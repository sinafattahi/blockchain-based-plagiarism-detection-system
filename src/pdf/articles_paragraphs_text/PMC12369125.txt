Overactive bladder management presents significant challenges, with treatment failures and medication non-adherence posing substantial barriers to patient outcomes. Early prediction of these challenges could enable timely interventions and treatment modifications.

To develop and validate an artificial intelligence-based prediction model for early identification of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder patients, with specific focus on different pathological subgroups including diabetic neuropathy.

In this single-center retrospective study (January 2018–April 2025), we analyzed data from 285 patients with overactive bladder. We developed and validated artificial intelligence models using comprehensive clinical parameters, including ultrasonography findings, uroflowmetry results, standardized voiding diaries, and disease-specific questionnaire outcomes. Primary outcome measures were treatment failure and medication non-adherence at three months.

The gradient boosting model achieved an accuracy of 87.3% (95% CI: 84.1–90.5%) for predicting treatment failure and 85.1% (95% CI: 81.8–88.4%) for predicting medication non-adherence. Key predictive factors included early changes in bladder wall thickness (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.14–6.81), diabetes duration > 7 years (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.58–4.72), and urgency improvement < 25% (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.76–4.92). Treatment failure rates varied significantly among pathological subgroups, with highest rates in diabetic neuropathy (42.8%) and lowest in idiopathic OAB (28.6%,p= 0.024). Among treatment failure patients, 68.4% proceeded to advanced therapies, with differential success patterns across subgroups.

Our artificial intelligence model effectively identifies patients at risk of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management. This approach enables early identification of high-risk patients, potentially improving treatment outcomes and healthcare resource utilization through timely intervention and treatment modification.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex defined by the International Continence Society as urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology [1,2]. It is important to emphasize that OAB is primarily a symptom-based clinical diagnosis that does not require urodynamic confirmation of detrusor overactivity. While detrusor overactivity (an urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase) may be present in many OAB patients, the correlation is imperfect, and the two conditions are not synonymous. Approximately 54% of patients with OAB symptoms demonstrate detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing, while conversely, not all patients with urodynamically confirmed detrusor overactivity report OAB symptoms [2].

This clinical distinction is crucial because OAB is diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms rather than urodynamic findings. Urodynamic studies may provide additional information about bladder function but are not necessary for diagnosis and are typically reserved for complex cases or when invasive treatments are being considered. The diagnosis and initial management of OAB should focus on the symptom complex that significantly impacts patients’ quality of life, rather than on the presence or absence of detrusor overactivity.

This symptom complex significantly impacts patient quality of life and presents substantial challenges in clinical management. Despite advancements in treatment protocols, the rates of failure and non-adherence to pharmacological therapies, particularly antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists, remain concerningly high, with estimates suggesting that up to 40% of patients experience suboptimal outcomes within the first three months after treatment initiation [3,4]. The ability to predict treatment failure and medication non-adherence early in the treatment course would enable clinicians to implement targeted interventions and proactively modify treatment strategies [5,6].

Overactive bladder management presents multiple challenges, including variable treatment responses, complex pathophysiology, and difficulties in patient adherence [7,8]. Traditional approaches to predicting treatment outcomes have largely relied on urodynamic studies which, while valuable, have limitations in terms of predictive capacity and interpretation variability [9,10]. Additionally, assessment of bladder compliance and function requires careful evaluation of multiple parameters, making outcome prediction particularly challenging [7,11].

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened new avenues for predictive modeling in healthcare [12,13]. These technologies offer the potential to analyze complex, multidimensional clinical data and identify subtle patterns that could predict treatment outcomes [14,15]. While artificial intelligence has been successfully applied in various areas of urology [16], its application in overactive bladder management, particularly in predicting treatment outcomes and medication adherence, remains largely unexplored [17,18].

This study aims to address this gap by developing and validating an artificial intelligence-based prediction model for early identification of patients at risk of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder [19]. By analyzing comprehensive clinical, ultrasonographic, voiding diary, disease-specific questionnaire (such as the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, OAB-q), and patient-reported parameters collected during the initial treatment phase, we aimed to create a practical tool that could assist clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes [5,20]. The identification of specific markers for overactive bladder will contribute to the development of personalized treatment approaches.

This single-center retrospective study analyzed data from patients who presented to the Department of Urology outpatient clinics at Mersin University School of Medicine between January 2018 and April 2025 and were diagnosed with overactive bladder. The study protocol was approved by the Mersin University Health Sciences Clinical Research Ethics Committee (approval number: 2023/470), and the research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [1]. The Institutional Review Board specifically waived the requirement for individual patient consent after review of the study protocol, acknowledging that the retrospective design precluded the possibility of obtaining prospective informed consent from participants, as detailed in the submitted methodology. The study follows the STROBE guidelines for observational studies and the TRIPOD statement for prediction model reporting [20]. Detailed patient characteristics are provided inSupplementary Table 1.

We included adult patients (≥ 18 years) with confirmed overactive bladder diagnosis who initiated treatment during the study period and had complete three-month follow-up data. The patient selection process is illustrated in Fig.1. From an initial pool of 412 patients screened, 127 were excluded based on the following criteria: incomplete medical records (n= 45), loss to follow-up before three months (n= 32), concurrent urological conditions (n= 21), bladder outlet obstruction (n= 15), low detrusor activity (n= 8), and recent urological surgery (n= 6). The remaining 285 patients were included in the final analysis.

It is important to note that our study population has a relatively high proportion of patients with diabetic neuropathy (48.4%, 138/285 patients). This proportion is higher than typically reported in general OAB populations, which reflects the referral pattern to our institution as a tertiary care center with specialized neuro-urology expertise. Our center serves as a regional referral hub for complex neurogenic bladder cases, particularly those associated with diabetic neuropathy. The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in our geographic region (reported at 18.2% in adults, compared to the national average of 13.7%) further contributes to this distribution. While this patient mix limits the generalizability of our findings to all OAB populations, it provides a unique opportunity to analyze treatment outcomes in this clinically challenging subgroup. We have performed separate analyses for different pathological subgroups to address this potential bias and enhance the applicability of our findings across different OAB etiologies.

The potential selection bias related to the retrospective design and exclusion of patients with incomplete data (10.9%, 45/412) was addressed through a comparison of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between included and excluded patients. No significant differences were found in age, gender distribution, or underlying pathologies, suggesting that the analyzed cohort was representative of the overall patient population presenting to our center during the study period.

Overactive bladder (OAB) was diagnosed based on the International Continence Society criteria as a symptom complex characterized by urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency (≥ 8 micturitions per 24 h) and nocturia (≥ 1 episode per night), with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. Diagnosis was established through a comprehensive assessment including detailed clinical history focusing on lower urinary tract symptoms, physical examination including neurological assessment, urinalysis and urine culture to exclude infection, 3-day voiding diary documenting micturition frequency, urgency episodes, and incontinence events, and validated symptom questionnaires including the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q).

While urodynamic studies were performed in a subset of patients (n= 178, 62.5%) to further characterize bladder function, detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing was not required for OAB diagnosis, consistent with international guidelines. Patients were categorized according to the likely underlying etiology of their OAB symptoms: idiopathic OAB (without identifiable cause), neurogenic OAB (associated with specific neurological conditions including diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury), or OAB secondary to bladder outlet obstruction.

Exclusion criteria included: (1) incomplete medical records, (2) loss to follow-up before three months, (3) active urinary tract infection or stone disease, (4) significant pelvic organ prolapse (≥ stage 2), (5) patients with predominant stress urinary incontinence without OAB symptoms, and (6) urological surgical intervention within six months prior to treatment initiation.

The data collection process encompassed demographic characteristics, underlying neurological conditions, baseline ultrasonographic bladder parameters, medication regimens, and early treatment response indicators.

Treatment failure was defined as meeting any of the following criteria within three months of treatment initiation: persistent symptoms with Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) symptom bother score > 40 (representing continued moderate-to-severe symptom burden despite treatment); deterioration in ultrasonographic bladder wall thickness (> 20% increase from baseline when measured under standardized conditions with bladder volume of 200-300 ml); lack of improvement in key voiding diary parameters (specifically, < 20% reduction in frequency or < 25% reduction in urgency episodes); deterioration in uroflowmetry parameters (> 20% decrease in maximum flow rate or > 30% increase in post-void residual volume); or need for treatment regimen modification due to inadequate symptom control.

Among patients who experienced treatment failure (n= 98, 34.4%), 67 patients (68.4%) proceeded to advanced therapies within six months of follow-up. The distribution of subsequent treatments was as follows: botulinum toxin A injection (n= 38, 56.7%), percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (n= 16, 23.9%), sacral neuromodulation (n= 8, 11.9%), and augmentation cystoplasty (n= 5, 7.5%). Treatment failure patterns varied by pathological subgroup: patients with diabetic neuropathy more frequently required botulinum toxin injection (64.3%) compared to idiopathic OAB patients (41.7%,p= 0.032), while idiopathic OAB patients showed higher rates of successful percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (35.3% vs. 18.2%,p= 0.027).

These criteria were selected based on validated outcome measures in the literature. The OAB-q symptom bother score was chosen as the primary symptom assessment tool as it is specifically validated for overactive bladder assessment, unlike the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) which is more appropriate for lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The OAB-q has demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.89) in previous validation studies. The threshold score of 40 corresponds to moderate symptom severity based on established cut-off values by Coyne et al. (2002). The ultrasonographic and voiding diary parameter thresholds were determined based on previous studies showing that a 20–25% improvement represents the minimal clinically important difference in these parameters.

Medication non-adherence was comprehensively assessed and categorized into two distinct types to allow for targeted intervention strategies: (1) Non-adherence due to perceived inefficacy: documented by either patient self-report of discontinuation due to lack of perceived benefit (assessed through a standardized questionnaire) or physician documentation of treatment abandonment despite recommendation to continue; (2) Non-adherence due to adverse effects: documented discontinuation of prescribed medication due to intolerable side effects (such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision for antimuscarinics, or hypertension for β3-agonists).

To ensure objective assessment of medication adherence beyond self-reporting (which can be subject to recall bias), we employed multiple complementary methods: (1) prescription refill data analysis (medication possession ratio < 80%, i.e., the patient obtaining or using less than 80% of the prescribed medications over the study period); (2) electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS) caps data where available (for a subset of 78 patients who consented to this monitoring); and (3) plasma drug level measurement at follow-up visits for patients with suspected non-adherence (n= 45).

The medication possession ratio threshold of 80% was selected based on pharmacokinetic studies showing that this level of adherence is necessary to maintain therapeutic drug levels for the medications used in this study. MEMS caps provided time-stamped records of bottle openings, allowing assessment of both adherence (percentage of prescribed doses taken) and persistence (duration of therapy). Plasma drug level measurements served as a biochemical validation of recent medication intake, with levels below 25% of the expected therapeutic range classified as non-adherence.

Patients were classified as non-adherent if they met any of the objective criteria above, with additional sub-classification based on the reason for non-adherence (inefficacy vs. adverse effects) when this information was available. This multi-method approach to adherence assessment has been shown to have greater sensitivity and specificity than any single method alone, as demonstrated in a meta-analysis by Lehmann et al. (2014).

The baseline assessment included a comprehensive set of variables. Demographic data collection encompassed age, gender, body mass index, and smoking status. Clinical parameters included duration of symptoms, underlying neurological condition, and presence of comorbidities. As classical urodynamic measurements (maximum cystometric capacity, detrusor pressure at maximum flow, and first desire volume) are highly costly and time-consuming, our study employed a more cost-effective approach. This approach utilized a combination of bladder wall thickness measured by ultrasonography, bladder filling volume at urgency sensation, non-invasive uroflowmetry, and post-void residual urine volume determined by post-voiding ultrasound. This method was found to be 70% less costly than traditional urodynamic assessment and more acceptable to patients in terms of compliance.

All patients were treated with pharmacological therapy consisting of either antimuscarinic agents or β3-adrenoseptör agonists. The distribution of medications was as follows: antimuscarinic agents (n= 186, 65.3%) and β3-adrenoseptör agonists (n= 99, 34.7%). Among the antimuscarinic agents, patients received solifenacin (5-10 mg daily,n= 82, 44.1%), tolterodine (2-4 mg daily,n= 67, 36.0%), oxybutynin (5-15 mg daily,n= 29, 15.6%), and trospium chloride (20-60 mg daily,n= 8, 4.3%). All patients in the β3-adrenoseptör agonist group received mirabegron (25-50 mg daily).

Initial medication selection was based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and potential contraindications. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, glaucoma, or cognitive concerns were preferentially prescribed mirabegron. Medication changes during the follow-up period occurred in 67 patients (23.5%): 42 switched from antimuscarinic agents to β3-adrenoseptör agonists due to side effects, 15 switched between different antimuscarinic agents due to insufficient efficacy, and 10 switched from β3-adrenoseptör agonists to antimuscarinic agents due to inadequate symptom control.

Treatment outcomes were analyzed both by initial medication class and by final medication at the three-month evaluation point. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate whether specific medication types were associated with differential treatment failure or non-adherence rates across the pathological subgroups (diabetic neuropathy, idiopathic OAB, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis).

Each patient was requested to maintain a standardized 3-day voiding diary, recording fluid intake, voiding frequency, voiding volume, urgency sensation intensity, urgency incontinence episodes, and the duration for which they could hold urine after the onset of urgency sensation. Voiding diary data were utilized as an important marker in the assessment of overactive bladder function and monitoring treatment response. Additionally, validated questionnaires were employed to evaluate patients’ bladder function and quality of life. All patients completed the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Qualiveen-SF, and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q). Laboratory assessment included serum creatinine and urine culture results.

Bladder wall thickness measurement was performed using a standardized protocol to ensure consistency and reliability. Measurements were taken using a high-frequency linear array transducer (7.5–10 MHz) with a GE Voluson E10 ultrasound system. To control for the known effect of bladder filling volume on wall thickness, all measurements were obtained when the bladder contained 200-300 ml of urine, confirmed by pre-measurement bladder volume calculation using the ellipsoid formula (height × width × depth × 0.52). Patients were instructed to drink 500 ml of water 30 min before the examination and to avoid voiding until the procedure was completed.

The measurement technique involved obtaining transabdominal sagittal and transverse views of the bladder, with wall thickness measured at three standardized locations: the anterior wall at midline, and the right and left lateral walls at the widest diameter of the bladder. At each location, three measurements were taken, and the mean value was calculated. The bladder wall was identified as the hypoechoic layer between the hyperechoic serosa and the hyperechoic mucosa. The final bladder wall thickness value used for analysis was the average of all nine measurements (three measurements at each of the three locations).

To ensure reproducibility and reliability of measurements, we implemented several quality control measures. All ultrasonographic examinations were performed by one of three certified radiologists with at least five years of experience in urologic ultrasonography, who underwent specific training for this study protocol. Inter-observer reliability was established through a pilot study of 30 patients, where each radiologist independently measured bladder wall thickness, achieving an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88–0.95). Intra-observer reliability was assessed by having each radiologist repeat measurements on 20 patients within a one-week interval, resulting in an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91–0.97). To address potential measurement drift over the study period (2018–2025), bi-annual calibration sessions were conducted, and systematic quality control was implemented with periodic re-evaluation of measurement technique.

For longitudinal comparisons, follow-up measurements were performed using the same protocol, with particular attention to replicating the bladder filling volume of the baseline measurement (± 50 ml). All measurements were documented with saved ultrasound images for quality control and retrospective review. In cases where there was significant discrepancy between serial measurements (> 30% change), a second radiologist performed an independent measurement to confirm the finding.

Early indicators were collected within the first two weeks after treatment initiation. These included changes in bladder wall thickness assessed by ultrasonography, changes in voiding diary parameters (frequency, urgency intensity, incontinence episodes), improvements in questionnaire scores, side effects of antimuscarinic and beta-3 agonist medications, adherence to voiding diary requirements, patient-reported changes in symptoms, and documentation of early complications or adverse events. These early indicators were systematically recorded and analyzed as potential predictors of treatment outcomes.

The dataset was randomly divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets with stratification by outcome to ensure balanced representation. Sample size was determined using power analysis with a target minimum AUC of 0.75, α = 0.05, and β = 0.20 [19]. Missing data (3.2% of total variables) were addressed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) with 5 iterations [13].

Data preprocessing included standardization of continuous variables and encoding of categorical variables using one-hot encoding. Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, and each model underwent comprehensive optimization. The random forests model, as an ensemble learning model, was optimized with 500 trees and maximum depth of 6. A random subset of features (√p, where p is the number of features) was used at each node, and minimum leaf node size was set to 10 to prevent overfitting.

XGBoost and LightGBM implementations were compared for gradient boosting. The XGBoost model was configured with a learning rate of 0.05, maximum depth of 5, minimum child weight of 3, and L1/L2 regularization (α = 0.01, λ = 0.05). The LightGBM implementation was optimized with a minimum of 20 samples per leaf, feature sampling ratio of 0.8, and early stopping patience value of 15 epochs.

The deep neural network architecture consisted of 3 hidden layers with 128, 64, and 32 neurons, respectively. Batch normalization and dropout (rates of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively) were applied after each hidden layer to prevent overfitting. The model utilized ReLU activation functions and was optimized with Adam optimizer (η = 0.001, β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999).

Feature selection was performed using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) and LASSO regression (α = 0.01) for dimensionality reduction with 5-fold cross-validation. Model hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation on the training set, utilizing 100 iterations and expected improvement as the acquisition function [10]. The final model architecture was selected based on performance on the validation set. To address potential overfitting, we employed early stopping (patience = 10 epochs), dropout layers in neural networks, and L1/L2 regularization (λ = 0.01).

Model stability was assessed through bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations) and sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters [17]. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and precision-recall curves. Confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrap resampling with 1000 iterations. Calibration was assessed using calibration plots and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Comprehensive model performance metrics across training, validation, and test sets are provided inSupplementary Table 2.

Multivariable logistic regression model: A standard logistic regression model was built using the same features as the machine learning models. Variables were selected based on clinical relevance and statistical significance in univariate analysis (p< 0.10). The final model included 15 predictor variables and was optimized using backward elimination based on the Akaike Information Criterion.

Clinical prediction rule: We developed a simplified clinical prediction rule using a weighted scoring system based on the coefficients from the logistic regression model. This approach represents the type of clinical tool that could be manually calculated by healthcare providers without computational assistance.

Decision tree model: A simplified decision tree with maximum depth of 3 was developed to create an easily interpretable model that could be applied as a clinical algorithm.

The comparative performance metrics of these traditional approaches versus our machine learning models are presented in Table1and visualized in Fig.2. The gradient boosting model demonstrated superior discrimination ability compared to the logistic regression model (AUC-ROC: 0.891 vs. 0.784,p< 0.001), the clinical prediction rule (AUC-ROC: 0.891 vs. 0.748,p< 0.001), and the decision tree model (AUC-ROC: 0.891 vs. 0.762,p< 0.001).

To assess the clinical impact of the improved predictive performance, we conducted a decision curve analysis, which demonstrated that the gradient boosting model provided higher net benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities (20–80%) compared to all traditional models. At a decision threshold of 30% probability of treatment failure, the net benefit was 0.241 for the gradient boosting model compared to 0.158 for logistic regression and 0.132 for the clinical prediction rule, translating to an additional 8.3 correctly identified high-risk patients per 100 without increasing false positives.

Furthermore, we evaluated the early detection capability of each approach by analyzing the proportion of treatment failures correctly identified within the first two weeks of treatment. The gradient boosting model identified 78.3% of eventual treatment failures at this early timepoint, compared to 61.7% for logistic regression and 57.2% for the clinical prediction rule (p< 0.001 for both comparisons). This improved early detection capability is particularly valuable in clinical practice as it enables timely intervention to modify treatment strategies.

The superior performance of our AI model stems from its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between predictor variables that traditional statistical methods cannot effectively model. For example, we identified a complex interaction between bladder wall thickness, HbA1c levels, and antimuscarinic side effects that significantly influenced treatment outcomes but was not adequately captured by logistic regression. The AI model also demonstrated greater robustness to collinearity among predictor variables and better handling of missing data patterns.

To validate the practical utility of the AI model in clinical settings, we conducted a simulated clinical implementation study. A panel of six urologists (three specialists and three residents) reviewed 50 randomly selected cases and made treatment failure predictions both with and without the assistance of the AI model. The AI-assisted predictions showed significantly improved accuracy (83.7% vs. 68.4%,p< 0.001) and reduced inter-observer variability (coefficient of variation: 0.12 vs. 0.28,p= 0.003). Additionally, urologists reported greater confidence in their predictions when using the AI model (mean confidence rating: 8.2/10 vs. 6.5/10,p< 0.001).

We also performed a subgroup analysis to identify specific patient populations where AI-based prediction provided the greatest incremental value over traditional methods. The performance advantage of the gradient boosting model was most pronounced in patients with diabetic neuropathy (ΔAUC: 0.124, 95% CI: 0.089–0.159) and those with multiple comorbidities (≥ 3 chronic conditions) (ΔAUC: 0.137, 95% CI: 0.098–0.176). These findings suggest that AI approaches offer particular value in complex patients with multiple interacting risk factors, precisely the population for whom accurate risk prediction is most clinically valuable.

Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range) according to distribution normality assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Sample size calculation was performed using G*Power 3.1.9.7 software, assuming an effect size of 0.3, alpha error of 0.05, and power of 0.90, which indicated a minimum required sample size of 234 patients. Accounting for an assumed dropout rate of 20% and potential confounding factors, we aimed to recruit at least 280 patients. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 4.1.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Machine learning models were implemented using Python 3.8 with scikit-learn 0.24.2 and TensorFlow 2.6.0 libraries. Between-group comparisons were conducted using Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Statistical significance was defined asp< 0.05.

The patient selection process is illustrated in Fig.1. From an initial pool of 412 patients screened, 127 were excluded based on the following criteria: incomplete medical records (n= 45), loss to follow-up before three months (n= 32), concurrent urological conditions (n= 21), bladder outlet obstruction (n= 15), low detrusor activity (n= 8), and recent urological surgery (n= 6). The remaining 285 patients were included in the final analysis.

Detailed baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table2, with expanded demographics and comorbidity distributions available inSupplementary Table 1.

The gradient boosting model demonstrated superior performance compared to other machine learning algorithms tested in this study (Table3).

Analysis of predictive factors revealed several significant variables for both treatment failure and medication non-adherence (Table4; Fig.3). ROC curves comparing model performance in training and validation sets are provided inSupplementary Fig. 1.

Treatment outcomes varied significantly among different underlying pathologies (Table5; Fig.4).

Early response indicators, particularly bladder wall thickness reduction and urgency episode reduction, showed significant variations among different pathological groups (p= 0.008 andp= 0.015, respectively) as illustrated in Fig.5.

The relative importance of different predictive factors varied considerably across pathological subgroups (Fig.6), with bladder wall thickness being particularly important in diabetic neuropathy and antimuscarinic side effects showing higher significance in idiopathic OAB. A detailed heatmap visualization of feature importance across all pathological subgroups is available inSupplementary Fig. 2.

Our gradient boosting model demonstrated superior performance compared to other machine learning algorithms and traditional statistical methods. The model achieved an accuracy of 87.3% (95% CI: 84.1–90.5%) for predicting treatment failure and 85.1% (95% CI: 81.8–88.4%) for predicting medication non-adherence. This robust performance significantly outperformed traditional approaches (AUC-ROC: 0.891 vs. 0.784 for logistic regression,p< 0.001).

The enhanced predictive capability translated to tangible clinical benefits in our decision curve analysis, with the AI model correctly identifying an additional 8.3 high-risk patients per 100 without increasing false positives at a decision threshold of 30%. This improvement was particularly marked in complex cases such as patients with diabetic neuropathy, where the model’s ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables proved especially valuable.

The model’s excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test,p= 0.42) indicates reliable probability estimates across the risk spectrum, allowing clinicians to make informed decisions based on individual patient risk assessments. This represents a significant advantage over traditional approaches to OAB management, which typically apply standardized protocols without accounting for individual risk profiles.

The superior performance of our AI-based approach can be attributed to several key factors. The model demonstrates an exceptional ability to model complex non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes that traditional statistical methods cannot capture effectively. It also provides automatic detection of interaction effects without pre-specification, robust handling of correlated predictors, and the capacity to learn from high-dimensional data with many potential predictors. These advantages were particularly evident in our diabetic neuropathy subgroup, where the AI model outperformed traditional approaches by the largest margin (ΔAUC: 0.124, 95% CI: 0.089–0.159). This finding aligns with observations by Martinez-Garcia et al. [6], who noted that machine learning approaches excel in conditions with complex, multifactorial pathophysiology.

Despite these advantages, we acknowledge the importance of model interpretability in clinical settings. We have addressed this by providing feature importance rankings and partial dependence plots that illustrate how specific predictors influence the model’s predictions. This approach balances the superior predictive performance of complex AI models with the clinical need for interpretability.

The robust performance of our model in predicting both treatment failure and medication non-adherence demonstrates that early indicators can effectively identify high-risk patients. This capability could potentially improve overall treatment outcomes by enabling clinicians to implement preventive strategies, modify treatment approaches, or increase monitoring for specific patients. The cost-effective assessment approach preferred in our study offers significant advantages compared to traditional urodynamic examination, both reducing economic burden and increasing patient adherence to treatment.

This study represents a comprehensive application of artificial intelligence to predict treatment outcomes in overactive bladder management [12,16]. The high predictive accuracy achieved by our models demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches in identifying patients at risk of suboptimal outcomes early in the treatment process [14]. Particularly in cases of overactive bladder caused by diabetic neuropathy, the identification of specific predictive factors provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of treatment failure and non-adherence, potentially guiding the development of targeted interventions [6,19].

Our findings highlight bladder wall thickness as a powerful predictive biomarker for treatment outcomes in OAB. While this ultrasonographic parameter emerged as the strongest predictor in our AI model (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.14–6.81), we acknowledge that bladder wall thickness measurement is not routinely performed in all clinical settings, particularly in the United States and other regions where different clinical protocols are followed. The physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying its predictive value are worth discussing. Increased bladder wall thickness represents hypertrophy of the detrusor muscle and altered extracellular matrix composition, which directly correlates with the severity and chronicity of bladder overactivity. Our longitudinal measurements demonstrated that early changes in bladder wall thickness strongly correlate with ultimate treatment success at 3 months, likely reflecting the reversal of detrusor hypertrophy when effective inhibition of inappropriate detrusor contractions is achieved. Notably, patients with diabetic neuropathy exhibited the highest baseline measurements (3.4 ± 0.7 mm) and showed slower reduction in response to treatment (12.4 ± 4.8%) compared to idiopathic OAB patients (18.6 ± 5.2%).

While the non-invasive nature and relatively low cost of bladder wall thickness measurement make it particularly valuable as a predictive biomarker in our clinical setting, we recognize that its implementation may vary across different healthcare systems and clinical protocols. Importantly, our model also identified universally applicable predictors such as urgency and frequency reduction patterns, which are routinely recorded in OAB treatment across all international practice settings. These parameters showed comparable predictive value (urgency improvement < 25%: OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.76–4.92) and could serve as primary predictors in settings where bladder wall thickness measurement is not standard practice. Our results are consistent with Dudley et al. [7], who reported correlations between bladder wall thickness and urodynamic findings in OAB, supporting the physiological basis of this biomarker.

The high proportion of diabetic patients in our cohort (54.0%, with 48.4% having confirmed diabetic neuropathy) warranted specialized analysis of this important subgroup. Our comprehensive analysis revealed several critical insights specific to diabetic OAB patients. We observed significantly different medication response patterns, with diabetic OAB patients showing higher treatment failure rates with antimuscarinic agents (48.9% vs. 29.7%,p= 0.012) compared to non-diabetic patients where no significant difference was observed (32.5% vs. 30.4%,p= 0.842). This suggests that β3-adrenoseptör agonists may be preferable first-line agents in diabetic OAB. We also identified a clear relationship between glycemic control and treatment outcomes, as patients with HbA1c > 8% had significantly higher treatment failure rates (58.4%) compared to those with HbA1c ≤ 7% (33.1%,p< 0.001). A multivariate analysis controlling for other factors confirmed HbA1c as an independent predictor of treatment outcomes (adjusted OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.38–4.08).

Furthermore, diabetes duration > 7 years was strongly associated with treatment failure (adjusted OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.58–4.72), and patients with clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy had significantly higher treatment failure rates than diabetic patients without neuropathy (47.8% vs. 25.0%,p= 0.018). We also noted that diabetic patients were prescribed more concomitant medications (mean: 5.8 ± 2.3) compared to non-diabetic patients (mean: 3.2 ± 1.9,p< 0.001), which was significantly associated with medication non-adherence in diabetic patients (OR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.94–6.97).

These findings underscore the need for tailored approaches in diabetic OAB patients. Our analysis suggests that optimizing glycemic control, preferential use of β3-adrenoseptör agonists, and addressing polypharmacy issues could significantly improve outcomes in this challenging subgroup. The integration of urological and endocrinological care, with particular attention to neuropathy assessment, appears crucial for these patients.

Our finding that β3-adrenoseptör agonists showed better outcomes in diabetic patients expands on previous research by Loftus et al. [22], who identified diabetes as a potential predictor of differential medication response but did not specifically analyze treatment outcomes by agent class in this subgroup.

The neurogenic component of diabetic OAB deserves special consideration, as highlighted by Groen et al. [1] in their guidelines on neuro-urology. The autonomic neuropathy that develops in long-standing diabetes affects both afferent sensory pathways and efferent motor control of the bladder, potentially explaining the differential response to medication classes that we observed.

Future research should focus on prospective evaluation of diabetes-specific OAB treatment algorithms based on these predictive factors. The development of interdisciplinary care pathways for diabetic OAB represents a promising approach to improving outcomes in this large patient subgroup. Collaboration between urologists and endocrinologists in monitoring treatment response and optimizing glycemic control could potentially reduce the high treatment failure rates we observed in this population.

Our finding that 68.4% of treatment failure patients proceeded to advanced therapies highlights the clinical importance of early failure prediction. The differential patterns of subsequent treatment success across pathological subgroups suggest that our AI model could potentially be extended to predict optimal third-line therapy selection. For instance, the higher success rate of botulinum toxin injection in diabetic neuropathy patients and better outcomes with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation in idiopathic OAB patients indicate subgroup-specific treatment pathways that could be incorporated into future predictive models.

Our study identified several early response indicators that significantly enhanced predictive accuracy when incorporated into the AI models. The change in bladder wall thickness and urgency improvement within the first two weeks of treatment initiation emerged as particularly powerful predictors of three-month outcomes. This finding has substantial clinical implications, as it suggests a critical window for intervention during which treatment strategies could be modified to improve outcomes.

Early indicators showed distinct patterns across pathological subgroups. In patients with diabetic neuropathy, bladder wall thickness reduction at two weeks was significantly less pronounced (12.4 ± 4.8%) compared to idiopathic OAB (18.6 ± 5.2%,p= 0.008). Similarly, urgency episode reduction was lower in diabetic patients (28.5 ± 8.7%) versus idiopathic OAB (35.2 ± 9.4%,p= 0.015). These differences highlight the potential value of pathology-specific thresholds for early response assessment.

The inclusion of early response indicators dramatically improved the model’s predictive performance. The AUC-ROC increased from 0.794 (baseline characteristics only) to 0.891 (including early indicators), representing a statistically significant improvement (p< 0.001). This finding suggests that treatment response is dynamic and that even brief periods of treatment can provide valuable information for outcome prediction. Our approach of combining baseline characteristics with early response indicators resulted in a more clinically useful model than those based solely on pre-treatment factors.

These observations align with emerging literature on the importance of early treatment response in chronic conditions. Chen et al. [5] reported that early changes in symptom scores could predict long-term outcomes in lower urinary tract symptoms, while Corona et al. [3] emphasized the importance of early identification of suboptimal responders to enable timely intervention. Our work extends these findings by quantifying the predictive value of specific early indicators and incorporating them into comprehensive AI models.

The robust performance of our model in predicting both treatment failure and medication non-adherence demonstrates that early indicators can effectively identify high-risk patients. This capability could potentially improve overall treatment outcomes by enabling clinicians to implement preventive strategies, modify treatment approaches, or increase monitoring for specific patients. The cost-effective assessment approach preferred in our study offers significant advantages compared to traditional urodynamic examination, both reducing economic burden and increasing patient adherence to treatment.

The high predictive value of bladder wall thickness measurement by ultrasonography in overactive bladder supports its more widespread use in future clinical applications, as reported in recent studies on urodynamic alternatives [21]. The identification of bladder wall thickness, diabetes duration, and HbA1c levels as significant predictive factors in the diabetic patient group indicates that glycemic control and effective management of diabetes are critical for the success of overactive bladder treatment in these patients [23]. Changes in urgency intensity and improvement in the duration for which patients can hold urine after the onset of urgency sensation have been identified as important indicators of treatment success in the initial period [24]. The relative importance of early urodynamic changes and medication side effects as predictive factors emphasizes the critical nature of the initial treatment period in determining long-term outcomes [3].

Our gradient boosting model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional statistical methods (AUC-ROC: 0.891 vs. 0.784 for logistic regression,p< 0.001). The enhanced predictive capability translated to tangible clinical benefits in our decision curve analysis, with the AI model correctly identifying an additional 8.3 high-risk patients per 100 without increasing false positives at a decision threshold of 30%. This improvement was particularly marked in complex cases such as patients with diabetic neuropathy, where the model’s ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables proved especially valuable.

The model’s excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test,p= 0.42) indicates reliable probability estimates across the risk spectrum, allowing clinicians to make informed decisions based on individual patient risk assessments. This represents a significant advantage over traditional approaches to OAB management, which typically apply standardized protocols without accounting for individual risk profiles. As Tarcan et al. [10] highlighted, personalized risk assessment is particularly critical in neurogenic bladder dysfunction, where standardized approaches may fail to address the heterogeneous nature of the condition.

Practical application of our model in clinical settings requires careful consideration of various factors and limitations. Integration into existing clinical workflows necessitates appropriate training of healthcare providers and support personnel, with an interface that is intuitive and seamlessly integrated with existing electronic health record systems. For diabetic patients, an approach integrated with existing diabetes management plans would be beneficial for optimizing overactive bladder treatment.

Implementation challenges, as detailed by Wilson et al. [20], include technical infrastructure requirements, clinician acceptance, and workflow integration. To address these challenges, we have developed a simplified risk calculation tool that can be readily incorporated into electronic health records, generating risk scores with specific recommendations based on identified risk factors.

Our deployment strategy includes a phased implementation approach that begins with initial validation in prospective clinical settings to confirm real-world performance. This is followed by development of clinical decision support tools providing actionable recommendations based on individual patient risk profiles. We then plan integration with existing OAB treatment guidelines to ensure coherence with established clinical practices. Finally, educational programs for healthcare providers on interpretation and application of risk predictions will be essential for successful clinical adoption and proper utilization of the model’s outputs.

While our model demonstrates strong performance, several technical limitations should be acknowledged. Data quality and standardization remain challenging, particularly when dealing with different clinical documentation practices across healthcare settings. Model generalizability may vary in patient populations not well-represented in our training data, and implementation in substantially different clinical environments may require local recalibration. The model identified 32 variables with significant predictive value, which may appear complex for clinical implementation, though our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a reduced model with only the top 10 predictors still maintained good discrimination (AUC-ROC: 0.858). Additional considerations include computational requirements for integration with existing health informatics infrastructure and the need for regular model updates to ensure continued accuracy as OAB treatment practices evolve.

An important limitation of our study is the inability to account for financial and economic factors that may significantly influence medication adherence patterns. Medication costs, insurance coverage limitations, and patients’ economic status could play substantial roles in non-adherence, particularly in healthcare systems with different reimbursement structures. Our retrospective design did not capture detailed socioeconomic data or medication accessibility information, which may have contributed to some of the observed non-adherence patterns. Future prospective studies should incorporate these economic variables to develop more comprehensive prediction models that account for the multifactorial nature of medication adherence in OAB treatment.

Building on our findings, future research should focus on several key areas. Multi-center prospective studies are needed to validate our findings in diverse clinical settings and patient populations, addressing the limitations of our single-center design. Investigation of the model’s adaptability to different healthcare systems and resource settings will be crucial, with studies examining the impact of model-guided interventions on patient outcomes, healthcare costs, and resource utilization. Evaluation of integrated approaches that combine diabetes management with bladder dysfunction treatment is particularly important for improving outcomes in diabetic patients, given our findings on the impact of glycemic control.

Given our observation that 68.4% of treatment failure patients proceeded to advanced therapies with differential success patterns across pathological subgroups, future AI models should be developed to predict optimal third-line therapy selection [25]. This could significantly improve resource utilization and patient outcomes by avoiding unsuccessful interventions and directing patients toward the most appropriate advanced treatments based on their individual risk profiles and pathological subgroup characteristics [26].

Identification of more specific biomarkers that predict early efficacy of antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists, particularly in diabetic patients, represents another promising research direction. Development of dynamic prediction models that continuously update risk assessments based on ongoing treatment response could further enhance clinical utility, potentially integrating additional data sources including genetic markers, metabolomic profiles, and continuous monitoring technologies. More comprehensive evaluation of psychological factors influencing treatment adherence could enhance prediction of adherence patterns and guide interventions to improve compliance. Finally, collaborative research initiatives pooling data across multiple centers would address sample size limitations and facilitate the development of more robust prediction models with standardized data collection protocols.

The application of deep learning techniques to time-series data from voiding diaries or wearable devices could reveal subtle patterns predictive of treatment outcomes, as highlighted by Anderson et al. [15]. Our current model primarily utilizes discrete assessment points, but continuous monitoring could capture more nuanced aspects of bladder dysfunction and treatment response.

Our artificial intelligence-based prediction model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying patients at risk of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management. The model’s ability to utilize early indicators such as bladder wall thickness, HbA1c levels, and diabetes duration provides a practical tool for clinical decision-making and patient monitoring, particularly valuable in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

The significant differences in treatment outcomes among pathological subgroups highlight the need for tailored approaches. Treatment failure was observed in 28.6% of patients with idiopathic OAB, which is lower than the 42.8% rate in patients with diabetic neuropathy, suggesting that idiopathic OAB is a more treatable subgroup. However, medication non-adherence rates in the idiopathic group (43.2%) were higher than in patients with diabetic neuropathy (38.4%), indicating that side effect management and adherence strategies are particularly important in patients with idiopathic OAB.

Implementation of this predictive approach could significantly improve treatment outcomes through early intervention and personalized treatment modification. Optimization of glycemic control in diabetic patients and closer monitoring with better side effect management in idiopathic OAB can contribute to treatment success.

Future research should focus on validating these findings in various clinical settings, assessing the impact of prediction model-guided interventions on patient outcomes, and identifying better biomarkers for treatment response prediction, particularly in idiopathic OAB.
