The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted critical limitations in conventional pulse oximetry, especially in diverse populations. This study evaluates the performance of noninvasive devices for assessing tissue oxygenation in a cohort of 20 healthy individuals, with a focus on device sensitivity, physiological and demographic variables. Tissue oxygenation was measured using devices: spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TCOM), wearable photoplethysmography (WD), and pulse oximetry (PO) during baseline, ischemia, and reperfusion phases. Comparative analyses were performed across devices, sex and Fitzpatrick skin types. Among the four devices, SFDI uniquely detected significant differences in tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), highlighting its sensitivity to tissue heterogeneity. PO and WD data showed moderate correlation (r= 0.44–0.59); SFDI and TCOM demonstrated fair correlation (r= 0.23–0.36). Although sex-based differences were minimal, the SFDI revealed significantly different recovery metrics. Notably, SFDI provided deeper insights into hemoglobin dynamics (HbO2, dHb, HbP1, HbP2), which was not captured by point-measurement devices. Results demonstrated that SFDI offers superior spatial/spectral resolution for mapping tissue oxygenation, particularly in detecting skin-type variations. However, device-specific limitations such as motion artifacts and melanin interference necessitate further optimization. This work supports the development of more inclusive and accurate non-invasive monitoring tools for clinical use.

Measuring tissue oxygenation is crucial for understanding the underlying physiological and pathological conditions1,2in human tissues. Conventional devices like pulse oximeters3and oxygen electrodes4provide localized measurements, limited by their ability to map oxygen distribution across broader tissue regions. Clinicians, however, rarely employ oxygen mapping, either because the equipment is unavailable or the implementation costs are high5. Consequently, current conventional methods remain inadequate for measuring global tissue oxygenation or monitoring the oxygen levels in physiological or pathological scenarios6.

Oxygen is a fundamental component for energy metabolism, reflecting the health status of the body organs7both in normal and pathological conditions. Skin oxygenation can also indicate the health status of internal organs8. Hypoxemia can suggest lungs are not transferring oxygen into the blood, indicating asthma, COPD, pneumonia, or pulmonary fibrosis9. Similarly, low oxygen in the blood can manifest heart pathology or neurological symptoms such as dizziness or unconsciousness. Moreover, muscles can experience fatigue or decrease function10with low oxygen levels. Monitoring of oxygen in wound healing is important7which particularly requires oxygen supplementation besides restoration of blood flow, debridement, compression therapy, and administration of growth factors11or vascularization therapy12. Therefore, noninvasive identification of tissue oxygenation level in larger areas is important in preclinical and clinical settings.

Conventional methods have been employed to measure tissue oxygenation13many of which are hindered by their drawbacks. A traditional invasive method, for example Clark electrode, which has been widely used for measuring tissue oxygen dissolved in blood14has limitations including instability, slow response, and susceptibility to membrane damage and contamination15. Another indirect method is invasive measure of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration16from blood work17. However, the blood work method has limitations, including instrumental errors, specimen handling issues, and patient-related factors18. Near-infrared (NIR)-based methods, such as plethysmography (PPG) devices, are noninvasive, however, they use only two wavelengths in a pulse oximeter (660 and 940 nm) or three wavelengths in a Wearable Device (660 nm, 525 nm, and 850 nm) to measure tissue oxygenation. Consequently, PPGs lack wide spectral bands for heterogeneous tissue components. Therefore, these devices are suboptimal to address both superficial and deeper blood vessels19in the skin because they depend only on the pulsating deeper blood vessels20,21. TCOM measures the oxygen partial pressure diffusing through the skin (oxygen tension) and indirectly measures tissue oxygenation. In contrast, there are multispectral devices which use a wide range of wavelengths encompassing both the visible to NIR spectrum that essentially covers both superficial and deeper tissue layers22Table1.

Comparison between different optical techniques used in tissue oxygenation measurement.

Recent research has prioritized the development of non-invasive optical methods to map oxygen levels accurately, safely, and reliably in tissues with pathological conditions23–25. These optical measurement techniques offer valuable insights into tissue oxygenation26perfusion27–30and metabolism31aiding in the assessment of tissue viability and function. In critical care settings, tissue oxygenation monitoring is vital for assessing organ function32and guiding resuscitation efforts24. Techniques such as transcutaneous oxygen measurement (tcpO2), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)33positron emission tomography (PET)34and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)35have been used to measure tissue oxygen in both preclinical and clinical settings. In addition, alternative noninvasive imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT)36which has been used to measure the retinal oxygenation36and hyperspectral imaging37show promise in monitoring tissue oxygen. However, these devices face implementation challenges due to higher capital costs, large data size, or the need for specialized data processing hardware or software23,38.

An ideal device for measuring tissue oxygenation should overcome all limitations, effortlessly gauging arteriovenous oxygenation while detecting hypoxic and hyperemic events with precision. The light used by the device should penetrate both superficial and deeper tissues to measure blood hemoglobin oxygenation, delivering unmatched sensitivity for accurate measurements.

Recent developments in NIR-based technologies, such as SFDI use light with wider wavelength range from visible to NIR, extending to infrared (IR), to measure multiple chromophores, including oxygen saturation (StO2), oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (dHb), superficial hemoglobin (HbP1), and subsurface hemoglobin (HbP2). In addition, SFDI uses the Monte-Carlo algorithm during simulation of light-tissue interactions39. This study compared tissue oxygenation measurements among devices (SFDI, TCOM, PO, and WD) to evaluate their capabilities in detecting tissue oxygenation and Hb-perfusion. Additionally, this study sought to investigate the possible differences in oxygen measurement related to sex and skin type in a cohort of healthy subjects.

Twenty healthy volunteers, thirteen males (aged 33 ± 4 years) and seven females (aged 36 ± 10 years) with a height of 172 ± 5 cm, body weight of 75 ± 22 kg, and body mass index (BMI) of 25 ± 3, were included in this study (TableS1). A brief medical history and a skin type survey response were obtained from the subjects. The enrollment process and a schematic of the experimental timelines are shown in Fig.1A. The devices used along with the representative outcomes during the study and a brief technical specification of SFDI device are shown in Fig.1B. One patient was excluded from the analysis because of inaccurate data acquisition due to motion artifacts, resulting in 19 subjects for the data analysis.

Study design and schematic presentation of the study. (A) Study design and activity. The order of the devices used for the measurement was TCOM, WD, PO, and SFDI throughout the study subjects. The pressure of the arm cuff was maintained in the range of 180–200 mmHg. (B) The devices are shown. Light‒tissue interactions and the oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb curves used, resulting in 2D-chromophore maps from the SFDI, are shown. SFDI = spatial frequency domain imaging, TCOM = transcutaneous tissue oxygenation measurement, WD = wearable device, PO = pulse oximetry.

Comparing tissue oxygenation of healthy human volunteers collected by four different modalities (TCOM, Plethysmography, SFDI), showed no difference between males and females (Fig.2A), except during the recovery phase in WD and PO (p= 0.05 and 0.02 respectively) between males and females, due to earlier detection of recovery events compared to the SFDI and TCOM. However, there was no significant sex related bias in any of the devices used to measure oxygen saturation (Table S2A). Data analysis of tissue oxygenation by the SFDI technique revealed sex-based differences, where the oxyhemoglobin and Hb perfusion values were significantly different in reactive hyperemia and recovery events (Fig.2B-ii, iv, v) and Table S2B. Since the responsiveness of blood vessels to stimuli exhibits sex-specific differences, women generally display enhanced reactivity to certain enzymes like serotonin and estrogen, while men may show more reactivity to norepinephrine. However, boxplots of SFDI data indicated no significant differences in StO2(Fig.2B-i) and dHb (Fig.2B-iii) between males and females at all time points.

(iii) SpO2data from a wearable device and (iv) SpO2from pulse oximetry. Data were compared between devices at different stages of ischemia. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical analysis. The data is presented as a whisker box plot. (B) Tissue perfusion with the SFDI alone. Boxplot of oxygen saturation measured in males and females at baseline (B), during occlusion (O), during reactive hyperemia (rH), and recovery (R) events with SFDI.

P-values are provided at the top of each event.n= 19, *p≤ 0.05 as a confidence level of significance.

Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) from SFDI data revealed that it was significantly different at baseline (p= 0.05) which can be due to the melanin pigmentation that could interfere with device imaging, a known confounder in optical measurements, during occlusion (p= 0.02), and during reactive hyperemia (p= 0.04) and recovery (p= 0.01) between skin types II + III and skin type IV, as shown in Fig.3A-i and Table S3A. The TCOM and WD data revealed no significant differences in the measured values, as shown in Fig.3A-ii-iii and Table S3B. Although the baseline SpO2data from PO were significant (p= 0.05), the reactive hyperemia and recovery stages were not significantly different (p= 0.28 and 0.66, respectively) (Fig.3A-iv). This may be because of hyperemia-related motion artifact, which can skew readings during later stages. In an occlusion event, the data from WD & PO could not be measured because there was a poor flow and no pulsation; the reactive hyperemia blood is moving faster after a sudden reperfusion, whereas the post-occlusion recovery took a longer time (2–3 min). The combination of motion artifact and low perfusion can further exacerbate the issue, leading to a greater incidence of erroneous readings.

Boxplots of data measured in skin types II + III and skin type IV at baseline and during and after occlusion events by the SFDI are shown in Fig.3B. The data revealed a significant difference in the StO2(p= 0.05, 0.02, 0.03, & 0.01) and deoxyhemoglobin (p= 0.04, 0.04, 0.04, 0.01) values between the two skin types at all events (Fig.3B-i, iii). There was no difference in other biomarkers, such as HbO2, HbP1, or HbP2, indicating that these markers are independent of skin color.

Figure4A presents the Spearman correlation matrices illustrating the relationships between the various devices across different phases: baseline, occlusion, reactive hyperemia, and recovery. These matrices (Fig.4A-i, ii, iii, iv) quantify the degree of association between device measurements during each phase.

Correlation between the devices. (A) Correlation matrix of the coefficient (ρ) between devices. (i) baseline, (ii) during occlusion, (iii) at reactive hyperemia, and (iv) recovery. The correlation between different devices is color-coded; the color gradation and the size of the discs represent the strength of the correlation. Negative R-values mean the reverse correlation. (B) Correlations between tissue biomarkers measured by the SFDI alone. Correlation matrices: (i) baseline, (ii) during occlusion, (iii) at reactive hyperemia, and (iv) after recovery. Correlations between StO2, HbO2, dHb, superficial perfusion (HbP1), and deeper perfusion (HbP2) are shown. *p≤ 0.05 was considered a confidence level of significance.

At baseline and during reactive hyperemia, a fair correlation was observed between the PO and WD, with Spearman coefficients of (r= 0.44 and 0.28), respectively. During the recovery phase, this relationship strengthened to a moderate correlation (r= 0.59). This variation may reflect differences in device sensitivity and measurement principles.

SFDI and TCOM also showed fair correlations across all phases (r= 0.36 at baseline, 0.23 during reactive hyperemia, and 0.35 during recovery), suggesting some consistency in their response to vascular changes.

In contrast, the correlation between SFDI and WD was poor throughout (r= − 0.08, − 0.31, and − 0.44), indicating limited agreement between these modalities. This may be due to differences in the physiological parameters each device targets and the influence of tissue optical properties on near-infrared (NIR) measurements.

Interestingly, SFDI and PO exhibited inverse relationships across all phases (r= − 0.34, − 0.14, and − 0.25), further highlighting the complexity of interpreting NIR-based data in dynamic vascular conditions. The correlation between TCOM and WD was also poor at baseline and recovery (r= − 0.13 and 0.15), with a fair correlation during reactive hyperemia (r= 0.20). Similarly, TCOM and PO showed poor correlation at baseline (r= − 0.15), but improved to fair levels during reactive hyperemia and recovery (r= 0.31 and 0.22). It is worth noting that both PO and WD utilize photoplethysmography (PPG) but differ in their optical configurations, PO uses transmissive PPG, while WD relies on reflectance PPG. These differences likely contribute to the variability in their correlation.

Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate relationships among tissue biomarkers including: StO2, HbO2, dHb, HbT1, and HbT2, measured using the SFDI device before, during, and after occlusion events (Fig.4B). A moderate positive correlation was observed between StO2and HbO2(r= 0.55, 0.55, 0.42, and 0.59 across events), consistent with their physiological association. As anticipated, StO2and dHb exhibited moderate to strong negative correlations at baseline (r= − 0.71, − 0.64, − 0.78, and − 0.74), reflecting the inverse relationship between oxygen saturation and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Correlations between StO2and HbT2 were fair (r= 0.36, 0.20, 0.24, and 0.32) during different events, suggesting a more complex or indirect relationship. Notably, HbO2and HbT2 showed strong positive correlations (r= 0.93, 0.87, 0.89, and 0.89), during different events, indicating a potential shared physiological measurement basis. Representative tissue oxygenation maps from the palm are presented for Fitzpatrick skin types II–III and IV (Fig.5A,B), as well as for male and female subjects (FigureS1), to illustrate spatial variations across demographic groups.

Skin type-based tissue oxygenation and Hb-perfusion maps obtained using SFDI. Representative tissue biomarker maps are compared between skin types II + III and IV. The data were compared at different time points. (A) Skin types II + III are shown, and (B) Skin type IV is shown for the corresponding biomarkers.

This study evaluated tissue oxygenation using multiple noninvasive optical devices under blood flow restrictions conditions in healthy volunteers. The experimental design involved arm pressure cuff-induced ischemia, enabling evaluation of tissue oxygen dynamics (pre-, during, and post-ischemia). Most devices showed no significant sex-based differences in oxygen saturation. However, SFDI device revealed nuanced differences in oxyhemoglobin and Hb-perfusion during reactive hyperemia and recovery phases, consistent with known sex-specific vascular responses, where females may exhibit heightened reactivity to certain vasodilators40.

Correlation analyses revealed varying degrees of agreement between devices. PO and WD showed moderate to strong correlations, especially during recovery (r= 0.59), approaching the threshold for high positive correlation (r≥ 0.70)41. This suggests potential interchangeability42and highlights the practicality of wearable reflectance oximetry could serve as alternative to transmissive oximetry42due to its convenience and continuous monitoring capability.

Interestingly, WD and PO detected significant sex-based differences during recovery (p= 0.05 and 0.02 respectively) between males and females, possibly due to earlier detection of recovery events compared to the SFDI and TCOM43. These findings align with previous reports of sex-specific microvascular responses44to altered blood flow stimuli.

In contrast, SFDI and WD exhibited poor correlation, likely due to differences in measurement principles and tissue penetration depths. Inverse correlations between SFDI and PO further highlight the complexity of interpreting NIR signals under dynamic vascular conditions. Notably, SFDI’s broad wavelength range (450–1000 nm) enables multi-depth assessment45with shorter wavelengths penetrating superficial tissues and longer wavelengths reach deeper layers46.

Within the SFDI biomarkers, strong correlations were observed between StO2and HbO2, and inverse correlations with dHb, validating the physiological relevance of these metrics. The strong association between HbO2and HbP2 indicates SFDI’s capability to assess both superficial and deep tissue perfusion. Additionally, significant sex-based differences in superficial perfusion were observed during occlusion (p= 0.04), hyperemia (p= 0.03), and recovery (p= 0.01), despite no sex differences in dHb levels.

Strong correlations between dHb and superficial Hb-perfusion were observed across physiological states (r= 0.63–0.70), linking hemodynamics47to metabolic regulation48during oxygen demand fluctuations.

Beyond single-point Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) devices, there are multiple hyperspectral and multispectral imaging systems that offer advantages such as wide field of view and detailed spatial-spectral information49. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems (e.g., HyperView™) provide 2D oxygenation maps50but suffer low intra- and inter-observer reliability51. SnapshotNIR of Kent Imaging integrates NIRS with imaging to evaluate tissue oxygenation patterns; however, it is not a standalone tool for comprehensive tissue oxygenation mapping52(Table1).

SFDI has emerged as a high-resolution platform capable of probing oxygenation across different tissue depths53. Its multiwavelength approach exploits hemoglobin’s oxygen-binding properties to concurrently assess both superficial (HbT1) and deep-tissue (HbT2) perfusion, providing clinicians with subsurface visualization capabilities and quantitative data assessment.

Despite the advantages, device-specific limitations merit discussion. All the tested devices may be affected by skin temperature variations and environmental interferences, including temperature, sweat, and dust54,55that warrant a proper experimental setup before measurement. Even though we tested one of these devices (Clarifi®, Modulim Inc., CA) that utilize SFDI technology, this device has its limitations. For instance, baseline oxygen saturation measurements varied significantly across skin types, suggesting melanin interference, a known confounder in optical imaging25,56. In contrast, TCOM and WD showed no significant differences across skin types, suggesting their relative robustness to pigmentation effects. Additionally, SFDI faces challenges similar to other hyperspectral systems, including high capital costs, large data sizes, and complex processing requirements57. WD and PO rely on pulsatile flow, rendering them susceptible to motion artifacts54,58. PO also exhibits latency in detecting SpO226,59. Similarly, TCOM’s delayed response to acute dynamic oxygen tension60,61remains unresolved. Signal acquisition and data processing are further complicated by the use of multiple frequencies and wavelengths, and narrow frequency choices due to single-wavelength light emitting diodes (LEDs). Additionally, the data interpretation should be judged carefully for other patients cohorts because multiple cofounding factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking can affect the cuff pressure readings, subsequently increasing the probability of missing the presystolic point62,63. Moreover, uneven tissue surfaces and its structural heterogeneity can affect the accuracy of optical property estimation64. Techniques like curvature correction and phase-measuring profilometry65and employment of advanced light sources, including tunable lasers for precise wavelength selection may mitigate these issues66.

Future improvements should focus on integrating deep learning algorithms with SFDI for rapid and accurate optical property estimations of biological tissues64,67. Simulation models that generate oxygen maps with varying melanin and hemoglobin levels could enhance understanding of oxygen distribution across tissue layers55,68. Enhanced software interfaces with spectral unmixing and predictive modeling may improve accuracy64. For TCOM, replacing electrodes with optical sensors or using more sensitive materials could address its delayed response to dynamic oxygen changes60.

Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate devices based on patient demographics and clinical context. SFDI offers detailed spatial and depth-resolved oxygenation mapping but requires further refinement for broader clinical adoption.

This study underscores the need for bias-free, spatially resolved tissue oxygenation mapping technologies. While devices like SFDI offer detailed insights into tissue perfusion and oxygenation, their performance can be affected by skin pigmentation and motion artifacts. Future advancements should focus on integrating advanced light sources and machine learning algorithms to enhance measurement accuracy and reduce bias. By elucidating device-specific strengths and constraints, this work paves the way for optimized monitoring tools that can accurately map tissue oxygenation and Hb-perfusion in clinical settings. By addressing these limitations, next-generation optical devices can provide reliable, real-time monitoring across diverse patient populations, ultimately improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

The study design includes screening and consenting subjects and order of measurements shown in Fig.1A. Episodes of occlusion events were induced using an arm cuff pressure. Twenty healthy volunteers, 13 males and 7 females, participated in the study. All study activities have adhered to IRB#13,895 of Indiana University and the STROBE reporting guidelines. Demographics were collected, and an IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF) was obtained from all the participants.

This study is a nonrandomized observational study that was completed in a cohort of healthy volunteers. After consenting, the subjects sat comfortably for standardized measurements from the proposed devices. In this study, the order of device usage was TCOM, WD, PO, and SFDI based on the device setup time. To minimize device order effects or temporal bias, especially during dynamic physiological changes like hyperemia, a 5-minute acclimation period was maintained for each measurement in all subjects, justifying that it does not affect outcomes. The oxygenation parameters tcpO2from TCOM, SpO2from WD & PO, and StO2from SFDI were measured in the order followed by events: baseline, occlusion, reactive hyperemia, and recovery. The measurement site was preferably chosen on the index finger to ensure a tissue match. The reason for choosing this site was that PO can only be used in this location, and it is consistent with the anatomical location for all devices. Measurement started with TCOM and after the baseline measurement, blood flow was impeded using an arm pressure cuff applied for 60 s at a pressure range of 180–200 mmHg, followed by reperfusion. This range was selected based on typical occlusion pressures, which are 50–100 mmHg above the systolic values69considering variable baseline blood pressure for all subjects. The oxygenation was measured at 3 repeated measurement readings during all events and was averaged, except the hyperemic phase which was recorded as a single-time event only because of the short span (few seconds after cuff release). The data were recorded before, during, and after occlusion, representing for the hyperemic event70,71. After five minutes, measurements were performed using WD and PO at the same site and with the same sequence of events. Finally, SFDI was employed to perform measurements under the same conditions (Fig.1B).

Healthy volunteers were enrolled based on whether they met the criteria approved in the IRB protocol and could understand and complete the ICF. Both males and females aged between 18 and 65 years from all ethnic groups were included in the study. Volunteers were not enrolled if they had health conditions such as active cardiovascular diseases, pregnant females, tobacco smokers, or prisoners.

The data collection was performed in the following order: (1) consenting, (2) questionnaires, (3) Fitzpatrick’s skin type assessment performed by an experienced plastic surgeon according to Fitzpatric’s skin type chart72and (4) noninvasive data collection and imaging. After baseline, cuff pressure was applied with a minimal risk of tolerable pain in the arm with inflation of the pressure cuffs up to 200 mmHg has been reported in the literature73. Then the cuff was deflated, and data was collected during the hyperemic and recovery period. The measurement was performed by people with different areas of expertise, including a plastic surgeon and an engineer. The measured data were entered into the REDCap data store network, and from there, the data was directly provided to the statistician who was blinded to the data collection.

The tcpO2measurement is a noninvasive technique for measuring local oxygen tension from capillary blood perfusion, which helps identify hypoxic tissue that responds to oxygen. A PeriFlux 5000 device (Perimed Inc., Sweden) was used, and to do this, an electrode with contact liquid on the index finger ensuring an airtight sealing. This device measures oxygen diffusion through the skin, providing instant information on oxygen delivery to tissues. The data collection rate of this device was 64 Hz.

Both the blood oxygen app of the WD and PO measure SpO2by illuminating the tissues with single-wavelength near-infrared (NIR, 850 nm) light along with red (660 nm) and green (525 nm) light. The emitted light signal was detected by PO and WD as done by photoplethysmography (PPG) devices. The WD tracks pulsations to determine the red-to-infrared modulation ratio and translates this value into the SpO2percentage. The crystal in the device serves as a light emitter and detector, enabling sensing of arterial hemoglobin oxygenation at a sampling rate of 1 Hz. PO emits red light at a wavelength of 660 nm and NIR light at a wavelength of 940 nm, which are employed to determine the ratio of hemoglobin bound to oxygen. PO uses fluctuations in light absorption during the heartbeat to calculate SpO23. The SpO2is arterial blood oxygenation, whereas StO2is arteriovenous oxygenation. Another difference between the two parameters is that SpO2requires pulsating blood flow from larger vessels, whereas StO2can be measured in perfused non-pulsating capillaries.

This device used a calibration surface pad to compensate for the ambient light conditions. The imaging was set, and the device used a laser light wavelength ranging from 450 to 1000 nm with a power of 8 W/cm2five discrete wavelengths selected from the continuous range22. SFDI used in this study has spectral width of 20–30 nm. Similarly, from the wavelength range, multiple LEDs each corresponding to a wavelength were used as opposed to using light filters. This device has acquisition time of less than 2 seconds74per scan and total scan time of less than 12 seconds75. The sampling rate of this device was 60 Hz. The Monte Carlo light‒tissue interaction, used a hybrid simulation and light diffusion theory76was software inbuilt to account for the accuracy of simulation and the speed of diffusion. The region of interest (ROI) tool provided an average pixel with a signal intensity value proportional to the biomarker concentration, while the extraneous pixels due to artifacts were ignored during ROI selection. The images were displayed averaging into 2D-biomarker maps of 280-micron lateral pixel resolution over a field of view of 300 × 225 mm without normalization22.

where HbO2is the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and dHb is the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the arteriovenous blood. Color-coded 2D-biomarker maps (Fig.5, Fig.S1) show the color gradation; for example, less oxygenation is represented by an increased blue color, whereas high oxygenation is represented by an increased red color. The region of interest (ROI) was drawn in the color maps, and the inbuilt software displays biomarker values.

Nineteen of the twenty subjects were analyzed, excluding one subject that experienced a data collection error. Measurements of oxygen saturation at baseline, during occlusion, during reactive hyperemia, and recovery events were obtained and reported as median values with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and presented visually through boxplots by sex and skin type. Also, biomarkers obtained from the SFDI device are presented, comparing sex and skin type. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare groups, with p-values indicating significance levels. Spearman’s rank correlation method was chosen over Pearson’s due to the relatively small sample size (n< 20), which limits the robustness of the assumptions required for parametric methods. Spearman’s method specifically does not assume normality and is less sensitive to potential outliers or deviations from linearity, making it more suitable for analyses with small samples. Although a formal assessment of nonlinearity was not conducted, visual inspection of the data distributions and scatterplots suggested potential deviations in some variable relationships, further supporting the use of a nonparametric correlation approach. These associations were visualized in correlation plots with color coding, and significant correlations are highlighted with (*). The correlation strength was categorized as poor (|ρ| ≤ 0.2), fair (0.2 < |ρ| ≤ 0.5), moderate (0.5 < |ρ| ≤ 0.7), or extraordinarily strong (0.7 < |ρ| < 1). A *p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were conducted using R-Studio software version 4.3.0.
