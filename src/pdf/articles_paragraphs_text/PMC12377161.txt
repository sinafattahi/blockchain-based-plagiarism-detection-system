In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome ofCallithamnion corymbosum(Smith) Lyngbye 1819 was reported for the first time, which could be beneficial for systematic studies onCallithamnion. The complete mitochondrial genome was 25,462 bp in length and contained 48 genes including 23 protein-coding, two rRNA, and 23 tRNA genes. The phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial genome sequences revealed that all 16 Ceramiales species grouped into three distinct clades, andC. corymbosumof this study forms a independent clade, showing a unique status within the order Ceramiales.

Ceramiales is the most species-rich order of Rhodophyta, which consists of five families and about 400 genera (Díaz-Tapia et al.2019). In Ceramiales, there is an extremely striking range of numbers of nuclei in each vegetative cell, from 1 to 4000 (McIvor et al.2002). Each family is homogeneous with respect to the uninucleate/multinucleate characteristic, except for the Callithamnieae (Maggs and L’Hardy-Halos1993). This special situation has led to a fact that there has been no consistent recognition in the classification study of Callithamnieae (Whittick1992).Callithamnionconsists of 65 species and mainly distributes in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean regions, which is the largest genus of Callithamnieae (McIvor et al.2002; Guiry and Guiry2019).

Callithamnion corymbosum(Smith) Lyngbye 1819 is the type species ofCallithamnion,which is multinucleate (Maggs and L’Hardy-Halos et al.1993; McIvor et al.2002). In China,C. corymbosumis the only species ofCallithamnion(Ding et al.2015). Phylogenetic analysis could contribute to the construction of a well-supported phylogeny for the species, providing a basis for reassessing its classification. Compared with phylogenetic trees based on the mitochondrial genome, those based on one or two molecular markers were poorly supported and failed to accurately resolve the species classification and evolution. Currently, no mitochondrial genome data have been published for any of the species inCallithamnion. The absence of complete mitochondrial genome information hinders our comprehensive understanding of this species and the phylogenetic relationships within the genusCallithamnionand the order of Ceramiales. So, this study is the first to sequence the mitochondrial genome ofC. corymbosumand provide an essential DNA molecular resource for further research.

C. corymbosumsamples (Figure 1) were collected on 26 September 2023 from Lidao Bay (37° 15′ 21.76″ N, 122° 35′ 36.34″ E), Weihai City, Shandong Province in China and deposited in the marine germplasm resources laboratory at Rongcheng Campus, Harbin University of Science and Technology (Shanshan Wang,sswang@hrbust.edu.cn) under voucher numberCC202401.

The upper part is corymbiform with dense branches exhibiting dichotomous branching. The basal part comprises numerous root-like filaments attached to the substrate.

The samples were identified based on comparative morphological characteristics. The morphological characters used for recognizing the sample are: the thallus is bright red, filamentous, soft, growing in clusters, 1–5 cm tall; the upper part of the thallus is corymbiform, with dense branches, and the cells at the top are obtusely rounded; the thallus is composed of single-file cells; there are many root-like filaments attached to the substrate at the base, with cell sizes of (40 ± 5) μm × (140 ± 10) μm; the erect branches are distinct, alternately branched, and each branch is dichotomously branched, with erect branch cell sizes of (58 ± 10) μm × (160 ± 20) μm, and branch cell sizes of (23 ± 3) μm × (70 ± 5) μm; the cells in the juvenile stage are mononuclear, while those in the mature stage are multinuclear (Liu1979; Liu et al.2022).

The total genomic DNA ofC. corymbosumwas extracted using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method and applied to 500 bp paired-end library construction using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina sequencing. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (BIOZERON Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China).

Approximately 6274.9 Mb of raw data were generated with 150 bp paired-end read lengths. Prior to assembly, raw reads were filtered by Trimmomatic 0.39 (Bolger et al.2014). The mitochondrial genome was reconstructed using a combination of de novo and reference-guided assemblies. First, the filtered reads were assembled into contigs using GetOrganelle v1.7.5 (Jin et al.2020), the mitochondrial contigs ofC. corymbosumwere extracted by aligning against the NCBI mitochondrial genome database. Second, the mitochondrial contigs were aligned to the mitochondrial genome using BLAST v 2.8.1+ (Camacho et al.2009), according to the reference mitochondrial genome ofSchimmelmannia schousboei(KJ398162.1). Finally, MUMmer 3.23 (Kurtz et al.2004) was used to check whether these contigs were circular. Based on the above assembly steps, we obtained a circle of theC. corymbosummitochondrial genome. The mitochondrion genes were annotated using the online GeSeq tool (Tillich et al.2017). TheC. corymbosummitochondrial genome map was visualized using OGDRAW (Greiner et al.2019).

A total of 16 common protein-coding genes from the other 15 Ceramiales (Rhodophyta) mitochondrial genomes (Table S1) were used to construct phylogenetic trees to infer the taxonomic position ofC. corymbosum. Hildenbrandia rubra(NC026055) andPalmaria palmata(NC026056) were used as outgroups. PhyloSuite v1.2.3 (Zhang et al.2020) was used to extract consensus gene sequences. Mega 7.0 (Kumar et al.2016) was employed to align protein sequences. BioEdit v7.0.9.0 (Hall1999) was used for manual editing and trimming. The concatenated alignments were generated respectively and poorly aligned regions were removed using the Gblocks server (Castresana2000).

The ML tree was constructed using RAxML (Stamatakis2006), and Bootstrap probability values were run with 1,000 replicates under the CpREV + G + I + F model. The BI tree was constructed with MrBayes v3.2.6 (Ronquist et al.2012) using the CpREV model. For this analysis, two independent Markov chain Monte Carlo runs were performed for 1,000,000 generations, sampling every 100 generations. The phylogenetic analysis was run until the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01 and the first 25% of samples were removed as burn-in. FigTree v1.4.3 was used to display the phylogenetic tree (Rambaut2016).

The complete mitochondrial genome ofC. corymbosumhad a total length of 25,462 base pairs and was deposited with the accession numberPV600744in the GenBank database (Figure 2). The mitochondrial genome contains 23 protein coding genes (PCGs), 23 tRNAs and two rRNAs. The overall base-composition of this mitochondrial genome was 13.48% guanine, 35.85% thymine, 38.01% adenine, and 12.66% cytosine. The AT and GC content of the complete mitochondrial genome was 73.86% and 26.14%, respectively. Average depth of coverage was 2169.65x across the mitochondrial genome (Figure S1). ATN (21 ATG, one ATT, and one ATA) codons were predicted to be the initiator for 23 PCGs. All termination codons in PCGs were predicted to be TAA, whilerps12contains an exceptional termination codon TAG. The tRNAs ranged in length from 72 bp to 89 bp. The lengths ofrrnLandrrnSinC. corymbosumare 3008 bp and 126 bp.

The same topological structure was shared by BI tree and ML tree, with the ML bootstrap support values integrated into the BI tree. The topology of phylogenetic tree of the order Ceramiales is shown inFigure 3. According to the phylogenetic outcome, the outgroupHildenbrandia rubraof Hildenbrandiales andPalmaria palmataof Nemaliophycidae is a single branch, all Ceramiales species form three clades:C. corymbosumof Callithamniaceae form a clade, five Ceramiaceae species form a clade, the species of the other three families form a clade. All three clades cluster together with strong support.

Phylogenetic trees using both BI and ML analyses base on 16 PCGs from 18 species, usingHildenbrandia rubraandPalmaria palmataas an outgroup. The numbers above the branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities and bootstrap support values. TheC. corymbosumin the study is labeled in red color. The GenBank accession numbers of all species are shown in the figure, and citations are given inTable S1.

In this study, the mitochondrial genome ofC. corymbosumwas sequenced and annotated for the first time. The circular mitochondrial genome was 25,462 bp in length, containing 48 genes, including 23 PCGs, 23 tRNAs, and two rRNAs. This study has further refined and expanded upon the previous studies of the order Ceramiales (McIvor et al.2002; Yang et al.2015). The phylogenetic tree using complete mitochondrial genomes, the 16 Ceramiales species grouped into three distinct clades.C. corymbosumof this study form a clade. Five Ceramiaceae species form a clade. Delesseriaceae, Rhodomelaceae and Wrangeliaceae species form a clade. The species of Ceramiales was resolved in a monophyletic group with full support. Compared with the topology inferred from plastid genomes in previous studies on the Ceramiales (Díaz-Tapia et al.2019), the clade comprising five Ceramiaceae species exhibits an identical topology to that of earlier work. In contrast, the other two clades show slight topological differences from the plastid-based reconstruction. It indicates that there are differences between the evolution of mitochondria and that of plastids. Studies based on organelle genomes or nuclear genomes represent an important step toward a precise understanding of the classification and evolution of the Ceramiales. The complete mitochondrial genome data ofC. corymbosumwill contribute to future studies on the molecular phylogeny of the Ceramiales which accounts for one third of red algal diversity.
