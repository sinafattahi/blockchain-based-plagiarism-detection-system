Sepsis is a condition resulting from the uncontrolled immune response to infection, leading to widespread inflammatory damage and potentially fatal organ dysfunction. Currently, there is a lack of specific prevention and treatment strategies for sepsis across different age groups. Programmed Cell Death (PCD) can regulate the enrichment of effector immune cells or regulatory immune cells, providing a new perspective for immunotherapy. Within the framework of computational biology and machine learning strategies, and against the backdrop of global multicenter sepsis cohort data, this study aims to deeply mine and screen specific biomarkers related to the immune microenvironment and programmed cell death in populations across different life stages (neonates, children, and adults). This will provide foundational data for precision treatment and drug development in artificial intelligence-assisted sepsis diagnosis and treatment management. Gene expression data from sepsis patients across global multicenter populations, including China, Europe, and the United States, were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. A literature review was conducted to obtain 18 PCD-related genes, which were intersected with DEGs to identify DEGs associated with specific types of PCD. Nine machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression LR, Decision Tree DT, Gradient Boosting Machine GBM, K-Nearest Neighbors KNN, LASSO, Principal Component Analysis PCA, Random Forest RF, Support Vector Machine SVM, and XGBoost) were applied to training and testing datasets with 10-fold cross-validation to select three optimized algorithm models. The SHAP algorithm was further used to quantify the contribution of each gene based on cell death features to the prediction of sepsis. Key PCD patterns were identified based on model evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve ROC), and their associated DEGs were obtained through intersection, followed by immune-related analysis of DEGs. The study included a total of 1507 sepsis cases and 484 controls globally, with 90 neonatal cases and 95 controls, 527 children cases and 101 controls, and 890 adult cases and 288 controls. The best model for predicting sepsis across different populations was GBM.The key PCD patterns selected by machine learning for different age groups were Pyroptosis (neonates), Ferroptosis (children), and Autophagy (adults). (1) In neonatal sepsis, the models constructed by GBM, XGBoost, and RF algorithms performed the best, and identified 5 key DEGs associated with Pyroptosis (CHMP7, NLRC4, AIM2, GZMB, PRKACA), with NLRC4 showing the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.902,P< 0.05), significantly positively correlated with neutrophils and negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells. (2) In the children sepsis population, models constructed using the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithms demonstrated the best performance. Six key DEGs associated with Ferroptosis were identified (AKR1C3, GCLM, PEBP1, CARS, MAP1LC3B, SCL11A2), among which MAP1LC3B, playing a role in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species energy metabolism, showed the strongest predictive ability (AUC = 0.883,P< 0.05). It was significantly positively correlated with M0-type macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with activated CD4 + memory T cells. (3) In the adult sepsis population, models constructed using GBM, SVM, and LASSO algorithms showed the best performance. Three key DEGs associated with Autophagy were identified (TSPO, HTRA2, USP10), with TSPO, which mediates oxidative stress regulation, iron homeostasis, and cholesterol transport, showing the strongest predictive ability (AUC = 0.825,P< 0.05). It was significantly positively correlated with M1-type macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells. This study, through the integrated application of computational biology and machine learning algorithms, discovered biomarkers of PCD patterns that affect cytokine storm-mediated inflammation and immunosuppressive effects in sepsis populations across different age groups (neonates, children, and adults). These findings have specific clinical application and drug development value, providing a scientific basis for the global application of artificial intelligence-assisted sepsis diagnosis and treatment management.

Sepsis is a syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated immune responses and extensive inflammatory damage triggered by infection, and it is one of the leading causes of death among critically ill patients1–3. In the early stages of systemic infection, a rapid cascade of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production is triggered, a phenomenon known as the “cytokine storm”4. Thanks to the timely advancements in intensive care, most sepsis patients now survive the acute phase of sepsis, which mitigates the damage of the cytokine storm to tissues and organs5. However, following the cytokine storm, patients may experience transient lymphopenia and long-term immune dysfunction, a condition referred to as “immune paralysis.” This makes surviving patients more susceptible to secondary infections and viral reactivation, resulting in a significantly lower 5-year survival rate compared to non-infected individuals6–8. According to a report from the World Health Organization, there are approximately 49 million cases of sepsis worldwide each year, with as many as 11 million related deaths9. A retrospective analysis indicated that the in-hospital mortality rate for sepsis is 17%, and for severe sepsis, it is 26%10. These figures highlight the severity of sepsis as a risk factor for patient mortality. Despite this, current preventive and therapeutic options for sepsis remain limited, with treatment choices mainly confined to general intensive care unit care and a lack of specific treatments for sepsis. This is primarily due to our limited understanding of the immunophysiology associated with the disease7. Therefore, the search for effective therapeutic targets and strategies has become particularly urgent and crucial.

In multicellular organisms, cell death pathways are diverse and flexible, and molecular regulation exhibits high plasticity. For a long time, it has been believed that various modes of cell death participate in the regulation of effector immune cells or the enrichment of regulatory immune cells through different pathways, and are involved in maintaining homeostasis and disease development. Studies have shown that sepsis is closely related to multiple cell death pathways. For example, review studies have pointed out that various forms of PCD are involved in regulating the immune response in sepsis patients, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, PANoptosis, NETosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, etc.11. However, the current limitation of research is that it focuses only on one type of cell death in a specific age group. There are significant differences in immune responses between neonates, children, and adults, and these differences affect the clinical manifestations and pathological processes of sepsis. The immune system of neonates is not yet fully mature, and their immune cells may not respond effectively to pathogens, leading to uncontrolled inflammatory responses12. The immune system of children gradually matures during growth, but their immune regulatory mechanisms may still not be as stable as those of adults13. In comparison, the immune system of adults is more mature and stable, but with increasing age, immune function may gradually decline, affecting the ability to defend against infections14. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of sepsis patients across different life stages through multiple centers worldwide, to identify the key PCD patterns among the 18 types of programmed cell death that play crucial roles in neonates, children, and adults, and to screen for key genes, thereby laying a theoretical foundation for the development of precision treatment plans.

In recent years, complex deep learning models such as Graph Attention Mechanism-Based Graph Neural Network (GAMB-GNN)15, Multi-scale Unsupervised Self-embedding Graph Neural Network (Muse-GNN)16, Integrative Clustering Framework (iCluF)17and Autoencoder18have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of biomedical data analysis, particularly in capturing complex nonlinear relationships and graph-structured information. However, given the relatively limited sample size of the omics data available for this study, as well as the potential overfitting risks and computational resource demands associated with overly complex models, we have chosen to prioritize the evaluation of a suite of classical and computationally efficient machine learning methods (including LR, DT, GBM, KNN, LASSO, PCA, RF, SVM, and XGBoost). These methods have been proven to exhibit robust performance on datasets of similar scale19–21, and their interpretability facilitates our preliminary exploration of the relationships between omics features and sepsis prediction. In the future, systematic exploration and comparison of these advanced models will be of great significance when larger-scale datasets and more abundant computational resources become available.

We utilized the limma package in R software to perform differential expression gene analysis on sepsis samples and healthy control samples from the microarrays. DEGs were identified based on an absolute LogFC value > 1 and an adjustedP-value (FDR) < 0.05.

We employed the IOBR package in the R language environment, integrating the advanced CIBERSORT algorithm, to conduct a comprehensive immune cell infiltration analysis on the collected samples. The CIBERSORT algorithm is capable of estimating the relative abundance of 22 major immune cell subsets in samples based on gene expression data and revealing differences in immune cell composition among various samples.

This study employed Pearson correlation analysis to explore the potential connections between DEGs in the dataset and specific immune cell subsets. These immune cell subsets include, but are not limited to, plasma cells and T cells, which play crucial roles in immune responses and disease progression.

To establish a consensus of PCD-related genes with high accuracy and stability, we applied nine machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression LR, Decision Tree DT, Gradient Boosting Machine GBM, K-Nearest Neighbors KNN, LASSO, Principal Component Analysis PCA, Random Forest RF, Support Vector Machine SVM, and Distributed Gradient Boosting Library XGBoost) to the training and testing datasets with tenfold cross-validation to select three optimized algorithm models. The Evaluation Indicators of Machine Learning Model were including F1-score, Recall, Precision, AUPRC and AUROC. The SHAP algorithm was further used to quantify the contribution of each gene based on cell death features to the prediction of sepsis outcomes.

Functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the three groups of DEGs were performed using R software23. The “ggplot2” and “clusterProfiler” packages were used to analyze and visualize the results.

The flowchart of this study is depicted in Fig.1. We collected transcriptomic data and clinical information of sepsis patients across different age groups compared to normal tissues from the GEO database. For the neonatal group, theGSE25504andGSE69686datasets were analyzed. After processing, merging, and removing duplicate tissues, an expression matrix consisting of 12,442 genes was constructed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to remove batch effects, and we successfully eliminated batch influence from the dataset (Fig.2A), further identifying 5839 DEGs between sepsis and normal tissues (Fig.2B). The children group was based on five datasets:GSE4607,GSE9692,GSE13904,GSE26378, andGSE26440. After processing, an expression matrix of 22,876 genes was formed. Following PCA analysis to remove batch effects (Fig.2C), 14,662 DEGs were identified (Fig.2D). The adult group analyzed a total of 13 datasets:GSE10361,GSE10474,GSE131761,GSE28750,GSE40012,GSE54514,GSE57065,GSE66890,GSE67530,GSE69528,GSE95233,GSE32707, andGSE65682. After processing, an expression matrix of 6,115 genes was obtained. After PCA to remove batch effects (Fig.2E), we identified 5,149 DEGs (Fig.2F). Additionally, 18 genes related to programmed cell death pathways were obtained through literature search (TableS1)22.

The DEGs from different age groups were intersected with genes related to the 18 programmed cell death pathways to obtain DEGs associated with different modes of death. Subsequently, nine machine learning algorithms were trained (LR, DT, GBM, KNN, LASSO, PCA, RF, SVM, XGBoost), and tenfold cross-validation was performed to select three optimized algorithm models. The results indicated that different ML algorithms showed competitiveness in risk assessment across different age groups. The Evaluation Indicators of Machine Learning Model across different age groups were described in Supplementary Table 2 (TableS2). Specifically, the models constructed by GBM, XGBoost, and RF algorithms performed better in neonatal sepsis (Fig.3A), while the models constructed by GBM, SVM, and LASSO algorithms performed better in children sepsis (Fig.3B), and in adult sepsis, the models constructed by GBM, SVM, and LASSO algorithms also performed better (Fig.3C). Furthermore, the SHAP algorithm was used to quantify the contribution of each gene based on cell death features to the prediction of sepsis outcomes in different age groups (Fig.4A–C). The results showed that the key PCD patterns selected by machine learning for different age groups were Pyroptosis (neonates), Ferroptosis (children), and Autophagy (adults).

In the enrichment analysis of key cellular programmed death patterns among different age groups, we observed the following patterns: In the neonatal population, GO enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs associated with pyroptosis were primarily involved in the regulation of enzymatic activities, including positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, positive regulation of endopeptidase activity, and positive regulation of peptidase activity (Fig.5A). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that these pyroptosis-related DEGs were closely related to lipid metabolism and immune response, with involvement in pathways such as Lipid and atherosclerosis, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Shigellosis (Fig.5B). In the children population, GO enrichment analysis identified DEGs associated with ferroptosis as being primarily enriched in response to metal ion, response to oxidative stress, and long-chain fatty acid metabolic process (Fig.5C). Further KEGG pathway analysis showed that these ferroptosis-related DEGs were enriched in lipid metabolism pathways, such as Fatty acid biosynthesis, Mineral absorption, and Fatty acid metabolism (Fig.5D). In the adult population, DEGs related to Autophagy were primarily involved in the regulation of autophagic processes, including regulation of autophagy, macroautophagy, and regulation of macroautophagy (Fig.5E). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these Autophagy-related DEGs were enriched in pathways such as Autophagy-animal, Shigellosis, and Longevity regulating pathway (Fig.5F).

In the comparative analysis of immune cells across different age groups, we identified the following characteristics: In the neonatal population, significant differences in immune cell levels were observed between sepsis patients and normal controls for B cell naïve, T cells CD4 memory resting, T cells CD4 memory activated, Tregs, macrophages M0, and neutrophils (P< 0.05) (Fig.6A). Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between T cells CD4 memory resting and Tregs, T cells CD8 and NK cells activated, T cells CD8 and neutrophils, and NK cells activated and neutrophils (Fig.6B). In the children population, significant differences in immune cell levels were noted between sepsis patients and normal controls for mast cells resting and neutrophils (P< 0.05) (Fig.6C). Further correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between T cells CD8 and T cells CD4 memory activated (Fig.6D). In the adult population, significant differences in immune cell levels were observed between sepsis patients and normal controls for B cell naïve, T cells CD8, T cells CD4 naïve, T cells CD4 memory resting, Tregs, NK cells resting, monocytes, macrophages M0, dendritic cells resting, mast cells resting, and neutrophils (P< 0.05) (Fig.6E). However, correlation analysis did not identify significant correlations among immune cells (Fig.6F).

In the neonatal population, the intersection of sepsis DEGs and pyroptosis-related genes yielded 5 genes (CHMP7, NLRC4, AIM2, GZMB, PRKACA), among which CHMP7 and GZMB were highly expressed in sepsis patients, while NLRC4, PRKACA, and AIM2 were lowly expressed (Fig.7A). In the children population, the intersection of sepsis DEGs and Ferroptosis-related genes resulted in 6 genes (AKR1C3, GCLM, PEBP1, CARS, MAP1LC3B, SCL11A2), with AKR1C3 and PEBP1 being highly expressed in sepsis patients, and GCLM, CARS, MAP1LC3B, and SCL11A2 being lowly expressed (Fig.7B). In the adult population, the intersection of sepsis DEGs and Autophagy-related genes identified 3 genes (TSPO, HTRA2, USP10), with TSPO and HTRA2 being highly expressed in sepsis patients, and USP10 being lowly expressed (Fig.7C).

In the children group, MAP1LC3B had the strongest predictive power (AUC = 0.883,P< 0.05) (Fig.8F–K), which was significantly positively correlated with M0-type macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with activated CD4 + memory T cells (Fig.9C,D). In the adult group, TSPO had the strongest predictive power (AUC = 0.825,P< 0.05) (Fig.8L–N), which was significantly positively correlated with M1-type macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells (Fig.9E,F).

Recent years have witnessed significant breakthroughs in the application of machine learning to sepsis research, particularly in early prediction model optimization and clinical decision support system development. Regarding predictive models, a systematic analysis integrating 28 studies encompassing 130 models demonstrated that machine learning models can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in advance24. Another study analyzing data from 2312 patients diagnosed with sepsis successfully established a machine learning-based predictive model, confirming a strong association between stress hyperglycemia ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill septic patients25. In clinical translation, existing research teams have utilized machine learning methods to optimize treatment protocols for sepsis and septic shock patients, effectively reducing the 28-day mortality rate26. In contrast, this study innovatively integrates multiple machine learning algorithms across global multicenter cohorts to conduct in-depth analysis of sepsis patients at different life stages. We identified crucial PCD patterns from 18 PCD modalities that play pivotal roles in neonatal, pediatric, and adult populations, screening key genes to establish a theoretical foundation for precision therapy. The study successfully identified distinct dominant PCD patterns across different age groups: pyroptosis (key gene NLRC4) predominates in neonates, ferroptosis (key gene MAP1LC3B) in children, and autophagy (key gene TSPO) in adults. These findings not only reveal the complex relationship between sepsis and PCD but also emphasize the necessity for personalized treatment strategies targeting specific PCD patterns across different life stage populations.

Firstly, this study found that pyroptosis may serve as the dominant mode of PCD in the course of sepsis in the neonatal population. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death triggered by inflammasome activation, characterized by the activation of caspase-1, which in turn leads to cell membrane rupture and the release of inflammatory factors27. In neonatal sepsis, pyroptosis may drive the bidirectional dynamic evolution of immune dysfunction through a mechanism mediated by endogenous host defense peptides: in the early stage, due to the immaturity of the neonatal immune system, endogenous host defense peptides can trigger excessive inflammatory responses (such as cytokine storms) by inducing pyroptosis in macrophages28; as the disease progresses, the important regulatory component of the defense peptide system, LL-37, tends to become depleted29. It is worth noting that multiple studies have confirmed that LL-37 has an inhibitory effect on cell pyroptosis30,31, and this regulatory mechanism may help maintain immune homeostasis during the compensatory phase. Based on the above evidence, we speculate that as LL-37 becomes progressively depleted, its inhibitory effect on cell pyroptosis gradually weakens, leading to abnormal activation of the pyroptosis pathway. This pathological shift may exacerbate immune paralysis through a dual mechanism: on one hand, persistent cell pyroptosis may accelerate the exhaustion of immune cells (especially macrophages with antigen-presenting functions); on the other hand, damage-associated molecular patterns released by pyroptotic cells may continuously activate immune cells through pattern recognition receptors, inducing them into an exhausted state, ultimately leading to a vicious cycle of decreased immune responsiveness and immune tolerance.

NLRC4, as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, can sense bacterial components such as flagellin and type III secretion systems, triggering inflammasome formation and activation. This process subsequently activates Caspase-1 and induces pyroptosis32. In sepsis, this mechanism is particularly critical, as NLRC4 activation may lead to excessive immune cell activation and massive release of inflammatory cytokines, thereby exacerbating the disease33–37. However, previous studies have not sufficiently explored this phenomenon in neonatal populations.This study found that in neonatal sepsis, NLRC4 is highly expressed, with its expression levels significantly positively correlated with the number of neutrophils and significantly negatively correlated with the number of CD8 + T cells. Neutrophils, as key members of the innate immune system, play an important role in sepsis, participating in inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance. The study found that compared with healthy controls, neonates with sepsis have a higher neutrophil ratio38, a finding that is highly consistent with the conclusions drawn in this study. In addition, CD8 + T cells play a key role in protecting the host from intracellular infections. Research has pointed out that compared with surviving neonates with sepsis, deceased neonates with sepsis have lower levels of CD8 + T lymphocytes39. This study found that children with sepsis have lower CD8 + T lymphocytes than healthy children. This result may imply that in the pathological process of neonatal sepsis, the function of CD8 + T cells may be suppressed, and the reduction in their numbers may be closely related to the severity of the disease and may even have a potential link to the poor prognosis of the children. Studies indicate that NLRC4 activation promotes neutrophil recruitment and activation40, with neutrophil pyroptosis serving as the primary source of IL-1β secretion. This process recruits additional neutrophils to infection sites through a positive feedback amplification loop, exacerbating inflammatory responses41. Therefore, we hypothesize that during the early stages of sepsis, NLRC4 activation induces neutrophil pyroptosis, further amplifying inflammation. Concurrently, as the disease progresses, excessive NLRC4 inflammasome activation-driven pyroptosis may lead to an overactive immune response42,43, triggering immunosuppressive mechanisms to prevent excessive damage. These mechanisms include the activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2), which suppress CD8 + T cell function44. Consequently, we propose that in the late stages of sepsis, NLRC4 impairs effective anti-infective CD8 + T cell responses, resulting in immune paralysis. Given the immature neonatal immune system and their weaker capacity to regulate inflammatory responses, neonates may exhibit heightened vulnerability to sepsis, rendering them more susceptible to severe outcomes.

Secondly, in pediatric sepsis, this study reveals that ferroptosis may serve as a significant mechanism as the dominant mode of PCD. Ferroptosis may drive sepsis-related immune imbalance through a dual mechanism: on one hand, the oxidized phospholipids (such as POVPC) released by ferroptotic cells activate the TLR4 signaling pathway in endothelial cells45, triggering a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α45. This finding provides a new perspective for explaining the occurrence of cytokine storms in the early stages of sepsis. On the other hand, the reduction of mitochondrial cristae and the decrease in membrane potential during ferroptosis lead to metabolic disorders in immune cells (such as dendritic cells46), which in turn cause impaired antigen-presenting ability and chemotactic dysfunction.In addition, as the disease progresses, the level of free iron in the blood significantly increases47. Iron overload directly damages the lysosomal function of macrophages48and interferes with T-cell receptor signaling transduction49, ultimately leading to a decline in antimicrobial efficacy. This dynamic evolution process may explain the pathological characteristics of the transition from early excessive inflammatory response to late immune suppression/immune paralysis in sepsis.

MAP1LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta), a critical protein in autophagy, plays a crucial role in autophagosome formation50. Studies have shown that autophagy can promote ferroptosis by selectively degrading anti-ferroptosis regulatory factors51–53. Notably, MAP1LC3B has also been implicated in ferroptosis regulation, serving as a biomarker for ferroptosis in gastric cancer54, ischemic stroke55, and osteoarthritis56. These findings suggest that MAP1LC3B may play a significant role in ferroptosis regulation, although its precise mechanisms require further investigation.In the immune regulation of sepsis, MAP1LC3B also plays an important role. The study by Di et al. identified it as a key gene in the immune regulation of sepsis57, implying its involvement in the regulation of sepsis. Our study further revealed that in pediatric sepsis patients, MAP1LC3B is significantly overexpressed. It shows a significant positive correlation with unactivated M0 macrophages and a significant negative correlation with activated CD4 + memory T cells. M0 macrophages, as precursor cells, can polarize into the pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes, but their specific functions in pediatric sepsis have not yet been clarified. The results of this study provide a new direction for research in this area. On the other hand, activated CD4 + T cells are responsible for rapidly recognizing and eliminating pathogens that reinvade in adaptive immunity. However, it has been reported in previous studies that these cells are significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of pediatric sepsis patients and are closely related to immune dysfunction54, which is consistent with the negative correlation results of this study. Although no studies have directly investigated whether MAP1LC3B participates in the polarization process of M0 macrophages, influences their pathogen phagocytosis and degradation capabilities, or regulates activated CD4 + T cells, existing research has shown significant correlations between MAP1LC3B and other immune cells54,58,59. This suggests that MAP1LC3B may possess potential regulatory roles in immune cell function.In the adult population, our research findings reveal autophagy as a key mode of PCD. Autophagy may exhibit dynamic dual roles in different stages of sepsis by regulating immune cell functions. On one hand, autophagy can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in macrophages60, and NLRP3 can significantly exacerbate the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-18, etc.)61, which in turn may drive the pathological process of cytokine storm. This may explain why autophagy promotes the sepsis cytokine storm in the early stages of sepsis. On the other hand, as the disease progresses, persistent autophagy activation can lead to the degradation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns required for inflammasome activation, thereby inhibiting inflammasome activation62. In addition, autophagy also promotes the internalization of MHC class I molecules, thereby suppressing the antiviral response of CD8 + T cells63,64, ultimately leading to immune cell exhaustion and an immunoparalysis state. TSPO (Translocator protein), a transporter protein localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, plays a critical role in regulating cellular stress responses and maintaining mitochondrial function. Current studies suggest that TSPO may indirectly influence the autophagy process by modulating mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress levels65,66. Although no research has directly elucidated the mechanism of TSPO in sepsis-associated autophagy, existing evidence indicates its involvement in regulating sepsis-related pathological damage. For instance, research by Koumine et al. found that modulating TSPO expression can influence M1/M2 polarization phenotypes of macrophages, significantly alleviating liver injury in septic mice67, suggesting TSPO may play an important role in immune regulation during sepsis.

This study found that the expression level of TSPO in the peripheral blood of adult sepsis patients is significantly elevated, and it is significantly positively correlated with the activation of M1 macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with the activation of CD8 + T cells. M1 macrophages, as pro-inflammatory phenotype macrophages, are closely related to the progression of sepsis when over-activated. Studies have shown that the over-activation of M1 macrophages and their pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in adult sepsis patients are key factors in triggering systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction68. It is worth noting that during the course of sepsis, platelets mediate the suppression of CD8 + T cell function through MHC class I molecules69, which echoes the negative correlation between TSPO and CD8 + T cell activation found in this study. Existing evidence suggests that the upregulation of TSPO expression may exacerbate the release of inflammatory cytokines and their mediated organ damage by promoting the activation of M1 macrophages67. On the other hand, CD8 + T cells play an important role in the immune response against intracellular pathogens. Although there are currently no reports on TSPO directly regulating CD8 + T cells in adult sepsis, multiple studies have shown that TSPO can induce T cell immune paralysis and lead to functional impairment70–72. This suggests that TSPO may participate in the pathological process of immune imbalance in sepsis by regulating the function of CD8 + T cells, and this regulatory mechanism needs to be further explored in subsequent studies.

In summary, our study indicates that in neonatal sepsis, pyroptosis is the key PCDmode, with NLRC4 being the critical DEG, which is significantly positively correlated with neutrophils and significantly negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells. In the pediatric sepsis population, ferroptosis is the key PCD mode, with MAP1LC3B as the critical DEG, which is significantly positively correlated with M0 macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with activated CD4 + memory T cells. In the adult sepsis population, autophagy is the key PCD mode, with TSPO as the critical DEG, which is significantly positively correlated with M1 macrophages and significantly negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells.

Our study, through the integrated application of computational biology and machine learning algorithms, has identified biomarkers of PCD patterns that influence cytokine storm-mediated inflammation and immunosuppressive effects in sepsis populations across different age groups (neonates, children, and adults). These findings hold specific value for clinical applications and drug development, providing a scientific basis for the global implementation of artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis and treatment management of sepsis.
