Bovine tuberculosis (BTB), caused byMycobacterium bovis, contributes significantly to human tuberculosis in developing countries, accounting for 10–15% of cases in Ethiopia. This study assessed the prevalence of BTB and associated risk factors in dairy cattle in Mekelle city and Wukro town, North Ethiopia, and evaluated farm workers’ awareness of its zoonotic significance. A cross-sectional study (2020–2021) tested 240 dairy cows using comparative intradermal tuberculin skin testing and cultured 140 milk samples. BTB prevalence was 7.1% by skin test (7.5% in Mekelle, 6.3% in Wukro) and 4.1% by culture. Risk factors significantly associated with infection included large herd size, poor management, adult age, exotic breeds, and poor body condition. Only 20% of farm owners and 14% of workers were aware of BTB’s zoonotic risk. These findings underscore the need for targeted public education and the implementation of control measures to reduce BTB transmission and protect public health. Without intervention, both animal productivity and human health remain at continued risk.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that affects both animals and humans. The disease is caused by various species, includingMycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium bovis,Mycobacterium microti,Mycobacterium caprae,Mycobacterium africanum,Mycobacterium canettii, andMycobacterium pinnipedii[1,2]. These species are obligate aerobic, non-spore-forming, acid-fast, non-motile, facultative intracellular, and slow-growing bacteria. Cold, dark, and moist environments favor the prolonged survival of these bacteria outside the host [3].

Mycobacterium bovis(M. bovis) primarily infects cattle but poses a significant zoonotic risk to humans. Human infection typically occurs through the consumption of contaminated or unpasteurized dairy products, contributing to the overall TB burden in areas where bovine TB (BTB) is endemic [4–6]. AlthoughM. bovisaccounts for a smaller proportion of human TB cases compared to M. tuberculosis, it is estimated to cause about 3.1% of all human TB cases in developing countries, including 2.8% in Africa. The overall TB incidence rate in Africa is approximately 264 cases per 100,000 people annually, with the proportion attributed toM. bovisreported as high as 17% in Ethiopia, 15.4% in Nigeria, and 26.1% in Tanzania [7–9].

Ethiopia, a country with a high TB burden, reports one of the highest incidence rates of extrapulmonary TB globally, and BTB remains endemic in its cattle population [10–16]. BTB prevalence has been reported at 4.3% in slaughterhouses, 3.4% in smallholder production systems, and up to 50% in intensive dairy farms [16–19]. The widespread practice of consuming raw meat and milk further increases the risk of zoonotic transmission. Despite growing health problems and production losses in intensive dairy systems, there is still limited epidemiological data on BTB at the district level in regions such as Tigray [4]. Specifically, there is a lack of detailed information on the prevalence, risk factors, and zoonotic significance ofM. bovisin Mekelle and Wukro. Moreover, dairy farm owners and workers often have limited awareness of BTB’s zoonotic nature and the farm-level practices that facilitate its transmission.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence ofM. bovisinfection in dairy cattle, assess major risk factors, and evaluate the awareness of farm owners and workers in Mekelle and Wukro, northern Ethiopia. The research addressed three key questions: (1) What is the prevalence ofM. bovisinfection in dairy cattle in the study areas? (2) What are the major risk factors associated with infection? and (3) What is the level of awareness among farm owners and workers regarding BTB and its zoonotic potential? We hypothesized thatM. bovisinfection is present among dairy herds in both towns, that factors such as herd size and farm management practices are significantly associated with infection, and that awareness of the disease’s zoonotic transmission is generally low among farm owners and workers.

The study was carried out in Mekelle city and Wukro town, Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Mekelle lies 783 km north of Addis Ababa, at a latitude and longitude of 13° 29′N and 39° 28′E, respectively, with an elevation of 2,084 m above sea level. Dairy farming in Mekelle predominantly employs both intensive and extensive systems. The dairy cattle consisted of crossbreeds resulting from the mating of local zebu breeds, such as Begait, with exotic dairy breeds, notably Holstein-Friesian, and exotic breeds, specifically the Holstein-Friesians. Wukro, situated in the Eastern Zone of Tigray, northern Ethiopia, has a comparable dairy farming system [3–11]. Fig.1.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 240 dairy cattle via the comparative intradermal tuberculin test (CIDT) and bacteriological analysis to determine the prevalence ofM. bovisin cattle at dairy farms in the study area from September 2020 to April 2021. Sex, age, breed, body condition score, and herd size were risk factors considered in this study (Table1). In addition, a questionnaire survey was employed to assess the knowledge and awareness of farm owners and workers about BTB transmission and its zoonotic importance.

The age of dairy cows was classified based on dentition, farm records, or owner recall. Cows were grouped into three categories: young (less than 3 years old), adult (3 to 8 years old), and old (more than 8 years old). Body Condition Score (BCS) was assessed through visual observation and palpation, using a standard 5-point scale. A score of 1 indicated emaciation, where bones such as the ribs and spine were sharp and clearly visible. A score of 2 represented thin animals with some muscle coverage but still prominent bone structures. A score of 3 indicated moderate or good condition, with ribs covered but still palpable and a smooth body appearance. Scores of 4 and 5 reflected fat animals, with increasing levels of fat deposits around the hips, tail head, and ribs. For analysis, BCS was grouped into three categories: poor (scores 1–2), moderate (score 3), and good (scores 4–5) [20]. The management of the farm was scored based on degree of ventilation, neatness of the floor, degree of exposure to the sunlight, stocking rate, neatness of watering and feeding. The score of each of these variables ranged from 1 to 2 (ordinal scoring established from an expert viewpoint), the former being the poor score whereas the latter being the good score. These variables were scored for each farm. Mean score of the management parameters was used to measure the association related to the prevalence of BTB [11].

In Mekelle, there are over 336 dairy farms of varying sizes, classified as small (1–3 cows), medium (4–10 cows), and large (> 10 cows), with more than 76% falling into the small farm category, according to a previous report [21]. Considering the role of herd size in BTB transmission, dairy farms with more than 20 cows were purposively selected, as larger herds present a higher risk for disease spread due to increased animal density and contact. A total of 15 such farms were identified and grouped into three categories: A (20–25 cows, 7 farms), B (25–30 cows, 5 farms), and C (30–35 cows, 3 farms). From these, 160 cows were proportionally sampled: 64 from category A, 56 from B, and 40 from C.

In Wukro, where formal documentation of dairy farms was unavailable, farms were identified through personal communication with the town’s agriculture office. Due to the relatively small number of large farms, a lower herd size threshold (> 10 cows) was used to include a sufficient number of study farms. Based on this criterion, 15 dairy farms were selected, and 80 cows were proportionally sampled. While the herd size thresholds differed between Mekelle and Wukro, the selection was based on local herd structure and aimed to capture farms with a higher likelihood of BTB transmission. The approach was designed to assess BTB prevalence and risk factors in high-risk settings rather than to compare prevalence between the two towns. A dairy farm was considered positive if at least one animal tested CIDT positive forM. bovis. Due to financial constraints, culture was performed on 140 milk samples.

Most assessed dairy farms, in both Mekelle and Wukro have 1–3 dairy workers, including the owner, totaling 30–90 workers/owners. To assess the knowledge and awareness of workers and owners about BTB, a structured questionnaire was used, and at least one respondent from each farm and two from those with more dairy workers were included in the survey, 30 from the former and 20 from the latter totaling 50 respondents. The respondents were evaluated on their knowledge of zoonotic tuberculosis transmission, specifically their awareness and understanding of how TB can be passed from animals (particularly cattle) to humans.

A CIDT was performed to determine the prevalence of BTB. Briefly, dairy cattle were restrained, two sites on the same side of the neck at a distance of 10–15 cm were shaved and cleaned, and the skin fold thickness was measured via a skin caliper in mm before and after injection. A total of 0.1 ml (28,000 IU/ml) of bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) and 0.1 ml (28,000 IU/ml) of avian PPD (supplier: Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK) were injected, one at each site, via an intradermal semiautomatic syringe. The injection sites were examined, and the skin thicknesses were measured 72 h post injection. When the difference in skin thickness was greater at the site of avian PPD inoculation than at the bovine PPD inoculation site, an animal was considered a nonspecific reactor. When the skin thickness increased at both sites and/or at the site of bovine PPD injection, test procedures and interpretation of the results were performed according to the standard procedure of OIE, 2009. B2– B1 = ∆B, A2– A1 = ∆A; ∆B - ∆A < 2 mm: Negative for theM. tuberculosiscomplex; ∆B - ∆A= (2–4 mm): In BTB diagnosis using CIDT, cattle with a ∆B - ∆A between 2 and 4 mm are considered doubtful reactors These cases are diagnostically challenging, as they may indicate early stages ofM. bovisinfection or result from non-specific immune responses. Doubtful reactions complicate disease classification, as they may represent either true infections or false positives. Therefore, it was considered as negative. In terms of skin thickness, A1 is the initial sign of pre-inoculation with PPD, B1 indicates the first sign, as well as the second sign, and B2 = skin thickness after inoculation with bovine PPD, ∆A = change in skin thickness at the site of avian PPD inoculation, and ∆B = change in skin thickness at the site of bovine PPD inoculation [4,22].

A total of 140 milk samples were collected for culturing, comprising 17 from CIDT reactors and 123 from non-CIDT reactors. Milk (30 ml) was collected from each cow using a sterile screw-capped universal bottle [5]. The samples were transported in a cold chain with ice to the Microbiology Laboratory at the National Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Center (NAHDIC), Ethiopia, and stored at −21 °C for up to five days prior to culturing. The milk sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. The sediment was suspended in 2 milliliters of sterilized saline water. After adding one drop of 0.05% phenol red indicator and an equal amount of sterilized 4-N sodium hydroxide solution, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, the samples were mixed with sterile 4-N hydrochloric acid solution and centrifuged again for 15 min at 3000 rpm, with the sediment used as a culture medium [7,23].

Milk samples were cultured in Löwenstein–Jensen (LJ) medium slants containing glycerol and pyruvate for eight weeks. Cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 °C, and growth indicators were checked weekly. It was assumed that bacteria growing in slants containing pyruvate, which produced small, moist, creamy to yellowish, smooth, flat colonies after four weeks of incubation, wereM. bovispositive. Growth of mycobacteria on LJ media supplemented with pyruvate is characteristic ofM. bovis, whereas growth on LJ media with glycerol is typical ofM. tuberculosis. Therefore, isolates growing on LJ with pyruvate suggestM. bovis, while growth on LJ with glycerol supports identification asM. tuberculosis.Positive controls with LJ-glycerol and LJ-pyruvate media containing a known inoculated strain of H37Rv, along with negative controls on these media without inoculation, were also maintained for comparison [23].

Mycobacteria were identified using the most widely employed Ziehl-Neelsen stain, which detects acid-fast bacilli. Examination under a microscope with an oil immersion lens at x 100 revealed acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The bacilli (positive) were stained red, appeared as straight or slightly curved rods, and occurred either singly or in small groups, whereas non-acid-fast microorganisms (negative) were stained blue [24].

Data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the prevalence ofM. bovisinfection and to summarize demographic and farm-level risk factors. The chi-square (χ²) test was employed for univariate analysis to assess the association between each independent variable and CIDT positivity. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to express the strength of these associations, and variables with a p-value less than 0.25 in univariate analysis were selected for multivariate logistic regression to control for potential confounding.

The study revealed that 17 out of 240 (7.1%) dairy cattle tested positive forM. bovisvia CIDT, with 12 from dairy farms in Mekelle city and the remaining from dairy farms in Wukro town. At the farm level, 8 out of 30 (26.7%) dairy farms were found to haveM. bovis. Among the 140 dairy cattle, one milk sample from non-CIDT reactors (123) and four from CIDT reactors (17) tested positive forM. bovis(Table2). A higher prevalence ofM. boviswas observed in Wukro town (5.8%) than in Mekelle city (2.3%). Considering culture test as a gold standard for diagnosing bovine tuberculosis, the sensitivity and specificity of the CIDT test were 80% and 90.37%, respectively. Out of the 30 owners/workers assessed for TB status, 3 tested positives for TB.

Age group (χ2 = 8.6,P= 0.034), breed (χ2 = 4.5,P= 0.05), and body condition score (χ2 = 10.00,P= 0.044), were significantly associated with CIDT positivity. However, there was no association between sex, and the discovery of CIDT responder animals (Table4). Regarding age, adult cattle were more likely to react to the PPD test than young and old animals were (P= 0.034, OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 0.4–14.7). Exotic breeds had a 4.1 times greater chance of contracting BTB than local breeds did (P= 0.04, OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 0.8–20). Coughing animal history in the herd of dairy farms was significantly associated (χ2 = 15.9,P= 0.001, OR = 7.4) with the occurrence ofM. bovisinfection (Table3).

Herd size (x2= 7.2,P= 0.028) and management conditions (X2= 6.9,P= 0.016) were significantly associated with the prevalence ofM. bovisinfection in the assessed dairy farms. Farms with > 10 cattle (P= 0.028, 95% CI = 1.3–4.6) were four times more likely to be reactive to the tuberculin test than farms with≤5 cattle. Regarding to the management system, poor management system of the farm (P= 0.016, 95% CI = 1.55–67.2) were ten times more likely to be reactive to the tuberculin test than good management system of the farm (Table4).

Among the 50 farm owners and workers surveyed, 10 (20%) were aware of BTB, and 14% were aware of the zoonotic importance of BTB. 32% (16/50) of the respondents believed that eating raw milk or meat can increase the risk of contracting tuberculosis. 70% of the participants in this study had the habit of eating raw milk (Table5).

The study revealed a 7.1% and 4.1%M. bovisprevalence in dairy cattle via the tuberculin skin test and bacterial culture of milk samples, respectively, which aligns with previous reports from Tigray [4,25–31]. The discrepancy between the two methods reflects differences in diagnostic performance. While bacterial culture is the gold standard for confirming infection due to its high specificity, it is less sensitive particularly in subclinical cases or when bacterial shedding is low. The tuberculin test, by contrast, showed a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90.37%, indicating the possibility of both false positives (e.g., from environmental mycobacteria) and false negatives (e.g., in immunosuppressed or early-stage infections). Thus, although CIDT is useful for herd-level screening, its results should be interpreted with caution and ideally confirmed by culture when feasible [32,33].

M. boviswas detected in 62.5% of farms with more than 10 cattle, reinforcing the role of herd size as a key risk factor. Larger herds are more likely to facilitate disease transmission due to closer animal contact and overcrowding, which supports aerosol spread of BTB. The association between herd size and infection likelihood has been documented in prior studies [3,4,13,34,35]. Interestingly, the herd-level prevalence observed in this study is higher than previous findings from Tigray, which reported 8.2% in small farms, 15.6% in medium farms, and 50% in large farms highlighting a possible increase in disease burden over time or differences in farm management practices.

In this study, dairy farms with poor management had a greater risk (54.5%) of developing the disease than those with good management (8.3%). This could be due to poor housing design, inadequate ventilation, and insufficient feed, which may increase the likelihood ofM. bovisinfection spreading on dairy farms [11]. Similarly, previous studies have reported a higher prevalence of TB on farms with poor management conditions in Addis Ababa (66.7%), Dilla (26.5%), and Tigray (25.5%) [13,16,36].

The disease was also more prevalent in adults than in young and older cattle, which might be due to the low immune status in young cattle and immune depression in older cattle. Calves are born immunocompetent, their immune systems are not fully mature, and they rely heavily on passive immunity from colostrum in the early days of life. This contradicts previous reports [13,37], where the prevalence increased from adult to old cattle in Addis Ababa and western Ethiopia. In some cases, the infection may not develop in young animals, but owing to increased exposure time as they age, it can become more likely [1,3,19,38,39].

In this study,M. boviswas detected more in exotic breeds (9.9%) than in local crossbreeds (2.2%). This observation aligns with earlier studies conducted in Tigray and other parts of Ethiopia, which reported higher prevalence rates ofM. bovisin exotic breeds specifically 11.5% and 14.8% in Tigray, and 9.6% in southern Ethiopia [11,16]. A possible explanation is that genetically improved cattle are more vulnerable to infections because they are often kept under intensive or semi-intensive production systems, where they are more likely to experience poor housing conditions and suffer from inadequate or imbalanced nutrition. In contrast, local crossbreeds are believed to be better adapted to the local agro-ecological conditions and more resilient to diseases, which could help explain the observed differences in prevalence between the breeds.

M. boviswas also more common in cattle with poor body condition (11.6%) compared to those with good body condition (3%). Animals in poor condition are especially vulnerable because they have weakened immune systems, creating a conducive environment for the spread ofM. bovisinfection and the onset of disease [18].

Surveys assessing dairy farm owners’ and workers’ knowledge of Mycobacterium bovis and its zoonotic transmission remain limited. In this study, only 20% of farmers were aware of the disease, and just 32% suspected it could be transmitted to humans. These figures align with previous studies reporting similarly low awareness levels: 29.7% in Dilla, 30.8% in Mekelle, and 34.3% in Bahir Dar [11,16,40]. This consistent gap highlights a critical weakness in public health education and communication efforts related to zoonotic TB.

The low level of awareness poses a serious risk, particularly given that 70% of respondents reported consuming raw milk a known route of transmission forM. bovis. Lack of knowledge hinders early detection, encourages risky practices, and undermines control strategies for bovine TB. Consequently, this not only endangers human health but also contributes to economic losses due to reduced animal productivity, increased culling, and potential trade barriers. Public health interventions must prioritize education campaigns targeting farmers and rural communities to reduce the zoonotic transmission of BTB.

Among the 30 households interviewed, three had TB cases among farm owners or workers alongside tuberculin-positive cattle, suggesting potential zoonotic transmission possibly through raw milk consumption or aerosol exposure. A similar trend was observed in Mekelle, where 10.8% (13/120) of individuals tested TB positive [11]. These findings emphasize the need to strengthen the “One Health” approach, integrating veterinary and human health surveillance to identify, track, and mitigateM. bovistransmission across species. It may emphasize the role ofM. bovistransmission from cattle to humans, possibly through the consumption of raw milk or inhalation of contaminated aerosols [41,42]. The proportion of BTB among total human TB cases is influenced by several factors, including the prevalence of BTB in cattle, dietary habits, socio-economic status, standards of food hygiene, and the effectiveness of medical prevention measures in place [43].

BTB infection in humans is often associated with extra-pulmonary TB, with the occurrence of M.bovisinfection being directly related to its prevalence in cattle [44]. Furthermore,M. bovisinfection in humans presents unique challenges for treatment and recovery, asM. bovisis naturally resistant to pyrazinamide [45,46], one of the four main drugs in the standard first-line anti TB regimen [47].

In this study, the overall prevalence ofM. bovisinfection in dairy cattle was 7.1% (17/240) based on CIDT results, with a slightly higher rate observed in Mekelle (7.5%) compared to Wukro (6.3%). Milk culture revealed a lower infection rate of 4.1% (5/140), with 2.3% in Mekelle and 5.8% in Wukro. Awareness of the zoonotic transmission of BTB was generally poor, as only 20% of respondents recognized that it could be transmitted to humans. Among farm workers, 32% believed TB could spread through raw food, 26% through shared living spaces, and 30% through direct contact. Additionally, 70% of participants reported regularly consuming raw or unpasteurized milk. Increased infection rates were associated with larger herds, poor farm management, exotic cattle breeds, animals in poor body condition, adult cattle, and milk collected from tuberculin-positive animals. These findings highlight a serious public health concern, as close human–animal interaction, widespread consumption of raw milk, and low awareness of BTB contribute to the risk of zoonotic transmission in the region. To minimize this risk, it is crucial to implement mandatory testing and certification of cattle before inter-farm movement, while the regional agricultural bureau should strictly regulate the transfer of BTB positive animals. Moreover, sustained public education campaigns are essential to raise community awareness on BTB transmission pathways, safe milk handling practices, and the importance of managing infected animals properly. For policymakers, this underscores the urgent need for coordinated control measures, including enforcement of testing protocols and community outreach programs, to curb the spread ofM. bovisand protect both animal and public health.

As a cross-sectional study, this research provides only a snapshot of the prevalence ofM. bovisinfection and associated risk factors among dairy cattle at a specific point in time. As such, it cannot establish causality or capture the dynamics of disease transmission over time. The determination of cattle age relied on owner recall, which may be inaccurate, particularly on farms lacking proper records, introducing potential misclassification bias that could affect associations with age-related infection risk. Although the CIDT is a standard diagnostic tool, the interpretation of doubtful reactors introduces uncertainty, potentially leading to inaccurate prevalence estimates. In addition, the study focused on specific locations, Mekelle and Wukro, which may limit the generalizability of findings to other regions with different farming systems or epidemiological conditions. Furthermore, different herd size thresholds were used for farm selection in Mekelle (> 20 cows) and Wukro (> 10 cows) based on local herd demographics. While this was necessary to ensure adequate sampling of high-risk farms in both areas, it may affect direct comparisons of prevalence between the two towns.

Our sincere gratitude goes to the National Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Center (NAHDIC) for providing us with a PPD antigen for the tuberculin test, and to all staff members of the Microbiology Laboratory of NAHDIC for their help and cooperation during laboratory work.
