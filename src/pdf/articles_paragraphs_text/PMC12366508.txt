Magnolia buenaventurensisÁ.J.Pérez & E.Rea 2023 is a newly described, endemic, and endangered species of the southwest Ecuadorian Andes mountains. Sequencing and characterizing its plastid genome will help clarify its relationship to other NeotropicalMagnoliaL. 1753. species. The plastid genome is 159,782 bp in length and includes 131 genes, 86 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 37 transfer RNAs (tRNA), and eight ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions. Phylogenetic analysis confirms the species’ taxonomic classification in the sectionTalauma(Juss.) Baill 1866 and its close relationship toMagnolia gilbertoi(Lozano) Govaerts 1996 from Colombia, which belongs to the same section. However, the phylogenetic relationship shows low bootstrap support.

TheMagnoliagenus comprises approximately 300 species with a disjointed distribution in America and Asia (Xie et al.2022). In the Neotropics, it is found in tropical cloud forests along the Andes mountains, the Chocó biogeographic region and the Amazon region (Vázquez-García et al.2013). According to the latest classification by Wang et al. (2020), there are two taxonomic sections located in this region:SplendentesDandy ex J.A.Vázquez 1994 andTalauma. SectionSplendentesis characterized by 1) stipules free from the petiole and 2) stamens with a long connective appendage embedded in the gynecium. SectionTalaumahas stipules adnate or free to the petiole and lacks a connective appendage (Pérez et al.2016; Wang et al.2020). Ecuador hosts 24 knownMagnoliaspecies, with 17 being endemic. One species is shared with Colombia, whereas six are shared with Peru. EcuadorianMagnoliaspecies are distributed across four main areas: the Choco-tropical forest, Andes slopes, Amazon-tropical forest, and Cordillera del Cóndor. The increased number of described species in the last ten years is attributed to eight additional Ecuadorian species described through collecting expeditions and the taxonomic revision of herbarium collections (Vázquez-García et al.2015,2016,2017,2018; Pérez et al.2016,2023; Arroyo et al.2019).

We recently described a new species,Magnolia buenaventurensis, from the southwestern slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes.M. buenaventurensisis a narrow endemic known only from its type locality in the Reserva Buenaventura, managed by the Jocotoco Foundation, in El Oro Province (Figure 1). The species is considered Critically Endangered (CR), with eight individuals identified at the time of discovery (Pérez et al.2023); currently, more than 30 individuals have been located. Here, we sequence and assemble the complete plastid genome and preliminarily assess the species’ phylogenetic relationship with other representative NeotropicalMagnolia.

DNA samples were collected from the voucher Pérez et al. 11777 deposited in the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador Herbarium (QCA), Quito, Ecuador, with the voucher barcode number QCA246372 (URL:https://bioweb.puce.edu.ec/QCA/Contact: Álvaro Pérez,ajperezc@puce.edu.ec). The leaves were collected following the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) research policies for species at risk of extinction. The individual tree is located in the Buenaventura Reserve, Fundación Jocotoco, at an elevation of 1300–1400 m in the El Oro province (03°33′54.7″S, 79°46′47.5″W).

DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were performed at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL, USA). DNA was extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Plant Pro kit with minor modifications. 100 mg of tissue was lysed in 1 mL of Buffer CD1 at 65 °C with constant agitation at 1000 rpm using a ThermoMixer. The lysate was then vortexed at maximum speed for 10 min, after which the manufacturer’s protocol was continued. Finally, 55 µL of Buffer EB was dispensed onto the center of the spin-column membrane and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5 min before centrifugation to collect the eluate. DNA was tested for purityviaspectrophotometry and quantified by Qubit dsDNA Broad Range. A PCR-free sequencing library was constructed using Illumina’s TruSeq DNA PCR-Free LT Library Preparation Kit and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with paired-end 150 nt reads. Reads were trimmed and quality filtered using fastp (Chen et al.2018).

Plastid genome assembly was performed with GetOrganelle with default settings and the entire plastome sequence ofMagnolia denudataDesr. 1792 (JX280394) as a seed (Jin et al.2020). Sequencing depth and coverage results were plotted following Ni et al. (2023). The plastome was annotated with Plastid Genome Annotator withMagnolia megaphylla(H.H. Hu & W.C. Cheng) V.S. Kumar 2006 (MF990567) as a reference (Qu et al.2019). The plastid genome map was visualized using Chloroplast Genome Viewers (CPGView) (Liu et al.2023). The complete annotated genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank under the accession numberPQ303609.1. To evaluate the phylogenetic relationship of the newly describedM. buenaventurensisto other Neotropical species, we included 19 plastome sequences of other NeotropicalMagnoliaspecies from NCBI GenBank in the phylogenetic analysis;Liriodendron tulipiferaL. 1753 was used as the outgroup. Entire plastid genomes were aligned by MAFFT (Katoh and Standley2013), and IQ-TREE 2 was used to construct the phylogeny with 1000 bootstraps under a TVM+F + I + R3 model (Kalyaanamoorthy et al.2017; Hoang et al.2018; Minh et al.2020).

The plastid genome ofM. buenaventurensisis a circular molecule 159,782 bp in length, conforming to the standard quadripartite structure (Figure 2). The average sequence depth is 3358× (Figure S1). A Large Single-Copy (LSC) region of 87,987 bp is flanked by two inverted repeated regions (IRs) of 26,517 bp; the Small Single-Copy (SSC) region is 18,761 bp. The genome’s GC content is 39.3% (Figure 2), comprising 131 genes, of which 113 are single-copy and 16 are in IRs. Eighty-six protein-coding genes (PCGs), 37 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and eight ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions were identified. Among these genes,rps16,atpF,rpoC1,petB,rpl2,ndhB, andndhAeach possess a single intron. In contrast,ycf3andclpPhave two introns, while the trans-splicing generps12contains three (Figure S2). The phylogenetic analysis included other NeotropicalMagnoliaspecies clustered into two clades representingSplendentesandTalaumasections.M. buenaventurensisis positioned within the sectionTalaumaand is closely related toM. gilbertoi(Figure 3).

Plastome genome map ofMagnolia buenaventurensisrepresented in six tracks. From the center outward, the first track shows the dispersed repeats, colored red for direct and green for palindromic repeats. The second and third tracks show the long and short tandem repeats, respectively. The fourth track shows the plastid structure: small single-copy (SSC), inverted repeat (IRA and IRB), and large single-copy (LSC) regions. The amount of GC content is represented in the fifth track. The sixth track shows cycle genes that were transcribed in a counterclockwise direction, and genes on the outer cycle are transcribed in a clockwise direction. The genes are color-coded by function according to the figure legend.

The plastid structure ofM. buenaventurensisis similar in gene length, orientation, number of genes, PCG, tRNA, and rRNA to the other species of the Magnoliaceae family (Shen et al.2018; Wang et al.2020; Guzmán-Díaz et al.2022). The ML tree topology was highly supported and corresponded to previous studies, which also found thatMagnoliaspecies from the Neotropics cluster within the sectionsSplendentesandTalauma(Wang et al.2020). According to the phylogenetic tree proposed by Aldaba Núñez et al. (2024), our sample ofM. buenaventurensiscould be placed within the southern clade of the sect.Talaumasubsect.Talauma, which also includes species from South America and the Caribbean. Furthermore,M. buenaventurensisis sister toM. gilbertoi(although with relatively low bootstrap support, 70%) from west-central Colombia. Although our phylogenetic placement supports the current taxonomic classification ofM. buenaventuresisin theTalaumasection (Pérez et al.2023), our population is isolated in the western Andes, where future studies into its origin may unravel patterns of diversification along the Andes.

The plastid genome sequence presented here confirms the identity ofM. buenaventuresisas a distinct new species. This research represents a multi-institutional effort to unravel the evolutionary patterns of Magnoliaceae in the American tropics and provides a foundation for future conservation initiatives ofMagnoliaspecies in Ecuador.
