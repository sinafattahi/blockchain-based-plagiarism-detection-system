Food-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered a novel therapeutic approach for osteoporosis. However, their efficacy in treating osteoporosis remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to preliminarily evaluate and explore the effects of food-derived EVs in animal models of osteoporosis.

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for preclinical studies on food-derived EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis, up to November 25, 2024. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of food-derived EVs on bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation/marrow thickness (Tb.Sp), trabecular number (Tb.N), and serum bone turnover markers in osteoporosis animal models.

Six studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The results showed that food-derived EVs contributed to increases in BMD and bone mass markers (BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Tb.N), while promoting the expression of bone formation markers (OPG and PINP) and reducing the expression of bone resorption markers (TRACP 5b and β-CTX). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the stability of the pooled effect sizes.

The present meta-analysis suggested that food-derived EVs could improve BMD and bone mass in animal models of osteoporosis. This positive effect may be attributed to the promotion of bone formation mediated by the upregulation of osteogenic markers and the inhibition of bone resorption mediated by the downregulation of osteoclastic markers. Moreover, it is necessary to conduct studies with larger sample sizes and using other animal models to provide important insights for clinical trials.

Osteoporosis is the most common systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mineral density and the deterioration of bone tissue microstructure, which increases the risk of fractures [1,2]. With the growing global trend of population aging, osteoporosis affects over 200 million people worldwide [3]. Complications associated with osteoporosis cause significant suffering, substantially reduce patients’ quality of life, and increase rates of disability and mortality, placing a heavy burden on families and societies globally [4,5].

In clinical practice, current anti-osteoporosis medications primarily function by either enhancing bone formation through osteoblast stimulation or reducing bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts. Typical bone resorption inhibitors include estrogens, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin, while bone formation-promoting agents encompass parathyroid hormone analogs [6]. However, long-term clinical observations have revealed limitations and potential adverse side effects associated with both bone resorption inhibitors and bone formation drugs, including femoral and mandibular fractures as well as esophageal disorders [7,8]. For osteoporosis-related fractures, surgical procedures such as vertebral augmentation can repair fractures and alleviate local pain but may be accompanied by adverse effects like infections, embolism, and hematomas [9,10]. As alternatives to existing clinical drugs for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, natural bioactive compounds have garnered considerable research interest.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bound membrane vesicles containing diverse cellular metabolic information, which can facilitate transmembrane communication and signal transduction between plant, microbial, and animal cells [11,12]. In recent years, EVs have been successfully isolated from various edible sources, including animal products [13] (e.g., pork, milk), plants [14,15] (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains), and microorganisms such as probiotics [16]. These EVs naturally transport a range of bioactive molecules from their parental cells, including functional proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, flavonoids, and metabolites [17]. Remarkably, EVs can traverse the gastrointestinal tract in an intact form, facilitating the direct absorption of their bioactive components into the bloodstream and their subsequent distribution to target tissues without significant degradation [18]. Studies have reported that orally administered natural food-derived EVs exhibit multiple biological effects, including anti-cancer [19], anti-colitis [20], hepatoprotective [21], gut homeostasis regulation [22], and bone health improvement [23]. For example, Go et al. [24] found that milk-derived EVs promote the differentiation and proliferation of Saos-2 cells by upregulating the expression of key osteogenic transcription factors RUNX2 and Osterix. Another study confirmed that milk-derived EVs may serve as potential anti-osteoporotic agents by increasing the number of osteocytes [25]. However, there is still a lack of summarized evidence on the preliminary efficacy of food-derived EVs in treating osteoporotic models, particularly regarding changes in bone mineral density (BMD), bone mass, and trabecular microarchitecture in animal models.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of food-derived EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis in preclinical animal models, with the aim of supporting further large-sample preclinical studies and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of food-derived EVs.

The study protocol was predefined in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria [26]. It was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the identifier CRD42020159.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Studies involving osteoporosis animal models, with no restrictions on modeling methods or animal species; (2) Research using any food-derived EVs as an intervention; (3) Any study designed as a controlled trial, including a placebo control group; (4) Reported outcomes including at least one primary measure: BMD, bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation/marrow thickness (Tb.Sp), or trabecular number (Tb.N); (5) Studies published in English.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Studies using EVs from non-food sources for the treatment of osteoporosis; (2) Preclinical studies lacking animal models or outcomes; (3) Studies not involving animal models of osteoporosis; (4) Studies without primary outcomes or with data that could not be fully extracted; (5) Studies unrelated to the application of SC-EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis; (6) Non-comparative study types such as reviews, case reports, meta-analyses, letters to the editor, and commentaries.

The study selection process was conducted by two independent authors. First, the retrieved literature was imported into EndNote 20, and duplicate records were removed. Next, a second round of screening was performed based on titles and abstracts to preliminarily exclude irrelevant studies and inappropriate study types. Finally, the full texts were reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify studies for the final meta-analysis. Any disagreements during the inclusion and exclusion process were resolved through discussion with a third author.

Two independent authors extracted data from the included studies and cross-checked the data for accuracy and confirmation. The following data were collected: (1) General information: First author, country, and publication year; (2) Animal characteristics: Species, body weight, age, and modeling method; (3) EVs characteristics: Source, isolation and purification methods, diameter, concentration, administration method, administration frequency, and treatment duration; (4) Outcome measures: BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, Tb.N, OPG, PINP, TRACP 5b, β-CTX, and calcium levels in serum. For studies that did not provide statistical data, Origin 2021 was used to extract data from statistical graphs, calculating the mean and standard deviation.

To evaluate the efficacy of food-derived EVs on osteoporosis, the primary outcomes included BMD and bone microstructural parameters (BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, and Tb.Th) to explore the effects of EVs on bone mass and bone strength. The secondary outcomes included serum bone turnover markers (OPG, PINP, TRACP 5b, β-CTX, and calcium levels in serum).

The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool [27], designed for systematic reviews of animal experiments. The SYRCLE tool evaluates the following domains: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias. The results of the risk assessment were classified as high risk, low risk, or unclear risk. Two authors independently conducted the assessments, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third author.

In this meta-analysis, the combined effect size is expressed as the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among the study results was quantified using theI2statistic and theχ2test. Specifically,I2> 50% indicated significant heterogeneity [28]. A random-effects model was applied whenI2> 50%, whereas a fixed-effects model was used otherwise. For studies with significant heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the sources of heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the results. Publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and Egger’s test. AP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed using RevMan 5.2.7 (The Cochrane Collaboration) and Stata 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA), respectively.

The study selection process is illustrated in Fig.1. A total of 930 potential studies were initially identified. After removing duplicates (N= 273) using EndNote 20, 657 records remained. Subsequently, titles and abstracts were screened, leading to the exclusion of irrelevant studies, non-controlled studies, and non-English publications, leaving 56 articles for further review. After downloading and thoroughly reviewing the full texts, 50 articles were excluded due to the following reasons: (1) Use of non-food-derived EVs (N= 33); (2) In vitro studies (N= 10); (3) Absence of primary outcome measures (N= 7). Finally, 6 studies [23,29–33] were included in the meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of food-derived EVs in treating osteoporosis.

In total, six studies published in the past five years (2020 to 2024) were included. Among them, four studies were conducted in China [30–33], and two studies were conducted in Korea [23,29]. The detailed characteristics of the animal models are summarized in Table1. A total of 92 osteoporosis animal models were included in the analysis: 46 animals received food-derived EVs treatment, while the remaining 46 animals received a placebo. Five studies used C57BL/7 mice as the osteoporosis model, and one study used SD rats. Five studies utilized female animals, while one study included male animals. Two studies reported animal weight data. For the modeling method, five studies induced osteoporosis through bilateral ovariectomy (OVX), and the remaining study used hormone induction.

The specific characteristics of food-derived EVs are summarized in Table2. Two studies sourced EVs from oral milk, while the remaining four studies sourced them from yam, pueraria lobata, scallop mantle, and oyster mantle. All six studies used ultracentrifugation to isolate EVs. The particle size was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), with sizes ranging from 75.7 to 328 nm. As summarized in Supplementary Table1, all studies except one employed oral administration, with the remaining study using intraperitoneal injection. Regarding dosing frequency, four studies administered EVs once a day, while the other two studies used a schedule of three times a week and once every three days, respectively. For treatment duration, five studies had a treatment period of ≥ 4 weeks, while one study only administered treatment for 15 days.

BMD results were reported in all six studies. BV/TV was reported in five studies, while Tb.Th and Tb.Sp were reported in four studies, and Tb.N was reported in two studies. For serum bone turnover markers, serum OPG was reported in three studies, and PINP, β-CTX, TRACP 5b, and calcium levels in serum were each reported in two studies.

The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the SYRCLR's RoB tool (Figs.2a and b). No study demonstrated a low risk of bias across all items. None of the studies provided detailed descriptions of the specific methods for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of implementation, outcome assessment blinding, or random outcome evaluation. Two studies [29,31] reported the body weight and age of the included animals, which were considered to have a low risk of bias for baseline characteristics. Three studies [23,32,33]reported randomization of animal allocation. One study [29] did not specify whether all animals were included in the final outcome analysis, leading to an unclear risk of bias. Additionally, all studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias regarding selective reporting, and no other sources of bias were identified. Overall, all included studies presented an unclear risk of bias.

The results of the meta-analysis showed that food-derived EVs significantly increased BMD (SMD  3.58, 95% CI 1.48 to 5.68,P< 0.00001), suggesting a promoting effect of EVs on BMD (Fig.3). However, due to significant heterogeneity (I2= 89% > 50%), the functional results of EVs on bone strength should be interpreted with caution. Regarding bone microstructure, EVs demonstrated a promoting effect on bone mass and trabecular microstructure, as evidenced by significant increase in BV/TV (SMD  4.10, 95% CI 2.18 to 6.02,P< 0.0001) (Fig.4a), Tb.Th (SMD  2.12, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.81,P< 0.00001) (Fig.4b), and Tb.N (SMD  4.92, 95% CI 3.36 to 6.47,P< 0.00001) (Fig.4d), as well as a significant decrease in Tb.Sp (SMD  − 2.80, 95% CI − 4.34 to − 1.26,P= 0.0004) (Fig.4c). These results suggested that food-derived EVs may have a beneficial effect on BMD, bone mass, and trabecular microstructure in osteoporosis models.

Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of food-derived EVs on osteoporosis through hematological indicators. The meta-analysis results showed that EVs increased serum levels of OPG (SMD  2.65, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.58,P< 0.00001) and PINP (SMD  3.29, 95% CI 2.12 to 4.45,P< 0.00001), while decreased the levels of TRACP 5b (SMD  − 3.86, 95% CI − 5.18 to − 2.55,P< 0.00001) and β-CTX (SMD  − 3.81, 95% CI − 6.02 to − 1.60,P= 0.0007) (Figs.5a–d). However, EVs showed no effect on serum levels of calcium (Fig.5e). In summary, food-derived EVs may enhance osteoblast activity and suppress osteoclast activity, thereby promoting bone formation while reducing bone loss.

Given the significant heterogeneity in animal models and EV characteristics, subgroup analyses were conducted to further explore potential sources of heterogeneity. For BMD, the subgroup analyses indicated that factors such as animal species (C57 mice and SD rats), sex (female and male), age (≥ 8 weeks and < 8 weeks), modeling methods (bilateral ovariectomy and hormone induction), EV sources (oral milk and other sources), administration routes (oral and intraperitoneal injection), intervention frequencies (once per week and other frequencies), and treatment durations (> 4 weeks and ≤ 4 weeks) were not significant contributors to the heterogeneity observed in BMD outcomes (Supplementary Figs. 1–8). Similarly, for BV/TV and Tb.Th, subgroup analyses suggested that animal species, intervention route, frequency, and treatment duration were likely not major sources of heterogeneity (Supplementary Figs. 9–16). In addition, differences in animal species and administration routes did not appear to contribute to the heterogeneity in Tb.Sp (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18). Due to the limited number of included studies, these subgroup analysis results should be interpreted with caution.

Due to the significant heterogeneity in the pooled effect sizes of the main outcomes (BMD, BV/TV, and Tb.Sp), we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the meta-analysis results. The findings indicated that after excluding individual studies, the magnitude of the pooled effect size did not change significantly, and the direction remained consistent (Figs.6a–c). Publication bias for BMD and BV/TV was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Obvious asymmetry was observed in the funnel plots, and the results of Egger's test indicated that potential publication bias might exist for these two key indicators (P< 0.05) (Fig.7a–b and Supplementary Table 2). Given the limited number of included studies, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Overall, the results suggest that the meta-analyses for BMD, BV/TV, and Tb.Sp are generally stable.

Currently, clinical drugs for osteoporosis treatment mainly include bone formation-promoting agents and bone resorption inhibitors [34]. However, limited efficacy and adverse side effects have prompted the exploration of novel anti-osteoporosis therapies [7,8]. EVs from various sources have shown potential in reducing bone loss associated with osteoporosis. Dietary patterns are closely related to osteoporosis risk; for example, higher seafood consumption has been associated with a lower incidence of osteoporosis [35,36]. In recent years, increasing research has focused on exploring natural food-derived EVs as alternative therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis. For example, Dong et al. [37] demonstrated that milk-derived EVs significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cell lines in vitro and exhibit favorable reparative effects in a murine calvarial defect model. Additionally, another study found that milk-derived EVs markedly enhanced osteoblast differentiation and played a positive role in bone remodeling [24]. In this context, we collected preliminary evidence on the efficacy of food-derived EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis and conducted a meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that food-derived EVs can improve BMD, bone mass, and trabecular microarchitecture in osteoporotic models, accompanied by upregulation of serum bone formation markers and downregulation of bone resorption markers. These findings provide initial evidence to support large-scale future investigations into the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of food-derived EVs. However, due to the limited number of studies, further high-quality research is essential to confirm the effectiveness and safety of food-derived EVs.

It is worth noting that the risk of bias assessment for the included studies revealed multiple instances of unclear bias risk. For example, none of the studies provided detailed descriptions of the random sequence generation and allocation concealment processes, indicating an unclear risk of selection bias. Additionally, all studies lacked detailed descriptions of blinding methods (perfomation and detection), leading to uncertain detection bias. Furthermore, significant heterogeneity was observed in the pooled effect sizes of key outcomes, including BMD, BV/TV, and Tb.Sp. This heterogeneity may stem from differences in animal models (species, age, and modeling methods) and EV characteristics (source of food, administration routes, dosing frequency, and duration). The results of the subgroup analyses based on the above characteristics showed that heterogeneity was not reduced within subgroups, suggesting that these factors may not be significant contributors to the observed heterogeneity. Although we could not identify the sources of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis indicated the relative stability of the pooled effect sizes.

Our analysis suggested that food-derived EVs upregulated the expression of serum bone formation markers while downregulating bone resorption markers. At the microstructural level, this may be reflected in promoted bone mass and trabecular microstructure. Mechanistically, EVs may restore the balance between bone formation and resorption by suppressing osteoclast activity and enhancing osteoblast activity. Therefore, restoring the balance between bone formation and resorption is an effective strategy for treating osteoporosis. Multiple signaling pathways are involved in the potential mechanisms of food-derived EVs for osteoporosis treatment, including RUNX2, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin. Scallop mantle-derived EVs have been shown to promote osteoblast differentiation and mineralization via the RUNX2 pathway [32]. Another study found that pueraria lobata-derived EVs enhance the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and upregulate the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and proteins, such as RUNX2, OPN, and OCN [30]. Moreover, Hwang et al. [23] discovered that yam-derived EVs enhance bone formation in osteoporotic mice, with RNA sequencing analysis revealing that EVs regulate osteogenic activity through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Hu et al. [33] reported that oyster mantle-derived EVs promote osteoblast differentiation via the PI3K/Akt/β-catenin signaling axis and inhibit osteoclast differentiation through the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby coordinating bone resorption and formation.

Additionally, different routes and dosages of EVs administration may influence their pharmacokinetics in vivo, including biodistribution, accumulation, and metabolism. Most previous studies have employed mouse models to investigate the pharmacokinetics of EVs [38], with the liver and kidneys being the primary sites of rapid accumulation following EV administration, and occasionally the lungs also showing initial uptake [39,40]. Regarding different administration routes, Wiklander et al. [41] administered EVs to mice via intravenous, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal injections and found that compared to intravenous delivery, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration led to lower EV uptake in the spleen and liver, but higher uptake in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. In a non-human primate model, another study detected EVs in the liver and spleen within one hour after intravenous injection and reported that the circulation time of EVs in plasma was longer than previously observed in mice [42]. Among the six studies included in this meta-analysis, only one employed intraperitoneal administration, which may have facilitated rapid gastrointestinal uptake and subsequent effects, while the remaining five studies all used oral administration. As food-derived EVs are mostly administered orally, special attention should be given to their absorption and bioavailability in vivo. Food-derived EVs can carry various bioactive molecules from their parent organisms, activate intercellular signaling pathways, and penetrate the intestinal mucosa to reach host cells [43,44]. Studies have reported that orally administered food-derived EVs cross the epithelial barrier through diffusion and endocytosis, enter the bloodstream, and subsequently distribute to various organs and tissues [17,45]. Since bone is one of the most vascularized tissues in the human body, orally administered EVs can reach bone tissue via the circulatory system [46]. Regarding the in vivo metabolic evaluation of orally administered food-derived EVs, Hu et al. [32] observed that scallop mantle-derived EVs retained their osteogenic activity even after passing through the gastrointestinal digestive system and provided evidence of their accumulation in mouse bone tissue. Additionally, studies have shown that EVs derived from milk [47] and yam [23] also maintain their activity after gastrointestinal digestion. These findings suggest that food-derived EVs, when administered orally, can maintain osteogenic activity before reaching bone tissue. However, the specific mechanisms by which food-derived EVs maintain their activity within the digestive system require further investigation.

Currently, there is limited research on the impact of EVs dosage on their biodistribution and metabolism. Following low and medium doses (< 1.0 × 1010particles/g) of EVs administration, accumulation primarily occurs in the liver of mice, whereas higher doses (1.5 × 1010particles/g) result in reduced hepatic accumulation [41]. Moreover, due to the lower body surface area-to-weight ratio and metabolic rate in higher-order animal species, lower doses are generally required to achieve similar effects in larger animals [48]. Interestingly, one study observed that repeated intravenous injections of EVs significantly shortened their circulation time in vivo, which may be associated with immune responses [42]. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate, across different species, the biodistribution and metabolic fate of repeated and high-dose EVs administration, as well as the influence of immune responses on their pharmacokinetics.

Currently, common animal models for osteoporosis include the OVX-induced model and the glucocorticoid-induced model. Among the six studies analyzed, five employed the OVX-induced osteoporosis model, while one utilized the glucocorticoid-induced model. Mechanistically, the OVX model primarily induces bone loss by surgically removing both ovaries, resulting in estrogen deficiency in the animals [49]. As a classical model, the OVX model effectively mimics postmenopausal osteoporosis in women. However, the rapid decline of estrogen levels in OVX animals does not fully align with the clinical scenario, where the decrease in estrogen after menopause is typically a gradual process. This discrepancy limits the clinical translatability of the OVX model. The glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis model could simulate clinical drug-induced bone loss, though it also presents certain differences from clinical conditions [50]. Subgroup analysis based on different modeling approaches showed that food-derived EVs consistently improved BMD in OVX-induced models. Nevertheless, further validation in osteoporosis models across more species is still required in future research.

The evaluation of the safety of orally administered food-derived EVs is a fundamental prerequisite for successful clinical translation. Given their origin from food, the safety of orally administered food-derived EVs is generally expected. However, Li et al. [51], in their review of food-derived EVs, highlighted the potential negative impact of miRNAs contained in EVs on human health. In recent studies, oyster mantle-derived EVs demonstrated favorable safety profiles, with in vivo biocompatibility assessments showing no evidence of nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity [33]. Similarly, another in vivo toxicity evaluation revealed that orally administered yam-derived EVs did not cause damage or toxicity to the heart, liver, brain, kidneys, or lungs [23]. Although current results suggest that orally administered food-derived EVs are safe, further extensive clinical trials are still required.

This meta-analysis has certain limitations. Firstly, the number of included studies and the sample size of animal models are limited. Future research with larger sample sizes is needed to validate the beneficial effects of food-derived EVs in treating osteoporosis. Secondly, the heterogeneity in animal species and the characteristics of EVs may affect the stability of the analysis results, highlighting the need for more standardized experimental designs and implementation processes in future studies. Thirdly, the animal models used primarily limited to rats and mice, which poses challenges for the applicability of findings to human diseases. Prior to conducting clinical trials, it is crucial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions using large animal models and non-human primates. Lastly, the use of software to extract data from statistical graphs may introduce deviations from the original data.

This meta-analysis suggested that, compared to placebo, food-derived EVs could enhance BMD and bone quality, potentially by promoting the expression of bone formation markers and inhibiting the expression of bone resorption markers. These findings provide preliminary evidence and mechanistic insights supporting the use of food-derived EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis in animal models. However, further preclinical studies are needed to address the standardization and safety of animal models and EV characteristics.
