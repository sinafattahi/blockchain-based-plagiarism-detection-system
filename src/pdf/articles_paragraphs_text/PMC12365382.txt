This study investigates the geographic disparities in the distribution of sleep surgeons in the United States, focusing on the influence of regional sociodemographic characteristics on the proximity of specialized care for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) surgery.

This study is a cross‐sectional observational geospatial analysis of sleep surgeons practicing in the United States. We correlated geographic coordinates of sleep surgeons with sociodemographic data from the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau and the 2021 American Community Surveys. Multivariate Poisson regression analyses were used to examine predictors of sleep surgeon density and presence across ZIP Code Tabulation Areas.

Analysis included 205 sleep surgeons. The density of sleep surgeons was higher in urban and coastal areas. Sleep surgeons were also more likely to practice in locations with higher percentages of non‐citizen (AOR = 1.067,p< 0.001) and non‐White populations (AOR = 1.017,p< 0.001). Sleep surgeons were less likely to practice in areas with greater proportions of uninsured patients (AOR = 0.926,p< 0.001) and elderly patients (AOR = 0.964,p= 0.001).

Significant geographic and demographic disparities exist in the distribution of sleep surgeons, particularly marked by a scarcity of sleep surgeons in rural areas and fewer sleep surgeons in areas with larger elderly and uninsured populations. These disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to enhance access to specialized OSA care, especially in underserved areas. Effective strategies to address these inequalities are crucial for equitable healthcare delivery and improving health outcomes for OSA patients across the U.S.

This study looked at the significant distribution of sleep surgeons and sociodemographic factors associated with the presence of sleep surgeons in an area. Significant geographic and demographic disparities exist in the distribution of sleep surgeons, particularly marked by the scarcity of sleep surgeons in rural areas and fewer sleep surgeons in areas with larger elderly and uninsured populations. These disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to enhance access to specialized obstructive sleep apnea care, especially in underserved areas.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, is a significant public health concern given its capacity to cause an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excessive daytime sleepiness. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is the gold standard treatment for OSA, but long‐term compliance remains low [1]. For those unable to tolerate CPAP or other non‐surgical treatment options, sleep surgery is often considered. There is an increased demand for sleep surgeons with new procedures and technologies available for OSA treatment [2]. Despite some studies pointing toward an increasing number of otolaryngologists with subspecialty training, there still exists a paucity of otolaryngologists in many regions of the US, with an overrepresentation of otolaryngologists in larger U.S. cities [3]. This difference in distribution may indicate a potential access challenge for rural populations [3,4]. Most notably, access to care from otolaryngologists is most restricted in rural regions of America [5]. A gap in specialists trained to assess for CPAP alternatives and offer sleep surgery may impact access to sleep surgery in certain regions. CPAP compliance rates vary by region, with a lower proportion of compliance in non‐metropolitan areas indicating a potentially higher need for experts in the field of sleep surgery and sleep medicine in these areas [6]. Currently, there is no published study investigating sociodemographic characteristics related to the density of practicing otolaryngologists in the field of sleep surgery.

Further, the absolute number of otolaryngologists dedicated to OSA surgery is limited across the country [7]. This scarcity of sleep surgeons highlights the need for increased training and exposure in sleep medicine within otolaryngology and, more specifically, proper distribution of resources to train sleep surgeons in areas lacking providers.

These studies underscore the importance of addressing geographic and demographic disparities in the distribution of sleep surgeons. Our study aims to assess the impact of various sociodemographic characteristics and disparties due to the geographic distribution of sleep surgeons. We hypothesize that the geographic distribution of sleep surgeons will be centered in areas of higher overall socioeconomic status and that metropolitan areas will have a higher density of sleep surgeons relative to rural areas.

A list of otolaryngology‐head and neck surgery sleep surgeons specializing in OSA surgery across the United States was generated by identifying otolaryngologists who had listed sleep medicine as their specialty on the American Academy of Otolaryngology‐Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS) website as well as any US providers who were listed on the International Sleep Surgical Society (ISSS) member web page. We further identified more sleep surgeons by systematically reviewing the web pages of all academic otolaryngology programs in the United States for faculty listed as sleep surgeons. This resulted in obtaining data for 216 sleep surgeons throughout the US. This methodology was used instead of focusing on only sleep board certified Otolaryngologists because the number of otolaryngologists board certified in sleep medicine is likely too small to perform a meaningful geospatial analysis. Surgeons practicing in ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) with missing sociodemographic data were excluded for geospatial and statistical analysis.

Data extracted for each sleep surgeon encompassed legal names, practice addresses, practice ZIP codes, and practice states. We conducted a comparison between the ZIP codes and geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude) of each eligible sleep surgeon's practice address with data from the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau and the 2021 American Community Surveys (ACS). The choice of the 2020 DEC Demographic and Housing Characteristics survey was made due to its status as the most recent and comprehensive source of racial distribution information in the U.S. For other sociodemographic factors, such as unemployment levels, health insurance coverage, poverty levels, sex ratios, educational attainment, age, median household income, and citizenship status, we relied on data obtained from the 2021 ACS. Operating as a branch of the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACS conducts annual surveys of over 3.5 million households to collect sociodemographic information that informs policy and decision‐making.

All sleep surgeon‐related data was recorded using Microsoft Excel. Subsequently, each practice address was geocoded to its unique coordinates using the U.S. Census Bureau Geocoding website (https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/). Following the establishment of georeference points for each sleep surgeon's practice address, we employed QGIS geospatial information software (QGIS.org) to construct choropleth distribution maps. These maps displayed the practice address coordinates overlaid on U.S. counties and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Density distributions for all ZCTAs were derived from data extracted from the 2020 DEC Demographic and Housing Characteristics and the 2021 ACS. These choropleth maps were generated by plotting the point coordinates of each sleep surgeon on a U.S. population map. This stratification was based on various variables of interest.

We explored associations between the density of sleep surgeons per ZCTA population and sociodemographic variables of interest. Sociodemographic variables, sourced from the 2020 DEC Demographic and Housing Characteristics and the 2021 ACS, included race, citizenship status, median household income, poverty level, sex ratio, health insurance coverage, educational level, employment status, and age over 65 years. ZCTAs with any missing values for the above variables were excluded from the analysis, resulting in the inclusion of 29,158 ZCTAs out of a total of 33,774 within the entire database.

A multivariate Poisson regression model was created to identify the factors predicting the number of sleep surgeons present in a ZCTA. Poisson modeling was chosen for its ability to handle count data and to ascertain which predictor variables had a statistically significant impact on the response variable. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 27.0.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

A total of 205 sleep surgeons were included in the final geospatial and statistical analysis after removing 11 sleep surgeons located in ZCTAs with missing data. Figure1shows the distribution of sleep surgeons in the United States, where each red point corresponds to a distinct location where a sleep surgeon practices. Most sleep surgeons were located in urban areas. The greatest densities of sleep surgeons were in coastal areas, and the smallest densities of sleep surgeons were in the Central and Midwestern United States. Figure2presents the geospatial visualization with respect to the various demographic and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, in Figure2a, we observe the density of sleep surgeons in relation to the percent of the population without health insurance coverage. As expected, areas with the lowest health insurance coverage rates correspond to regions with high poverty levels (Figure2b). Figure2cshows the density of sleep surgeons concerning the percentage of the population identifying as non‐White, with the greatest densities of non‐White populations residing in the Southern and coastal regions. Lastly, Figure2ddepicts the density of sleep surgeons with relation to the percentage of the population aged 65 years or over, revealing a higher density of this demographic in the Midwestern and Northern US.

Table1demonstrates the univariate and multivariate Poisson Regression analysis comparing socioeconomic variables with the number of sleep surgeons in different ZCTAs. Most significantly, the percentage of non‐citizens had the highest positive association with the density of sleep surgeons, with an Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) of 1.067 (95% CI: 1.048–1.086,p< 0.001). Additionally, the percentage of the population being non‐White was another positive predictor for the number of sleep surgeons, with an AOR of 1.017 (95% CI: 1.010–1.024,p< 0.001). Significant negative predictors of sleep surgeon density included the percentage of the population without health insurance coverage, with an AOR of 0.926 (95% CI: 0.898–0.954,p< 0.001). Additionally, the percentage of the population that was 65 years and over was negatively associated with the number of sleep surgeons, with an AOR of 0.964 (95% CI: 0.943–0.986,p= 0.001).

Univariate and Multivariate Poisson regression of socioeconomic variables compared with number of sleep surgeons in a ZCTA.

The observed association between lower sleep surgeon density and a greater proportion of elderly individuals indicates that for each 1% increase in the population aged 65 and older, the likelihood of a sleep surgeon practicing in that area decreases by approximately 4% (AOR = 0.964,p= 0.001).

Our study elucidates the differences in the geographic distribution of sleep surgeons across the United States, with a pronounced concentration in metropolitan and coastal areas and a notable scarcity in rural regions. This pattern aligns with the broader issue of maldistribution of healthcare resources, where urban areas are better served than their rural counterparts [3,4]. These findings underscore inequities in access that potentially exacerbates health disparities between urban and rural populations.

The positive association of sleep surgeon density with higher percentages of non‐White and non‐citizen populations was also related to these populations concentrating in major metropolitan areas which has been shown in other otolaryngology subspecialties as well [8]. This may reflect the diverse demographic composition of urban populations [9]. Despite this, most studies of sleep surgery subjects include primarily white patients [10]. This geographic analysis cannot explain potential racial/ethnic barriers seen in sleep surgery care delivery [11].

The finding that areas with higher percentages of older populations have fewer sleep surgeons is particularly concerning given the increased prevalence of OSA with age, with more than half of people over 65 being at risk [12]. Untreated OSA in older patients is associated with an increased risk of dementia in addition to cardiovascular disease [13,14]. Fortunately, hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) therapy has emerged as an effective treatment option for elderly patients with OSA. The ADHERE study, a large prospective cohort study of HGNS patients, has shown that success rates with HGNS may be higher in older age groups [15]. Despite these advancements, the limited availability of sleep surgeons in areas with larger elderly populations suggests that significant barriers to accessing specialized care still exist for this vulnerable demographic. Several factors likely contribute to this pattern, including lower appeal for rural areas that usually have higher proportions of elderly patients, limited Medicare reimbursement levels, and differences in healthcare‐seeking behaviors amongst elderly individuals.

Our study also demonstrated that there are fewer sleep surgeons in areas with a higher uninsured population. The barriers in access to care for the uninsured population are multifactorial and often lead to delayed diagnoses and treatment as well as poorer health outcomes [16]. Studies in other surgical specialties have shown that type of insurance is an important factor in patients obtaining treatment, with many practices not accepting state‐sponsored insurance due to decreased reimbursement levels [17]. For OSA, prior studies similarly demonstrate that the chance of receiving a CPAP alternative is lower among patients without private insurance [18].

The concentration of sleep surgeons in urban and coastal areas likely reflects the broader trend of healthcare specialization clustering in regions with larger population centers and greater healthcare infrastructure densities [5]. This urban‐centric distribution creates a service vacuum in rural areas, where residents may face long travel times and limited access to specialized care. Such geographic differences in healthcare access are a critical public health concern, as they can lead to delayed diagnosis, treatment, and potentially poorer health outcomes for rural populations [19]. This disparity only serves to compound the already low levels of CPAP treatment and adherence in these regions [6]. Some reasons for the shortage of sleep surgeon access in rural areas could be a lack of health infrastructure to support sleep surgery programs as well as a lower desirability to live in areas far from urban centers for sleep surgeons.

It is important to address these geographical differences using a multifaceted approach. Increasing the number of training programs for sleep surgeons in underserved and rural areas is one potential strategy. Expanding rural healthcare loan forgiveness programs to include sleep surgeons could incentivize providers to practice in underserved areas. Additionally, leveraging telemedicine and mobile health units to extend the reach of specialized care into rural areas present promising avenues for mitigating geographic barriers [20]. Policy interventions aimed at improving insurance coverage and reducing out‐of‐pocket costs for sleep surgery could also play significant roles in enhancing access for vulnerable populations. An example of this could be increasing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for sleep surgery to help alleviate financial barriers for elderly and underserved patients. These types of policies can be supplemented with targeted efforts to increase the availability of specialized care in underserved areas, which would be a crucial step towards mitigating these disparities. Furthermore, easily accessible and readable educational material could help educate patients on the importance of OSA treatment and CPAP alternatives, including sleep surgery, which may be especially useful for elderly patients and patients living in rural areas. It is important to note that the findings from this geospatial analysis may be applicable to other subspecialties within otolaryngology or surgical fields where geographic disparities exist. Further research is needed to investigate trends among other specialized surgical disciplines.

This study has several limitations. First, the ACS, while being one of the most comprehensive and representative resources for data regarding sociodemographic and socioeconomic data in the United States, is limited to individuals who submit responses to the US Census Bureau. For this reason, certain ZCTAs may not have as complete data as others. ZCTA data, which, while useful for geographic analyses, has notable drawbacks in the context of rural health research. ZCTAs are designed to approximate ZIP codes for census reporting, but may not accurately represent sparsely populated rural areas where ZIP codes cover vast geographic regions with highly dispersed populations. This can lead to the underrepresentation of rural healthcare access challenges, as this data may obscure the true distance patients must travel to access a sleep surgeon.

Additionally, the exclusion of ZIP codes with missing data might skew the geographic distribution analysis, potentially underrepresenting certain regions. We also may have missed sleep surgeons with our search parameters, especially if otolaryngologists do not identify sleep surgery as their main subspecialty and/or are not members of the ISSS. Confounding sleep services provided by comprehensive otolaryngologists in the setting of adjusted odds ratios that are small and close to 1, as found in our study, could make it difficult to assess the true degree of disparity for sleep surgery access. Finally, since we used primarily databases of otolaryngologists to search for sleep surgeons, we are not accounting for maxillofacial surgeons who perform sleep surgery.

To improve future geospatial analyses of rural healthcare disparities, alternative data sources could provide higher‐resolution insights. One approach is to use Rural–Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes, which classify regions based on population density and commuting patterns, offering a more precise delineation of rural healthcare access. Additionally, another valuable data source is all‐payer claims databases, which aggregate healthcare utilization data across insurance types, allowing for a more patient‐centered approach to measuring access barriers in rural settings. Integrating these sources in future research could provide a more nuanced understanding of geographic disparities in sleep surgery access and inform targeted interventions to improve care delivery in underserved regions.

In conclusion, significant geographic and demographic differences in the distribution of sleep surgeons across the United States are present. Sleep surgeon distribution is reduced in rural areas and in areas with higher percentages of elderly and uninsured patients. Future research should aim to identify effective strategies to attract and retain specialized healthcare providers, particularly sleep surgeons, in these underserved areas. Additionally, exploring innovative solutions such as telemedicine and policy reforms could help bridge the urban–rural divide and enhance service delivery in remote locations. These efforts are essential to address the current inequities and ensure that all patients have access to necessary surgical care, regardless of their geographic location.
