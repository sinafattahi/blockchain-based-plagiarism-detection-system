Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a common pathological phenomenon during the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies suggest that macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in MIRI progression. However, whether quercetin mitigates MIRI by modulating macrophage polarization and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

The protective effects of quercetin against MIRI were assessed using TTC-Evans blue staining, echocardiography, and myocardial enzyme assays. Histological changes, including myocardial fibrosis, were evaluated via HE and Masson staining. Western blot, qPCR, and immunofluorescence were performed to analyze macrophage M1/M2 polarization. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were conducted to determine whether quercetin regulates M2 polarization through autophagy modulation.

Quercetin significantly reduced infarct size, improved cardiac function, and alleviated inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that quercetin downregulated M1 markers while upregulating M2 markers and enhancing IL-10 secretion. In vitro experiments further confirmed that quercetin promoted M2 macrophage polarization under H/R conditions, thereby attenuating cardiomyocyte injury through a paracrine mechanism. Mechanistically, quercetin facilitated autophagic flux by reducing the binding affinity between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, leading to enhanced M2 macrophage polarization, an effect partially reversed by 3-MA.

This study provides the first evidence that quercetin exerts cardioprotective effects in MIRI by promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, it elucidates a novel molecular mechanism in which quercetin regulates autophagy to drive M2 polarization, offering experimental support for quercetin as a potential therapeutic strategy for MIRI.

Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury (MIRI) is one of the primary causes of exacerbated cardiac damage following reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [1,2]. Its pathological mechanisms involve inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis. Among these, the inflammatory response plays a central role in the onset and progression of MIRI [3,4]. As key regulators of inflammation, macrophages are essential in myocardial repair. Studies have shown that macrophages can differentiate into M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes in response to microenvironmental signals [5–7]. M1 macrophages primarily release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, exacerbating tissue damage, whereas M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory factors like IL-10, promoting myocardial repair. Therefore, modulating macrophage polarization may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for MIRI.

In recent years, natural products have attracted much attention in the field of heart protection, among which Astragalus membranaceus, Rheum palmatum, and Ginsenoside have become research hotspots due to their extensive pharmacological activities [8]. Quercetin is an effective active ingredient in Astragalus membranaceus and a flavonoid widely found in fruits and vegetables, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and cardioprotective effects [9–13]. Previous studies indicate that quercetin mitigates myocardial ischemic injury by regulating the NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways [14,15]. However, whether quercetin improves MIRI by modulating macrophage polarization and its precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

Autophagy, a fundamental cellular survival mechanism, maintains cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged proteins and organelles. Recent studies suggest that autophagy activation plays a crucial role in M2 macrophage polarization [16,17], and the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 serves as a negative regulatory mechanism of autophagy [18,19]. Based on this, we hypothesize that quercetin may promote M2 macrophage polarization by modulating autophagy, thereby alleviating MIRI.

This study aims to investigate the role of quercetin in M2 macrophage polarization using both an in vivo MIRI model and an in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model. Furthermore, we seek to elucidate whether quercetin exerts this effect via autophagy regulation, providing new theoretical insights into its potential therapeutic application in MIRI.

Eight-week-old male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were acclimated under standard laboratory conditions for one week with free access to food and water. The rats were then randomly assigned to the following groups: Sham, MIRI model, low-dose quercetin (50 mg/kg), high-dose quercetin (100 mg/kg), macrophage depletion, and macrophage depletion + quercetin treatment. Rats in the Sham group underwent a sham operation in which a suture was passed around the myocardium without ligation. The MIRI model was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In brief, rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, and a transverse incision was made along the upper border of the third or fourth rib to expose the heart. The LAD was ligated with a 7 − 0 suture approximately 2 mm from its origin to induce ischemia. After 30 min of LAD occlusion, the suture was released, and reperfusion was allowed for 24 h. This experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical University (ID: xmsq2023-0889).

For macrophage depletion, rats were administered 200 μL of liposome-encapsulated clodronate (Lipo-Clo, FormuMax, USA) via tail vein injection 24 h before MIRI induction. Control animals in the depletion model received liposome-encapsulated PBS (Lipo-PBS) as vehicle. This approach selectively depletes circulating and tissue-resident macrophages without significantly affecting other leukocyte subsets. The efficacy and timing of depletion were based on established protocols in rodent myocardial injury models.

To assess myocardial infarct size, Evans blue and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining were performed. At the end of reperfusion, 1.5 mL of 1% Evans blue was injected into the left ventricle. The hearts were quickly excised, frozen at − 20 °C, and sliced perpendicularly to the long axis into four sections. The sections were then incubated with 1% TTC at 37 °C for 20 min and photographed.

Myocardial tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 μm-thick sections using a microtome. Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene (5 min × 3 times), incubated in hematoxylin for 5 min, and then treated with differentiation and bluing solutions. After rinsing with tap water, the sections were dehydrated in 95% and 85% ethanol (5 min each). For each rat (n = 5 per group), three randomly selected fields per section were evaluated for histopathological assessment. Representative images at × 40 magnification are shown in the corresponding figure.

To evaluate myocardial fibrosis, heart tissues were washed with PBS, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin. Myocardial Sects. (5 μm thickness) were prepared and stained using Masson’s trichrome staining kit (Solarbio, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to assess collagen deposition. The stained sections were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted for microscopic analysis. Three random fields per section were selected from each animal (n = 5 per group) for quantification of fibrotic area. Images were acquired at × 40 magnification with scale bars included.

After 24 h of reperfusion, an ultrasound imaging system for small animals was used to record M-mode images, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were measured.

The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in serum were measured using commercial assay kits. The results were expressed in U/mL or U/L.

Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured using commercially available ELISA kits. The kits were purchased from Proteintech (Wuhan, China) with the following catalog numbers: TNF-α (KE10002), IL-1β (KE10003), IL-6 (KE10007), and IL-10 (KE10003). All assays were performed strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Optical density (OD) values were measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, USA), and standard curves were generated to calculate cytokine concentrations.

Total protein was extracted from the ischemic myocardial tissue. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with skim milk at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against iNOS, Arg-1, CD86, CD206, LC3, P62, Bcl-2, Beclin1, and GAPDH. The following day, membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Each Western blot experiment was independently repeated three times (n = 3) for reproducibility.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the TransScript One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit. The expression levels of iNOS, Arg-1, CD86, and CD206 were detected by qPCR using IQ SYBR Green SuperMix. GAPDH was used as an internal reference.

RAW264.7 murine macrophages and H9C2 cardiomyocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ incubator. To simulate MIRI, cells were subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (H/R): cells were first incubated in glucose-free DMEM under hypoxic conditions (1% O₂, 94% N₂, 5% CO₂) for 4 h, followed by reoxygenation under normoxic conditions (21% O₂) for 6 h.

Cell apoptosis was analyzed using an FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit or a PE Annexin V apoptosis detection kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry was performed using a Cytomic FC 500MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and apoptotic cells were quantified using flow cytometry software.

To verify AAV transfection efficiency in rat myocardial tissue, paraffin-embedded heart sections were subjected to immunofluorescence staining. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval using H-3300 antigen retrieval solution (Vector Lab Inc.). Permeabilization was performed with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. To block non-specific binding, the sections were incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% goat serum in PBST at RT for 30 min. Since AAV carried a ZsGreen fluorescent tag, transfection efficiency was evaluated based on ZsGreen fluorescence. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: Anti-CD86 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat#19,589); Anti-CD206 (mouse monoclonal, 1:200, Abcam, ab64693); Anti-F4/80 (rat monoclonal, 1:200, Bio-Rad, Cat#MCA497GA). After washing, sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Abcam, ab150113); Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Abcam, ab150080). DAPI (1 μg/mL, Beyotime, C1002) was used to counterstain the nuclei. Finally, the slides were mounted with antifade mounting medium containing DAPI and imaged using a fluorescence microscope.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests was used for multiple comparisons. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

To evaluate the success of the MIRI model in rats and the protective effect of quercetin, we first measured serum levels of LDH and CK-MB. Compared with the Sham group, the MIRI model group showed significantly elevated levels of LDH and CK-MB, indicating successful induction of myocardial injury. Notably, treatment with quercetin markedly reduced both LDH and CK-MB levels (Fig.1A). Furthermore, analysis of serum inflammatory cytokines revealed that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β followed a similar trend to the myocardial injury markers, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased in the quercetin-treated group (Fig.1B).

TTC-Evans blue staining showed a significant increase in myocardial infarct size in the MIRI model group, whereas quercetin treatment markedly reduced infarct size in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1C). Furthermore, echocardiographic analysis confirmed that quercetin improved cardiac function, as indicated by the significant restoration of LVEF and LVFS, with high-dose quercetin exhibiting a superior protective effect compared to the low-dose group (Fig.1D). Notably, macrophage depletion partially attenuated the cardioprotective effects of quercetin, suggesting that its efficacy may be mediated by macrophages (Fig.1D).

Histological analysis with HE staining and Masson’s trichrome staining revealed severe myocardial fiber disruption and increased collagen deposition in the MIRI model group, while these pathological changes were significantly alleviated in the quercetin-treated groups (Fig.2A-B).

To investigate the role of macrophages in the protective effects of quercetin against MIRI, Western blot and qPCR analyses were performed. The results showed that quercetin treatment led to a decrease in the M1 macrophage marker, while the M2 macrophage marker was upregulated (Fig.3A). Immunofluorescence staining further demonstrated that quercetin treatment increased the proportion of F4/80⁺CD206⁺ M2 macrophages, while reducing the proportion of F4/80⁺CD86⁺ M1 macrophages (Fig.3B). Interestingly, when macrophages were depleted, the effect of quercetin on M2 polarization was significantly diminished, indicating that its cardioprotective effects are largely dependent on M2 macrophage polarization.

To further validate the regulatory effect of quercetin on M2 macrophage polarization, we conducted in vitro experiments. LPS/IFN-γ stimulation was used to induce M1 polarization, while IL-4 treatment was used to induce M2 polarization. Successful model establishment was further validated by flow cytometry, which demonstrated increased expression of CD86, a marker of M1 macrophages, as well as CD206, a marker of M2 macrophages, relative to the control group (Fig.4A).

Subsequently, M1 macrophages were subjected to H/R treatment to mimic in vivo MIRI conditions, followed by quercetin intervention. The results showed that quercetin significantly reduced CD86 expression and increased Arg-1 expression following H/R injury (Fig.4B). Immunofluorescence analysis further demonstrated a marked increase in CD206⁺ macrophages in the H/R group, confirming that quercetin directly promotes M2 polarization (Fig.4C).

To explore the mechanism by which quercetin-induced M2 macrophage polarization alleviates cardiomyocyte injury, we subjected cardiomyocytes to H/R conditions and directly treated them with quercetin. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis revealed that H/R injury significantly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, whereas treatment with quercetin markedly reduced apoptosis, indicating a direct protective effect on myocardial cells (Fig.5A). Interestingly, the protective effect was even more pronounced when quercetin was applied to macrophages rather than directly to cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by a further reduction in apoptotic cell rates (Fig.5A). ELISA results showed that although direct quercetin treatment reduced TNF-α, LDH, and IL-1β levels while increasing IL-10 expression, quercetin-mediated M2 polarization further enhanced these effects (Fig.5B–E). This suggests that M2 macrophages may modulate the cardiac microenvironment via paracrine mechanisms, playing a crucial role in quercetin’s cardioprotective effects in MIRI.

Previous studies have shown that autophagy activation promotes M2 macrophage polarization, enhancing their anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions [20,21]. Our study found that quercetin increased the LC3-II/I ratio and accelerated P62 degradation. However, these effects were partially reversed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (Fig.6A).

Further co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays demonstrated that quercetin reduced the binding affinity between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, thereby promoting autophagosome formation (Fig.6B). This process was accompanied by upregulation of the M2 marker, which was reversed upon 3-MA treatment, confirming that autophagy plays a crucial role in quercetin-induced M2 polarization (Fig.6A).

This study systematically explored the cardioprotective effects of quercetin in MIRI and, for the first time, revealed its molecular mechanism in promoting M2 macrophage polarization and autophagy activation, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.

MIRI is an unavoidable pathological process during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treatment, characterized by excessive post-reperfusion inflammatory activation, aggravated myocardial injury, and subsequent myocardial remodeling. Accumulating evidence indicates that macrophages play a pivotal role in both inflammation and repair during MIRI [22,23]. M1 macrophages dominate in the early phase, releasing TNF-α and IL-1β, which exacerbate myocardial damage, whereas M2 macrophages are predominant in the later stage, secreting IL-10 and TGF-β, which facilitate inflammation resolution and tissue repair [24,25]. Therefore, promoting the transition from M1 to M2 macrophages has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for MIRI.

Our study demonstrated that quercetin significantly reduced infarct size and myocardial injury markers (LDH and CK-MB) while restoring LVEF and LVFS, indicating its ability to improve cardiac function. ELISA results further revealed that quercetin suppressed TNF-α and IL-1β secretion while promoting IL-10 production, suggesting that it exerts cardioprotective effects by regulating inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, quercetin upregulated the M2 macrophage markers Arg-1 and CD206 while downregulating M1 markers iNOS and CD86, and further promoted M2 polarization in an in vitro H/R injury model. These findings indicate that quercetin confers anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects by facilitating M2 macrophage polarization in MIRI. Previous studies have also demonstrated that quercetin can ameliorate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by modulating microglia M2 polarization, which further corroborates our study [9].

Interestingly, when macrophages were depleted, the cardioprotective effects of quercetin were markedly attenuated, highlighting macrophage polarization as a key mediator of its therapeutic effects. Further co-culture experiments revealed that quercetin-induced M2 macrophages ameliorated H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury via paracrine signaling, underscoring its potential role in cardiac microenvironment remodeling. Macrophages have been documented to play an important role in the cardiac immune microenvironment, and type 2 macrophages have the ability to promote cardiac remodeling and angiogenesis [26,27].

Autophagy is recognized as a crucial mechanism regulating macrophage polarization [28,29]. Previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy activation drives metabolic reprogramming in M2 macrophages, thereby enhancing their anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing properties [30,31]. Our study found that quercetin significantly increased the LC3-II/I ratio, promoted P62 degradation, and enhanced autophagosome formation, indicating its role in autophagy activation. Mechanistically, quercetin reduced the binding affinity between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, facilitating Beclin-1-mediated autophagy activation. Bcl-2 is a frequent target for drugs that inhibit autophagy by binding to the Beclin-1 BH3 structural domain [32]. Notably, when the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA was applied, the ability of quercetin to promote M2 polarization was partially reversed, and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β rebounded, suggesting that quercetin-induced M2 polarization is at least partially dependent on autophagy activation. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses in the MIRI model further confirmed that quercetin regulates M2 polarization through autophagy, ultimately mitigating myocardial injury. These findings suggest that quercetin may enhance M2 polarization by activating autophagy, modulating macrophage energy metabolism, and suppressing inflammatory responses. Similar studies have found that taurine can antagonize macrophage polarization toward M1 by inhibiting mitochondrial autophagic flux and hindering energy metabolism conversion and hence, macrophage polarization [30].

Despite revealing the cardioprotective mechanism of quercetin via autophagy-mediated M2 macrophage polarization, this study has some limitations: The study was conducted at the animal and cellular levels, and further validation using clinical samples and patient-derived models is necessary. Although our study focused on autophagy, additional pathways such as NF-κB and PI3K/Akt may also contribute to M2 polarization, warranting further investigation.

This study is the first to demonstrate that quercetin exerts cardioprotective effects in MIRI by promoting M2 macrophage polarization and activating autophagy. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the potential application of quercetin in cardiovascular diseases and suggest that quercetin may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for modulating the inflammatory microenvironment and facilitating myocardial repair.
