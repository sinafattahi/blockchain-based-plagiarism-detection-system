Brain tumors have complex structures, and their shape, density, and size can vary widely. Consequently, their accurate classification, which involves identifying features that best describe the tumor data, is challenging. Using classical 2D texture features can yield only limited accuracy. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by using 3D feature extraction and ranking methods. Brain tumor images obtained through 3D magnetic resonance imaging were used to classify high-grade and low-grade glioma in the BraTS 2017 dataset. From the dataset, texture properties for each of the four phases (i.e., FLAIR, T1, T1c, and T2) were extracted using a 3D gray level co-occurrence matrix. Various combinations of brain tumor feature sets were created, and feature ranking methods—Bhattacharyya, entropy, receiver operating characteristic, the t-test, and the Wilcoxon test—were applied to them. Features were classified using gradient boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and random forest methods. The performance of all combinations was evaluated from the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score obtained from twofold, fivefold, and tenfold cross-validation tests. In all experiments, the most effective scheme was that involving the quadruple combination (FLAIR + T1 + T1c + T2) and the entropy feature-ranking method with twofold cross-validation. Notably, the proposed machine-learning-based framework showed remarkable scores of 100% (sensitivity), 97.29% (specificity), 99.30% (accuracy), 99.07% (precision), and 99.53% (F-score) for glioma classification with an SVM. The proposed flowchart reflects a novel brain tumor classification system that competes with the novel methods.

Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells that form within the brain or its surrounding tissues. Brain tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and can develop at any age. Brain tumors can originate from any part of the brain or spinal cord and can be classified according to the type of cell they arise from, their location, or their behavior1,2. Brain tumors can cause different type of symptoms, depending on size and location. Some of the common symptoms of tumors are headaches, seizures, changes in vision or hearing, difficulty speaking or understanding language, and changes in personality or behavior. Several factors affect the treatment of brain tumor: The type, size, and location of the tumor, and the patient’s overall health3,4. Imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans are used to diagnose brain tumors. Also, biopsy method is used to examine a sample of the tumor tissue. To examine the different diseases in the body, CT5,6and MRI7–9scans are used often. Brain tumors can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted drug therapy10,11. The prognosis for patients with brain tumors depends on several factors, including the type and grade of the tumor, as well as the age and overall health of the patient. The prognosis and treatment options for HGG and LGG are quite different. High-grade gliomas are aggressive tumors that are more likely to spread quickly and require more aggressive treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Low-grade gliomas, on the other hand, are slow-growing tumors that can often be managed with more conservative treatments, such as watchful waiting or surgery alone. Accurate classification of brain tumors as either HGG or LGG is therefore crucial in determining the appropriate treatment plan for the patient12,13. The classification of brain tumors as either HGG or LGG can also provide important information about the tumor’s underlying biology and behavior. High-grade gliomas are typically associated with more genetic abnormalities and a greater potential for resistance to treatment. By contrast, low-grade gliomas are typically associated with fewer genetic abnormalities and a lower potential for resistance to treatment. Understanding the biology of brain tumors is important for developing new and more effective treatments in the future. As a result, accurate classification of brain tumors as either HGG or LGG is critical for determining the appropriate treatment plan and understanding the underlying biology of these tumors14,15. Therefore, there are many studies on brain tumor classification. Before classification process, a feature extraction step is applied. Automatic or hand-crafted (manual) feature extraction processes are used to extract features. Some studies16–22use methods that extract features automatically before the classification process, and some23–27extract manually. Wasule and Sonar28extracted texture features with GLCM and used as a feature vector that was classified by SVM and k-NN methods. They used BraTS 2012 dataset for the proposed method examination. Their method achieved 85% and 72.5% classification accuracies with SVM and k-NN, respectively. Cho and Park29extracted GLCM features on Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 modalities (180 features in total) and selected important features among them with L1-norm regularization. They classified the new selected feature set with Logistic Regression and achieved 89.91% classification accuracy. Johnpeter and Ponnuchamy30used brain MRI images and applied dual tree wavelet transform on the fused image. They extracted texture features and classified the features with co-active adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (CANFIS). They achieved 98.8% average classification accuracy with the proposed method. Rajagopal31proposed a random forest-based classification system using feature optimization process. They extracted features on the data and optimized them with ant colony optimization algorithm. The classifier achieved 98.01% accuracy on the optimized feature set. Jefferson and Shanmugasundaram32extracted features with GLCM and 3D-CNN methods. The extracted feature set combined and provided to k-NN classifier. K-NN method increased the classification accuracy up to 96.7%. Vijithananda et al.33extracted GLCM features on 1599 labeled MRI brain ADC image slices. They selected features with ANOVA f-test method and classified with random forest classifier. Their method achieved 90.41% classification accuracy. Vankdothu and Hameed34extracted features with GLCM on the dataset and classified the features with recurrent convolutional neural networks. The experiments were applied on 3264 MRI images and the proposed method achieved 95.17% accuracies. Sharif et al.35proposed an end-to-end optimized deep learning system for multimodal brain tumor classification. They increased the contrasts in the images by using hybrid division histogram equalization along ant colony optimization approach. Then, they extracted features with a CNN model. The features were classified with multi-class SVM with a classification accuracy of 98.18%. Neetha and Narayan36used different feature extraction methods (LeNET, GLCM, and LTP) to extract features from brain images. They classified the features by using LSTM method. They achieved 97.16% classification accuracy. Mehmood et al.20proposed a ConvNext architecture to extract features. These features were fed to a fully connected neural network for final classification. The proposed method achieved high classification performance as 99.5% on the BraTS 2019 dataset. Abd-Ellah et al.37detected and classified brain MR images into normal, HGG, and LGG. They extracted 1800 images from The BraTS 2017 dataset. The deep learning model classified brain images with 99% accuracy.

The paper is organized as follows. The data preparation, visual features of the tumors, feature extraction method, feature-ranking methods, and binary classifier are presented in Section “Materials and methods”. The experimental study is discussed in SectionExperimental study. The results of the proposed method are presented in Section “Results”. The concluding remarks and literature comparison are presented in Section “Discussion”.

The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation challenge data in 2017 was used in this study. The BraTS2017 brain dataset consists of 210 HGG 3D image sequence, and 75 LGG 3D image sequence where the MR modality is obtained on sequences of T1c, FLAIR, T1, and T2. Each modality has 155 2D images, for a total of 620 slices per a patient data. Each slice in the dataset has an image dimension of 240 × 240 and slice thickness of 1 mm. Expert neuroradiologists labelled the non-brain structures38–40.

In the data set, four different modalities of each patient are registered as “.mha” extension. The file with the extension “.mha” is opened in the program and each slice is read. Slices with tumors in a total of 240 slices are saved in a separate variable. This process was performed on 210 HGG and 75 LGG images for four different modalities, and two datasets were created. The two datasets were used as it is. Specific techniques such as resampling or class weighting weren’t applied during the training process.

In the first dataset, only slices containing tumor information are obtained in 240 slices. Each patient data had different number of slices. However, all slices have the same size of 240*240. 3D data creation for the first dataset is presented in the Fig.1for the T2 modality of “Brats17_TCIA_150_1” scan.

3D tumor data visualization for creation of the first dataset (the 3D images were generated by using MATLAB 2022a).

The second dataset has 240 slices all. There is no selection of slices where the tumor occurs. This provides the second dataset has position information of the tumor where the first dataset has no position information of the tumors.

Figure2presents HGG and LGG type tumors that size and shape of the tumor can vary. HGG and LGG tumor images can have similar sizes and shapes. The structure of brain tumors and their aspects in MRI scans, and the differences between the same type of tumors (size, shape, and intensity) may be considered as challenges for data processing. The detailed information about the data features is in previous study41. These challenges affect the high accuracy classification. Therefore, this study performed phase combination, feature-ranking approach, and a binary classifier to increase the classification accuracy.

Samples of 3D tumor shapes (the 3D images were generated by using MATLAB 2022a).

In phase combination, all modalities were used to create single, double, triple, and quadruple combinations. All combinations have 210 HGG and 75 LGG images. The single (T1, T2, T1c, Flair), double (T1 + T2, T1 + T1c. Flair + T2 etc.), triple (T1 + T1c + T2, T1c + T2 + Flair etc.), and quadruple (T1 + T2 + T1c + Flair) combinations have 624, 1248, 1872, and 2496 features, respectively.

For three dimensional operations, an adjacency matrix representing three dimensions is derived using the gray level values of voxel neighborhoods. In addition to the conventional 2D-GLCM, thezaxis is added to the displacement vector in the 3D-GLCM operation (d=dx,dy,dz).dzspecifies how far to go in thezaxis. In 3D space, which neighborhoods of a voxel are to be examined depends on theθandФangles. TheФangle defines the movement in thexyplane, and theθangle defines the up and down movement in thezplane. Table1shows the directions of the linesθandФin thex,y,zplanes42. Voxel neighbors can be defined in 26 directions together with these angles. In volumetric situations, a voxel has 26 neighbors, but since the displacement vectors are bidirectional, 13 neighborhoods are sufficient to define the data. Table1gives angle values and direction-defined displacement vectors for 13 directions in three-dimensional space. 3D-GLCM method usedx,y, andzaxis, and created 624 features for each 3D tumor.

Angular values and angle-defined displacement vectors for 13 directions in three-dimensional space.

Twelve properties were obtained with each co-occurrence matrix. If the co-occurrence matrix is denoted byP(i,j); variance, total mean, inverse variance, energy, contrast, correlation, entropy, homogeneity, inertia, cluster shade, cluster tendency, maximum probability, are calculated fromP(i,j)as in Eqs.1–1243.

Feature ranking methods such T-test, Bhattacharyya, Wilcoxon Test, ROC, and Entropy were used to rank the features. All features were ranked and classified.

The t-test method is employed to ascertain whether two sets of data exhibit significant differences between them. This method splits dataset into independent variables (features) and the target variable (labels). Thentis computed for each feature separately.

Features are ranked based on their p-values, with smaller values indicating higher importance. In Eq.13,n1andn2are cluster sizes,µis cluster mean,σis the variance of cluster. Higher t-value shows that there is a great difference between the groups. The difference may not be significant if the t-value is low44.

Bhattacharyya distance is an approach that gauges the similarities between two continuous or discontinuous probability distributions. The method estimates the probability distributions of each feature for both classes. Equation14is used to compute the distance for each feature. Features with higher Bhattacharyya distances are ranked as more important because they better separate the classes45.

Wilcoxon Test is used to search significance between two separate samples. This method extracts independent variables (features) and the target variable (labels). Then, feature values are converted into ranked values. The rank sums are computed for each feature across two classes. Features with smaller p-values are more important. In Eqs.15–17,andare cluster sizes,Ris the sum of rankings in small cluster,is the mean ofR,is the variance ofR46.

This method extracts independent variables (features) and the target variable (labels). A logistic regression or a similar model is used with each feature individually to train a simple classifier. Then, it is measure that how well each feature distinguishes between classes. Features with the highest ROC are the most useful for classification.

Letanddenote the distribution function ofXtwo population. The tail functions are denoted respectively. If the ROC value is high, the feature strongly separates the classes. If it is low, the feature has little or no discriminative power47.

In the field of statistics, entropy serves as a representation of the randomness or unpredictability inherent in data. This method calculates the entropy of the target variable. Mutual information is calculated for each feature. Then, features are ranked based on mutual information48.

This study used three different strong classifiers to classify brain tumor features.

SVM, a learning technique, achieves remarkable classification accuracy across various applications, built upon two fundamental concepts. Initially, it employs a nonlinear method to project feature vectors into a higher-dimensional space. Subsequently, it employs linear classifiers within this transformed space. The secondary notion involves identifying a hyperplane that exhibits a substantial margin between data points. This hyperplane effectively partitions the data49. SVM uses Eq.20to solve a binary classification problem.

ξis a slack variable, andcis the regularization parameter. The optimization problem above can be written as in Eq.23.

At eachmboosting iteration, the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s current prediction is computed.

This step finds the functionthat best approximates the negative gradient. To determine how much the new model should contribute to the final prediction, a step sizeis optimized.

The final model is updated by adding the new learner with the optimized weight.

This process continues form iterationsuntil the model converges or a stopping criterion is met52.

This study created two different datasets to classify HGG/LGG. The first dataset had only tumor slices, and the second dataset had whole slices. The second dataset contained the tumor position information in slices while the first dataset had not such information. Combinations of phases, three-dimensional feature extraction, and feature ranking methods are used to increase the classification accuracy of the classifiers. The flow of the training phase is seen in Fig.3.

The data was divided into training (80%) and test (20%) dataset. The training and test dataset had 228 and 57 samples, respectively. The features extracted with 3D-GLCM method from MR modalities. The features then combined in 15 different ways. Each sample for a modality has 624 features. For T1 modality, the extracted feature set for one image is in 1 × 624 format. There are 285 T1 images; so, the T1 modality feature set is in 285 × 624 format. Then, the features were ranked with five different methods and the ranked features represented thenew_dataset. Thenew_datasethas 285 samples, and each sample has 624 features; however, these 624 features are ranked from the most discriminative feature (the 1st feature) to least discriminative feature (the 624th feature) format. These features were saved in a ranked_features array. Then, a loop is started to process the features. The data creation in the loop is presented in Table2.

As seen in Table2, in each loop, the number of features is increased one by one. The first set has one feature, which is the most discriminative feature. Then, the second set is created with the first most two discriminative features. The loop is continued, and the last set has all features. When thenew training datais created in each loop, the classifiers were trained with 2-fold, 5-fold, and 10-fold cross-validations. After the classifier training in cross-validation is finished, thetest_datawas used to obtain the performance of each combination, ranking method, and classifier. During classification process, all classification results are saved for each number of features, and the best feature set that gives the best classification performance is obtained for all modalities combinations.

All combinations were provided to feature ranking, and classification system and the results were obtained. Sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), accuracy (ACC), precision (PRE), and F-score metrics were used to evaluate the results. TP, TN, FP, and FN represent true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative values, respectively, and used to calculate evaluation metrics. This study used standard k-fold cross-validation as implemented in MATLAB, where the dataset was randomly partitioned intoksubsets of approximately equal size. Each fold was used once as a test set while the remainingk-1folds were used for training. The partitioning was performed using MATLAB’s built-in cvpartition function, ensuring a reproducible and unbiased split. A stratified approach was used to maintain class distribution across folds. The first and the second dataset has low number of samples for each class. However, the number of features is high for the classification process. To address potential feature selection challenges arising from high-dimensional data, feature ranking using t-test, Wilcoxon test, Bhattacharyya, ROC, and Entropy methods were performed. These techniques allowed to rank features from the most discriminative to least discriminative while reducing the impact of irrelevant or redundant ones. Additionally, cross-validation was employed to evaluate model performance across different modality combinations, ensuring that the inclusion of multiple modalities did not lead to overfitting.

This study used feature ranking method toolbox in MATLAB. The used methods are MATLAB’s built-in functions. For classification processes, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Random Forest were implemented using MATLAB’s built-in functions. All preprocessing, model training, and validation steps were conducted within the MATLAB environment to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

The first dataset has only tumor slices in 155 slices, and do not have tumor position information. The classification method proposed in Fig.3was applied to the first dataset. The 15 phase combinations were created and classified. The best classification accuracy was obtained on triple combination ofT1 + T1c + T2. The classification outcomes from 2-fold cross-validation for all feature ranking techniques are outlined in Table3.

Table3indicates that the highest classification accuracy without feature ranking is 87.36%. By implementing feature ranking, the classification accuracy is increased in all classification processes. The best flowchart is found as: The Wilcoxon Test method ranked the features and SVM obtained the best feature set by classifying all feature combinations. This flowchart increased the classification accuracies by 4.93%, 3.88%, 8.42% with Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers, respectively. Table4presents the Wilcoxon Test results for different cross validations for SVM classifier.

Table4outlines that the classification accuracy is over 90.50% for three different cross validations. The results show that most of the features were used for the highest classification for the first dataset.

The second dataset has all slices for each image and have tumor position information. The classification method proposed in Fig.3was applied to the second dataset. The 15 phase combinations were created and classified. The best classification accuracy was obtained onFLAIR + T1 + T1c + T2dataset. Table5presents the classification results of 2-fold cross validation for all feature ranking methods.

Table5indicates that the highest classification accuracy without feature ranking is 85.96%. By implementing feature ranking, the classification accuracy is increased in all classification processes. The best flowchart is found as: Entropy method ranked the features and SVM obtained the best feature set by classifying all feature combinations. This flowchart increased the classification accuracies by 9.91%, 13.34%, 5.97% with Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers, respectively. Table6presents the Entropy results for different cross validations for SVM classifier.

The entropy results for different cross validations for the second dataset.

Table6indicates that the classification accuracy is over 98% for three different cross validations. The results show that most of the features were used for the highest classification for the second dataset.

In this part of the study, the effect of feature ranking methods is analyzed. The results showed that if there is not any ranking process, the classification accuracy is between 85 and 90%. However, when a feature ranking process was applied to both datasets, the classification accuracies increase. During all combinations and experiments, the number of selected ranking methods were examined and presented in Fig.4.

The ranking methods comparisonathe first dataset,bthe second dataset.

In 450 classification processes with SVM, total for the first and second experiments, the most selected ranking method is Wilcoxon Test method. The second method is Bhattacharyya ranking method. Although Entropy has the third place, it gave the best classification accuracy during experiments. For all experiments, in the first dataset that has no tumor position information single phases have 83.59% mean accuracy. The double and triple phases have 87.83% and 90.26% mean accuracies, respectively. The quadruple phase combination has an average classification accuracy over 90%. For all experiments, in the second dataset that has tumor position information single phases (T1, T2, T1c, Flair) have 78.87% mean accuracy. The double (T1 + T2, T1 + T1c. Flair + T2 etc.) and triple (T1 + T1c + T2, T1c + T2 + Flair etc.) phases have 84.43% and 88.34% mean accuracies, respectively. The quadruple phase combination (T1 + T2 + T1c + Flair) has an average classification accuracy over 98%.

This section analyzes the computational time of the best results for each dataset. The durations of feature ranking, classification method (for all features), and extracting GLCM 3D features (for a 3D data) for the first and second datasets were presented in Table7. All methods in this study were implemented on a computer that has an i7 8700HQ processor and 32GB RAM.

Table7indicates that feature ranking and classification processes has a duration lower than one second. However, feature extraction process on 3D data with 3D-GLCM method has a long duration. It takes about three minutes on average for 3D-GLCM method to extract features from only tumor slices. To extract features from all slices, it takes about five minutes on average. For the best method that gives the highest classification accuracy, the computational time is 322 + 0.1406 + 0.625 = 322.7656 s. Therefore, it can be said that the proposed method decides the tumor classification of HGG/LGG in 322.7656 s.

Overall, according to the results after experiments, the brain tumor classification framework on 3D MRI data is shown in Fig.5.

An integrated framework is presented to classify 3D MRI data of brain tumors. The framework used 3D-GLCM as a feature extractor that is used technique for analyzing texture in images. Feature ranking methods were analyzed to select the best feature set and phase combinations that represent each data. The ranking process was guided by statistical and information-theoretic criteria, focusing on the discriminative power of features rather than their redundancy. Given the high dimensionality of the data, effective feature selection plays a crucial role in optimizing the analysis and improving model accuracy.

This study created two different datasets to detect if the tumor position affects the classification accuracy. The results showed that tumor position information has a big impact on high classification accuracy. Adding position information increased the classification accuracy around 13%. Therefore, in 3D-MRI brain tumor classification process, the tumor position information must be used as a feature. The literature studies use mostly 2D-GLCM on slices and combine the extracted features from each slice as presented in Table8.

Table8indicates that the proposed method has a remarkable classification performance on 3D-GLCM texture features. 3D-GLCM method extracts many features on 3D tumor data. This provides 3D-GLCM to compete with deep feature extraction methods. Figure6presents the comparison of classification results of the proposed method with deep learning methods.

The comparison between the deep learning studies56–58and the proposed flowchart.

Figure6and other literature studies54,56–58show that the classification performance of the proposed novel flowchart can compete with the deep learning-based state-of-art methods.

The proposed approach is designed specifically for binary classification tasks and relies on statistical methods used for feature ranking, which are limited to comparing two groups. Therefore, direct extension to multi-class classification scenarios would not be straightforward without significant methodological adjustments. However, the framework can be applied to other binary classification problems involving different tumor types, such as distinguishing between metastases and primary brain tumors, or differentiating tumor presence versus absence. Future work will focus on evaluating its performance on different datasets with different tumor types to further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach.

The contribution of each component such as feature ranking and different modalities were analyzed in ‘4. Results’ section. In this part, the contribution of 3D-GLCM was observed. 2D-GLCM was used as feature extraction method to compare the results with 3D-GLCm method. For the ablation study, 2D-GLCM feature extraction was used to extract features from each slice that contains tumor. The angular secondary moment, contrast, correlation, sum of squares: variance, inverse difference moment, sum average, sum variance, sum entropy, entropy, difference entropy, difference variance, information measures of correlation 1, information measures of correlation 2, autocorrelation, dissimilarity, cluster shade, cluster prominence, maximum probability, and the inverse difference features were extracted for each image. All classification parameters in ablation study were set same as in Results section.

Two different datasets were created by using four modalities. If the image mean value is bigger than 0, it means that there is a tumor in the image. Then, the image was selected for each dataset. The features were extracted from HGG and LGG images and then were classified by SVM, and the effect of 2D-GLCM and 3D-GLCM methods were observed. Table9presents the results for ablation study.

Table9shows that extracting features from 3D-volume data gives better results than extracting features from 2D-slices. In the Experiments 1 and 2, the classification accuracy was increased around 12% with 3D-GLCM features. In the Experiments 3 and 4, the classification accuracy was increased around 11% with 3D-GLCM features.

This study used a pre-prepared 3D tumor data to classify the tumors. The proposed flowchart has high accuracy on HGG/LGG discrimination. To use this flowchart in real time applications, there has to be an automatic 3D tumor segmentation or manual 2D tumor segmentation for all slices are needed. 3D-GLCM method has high computational cost for large volumetric data. Moreover, the selection of window size may influence the feature extraction process, requiring careful tuning. These are potential limitations for the proposed flowchart. If the 3D tumor image is ready, the proposed flowchart can be integrated into real-time clinical decision support systems to enable fast and accurate analysis of patient data. When integrated with medical imaging systems, it can assist doctors in accelerating the diagnostic process and performing real-time risk assessments. Operating with real-time data flow, the system can automatically classify patients based on clinical parameters, detect anomalies early, and alert clinicians. This reduces reliance on subjective evaluations while ensuring faster and more reliable decision-making in diagnosis and treatment processes.

SVM can classify FLAIR + T1 + T1c + T2 data with high performance.

In five metrics-based comparisons, the quadruple combination generally results in better classification performance than datasets based on singular, double, and triple combinations.

Entropy ranking achieved promising performance based on the data to be classified.

The most appropriate dataset to classify brain tumors is the quadruple combination to obtain the highest results according to the accuracy metric.

The flowchart can compete with the deep learning methods.

A feasible classification strategy can be implemented for the whole brain defined in 3D MRI (e.g., disease classification) in addition to 3D-defined tumor classification.
