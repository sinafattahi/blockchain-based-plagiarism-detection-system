This study aims to evaluate the association between IDO index and the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We searched databases such as PubMed, to collect relevant English studies on the association between IDO level and the prognosis of CRC published before October 10, 2024. This meta-analysis included 11 studies involving 2068 patients. The results showed that IDO levels were not significantly correlated with OS in CRC patients (HR0.85, 95%CI 0.54–1.33,P= 0.488), but elevated IDO was associated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.38–0.99,P= 0.044).Elevated IDO was significantly associated with the incidence of liver metastasis (HR 4.66, 95%CI 1.72–12.64,P= 0.003) and lymphatic infiltration (HR 2.75, 95%CI 1.52–4.97,P< 0.001) in CRC patients. In conclusion, high expression of IDO is significantly associated with DFS, liver metastasis and lymphatic infiltration in CRC patients, and may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for DFS, liver metastasis, and lymphatic metastasis in CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), classified as a malignant tumor of the epithelial cells, is located in either the colon or rectum [1]. In terms of global cancer statistics, CRC is recognized as the third most commonly diagnosed cancer. A study indicates that for individuals with stage II CRC, the survival rate after five years fluctuates between 80 and 90%. In contrast, for those with stage IV CRC, the survival rate declines to a mere 10–20% [2]. Additionally, patients with distant organ metastasis have survival rates of less than 13% [3]. Therefore, early identification of CRC prognosis is particularly important. However, based on current findings, there are no biomarkers that are definitively associated with the prognosis of CRC [4].

It is possible that the evasion of immune effector cells from the immune system is linked to the growth and progression of tumors [5]. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), immune evasion and suppression play pivotal roles in the development of CRC [6]. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an intracellular enzyme known for its immunosuppression, can suppress T cell activity and bolster regulatory T cell functions, ultimately dampening immune responses [6]. Due to its role as a primary and rate-determining catalyst, IDO is a novel therapeutic target for a spectrum of malignancies [7,8]. Studies indicate that a reduction in immune scores among CRC patients correlates with elevated levels of IDO protein [6]. An upregulation of IDO is instrumental in creating a TME that is conducive to immunosuppression, by suppressing T and natural killer (NK) cells, and promoting and proliferating regulatory T cells (Tregs), dendritic cells (DCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [6]. Consequently, IDO-mediated tryptophan metabolism is a significant contributor to immune suppression within tumor cells [6]. Furthermore, clinical studies have found a positive association between the count of CD8 + lymphocytes and IDO expression levels in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) [9]. Both factors are linked to better survival outcomes and serve as standalone prognostic indicators for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) [9]. Based on this theory, some studies have implemented the immune-related scoring system in clinical practice, demonstrating its superiority over the TNM system in providing a more accurate prediction of CRC prognosis [9]. However, it remains uncertain whether IDO can be used as a prognostic biomarker for CRC. Consequently, delving deeply into the association between IDO and CRC is crucial for unraveling the intricacies of immune evasion in tumors, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and uncovering novel biomarkers for CRC [10].

As a new prognostic indicator, IDO may reveal heterogeneity among CRC patients during the same period, providing guidance for personalized treatment, further improving the survival rate of CRC patients, and avoiding unnecessary adjuvant therapy. However, there is currently no meta-analysis comparing the risk of recurrence and metastasis at specified future dates in patients with varying levels of IDO expression. On the other hand, high-quality meta-analyses are increasingly regarded as a key method for obtaining high-quality evidence. Consequently, a meta-analysis was undertaken to assess and synthesize the effects of varying IDO expression levels on the clinical prognosis and health outcomes of individuals with CRC.

The literature screening process involved reviewing article titles and abstracts, evaluating complete manuscripts, and autonomously selecting suitable studies. The following studies were included: (1) various observational studies, including longitudinal cohort studies, case-control investigations, and cross-sectional studies; (2) research that furnished valid prognostic metrics for assessing IDO levels in relation to CRC outcomes, encompassing measures like OS, DFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS); (3) studies that offered 95% confidence intervals (CI), odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or relative risk (RR); (4) literature that established criteria for classifying IDO expression into positive/negative or strong/weak categories.

The following articles were excluded: (1) Articles that did not belong to research types, such as reviews, conference abstracts, case reports, letters, guidelines, etc.; (2) Non-human animal studies; (3) Studies where data were unobtainable and full texts could not be acquired; where relevant outcome data, including OS, DFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS), were unavailable(4) Studies with sample sizes less than 50 participants; (5) Studies that did not detect IDO expression in CRC tissues. (6) Studies with NOS quality assessment scores below 6 points.

Data extraction and quality appraisal across studies were conducted autonomously by two researchers, adhering to uniform standards. Disagreements were addressed through group discussions. Information retrieved from the selected studies encompassed the first author, year of publication, demographic details (geographical region, age bracket, and gender ratio), sample size, research design, techniques for IDO identification, thresholds for IDO expression, categorization of CRC tumors, distant metastasis, adjusted odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) [11]. Numerical data were extracted from images using Engauge Digitizer (version 4.1) software to ensure data accuracy.

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [12] was employed to gauge the methodological quality of both case-control and cohort studies. Study quality was appraised as per aspects of selection, comparability, and either exposure (in case-control studies) or outcome (in cohort studies). A scoring system was applied, with a top score of 9. Scores of 7 and above denoted high-quality studies. Scores of 4–6 indicate moderate-quality studies, while scores below 6 indicate low-quality studies (Supplementary Material 2).

The impact of IDO expression on CRC prognosis was evaluated through HR estimation, with corresponding 95% CIs. HR (Hazard Ratio) is a commonly used metric in survival analysis to compare the risk differences of events (e.g., death, recurrence, disease progression) between two patient groups. The formula for HR is: HR = event risk rate in the treatment group/event risk rate in the control group. HR = 1 indicates no difference between groups; HR < 1 suggests the high-IDO group has lower CRC risk than the low-IDO group; HR > 1 indicates that the group with high IDO expression has a higher risk of developing CRC compared to the group with low IDO expression; In statistics, a 95% CI that does not include 1 suggests that the result is statistically significant. If HR was available, the effect size (ES) was determined using the formula ES = ln(HR), and the standard error (SE) of ES was derived as SE = [ln(UC) - ln(LC)]/3.92. Weighted percentages (%) reflect the weight of information (sample size, event count, and confidence interval), calculated as weight = 1/(SE squared) [11]. The heterogeneity of various studies was assessed using I² and p-values. A p-value < 0.05 indicates heterogeneity. An I² >50% indicates heterogeneity; 50–75% suggests moderate heterogeneity; and > 75% reflects high heterogeneity. If no heterogeneity was observed (I² < 50% orP> 0.05), a fixed-effects model was used. Conversely, when high heterogeneity was present, a random-effects model was used13.To identify the reasons for the heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted by geographic regions, ages, follow-up times, and tumor classifications. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding a study at a time to ascertain the potential effects of removing each study and pinpoint both the origins and extent of heterogeneity. Publication bias was determined by employing a funnel plot and was further validated via Egger’s test [13] Meta-analysis was executed utilizing Stata version 15.0 for Windows.

Two researchers (Y.T.T and Z.Y.L), adhering to the predefined search strategy, initially screened 658 articles sourced from four digital databases. After eliminating 124 duplicates, they subsequently scrutinized the titles and abstracts of 534 articles. Ultimately, 260 articles were deemed ineligible due to their irrelevance or failure to align with the established criteria. The full texts of 274 studies were further evaluated, among which 230 studies were excluded due to mismatched study types. Furthermore, we excluded 22 studies that reported IDO levels but lacked information on CRC, and 10 studies that reported CRC but lacked information on IDO, with 1 duplicate record removed. Eventually, the meta-analysis encompassed 11 studies, comprising 2068 participants, to delve into the correlation between IDO levels and the prognostic outcomes in CRC [5,14–23], as shown in Fig.1.

The 11 included studies originated from 7 countries, with 7 studies from Europe (Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Finland), 4 from Asia (China, Japan). All these studies were published betwee 2006 and 2024. In terms of CRC classification, the most common type in the studies was T1-T4 (n= 9), followed by T3-T4 (n= 2).

10 datasets included OS information, 3 datasets included DFS information, 2 datasets had information on distant tumor metastasis, and 2 datasets contained information on lymphatic infiltration, as shown in Table1.

All 11 studies were cohort studies. The quality assessment showed that 9 cohort studies were rated as high quality, of which 2 studies [18,23] were rated 9 points, 2 studies [14,19] were rated 8 points, and 4 studies [16,17,20,22] were rated 7 points. Three studies [9,15,21] were rated as moderate quality, with 6 points. No studies were rated as low quality.(Supplementary Material 2).

Out of the eligible studies, 6 [5,15,16,18,20,22] studies specifically examined the link between IDO levels and OS. Among them, 4 studies had HRs < 1 [5,16,18,20], whereas 2 presented HRs > 1 [15,22]. A meta-analysis encompassing these 6 studies was performed. Given an I² statistic of 83.6%, a random-effects model was selected to synthesize the HR and corresponding 95% CI. The aggregated analysis across the 6 data sets suggested that elevated IDO expression did not correlate with adverse outcomes in CRC(HR0.85, 95%CI 0.54–1.33,P= 0.488) (Fig.2). Accordingly, subgroup analysis by 1 to 5-year OS period was implemented, which included 6 studies. No significant link was observed between yearly IDO levels and OS in CRC. The pooled HRs and 95% CIs at various time points were as follows: 1-year OS (HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.70–3.00,P= 0.320); 2-year OS (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.56–2.74,P= 0.598); 3-year OS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49–2.16,P= 0.932); 4-year OS (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.45–3.67,P= 0.642); 5-year OS (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.47–3.26,P= 0.667)(Figure S1).A total of 3 studies [5,14,16] were used to evaluate the association between IDO expression and DFS. The HRs in these 3 studies were < 1 (5, 14, 16). Heterogeneity testing showed an I² value of 52.3%, and we used a fixed-effects model to pool HR and 95% CI. A comprehensive analysis of three datasets indicated that IDO positivity/high expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with CRC (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.99,P= 0.044) (Fig.3).

Out of the included studies, two investigations explored the link between IDO levels and the occurrence of liver metastasis in CRC, with both exhibiting HRs above 1 [18,21]. With an I² statistic of 71.1%, a fixed-effects model was deemed appropriate for synthesizing the HR and 95% CI. The pooled analysis of these two datasets revealed that elevated IDO levels were correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in CRC patients with liver metastasis (HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.0-1.97,P= 0.04) (Fig.5). Additionally, two studies evaluated the relationship between IDO levels and lymphatic infiltration in CRC, both showing HRs above 1 [5,16]. With an I² value of 55.9%, a fixed-effects model was utilized to amalgamate the HR and 95% CI.The synthesis of data from these studies suggested that high IDO levels were tied to a negative prognosis in CRC patients with lymphatic infiltration (pooled HR 2.75, 95% CI 1.52–4.97,P< 0.001) (Fig.5).

Given the heterogeneity in OS and DFS outcomes in this meta-analysis, subgroup analyses and regression analyses were conducted based on sample size, publication interval, study quality scores, and geographical location to examine sources of heterogeneity. Regression analyses showed that the aforementioned factors were not sources of heterogeneity for OS and DFS (Supplementary Material 3). Subgroup analyses revealed that Asian region, sample size of 100, and literature quality scores below 7 were sources of heterogeneity for OS; whereas non-Asian regions, sample sizes ≥ 100, publication intervals < 3 years, and literature quality scores ≥ 7 were sources of heterogeneity for DFS (Supplementary Material 3).

The publication bias across studies was evaluated through Begg’s test and Egger’s regression funnel plots. The funnel plot for 1-year OS was symmetrical, and Begg’s test (P= 0.624) and Egger’s test (P= 0.428) suggested no significant publication bias (Fig.6). In order to determine the robustness of the findings, sensitivity analysis was executed employing a random-effects model, showing that the influence of any individual study on the overall meta-analysis results was not substantial. (Fig.7).

This study investigated the prognostic value of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in colorectal cancer (CRC) through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. The findings showed that high IDO expression was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients, as well as with increased risks of liver metastasis and lymphatic infiltration. However, no significant association was observed between IDO expression and overall survival (OS). These results suggest that IDO may influence the progression of CRC by promoting immunosuppression and metastatic potential within the tumor microenvironment (TME), although its impact on long-term survival may be confounded by other factors. This finding provides new evidence supporting IDO as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target related to DFS and metastasis in CRC, but also suggests that its role may be context-dependent.

In this study, IDO expression was significantly associated with DFS but not OS. This discrepancy may be attributed to the following factors: First, DFS primarily reflects early tumor recurrence or metastasis risk, whereas OS is influenced by various late-stage treatments and complications. IDO may more directly influence local immune evasion and early metastasis of tumors by suppressing T cell function and promoting the activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [24,25]. One previous study showed that high IDO1 expression was associated with worse 5-year OS rates in cholangiocarcinoma (64.8% vs. 85.4%,P= 0.02) [15], while in small intestinal adenocarcinoma, it was significantly correlated with shorter PFS (P= 0.006) and OS (P= 0.034) [26]. Some studies found no significant association between IDO expression and OS—for instance, one study reported identical 26-month OS in both IDO-positive and negative patients [27]. This discrepancy may be related to tumor type. In this study, the negative results for OS may be attributed to the heterogeneity of subsequent treatments, such as interventions with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, which could potentially offset the negative impact of IDO [28]. Furthermore, subgroup analyses revealed that IDO was significantly associated with both OS and DFS in studies from non-Asian countries (e.g., Germany, Finland), whereas no such association was observed in studies from Asian regions (e.g., Japan). This geographical variation may reflect biological heterogeneity in IDO expression or differences in population genetic backgrounds. Finally, the lack of standardization in IDO detection methods and cutoff values may introduce heterogeneity. For instance, some studies measured tumor-cell IDO expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC), while others assessed stromal/plasma IDO activity [15].

The correlation between high IDO expression and DFS/metastasis risk suggests its dual role in CRC progression: on one hand, IDO exerts dual effects in CRC through the tryptophan metabolic pathway (direct immunosuppression) and MDSCs/Tregs recruitment (indirect pro-metastasis), but its prognostic significance may be influenced by tumor type, microenvironment heterogeneity, and therapeutic interventions [29,30]. IDO inhibitors (e.g., 1-MT) or combined immune checkpoint blockade may serve as potential strategies to reverse immunosuppression and suppress metastasis [31]. Conversely, IDO operates via dual mechanisms: (1) directly activating MDSC-mediated immunosuppression, and (2) inducing Treg expansion—collectively shaping an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance metastatic potential [32,33]. Combined intervention strategies targeting the IDO-MDSCs-Tregs axis (such as IDO inhibitors combined with immune checkpoint blockade) have shown potential in suppressing metastasis [34]. For instance, Miaoqing Wu et al. [35] demonstrated IDO expression’s significant association with liver metastasis, likely linked to its modulation of hepatic immune microenvironments. Notably, the role of IDO may vary depending on tumor stage or treatment context. In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant therapy, some studies support that high IDO1 expression leads to shortened DFS by reducing CD8 + T cell infiltration and function, and may also diminish the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. IDO1-targeted combination therapies (e.g., IDO inhibitors + chemotherapy/radiotherapy) may represent potential strategies for improving prognosis [29,36].

The present meta-analysis indicates that the IDO may serve as a predictive biomarker for CRC patients. Findings from this study could contribute to elucidating the role of IDO in the progression and management of CRC, offering insights into the development of tailored therapeutic approaches.
