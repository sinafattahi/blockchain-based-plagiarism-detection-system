Pregnant women and their fetuses would be a high-risk population and more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, quarantine, social distancing and isolation, and the consequences were likely to increase the risk of domestic violence dramatically. This study aimed to explore women’s experiences of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This qualitative study was conducted from November 2020 to December 2022 in Mashhad, Iran. Data were collected through remote individual semi-structured interviews with 9 women who experienced perinatal domestic violence, and 7 key informants with relevant specialists, until data saturation was achieved. The data were analysed using conventional content analysis, as adopted by Graneheim and Lundman.

The 4 main themes that emerged from the data analysis were “aggravators of perinatal violence”, “enhanced vulnerability”, “strategies for dealing with perinatal violence” and “neglected needs”.

The high prevalence and the adverse consequences of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis provide a golden opportunity for performing appropriate interventions. The perinatal period provides a crucial opportunity to identify and support pregnant women who have been victimized and may have lost contact with other supportive services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological and physical support, as well as social connectedness, are important strategies during the period of isolation for individuals at risk of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted sexual and reproductive health services worldwide, leading to numerous unwanted pregnancies, maternal and neonatal deaths, and stillbirths, with negative impacts on women’s mental health outcomes [1]. Because of pathophysiological changes experienced during pregnancy, pregnant women and their fetuses would be a high-risk population and more susceptible to COVID-19 infection [2,3]. Adverse maternal and infant outcomes associated with this infection include a higher risk of preterm birth, cesarean birth, significant elevation in depressive and anxiety symptoms, and some cases of fetal and maternal death [4–11]. Shortly after the initial announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, the United Nations released a statement on 27 March 2020 warning of increased risk of intimate partner violence [12]. Intimate partner violence and domestic violence are often used interchangeably in the literature [13]. The World Health Organization defines domestic violence as any form of gender-based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm, or emotional distress, experienced by women [14]. Domestic violence is now considered a shadow pandemic due to increased incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic [15–19]. As the disease continues to spread in several countries, and Iran, it is suggested to consider long-term quarantine and distancing for personal protection and to prevent infection in vulnerable groups [20]. While quarantine helps reduce the risk of spreading the disease, it also poses the risk of domestic violence, particularly affecting women and children, thus contributing to another public health crisis [21]. Many women, when quarantined, face financial problems, job losses, and increased household responsibilities, such as taking care of their children and other family members. These circumstances have led to reduced access to security resources for women, increasing domestic violence [22]. Social distancing might increase the risk of domestic violence against women, which is the most common form of violence against women [23]. A recent study indicated that the risk of women’s exposure to domestic violence is higher during the COVID-19 quarantine period, because of the long time couples have to spend together and their inability to leave home. Similarly, domestic violence increased due to the financial difficulties and job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic [24]. The current pandemic has created a paradox, as staying at home to stay safe may also lead to increased risk for some individuals [25]. Staying at home and experiencing social and functional isolation increases the risk of being victimized due to limited family support. According to Bright et al. (2020), social isolation during a crisis escalates domestic violence [26]. The results of a recent study confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to a substantial increase in anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women [27]. During the pandemic, prenatal domestic violence led to an increase in mental disorders in South Africa [28] and a reduced quality of life in Iran [29].

Perinatal domestic violence refers to violence that occurs in the 12 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and up to one year postpartum [30]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 22% of pregnant women have reported experiencing domestic violence, according to a recent review. The highest prevalence of violence has been attributed to psychological violence, while the lowest prevalence was related to sexual violence [31]. During the pandemic, the prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 7.1% in Ethiopia [32] and 35.2% in Iran [29]. The prevalence of violence might be higher because many victimized women are not reported for various reasons during the current pandemic. For example, the perpetrators may use their power to reduce women’s access to services, assistance, and support networks and restrict their access to health care [31]. Domestic violence is often under-reported in many countries because of the normalization of violence against women, the stigma associated with disclosure, poor response or non-existent systems, and weak enforcement of laws [33–35]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare practitioners have been increasingly responsible for screening and addressing domestic violence [36], and it is important to maintain social connections during periods of isolation [37]. In addition, the general public must be informed about locally available services such as telehealth, hotlines, shelters, and counselling services. Mental health professionals can offer valuable psychological support, helping people to manage their mental health [38].

As domestic violence during pregnancy has a close association with the social, regional, and cultural context, it is crucial to collect relevant information across various social, geographical, and cultural contexts [39], therefore conducting the research in a certain local context can be the most important factor in better clarification and move toward resolving the problem of domestic violence. To get a deeper understanding of women’s experience of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to conduct a qualitative study that encompasses maternal behaviors and needs. Understanding the experience of domestic violence among these victimized women is essential to designing evidence-based domestic violence prevention strategies and programs in crisis. To the best of our knowledge, this study would be the first one to explore Iranian women’s experience of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A qualitative study with a conventional content analysis approach was conducted from November 2020 to December 2022 to gain a more detailed understanding of the women’s experience of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic [40].

The study was carried out with nine postpartum women who experienced domestic violence during the perinatal period (12 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and up to one year after delivery) during the COVID-19 pandemic and seven key informants who were specialists in reproductive health, social working, psychology, law, and sociology in Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan Razavi Province in the northeast of Iran. The participants were selected via purposive maximum variation sampling from comprehensive health centres, obstetrics and gynecology departments of referral hospitals, and prenatal clinics. Iranian women who experienced positive perinatal violence according to the HITS checklist (Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream) during the COVID-19 pandemic and were capable of sharing their related experiences were considered for inclusion. The HITS scale is a brief screening tool for domestic violence, consisting of four questions related to partner violence. Scores range from 4 to 20, with a score above 10 indicating the presence of domestic violence [41]. The Persian version of the HITS scale is a valid and reliable tool for screening domestic violence in Iranian women [42]. Maternal unwillingness to participate in research and mental and physical disease were the exclusion criteria. The participants’ profile is shown in Tables1and2.

Data were collected by the researcher (MAB), who has conducted several qualitative studies on domestic violence, with 25 years of experience in reproductive health, using semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews. Remote interviews were conducted at a time suitable for the participants and were audio-recorded until data saturation was achieved. An interview script with open-ended guiding questions was used to explain women’s experiences of perinatal domestic violence, and the main question was as follows: “Please describe your experience of violence during pregnancy or postpartum in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during public stay-at-home orders?” Other questions that followed the main question were “How do you react when you are abused?” and “What do you expect of the health care system or other supportive services to provide for you?” The questions asked of key informants were: “What is your experience of confronting women who have experienced perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic?“, “What is your experience of providing care to women who have experienced perinatal violence during the COVID-19 pandemic?“, “How do you assess the needs of women experiencing perinatal violence during the COVID-19 pandemic?“, and “Based on your experience, what interventions can reduce domestic violence among these abused women during the COVID-19 pandemic?“. The duration of the interviews ranged from 45 min to 1 h and 15 min.

A conventional content analysis method proposed by Graneheim and Lundman was used to analyse the transcribed data concurrently with data collection by MAXQDA software (version 10, VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany) [43]. The researcher (MAB) performed the five recommended steps as follows: listened to each interview several times then transcribed the interview verbatim and read it repeatedly to get familiarization with the data; divided the text of each interview into meaning units; condensed, summarized, and coded the meaning units; compared the codes according to the similarities and differences and classified them into subcategories and categories; and developed the latent content of the text.

The rigor and trustworthiness of the data were approved based on Guba and Lincoln’s criteria, which included credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability [44]. Two expert supervisors reviewed and verified the processes of data collection, data analysis, and interpreting the results to maintain the credibility of the results. Purposive maximum variation sampling and proper participants and key informants were accomplished to increase credibility. The dependability of data analysis was established by two independent, experienced qualitative researchers who confirmed its accuracy. The main supervisor and two other skilled faculty members outside the field of the study checked some of the transcripts, the codes, and the categories, and the process of analysis was confirmed. The research context, participants, data collection, and data analysis were described in detail for further evaluation to facilitate transferability.

The present study and the use of verbal consent were approved by the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences with the Ethics Code of IR.MUMS.NURSE.REC.1399.048 and accomplished according to the Declaration of Helsinki [45]. The study’s objective was explained to the participants, who were given the option to participate voluntarily and withdraw from the study at any time they wanted. Verbal informed consent was described to all the participants and obtained due to the need for telephone interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interview was stopped if any of the questions caused distress for the participants. However, with their permission, it was resumed after some time. The participants’ privacy and the confidentiality of data were respected. The participants received the necessary information about the supportive virtual services for abused women after the interviews were completed. Psychological support and telephone counselling were provided to the participants since they had been affected by domestic violence and had higher HITS scores. Similarly, they were referred to 1480 telephone counselling.

The participants included 9 abused postpartum women who had been subjected to domestic violence since their pregnancy and before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 7 key informants with relevant expertise. The abused women’s ages ranged from 19 to 37 years. Education levels ranged from 7 years to a Doctor of Philosophy degree. HITS score ranged from 11 to 18. The profile of participants is shown in Tables 1 and 2.

In the present research, 856 codes, 37 subcategories, 13 categories, and four main themes emerged from the data analysis. The data analysis processes recognized “aggravators of perinatal violence”, “enhanced vulnerability”, “strategies for dealing with perinatal violence” and “neglected needs” as the principal themes. “Aggravators of perinatal violence” was consist of three categories, containing “home quarantine”, “decline in the economy” and “multiple debilitating mental conflicts”. “Enhanced vulnerability” was consist of three categories, enclosing “intensified violence”, “intensification of physical vulnerability” and “restrictions on pregnancy and childbirth care”. “Strategies for dealing with perinatal violence” was consist of four categories, containing “concealment”, “passive reactions “, “protection of family privacy” and “reduced help-seeking”. “Neglected needs” was consist of three categories, including “identifying violence and promoting care”, “family involvement” and “promotion of intersectional cooperation”. A more detailed presentation of the results is shown in Table3.

“Aggravators of perinatal violence”, “enhanced vulnerability”, “strategies for dealing with perinatal violence”, and “neglected needs” were the main concepts that emerged from the data analysis.

Home quarantine, the decline in the economy, and multiple debilitating mental conflicts aggravated the perinatal violence.

Forced to stay at home and social restrictions limited familial and social support for abused women.

“My husband was at home more time because the company said to work remotely. Well, when a person stays at home for a long time, he gets bored and that causes fights and arguments.” (Participant 8, 12 months after birth).

“The spread of Corona and the need for women to stay at home has exposed more women to violence.” (Participant 12, key informant).

“Before, when there was a fight in the house, the mother would go out to discharge her emotions, by seeing a friend, by shopping…, now everyone stays at home and it causes the violence to intensify.” (Participant 5, 6 months after birth).

“The issue of social isolation is very traumatic for mothers because a large part of the mothers’ recreational and mental discharge needs were through communication with women and friends around them, which they lost due to COVID-19.” (Participant 6, 12 months after birth).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, intensification of economic difficulties, job loss, gender inequality in online employment, and financial concerns related to pregnancy and childbirth caused a decline in the economy.

Abused pregnant women experienced characteristic stress factors as a result of increased financial difficulties associated with childbirth, worries about access to perinatal healthcare, and the influence of the covid-19 on maternal and child health during the perinatal period.

Multiple debilitating mental conflicts included increased mood disorders in the family (stress, anxiety, and fear) and restrictions on healthy emotional discharge.

Intensified violence, intensification of physical vulnerability, and restrictions on pregnancy and childbirth care caused a maternal intensification of vulnerability.

Violence against pregnant women, which started before pregnancy, continued and intensified during the COVID-19 crisis.

Nutritional deficiencies, intensification of housework, additional household responsibilities, and exposure to pregnancy and childbirth emergencies caused intensification of physical vulnerability.

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, restrictions on pregnancy and childbirth care consisted of reduced routine perinatal care, irregular perinatal care, reduced perinatal screening, increased unwanted pregnancy, and non-recognition of violence by the health care system.

Unwanted pregnancy was increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessity of staying at home and reducing health care services for women.

Corona impressed the strategies that the abused mothers use to manage domestic violence. These strategies contained concealment, passive reactions, protection of family privacy, and reduced help-seeking.

Concealment of violence was one of the most common strategies used by abused pregnant women to deal with domestic violence.

Passive reactions consisted of silence, tolerance, patience, and obedience. Usually, abused mothers use passive reactions to reduce psychological complications and calm the situation.

Protection of family privacy consisted of resilience, maintaining maternal commitment, providing financial support, offering emotional support, and strengthening spirituality.

The result of the present study revealed that abused mothers were less likely to disclose violence to gain formal and informal support and help-seeking.

Neglected needs included identifying violence and promoting care, family involvement, and the promotion of intersectional cooperation.

Identifying violence and promoting care included screening for violence during perinatal care, providing perinatal and childbirth care, and providing maternal mental and physical health.

Promotion of intersectional cooperation consisted of the provision of legal support for abused women, the provision of psychological counselling by a health centers' psychologist and welfare counseling centers for couples, the necessity of teaching life skills to family members through the media, and emphasizing the participation of family members in household affairs through the media.

This is the first qualitative study in Iran that investigated the women’s experience of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. These abused women are confronted with aggravators of perinatal violence, enhanced vulnerability, strategies for dealing with perinatal violence, and neglected needs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women who experienced abuse exhibited significantly elevated levels of stress and anxiety. This heightened psychological distress places them at a substantially greater risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, including complications during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum. The findings of the present study are consistent with prior research, which also reported increased stress levels among pregnant women, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic [46,47]. These results underscore the compounding effect of domestic violence and pandemic-related stressors, suggesting that the intersection of these two risk factors may exacerbate both mental health challenges and perinatal health risks. Therefore, it is critical to develop targeted interventions and support systems that address both the psychological and physical health needs of abused pregnant women during public health crises.

The results of the present study demonstrated the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prenatal care and the harmful effects of maternal psychological stress on adverse maternal and neonatal consequences and perinatal emergencies. Abused pregnant women reported experiencing high stress related to the impact of COVID-19 on the fetus and their lack of preparation for the birth due to the crisis. The result is similar to Pries et al. [48], who addressed the maternal stress due to a lack of birth preparation and the adverse effects of COVID on the fetus. These insights underscore the urgent need for integrated prenatal care models that are resilient to public health emergencies and responsive to the unique needs of vulnerable populations, particularly those affected by domestic violence.

During the quarantine period, the risk of pregnant women’s exposure to domestic violence was higher due to the prolonged period couples had to spend together and their necessity to stay at home. Staying at home limited familial support and increased social isolation, which increased the risk of domestic violence. Similarly, Bright et al. demonstrated that domestic violence increased with social isolation and in times of the COVID-19 crisis [26]. Collectively, these results emphasise the need for proactive strategies and policy responses that account for the unintended consequences of quarantine measures, particularly for at-risk populations such as pregnant women experiencing intimate partner violence.

According to the result of the present study social distancing, staying at home, economic difficulties, and closures of many supportive resources increased the risk of domestic violence which was similar to Girmay et al. study that reported the increase in domestic violence from the issuance of stay-at-home order, social isolation and quarantine came into effect [49]. The enforced confinement, while intended to protect public health, inadvertently led to greater stress within households, particularly for pregnant women who faced both physical and emotional vulnerabilities. Economic strain, limited access to external support, and the isolation brought on by the pandemic not only intensified relationship tensions but also restricted opportunities for women to seek help or escape abusive situations. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need for robust, multi-level support systems and targeted interventions capable of addressing the compounded risks associated with domestic violence, particularly during public health emergencies, when access to conventional protective and social resources is significantly constrained.

Similar to the Brooks et al. study [50] the results of the present study showed that abused pregnant women experienced increased financial demands associated with childbirth, concerns about access to perinatal healthcare, and the impact of the virus on the maternal physical and mental health and the unborn child during the perinatal period. These findings suggest that perinatal domestic violence does not occur in isolation; rather, it intersects with broader systemic issues, such as healthcare inequities, financial insecurity, and public health crises, to compound the vulnerability of affected women. As such, the perinatal experience for abused women is shaped by multidimensional threats that amplify risk and undermine well-being. This calls for integrated intervention strategies that not only address the immediate effects of abuse but also consider the broader socio-economic and health-related contexts in which these women live.

The results suggested the importance of screening for domestic violence in perinatal care in health care centers during the crisis, as well as the obligation of developing proper interventions for abused pregnant women to decrease the adverse consequences. The results are similar to Naghizadeh et al., who emphasized the necessity of conducting proper interventions to address domestic violence to improve the quality of life in women [29].Therefore addressing domestic violence during pregnancy is not solely a matter of individual well-being, but a broader public health imperative that demands coordinated, multi-sectoral responses.

Despite the high prevalence of domestic violence and the increased risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare professionals were not well trained to screen perinatal domestic violence or to take action if domestic violence was identified. This result is similar to a previous study that showed inadequate information on screening and appropriate intervention among health care providers about violence [51]. Lack of preparedness limited the healthcare professionals’ ability to provide timely and effective interventions for vulnerable women during a critical period. The persistence of this issue points to a systemic shortcoming within the healthcare system that may have serious implications for the physical and psychological well-being of pregnant and postpartum women, as well as their infants.

Similar to the Kotlar et al. study [52], during the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal care visits decreased, potentially harmful strategies such as increasing the time between perinatal visits were established, and the healthcare infrastructure was strained. These conditions contributed to reduced access to essential maternal health services, particularly for vulnerable populations, and raised serious concerns about the long-term impacts on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Consistent with the findings of Berry et al. [33] and Amel Barez et al. [35] studies, according to the result of the present study domestic violence was often concealed due to the stigma associated with reporting, normalization of violence against women, non-existent or poor response systems, and weak laws and poor enforcement of laws. The lack of comprehensive or accessible support systems, such as shelters, counselling services, or trained responders, meant that even when women did attempt to report abuse, they were often met with inadequate support. Furthermore, the existence of weak legal frameworks or poor enforcement of existing laws contributed to a broader sense of impunity for perpetrators and helplessness among survivors. Together, these factors created an environment in which domestic violence could persist unchecked, with survivors left isolated and without the protection or resources they needed. findings from the present study indicated that some abused pregnant women usedsilence, tolerance, and patience strategies to minimize the recurrence of perinatal domestic violenceand keep peace in their houses during the crisis. The results are consistent with previous studies [53,54]. Such strategies, while intended to prevent further harm, can unfortunately perpetuate the cycle of abuse and contribute to long-term physical and emotional trauma.

Some abused pregnant women presented resilience and actively responded to their spouse's violent behavior in dealing with domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis. Resilience caused abused women's maternal welfare after violence. Rather than remaining passive, these women took deliberate steps to protect themselves and their unborn children, whether by setting personal boundaries, seeking support, or finding ways to emotionally distance themselves from the abuse. This resilience was not only a means of psychological survival but also played a crucial role in safeguarding their maternal well-being during and after episodes of violence. Their strength and agency, even under extreme stress and vulnerability, highlight the complex ways in which women navigate domestic violence while also trying to fulfil the emotional and physical demands of pregnancy. The result is similar to the previous studies that showed abused pregnant women may display resilience to deal with domestic violence [54,55]. Resilience, in this context, emerges as a powerful force that can mitigate the negative effects of trauma and promote maternal health despite ongoing challenges.

Most abused women used family protection privacy strategies such as maintaining maternal commitment and staying in an abusive marital relationship. For many of these women, enduring the abuse was perceived as a sacrifice made in the interest of preserving the family’s cohesion and fulfilling their role as a mother and wife, especially in contexts where cultural or societal expectations strongly emphasize family unity and a woman’s duty to sustain it. This result is in contrast to Bhandari et al. (2013) study [53] and consistent with another study [54] that suggest in some sociocultural settings, women may remain in violent relationships as an act of self-preservation and familial protection, particularly when support systems are weak, and the consequences of leaving—such as financial insecurity, social isolation, or loss of child custody—are perceived as more harmful than staying. This highlights the complex, multifaceted decision-making processes that abused women navigate, shaped by emotional, cultural, and structural factors.

Consistent with the studies conducted by Zakar et al.[56] and Amel Barez et al. [54], participants in the present studyused strengthening spiritualityto deal with domestic violence. This strategy made the abused mother calm in dealing with domestic violence. These findings underscore the powerful role that spirituality can play in empowering women to cope with trauma, especially in contexts where cultural or religious values are deeply embedded in daily life and personal identity.

In contrast with the study conducted by Amel Barez et al. (2022) [54], Zakar et al. (2012) [56], Bhandari et al. (2013) [53], and Kaye et al.(2007) [57] that demonstrated using formal and informal network support and asked help from these supportive systems for dealing with violence, the result of present study showed the reduction of help-seeking in abused pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic. The findings highlight how crises like the COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate existing barriers to support, leaving vulnerable women even more isolated and at risk. This underscores the urgent need for adaptable, accessible, and discreet support mechanisms that can function effectively during public health emergencies or other large-scale disruptions.

The Welfare Organization is one of the most important supportive organizations, which provides psychological and telephone counseling for abused women during the COVID-19 crisis. Because these women were often socially isolated and could not assess face-to-face supportive psychologic counseling, telephone counseling was an essential intervention for them. This result is similar to Kuhn's study, which emphasized telephone and mobile intervention for intimate partner violence-exposed women [58]. The current study underscores the importance of integrating flexible and scalable communication tools into domestic violence response strategies, ensuring that support remains accessible even under the most challenging circumstances. The result of the present study demonstrated the promotion of intersectional cooperation of existing supportive organizations with each other to be able to provide integrated and coordinated services to abused pregnant women and strengthen access to supportive resources without the need to allocate a special organization to this issue. This can also be economically valuable, especially in countries with limited resources.

The result is in contrast to Deuba et al. study that emphasized establishing separate organizations to provide appropriate services for young abused pregnant women [59] and is similar to Amel Barez et al. study [60].

The media had an important role in the awareness and sensitization of society about the participation of family members in household affairs, teaching life skills to family members, and reducing violence in society during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to Humphreys et al. study, the results of the present study demonstrated the benefit of a brief video on abused pregnant women's awareness and disclosure of violence to healthcare professionals [61]. For many women, exposure to such media content was a turning point that facilitated help-seeking and engagement with support services. These findings emphasise the transformative potential of media as an accessible and cost-effective tool for public education, early intervention, and the promotion of safety and well-being in vulnerable populations.

The results of this study increase understanding of Iranian pregnant women's experiences with perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could enable support systems to encourage abused women to use more effective strategies and seek help to reduce domestic violence and its adverse consequences. Due to the lack of effective intervention programs for abused women during the crisis, it is essential to conduct further research to develop clear intervention guidelines and a plan of action for all supporting organizations to reduce domestic violence in pregnancy during the crisis.

This is the first study performed in Iran to explore pregnant women's experiences of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, data collection through interviews with specialists from various disciplines, the diversity of participants, and multiple perspectives on domestic violence during pregnancy and postpartum were the strengths of this study.The patriarchal cultural context of Iran and the difficulty in obtaining responses from the abused mothers considering the taboo of violence were important limitations of this study which led to underreporting of domestic violence during pregnancy by the participants. Telephoneinterview due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing was another limitation of the study, similarly recall bias was another limitation of the present study.

The high prevalence and the adverse consequences of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis provide a golden opportunity for performing appropriate interventions. Governments and policymakers must create awareness about an increased risk of perinatal domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The perinatal period is a window of opportunity to identify and support abused pregnant who may have lost contact with other supportive services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals can support abused mothers by providing psychological and physical support for them. Similarly, maintaining social connectedness is an important strategy during crisis isolation for those who are at risk of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.
