A 71-year-old woman was hospitalized for a main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture of unknown origin. She was asymptomatic and had a history of cholelithiasis with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and following cholecystectomy, yet she denied any history of pancreatitis. Laboratory tests revealed no significant abnormalities. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed the short-segment MPD stricture in the body without a definite pancreatic mass (Fig. 1).

Preoperative imaging showed a main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture in the body and following upstream duct dilation, with absence of masses and calculi.aComputed tomography.bMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.

Therefore, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) was planned. After successful
pancreatic cannulation, repeated attempts to advance the guidewire through the stricture failed
(Fig. 2). Then, a new peroral pancreatoscope (eyeMax, 9 Fr; Micro-Tech, Nanjing, China) was
inserted. A pinhole-like concentric stricture with smooth mucosa, without protrusions,
friability or tumor vessels was found, suggestive of a benign nature1(Fig. 3). Despite guidewire manipulation under direct vision, the stricture was so narrow that
only a 0.025-inch ultra-fine guidewire (Jagwire; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts,
USA) was able to pass through (a 0.035-inch failed) (Fig. 4). In addition, the stricture was so tight that neither a sphincterotome nor dilation
bougies were able to cross, and complete guidewire blockage prevented passage of contrast agent.
A Soehendra stent retriever (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) was then used to negotiate
across the stricture. Finally, a 5-Fr × 11-cm pancreatic plastic stent (Zimmon; Cook Medical)
was successfully placed (Video 1,Fig. 5). At the six-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and free of disease
progression.

Contrast imaging demonstrated a stricture of the pancreatic duct in the pancreatic body.

Non-pancreatitis benign MPD stricture is rare and its differentiation from malignancy is challenging. Similar to cholangioscopy, peroral pancreatoscopy is useful in the diagnosis of an indeterminate MPD stricture by providing direct visualization and targeted biopsy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-assisted rendezvous often serves as an important rescue procedure when conventional ERP fails23. In our case, pancreatoscopy was an effective alternative method. To our best knowledge, this is the first case of pancreatoscopy-guided precision guidewire placement and stenting for non-pancreatitis benign MPD stricture.
