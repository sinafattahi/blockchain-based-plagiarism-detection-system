Cultivated strawberryFragaria×ananassa(Duch.) is an economically important small fruit. Flowering habit is a key trait of interest in cultivar development and agricultural production. Two cultivar types are distinguished: seasonal flowering (SF) varieties, which require a sufficiently short day length to initiate flowering; and perpetual flowering (PF) varieties, which are photoperiod‐insensitive and continuously flowering at permissive temperatures. Identifying marker‐trait associations (MTAs) and genes related to flowering time is an ongoing goal. SF and PF accessions of the ancestral octoploidFragaria virginianawere used in crossing and backcrossing to generate a BC1F1mapping population, which was genotyped on the IStraw90 SNP array to develop a linkage map using JoinMap 4.1. MTA analysis was done by chi‐square test for independence and compared with analyses done using FlexQTL and WinQTLCart. Six MTAs for PF were mapped, suggesting complex genetic regulation. These MTAs were distributed across five linkage groups (LGs) representing four chromosomal homeology groups. Surprisingly, none of these six MTAs were assigned to a member of theF. virginianasubgenome A, the octoploid strawberry subgenome widely agreed to descend from the ancestral diploidFragaria vesca. This important distinction extended to the strong MTAs on LG14, which our analysis assigned to the same homeology group but not the same homeolog previously assigned to the well‐studiedFaPFRUlocus conferring continuous flowering inF. ×ananassa. This alternative localization may help to explain why the gene(s) underlyingFaPFRUhave remained unidentified in the 13 years since its discovery.

The perpetual flowering trait confers continuous or repeated flowering and an extended harvest season in strawberry.

Breeding for perpetual flowering can be aided by developing and implementing trait‐associated molecular markers.

Marker‐trait association analysis in wild relatives advances identification of cultivated strawberry perpetual flowering genes.

The goal is to identify genes that influence the agriculturally important trait of flowering habit, that is, the timing of flowering and fruiting in response to environmental factors, in the wild strawberry species,Fragaria virginiana, an ancestor of the cultivated strawberryF. × ananassa. For this purpose,F. virginianaplants displaying alternate forms, seasonal versus continuous flowering, were collected in New Hampshire and British Columbia, respectively, and subjected to genetic analysis via sexual hybridization and DNA sequence analysis of the offspring. Each progeny plant was rated for its flowering habit, and 80 progeny plants were DNA‐fingerprinted with respect to 1064 mapped genetic markers widely distributed in the genome. Based on marker‐trait correlation, six chromosomal regions were found to be associated with flowering habit. These findings are expected to help strawberry breeders use DNA fingerprinting to more efficiently select new varieties with desirable traits.

The octoploid (2n= 8x= 56) cultivated strawberry,Fragaria×ananassaDuch., is well known for demand for its fresh produce and nutritional benefits. The timing and frequency of fruit production in this valuable fruit species depend on the photoperiodic flowering habit of the respective cultivar. The short days and cold conditions of autumn trigger flowering initiation in seasonal flowering (SF) strawberries. In these SF types, the previously initiated flowers typically emerge and open under warmer temperatures and longer days of the following spring (Heide et al.,2013; Savini et al.,2005). In contrast, continuous flowering types are photoperiod insensitive, exhibiting perpetual flowering (PF) under permissive temperatures. Because high temperature influences and can interrupt the day‐neutral flowering response, resulting in a pattern of repeated flowering, the term remontancy is often used in reference to the PF habit by researchers extensively working on this trait (Castro et al.,2015; Sooriyapathirana et al.,2015).

In the United States, breeding for PF cultivars gained traction when a wild PF germplasm accession of octoploidFragaria virginianasubsp.glauca(Wats.) was collected from the Wasatch mountains near Salt Lake City, UT, in 1954 (Ahmadi et al.,1990) and used in cultivar improvement in the University of California‐Davis strawberry breeding program. Since then, many popular PF cultivars in the United States have been bred with Wats. as the source of the PF trait (Darrow,1966; Hancock et al.,2001).

Marker‐assisted breeding facilitated by mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to various traits (Lerceteau‐Köhler et al.,2012; Whitaker et al.,2020) has been an increasing basis for improving strawberry cultivars. Several studies employing QTL mapping for PF have supported the hypothesis of multigenic inheritance of PF in octoploid strawberries (Castro & Lewers,2016; Castro et al.,2015; Cockerton et al.,2023; Gaston et al.,2013; Hancock et al.,2002; Lewers et al.,2019; Serçe & Hancock,2005; Verma et al.,2017; Weebadde et al.,2007). However, most attention has been directed to a single dominant locus, namedPERPETUAL FLOWERING AND RUNNERING(FaPFRU) (Gaston et al.,2013).

TheFaPFRUlocus regulating perpetual versus SF in octoploid strawberry was identified for the first time and localized to a linkage group (LG) identified as LGIV‐b inF. × ananassabased on linkage mapping in a “pseudo full‐sibling F1 population” of the SF × PF cross between cultivars CF1116 and Capitola (Gaston et al.,2013). Another study used a range of germplasm from the RosBREED project (Iezzoni et al.,2020) representing two breeding programs in MI and OR (PF sourceF. virginianasubsp.glaucaWats.) to develop a linkage map and conduct QTL analysis based on single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers (Verma et al.,2017). The study also confirmed a major QTL for flowering habit,FaPFRU, this time in the LG identified as LGIV‐A. In a study involving multiple families, a derivative ofF. × ananassacultivars from the Wasatch mountains’ source of the PF trait, the dominant allele at theFaPFRUlocus, was associated with repeated fruiting (Lewers et al.,2019). This study also implicated at least two other genes, one dominant and one recessive, that epistatically suppress repeated fruiting. In the latest iteration, a three‐locus model has been suggested, involvingFaPFRUand two epistatic modifiers (Cockerton et al.,2023).

The plant materials used to investigate repeated fruiting in cultivated strawberries by most of the studies have the Wats. source of PF (Castro & Lewers,2016; Castro et al.,2015; Gaston et al.,2013; Honjo et al.,2020; Lewers et al.,2019; Verma et al.,2017; Weebadde et al.,2007), while for some studied germplasm the source was unspecified (Honjo et al.,2020). Exploring other wild or domesticated PF accessions may reveal new genes influencing the trait. Identification of QTLs and genes expressed in different geographical locations and populations with a new source of PF trait may be necessary to fully understand the genetic basis of PF flowering habit in octoploid strawberries.

Here we present the results of marker‐trait association (MTA) mapping in a population with distinct sources for the PF and SF traits: octoploid (2n= 8x= 56)F. virginianaaccessions BC6 and L1, collected from the wild by Tom Davis (Davis et al.,2020) from, respectively, British Columbia, Canada, and Lincoln, New Hampshire, United States. Specifically, a selected F1hybrid designated LB48 from the cross L1 × BC6 was backcrossed as male to L1, generating our octoploid‐based LB48 mapping population, which was segregating for the PF trait as well as for numerous SNP markers as genotyped on the widely used IStraw90K strawberry SNP array. The present study takes advantage of our prior use ofF. virginianahybrid LB48 in a cross as male with the strawberry diploid (2n= 2x= 14) model plantFragaria vesca‘Hawaii 4’, thereby generating a pentaploid progeny population that was used to construct a novel, pentaploid‐based linkage map of LB48 (Davis et al.,2020). This map contained 5066 markers genotyped on the IStraw90K array, thus providing an opportunity for informative comparison between pentaploid‐based and octoploid‐based LB48 linkage maps. Perhaps due to the timing of seedling establishment and/or the PF habit of diploid crossing partner Hawaii 4, the pentaploid mapping population did not provide phenotypic segregation data with respect to flowering habit', nor was it intended to. However, illumination of the seven A‐subgenome LGs and the tentative identification of seven “b” subgenome LGs in the pentaploid study provided a valuable basis for comparison with the corresponding LGs as defined by the present study.

This study employed the following wild octoploid strawberries:F. virginianasubsp.virginiana(PI 660769), collected near the town of Lincoln, NH, and designated as L1;F. virginianasubsp.glauca(PI 660767), collected near the town of McBride, British Columbia, Canada, and designated as BC6; and their hybrid derivatives. L1 is an SF female accession, while BC6 is a PF hermaphrodite (Davis et al.,2020). Hermaphroditic F1hybrid LB48 (PI 664374), derived from the cross L1 × BC6 (Davis et al.,2020), was utilized as the pollen parent in a backcross to L1 as the female, recurrent parent (Figure1). The seed from the backcross was then grown to establish a segregating BC1F1population of sizeN= 120. The parental accessions L1, BC6, and LB48 are maintained and disseminated by the USDA National Clonal Plant Germplasm Repository in Corvallis, Oregon, under the PI numbers indicated above. Notably, octoploid hybrid LB48 was previously used as paternal parent in a cross with the PF inbred diploidF. vesca‘Hawaii 4′ to produce a pentaploid mapping population and pentaploid‐based LB48 linkage map (Davis et al.,2020).

Marker‐trait association analysis in wild relatives advances identification of cultivated strawberry perpetual flowering genes.

Seeds sown in seedling trays containing the PRO‐MIX HPCC MYCORRHIZAE substrate (Premier Tech Horticulture Ltd.) were kept in the dark for 15 days at 21°C, then incubated under grow‐light conditions in a CONVIRON PGR15 growth chamber for another 15 days, providing a cycle of 16‐h light/8‐h dark. In the growth chamber, day/night temperatures of 22°C/20°C and relative humidity (RH) of 95%/85% were maintained. A combination of fluorescent and incandescent lamps provided a light intensity of 875 µmol m−2s−1. The established seedlings (4 weeks old) were then transferred into plug trays and maintained in the greenhouse at an average daily temperature of 18°C (day 22°C and night 13°C) and RH of 48%. During the germination and seedling growth period, long‐day conditions (16 h day length) were maintained by providing artificial light to suppress SF. On June 6, 2019, seedlings at vegetative growth stage (11 weeks old) were pruned for runners (if present) and transplanted to the field at the Woodman Horticultural Research Farm, Durham, NH (FigureS1). Clones of each BC1F1plant, propagated through runners from the field, were subsequently maintained in the greenhouse from September 2019 to October 2020 under supplemental 8‐h light. Healthy runner nodes with one to two trifoliate leaves and emerging root tips were cut off from plants in late August and anchored to the moist substrate in plug trays. The trays were kept under mist for a week, then moved to a greenhouse bench for 8 weeks, and eventually transplanted into 20‐cm diameter pots. Plants in the pots were spaced 20 × 20 cm apart and supplied with drip irrigation.

The population was monitored in the field from June 2019 to May 2020, and in the greenhouse from September 2019 to October 2020. Three traits were recorded: presence or absence of runners, date of first flowering, and sex expression, which was determined by observing anthers and stigmas under a magnifying lens. Based on field observation through October 2019 and greenhouse observations from September to November, plants exhibiting SF phenotype were noted as NF (non‐flowering [NF] during field observation period) and the PF ones as F. For subsequent marker genotyping, 80 plants were selected, including all 17 F segregants and 63 selected NF segregants. Among the NF segregants, individuals were chosen at random, with priority given to those exhibiting noticeable morphological variation in the field, such as differences in plant vigor and leaf shape. The selection process for genotyping ensured inclusion of plants with visible phenotypic variation.

Young unexpanded leaves from the selected BC1F1plants and the parental accessions (L1, BC6, and LB48) were collected on ice and shipped to Eurofins BioDiagnostics, Inc. for DNA extraction and genotyping on the IStraw90KFragariawhole genome genotyping arrays. Results from genotyping, obtained as cell files for individual samples, were imported into the Axiom Analysis Suite Version 4.0.1.9 for SNP genotyping. The SNPs on the array are classified into three design categories: octoploid‐based SNPs (based on SNPs discovered in a diverse, octoploid discovery panel); F1D SNPs (based on polymorphisms discovered in ancestral diploidFragaria iinumae); and codon‐based (non‐discovery) SNPs as previously defined (Bassil et al.,2015; Mahoney et al.,2016). During the analysis, the SNPs were divided into six performance categories: poly high resolution (PHR); mono high resolution (MHR); no minor homozygote (NMH); off target variation (OTV); call rate below threshold (CRBT); and other as previously defined (Bassil et al.,2015). In the array output, missing data were represented by “−1” while the marker genotypes were simplified in a biallelic format (AA, AB, and BB coded as 0, 1, and 2).

Markers were subjected to various filters (TableS1) to retain suitable markers for linkage mapping. Qualifying markers were restricted to those in performance categories PHR and NMH (TableS2). The JoinMap 4.1 standard coding scheme for the BC (backcross) cross type (“a” for maternal, “b” for paternal, “h” for heterozygous) (Van Ooijen,2006) was used to code marker genotypes of the progeny population (TableS3). Filtered and coded data were imported into the software to generate LGs using default parameters. Grouping trees of linked markers developed by the JoinMap software based on maximum likelihood function and the default parameters was used to generate LGs at a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 9 or higher. The LGs were numbered based on marker commonality with the LGs of the prior pentaploid‐based map of hybrid LB48 (Davis et al.,2020).

Marker genotype data from all the LGs were used for MTA analysis. The number of plants in the F and NF categories, the frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous marker genotypes within the F and NF categories, and the frequencies of total homozygous and heterozygous genotypes were used to construct 2 × 2 chi‐square contingency tables to test the association between markers and the phenotypic categories F and NF as observed during the months of June–July (TableS4). Associated loci in the linkage map were determined based on the position of the markers, resulting in a significant chi‐square value (>6.64) at the 0.01 level of significance anddf= 1.

VisualFlexQTL v0.1 (Bink,2005) and MapChart v2.32 software (Voorrips,2002), available atwww.flexqtl.nlwere also used for MTA mapping and map chart development. In the parameter file (.par), Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation chain was adjusted as suggested (Bink et al.,2014), starting from 25,000, until an effective chain size of >100 was obtained for three different parameter settings of prior distributions (prior QTL) 1, 3, and 5. Since the phenotypic data were qualitative (F was assigned “1” and NF, “0”), rather than quantitative, different model iterations within parameter files were used for the analysis. The analysis of six combinations, three levels of priors, Prior (QTL) 1, 3, 5, and two levels of the indicator of major gene analysis (FPM) 0 (excluded), and 1 (major gene unknown) was used to interpret the result. A mixed model for the dominance and additive effects was used. Inference on the position of MTA was done based on the posterior QTL probability estimate. Likewise, inference on the number of true loci was based on twice the natural log of Bayes Factor [2ln(BF)]; values 2, 5, and 10 indicate positive, strong, and decisive evidence, respectively.

The software WinQTLCart2.5 (Wang et al.,2007) was used to perform composite interval mapping (CIM) to detect the marker loci associated with the PF trait. Because the data were collected as qualitative categories (F and NF), the values for the two categories were assigned as 0 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for the trait in the software was calculated using 1000 permutations at α = 0.005. Using the standard model (Model 6), a window size of 10 cM, walk speed of 1 cM, and 5 marker cofactors determined by forward and backward regression, CIM was performed.

The MTAs identified by chi‐square test and by FlexQTL and WinQTLCart were compared based on the genetic map distance and the position of markers. The consensus locations of trait‐associated markers were determined. The 71–74 bp flanking sequences associated with SNP markers in the respective LGs of the LB48 and pentaploid‐based linkage maps (Davis et al.,2020) were blasted against theF. × ananassaRoyal Royce v1.0 reference genome (Hardigan et al.,2021) to help illuminate their genomic locations. Nucleotide BLAST search was performed in the plant comparative genomics portal (https://phytozome‐next.jgi.doe.gov) of the Joint Genome Institute, Department of Energy.

All plants began producing runners 5 weeks after germination, except for three individuals that produced runners only after transplantation to the field in August, and one individual that did not produce runners at any point during the study. The development of new runners continued even during flowering in F segregants, except for cooler months: from late October to early March in the field, and from late December to February in the greenhouse. Flowering in the field was first detected on June 20, 2019, within 16 days of transplantation. Not all plants began flowering on the same day; initial flowering dates varied among individuals and were non‐uniformly distributed through June and July. Plants in the field exhibited freezing injury and began to senesce in October (FigureS2), and none of the NF segregants flowered before senescence. In early October, night temperatures in the field dropped below freezing (NCEI,2020; FigureS2). Clones of all 80 genotypes maintained in the greenhouse flowered in seedling plug trays in late October and continued flowering in 10‐cm diameter pots (FigureS3). All greenhouse plants entered dormancy from December 2019 to February 2020 (FigureS4). In 2020, plants in the field resumed growth in late March, with flowering observed in all genotypes by May, which marked the end of field observation period. In the greenhouse, flowering resumed in all genotypes in March 2020 and continued through June (FigureS3). However, the NF segregants did not flower again until mid‐October, when a second burst of flowering was observed. In contrast, the F segregants continued flowering throughout. Records of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures (NCEI,2020) and day length (USNO,2020) at Durham, New Hampshire, and average day/night temperatures maintained in the greenhouse are summarized in FiguresS2–S5. By the end of July 2019, 17 and 103 plants were classified as F and NF, respectively. The classifications (N and NF) were subsequently consistent in the greenhouse. Leaf tissue samples from all 17 F individuals and from 63 NF individuals were used for SNP genotyping. Of these 80 selected plants, 42 were female (lacking anthers) and 38 were hermaphrodites. The selection was random and unbiased with respect to sexual morphology.

Of the total 95,062 markers genotyped by the IStraw90K Array, 72,861 fell into the MHR category, followed by 11,641 NMH, 5414 Other, 3547 PHR, 1516 CRBT, and 83 OTV. Those classified as NMH and PHR, totaling 15,188 segregating markers, were subjected to various filters (TableS1), including the requirement of homozygosity in recurrent parent L1, resulting in 5297 markers suitable for constructing a linkage map of heterozygous parent LB48. Among these selected markers, 4995 were octoploid‐based, 75 were F1D based, and 227 were codon‐based, according to their previously defined design categories (TableS2) (Bassil et al.,2015; Mahoney et al.,2016).

A linkage map (the octoploid‐based LB48 map) forF. virginianawas developed using JoinMap, resulting in 29 LGs based on the grouping tree generated at a LOD score of 9 or higher (FigureS6). The designation of LG numbers from LG01 to LG28 is based on marker sharing with the LGs of the prior, pentaploid‐based LB48 linkage map (Davis et al.,2020). There were 692 markers in common between the new, octoploid‐based LB48 map and the prior, pentaploid‐based map. The additional group, LG29, has 29 markers, among which only one marker was in common with the pentaploid‐based LB48 linkage map. To designate the accurate homeology group (HG) for LG29, the sequence associated with the markers was blasted againstF. × ananassaRoyal Royce v1.0 assembly (Hardigan et al.,2021), thus assigning LG29 to HGVI (TableS5). Of the 1064 mapped markers in the new LB48 map, 713 were NMH and 351 were PHR, which included 1045 octoploid‐based, nine F1D‐based, and 10 codon‐based markers. After binning the co‐segregating markers, the total number of loci mapped was 830 across the total map length of 2202 cM (TableS6). The greatest numbers of markers and loci were in LG21 (67 and 54, respectively). The least number of markers were mapped in LG02 (18), and the least number of loci (16) were mapped in LG16.

Five of the 29 LGs had regions of significant chi‐square value, >6.64 at 0.01 level of significance anddf= 1, resulting in the identification of six MTAs (Figure2; TableS4). LG02 had a cluster of eight significant markers, with chi‐square values ranging from 7.27 to 9.39, the greatest at position 13.11 cM (AX‐89818677). This MTA, hereafter designated MTA‐02, encompasses a map interval of 19.51 cM, from 5.16 to 24.67 cM. LG03 had a cluster of six significant markers with chi‐square values ranging from 6.53 to 8.40, the greatest value at position 57.60 cM (AX‐89873202). This MTA, hereafter MTA‐03, encompasses a map interval of 10.36 cM, from 47.24 to 57.60 cM. LG08 had a single significant marker, AX‐89781020 at 29.30 cM, with a chi‐square value of 7.90, hereafter MTA‐08. LG10 had a cluster of 10 significant markers with chi‐square values ranging from 7.67 to 11.95, the greatest at position 16.52 cM (AX‐89811802). This MTA, hereafter MTA‐10, encompasses a map interval of 6.33 cM, from 13.99 to 20.32 cM. LG14 had two MTA clusters, MTA‐14a and MTA‐14b. MTA‐14a had a cluster of six significant markers with chi‐square values ranging from 7.67 to 13.07, the greatest value at position 16.87 cM (AX‐89905197). This MTA encompasses a map interval of 7.63 cM, from 14.33 to 21.96 cM. MTA‐14b had a cluster of three significant markers with chi‐square values ranging from 7.64 to 7.67, the greatest value at position 27.06 cM (AX‐89829726). This MTA encompassed a map interval of 1.26 cM, from 27.06 to 28.32 cM.

Marker‐trait associations (MTAs) for perpetual flowering inFragaria virginianamapped to linkage groups LG02 (MTA‐02), LG03 (MTA‐03), LG08 (MTA‐08), LG10 (MTA‐10), and LG14 (MTAs, 14a and 14b). Markers shown in red text are those with significant chi‐square value at the 0.01 level withdf= 1.

Use of differing parameters on FPM and prior assumptions on the number of QTLs influenced the Bayes Factor (2ln(BF)) value of the marked QTL regions in LG02, LG03, LG10, and LG14 (TableS7; Figure3). Based on the parameters, 2ln(BF) values of 2, 5, and 10 indicate positive, strong, and decisive evidence, respectively. Two strong QTLs were identified by FlexQTL: one on LG02 and one on LG14. Two additional positive QTLs were defined: one each on LG03 and LG10 (TableS7).

Each diagram represents FlexQTL output for posterior probability (y‐axis) QTL position using floor probability of the model (FPM) of 0 and 1 for each respective prior QTL assumption 1, 3, and 5. The header on each diagram represents 29 LGs, and the footer represents the length of the linkage map in cM (total 2202 cM).

The QTL analysis by WinQTLCart2.5 showed significantly associated regions in LG08 and LG14 (Figure4). The first of the three QTLs in LG14 is mapped at 14.34–15.34 cM with maximum LOD 3.8 and R2 11.3%. This QTL is flanked by markers AX‐89830030 at 14.34 cM and AX‐89829930 at 15.60 cM. The second QTL in LG14 is mapped at 20.71–21.71 cM with maximum LOD 3.9 and R2 11.8%. This QTL is flanked by markers AX‐89789369 at 19.40 cM and AX‐89829369 at 22.00 cM. The third QTL on LG14 is mapped at 25.60‐26.50 cM with maximum LOD 3.2 and R2 10.2%. This QTL is flanked by AX‐89789301 at 24.49 cM and AX‐89829726 at 27.06 cM. The only QTL in LG08 is mapped at 20.92–30.31 cM with maximum LOD 4.3 and R2 12.5%. The closest marker to the peak is AX‐89781020 at 29.30 cM, and the flanking markers are AX‐89783691 at 19.90 cM and AX‐89781194 at 30.60 cM.

(Top) Composite interval mapping revealed one QTL on LG08 at the logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold value of 3 (orange line). The red triangles represent markers closest to the peak and markers flanking the QTL. (Bottom) Composite interval mapping on WinQTLCart revealed three QTLs on LG14 at the LOD threshold value of 3 (orange line). The red triangles represent markers flanking the QTL.

All three methods used for MTA analysis identified at least one QTL on LG14 (Figure5). To determine the corresponding homeolog IDs of this study's LGs in theF. × ananassaRoyal Royce v1.0 assembly (Hardigan et al.,2021), the flanking sequences (71–74 bp) of SNP markers from LG13 and LG14 were blasted against the Royal Royce reference genome (TableS8). A total of 63 markers were used in the BLAST analysis for LG13, comprising 28 markers unique to the pentaploid‐based LB48 map, 16 markers unique to this study, and 19 markers common to both. For LG14, 41 markers were blasted, including six unique to the pentaploid‐based LB48 map, nine unique to this study, and 25 shared markers. The BLAST results revealed that many SNP marker sequences had similar levels of identity to multiple homeologs of HGVI in the Royal Royce v1.0 reference genome (Hardigan et al.,2021), as detailed in TableS8, and therefore this approach does not establish clear identification of subgenomes.

Colocalization of QTLs on LG14 identified by three different methods of marker‐trait association (MTA) mapping. (A) MTA analysis by chi‐square test for independence associated nine markers, six on MTA‐14a and three on MTA‐14b (red blocks and marker position indicated by red triangle), to the perpetual flowering. (B) QTL analysis by composite interval mapping on WinQTLCart mapped three QTLs on LG14 (brown blocks). (C) QTL mapping by Bayesian analysis on FlexQTL mapped two QTLs on LG14 (green blocks).

A qualitative criterion, flowering (F) versus NF, was used to phenotype the carefully managed BC1F1progeny population from theF. virginianaintraspecific cross designated L1 d7 LB48. The F and NF designations were provisional codes assigned during the initial field observation period in 2019. Following extended monitoring in the greenhouse, it became evident that the 17 F segregants consistently exhibited a PF habit, while the 63 NF segregants displayed an SF pattern (FiguresS2–S5). The provisional characterization of flowering plants during June‐July 2019 in the field as PF relied on the fact that SF flowering initiation was intentionally suppressed in SF but not PF plants by ensuring that all studied plants were maintained under long‐day conditions (16 h > 12 h day length, and warm temperatures) during the germination and seedling stages of the mapping population. Designating “PF” as the phenotype of individuals flowering before the photoperiod transitioning to short days is used by several prior studies, whereby the time window for phenotyping was terminated before the photoperiodic condition transitioned to short days (Ahmadi et al.,1990; Gaston et al.,2013; Lewers et al.,2019; Verma et al.,2017; Weebadde et al.,2007). In our study, all individuals classified as F had initiated flower by the end of July, and none of the NF‐classified individuals had flowering during the observational period, which extended from June planting until the first snowfall in 2019 in Durham, New Hampshire. All 80 clonally propagated and transplanted segregants flowered in October in the greenhouse in presence of cooler temperatures and short‐day conditions. All F segregants continued flowering in the field and greenhouse except for during dormancy caused by cooler temperatures. The number of QTL, or at least the strength of QTL, for PF response was previously reported to be geographic location dependent (Weebadde et al.,2007). The requirement of multiple populations or multi‐year phenotyping to evaluate true QTLs has been suggested (Bink et al.,2014; Verma et al.,2017). Although the present study is based on a single‐year and single‐field location phenotyping of 80 BC1F1progeny, the greenhouse observations were consistent. Examination of weather data indicates that 2019 was not an unusual year in NH (NCEI,2020). In the 2020 project year, all genotypes flowered in May, likely triggered by the transition to short‐day conditions following snowmelt in March 2020. In contrast, short‐day‐induced flowering was successfully avoided in the first year by maintaining seedlings under long‐day conditions in the growth chamber and greenhouse. Thus, given the careful management of this informative progeny population under reasonably typical environmental conditions, further investigation with related populations at the same location might be well justified and expected to increase the resolution of at least some of the described QTLs.

In this study of ancestral octoploidF. virginiana, six QTLs were identified as being associated with the PF trait, distributed across (LGs), LG02, LG03, LG08, LG10, and LG14 of the octoploid‐based LB48 map. The number of detected QTLs varied depending on the mapping methodologies employed. Three distinct approaches were utilized for MTA analysis: the chi‐square contingency test, and the software packages FlexQTL and WinQTLCart. QTLs on LG02, LG03, and LG10 were identified using both chi‐square tests and FlexQTL. A QTL on LG08 was identified by both chi‐square test and WinQTLCart. Notably, QTL on the LG14 was consistently detected by all three approaches.

Various marker‐trait analysis strategies have been utilized in genetic studies of the PF trait in strawberries. The chi‐square goodness‐of‐fit test is well demonstrated to assess phenotypic segregation data against Mendelian expectations (Castro & Lewers,2016; Gaston et al.,2013; Lewers et al.,2019; Weebadde et al.,2007). However, to our knowledge, the chi‐square test for independence has not been used for genome‐wide MTA studies of PF flowering in octoploid strawberries. QTL mapping for PF in strawberry performed by CIM analyses using QTL Cartographer or MapQTL (Van Ooijen,2004) is common (Castro & Lewers,2016; Gaston et al.,2013; Weebadde et al.,2007). FlexQTL, which performs QTL mapping based on Bayesian analysis, was used by Verma et al. (2017) to map QTL associated with repeated flowering in octoploid strawberry. In the present study, the multiple, confirmatory colocalizations of QTLs indicate the successful use of all three approaches, emphasizing, for the first time, the efficacy of the chi‐square contingency test in genome‐wide MTA studies of trait variation that can be treated as qualitative. The chi‐square test is suitable for single‐marker analysis of categorical data, which fits our F versus NF phenotypic classification. However, most QTL mapping in octoploid strawberry uses quantitative data and advanced methods like CIM and Bayesian approaches, as these can handle effect of multiple markers on the trait and account for polyploid complexity (Bink et al.,2014; Wang et al.,2007). Therefore, we combined the chi‐square test with WinQTL and FlexQTL to provide a comprehensive analysis.

Our finding of polygenic inheritance of PF is consistent with previous reports. Weebadde et al. (2007) constructed a genetic linkage map of PF × SF (“Tribute” × “Honeoye”) using AFLP markers, demonstrating polygenic inheritance. Their study spanned multiple geographic locations: Michigan, Minnesota, Maryland, Oregon, and California, where QTLs identified showed both shared and location‐specific patterns. Similarly, multigenic inheritance of PF in octoploid strawberry is widely supported by other linkage mapping and QTL analyses studies (Castro & Lewers,2016; Castro et al.,2015; Lewers et al.,2019; Sooriyapathirana et al.,2015). Additionally, a recent GWAS study mapped three loci, one each on Chr4A, Chr5C, and Chr6A (Cockerton et al.,2023).

Despite all the QTL findings, no specific genes confirmed to influence the PF trait have been cloned and manipulated in the octoploid strawberry. Genetic regulation of flowering habit in the diploid progenitorF. vescahas been elucidated. A single major gene,SEASONAL FLOWERING LOCUS, located in LGVI (Albani et al.,2004), was initially discovered to regulate flowering habit (Brown & Wareing,1965). Homozygosity of the recessive allele of this gene is shown to confer PF flowering in diploids. The molecular candidate gene,F. vescahomolog ofTERMINAL FLOWER, FvTFL, was identified to be a floral repressor (Iwata et al.,2012; Koskela et al.,2012). In our current study, no significant associations were found between PF and markers in HG six (HGVI), which corresponds to LGVI inF. vesca. However, it is likely that there are shared loci between our study and existing literature that mapped QTLs for PF in octoploid strawberry.

Inconsistencies in LG and pseudochromosome naming/numbering, and in assigning homeolog identities across various studies, complicate comparisons of mapped QTLs in octoploid strawberry (Verma et al.,2017). The seven pseudochromosomes of the originalF. vesca‘Hawaii’ genome assembly (Shulaev et al.,2011) and its subsequent iterations (Darwish et al.,2015) have provided the basis for HG assignments in most subsequentFragarialinkage maps and QTL studies. Thus, defining the correspondences between HG assignments per se has been relatively straightforward in octoploid strawberry. More problematic has been subgenomic assignment within HGs, both in terms of nomenclature and putative affinities to ancestral diploids (Edger et al.,2020; Liston et al.,2014). While there is general agreement that one member of each HG in octoploid strawberry represents the ancestralF. vesca‐derived subgenome and that diploidF. iinumaeplayed a contributory ancestral role, the composition and origins of the remaining subgenomes remain uncertain and controversial (Edger et al.,2019; Han et al.,2022; Hardigan et al.,2021; Jin et al.,2023).

In the present study, the nomenclature of homeology and LGs was followed in accordance with the previous, pentaploid‐based linkage map ofF. virginianaLB48 (Davis et al.,2020), HGs were assigned Roman numerals (I through VII); while LGs were assigned Arabic numerals (1 through 28), such that (for instance), HGIII consists of LGs LG09–LG12. Within each HG, the first member (lowest LG number, e.g., LG01, LG05, etc.) was the LG identified as ancestrally derived fromF. vesca. Beyond establishing a clear definition of theF. vesca“A” subgenome, the pentaploid mapping study (Davis et al.,2020) drew upon marker comparison with a prior array‐basedF. × ananassalinkage map (Sargent et al.,2016) to define the HG members with the greatest affinity to ancestral diploidF. iinumae. Thus, in the pentaploid‐based and our octoploid‐based LB48 maps, the tentatively definedF. iinumaesubgenome is composed of LGs LG03, LG08, LG11, LG15, LG19, LG24, and LG28. This tentative “b” subgenome model is now supported by k‐mer‐based analysis (Yang and Davis, manuscript in process). In the present context, this subgenomic perspective is important to MTA analysis for two reasons. First, of the six QTLs identified, none reside in the “A” (F. vesca‐derived) subgenome, while two reside on LGs 03 and 08 of theF. iinumae‐derived “b” subgenome, and four (including MTAs on LG14) reside elsewhere, in subgenomic categories lacking consensus definition. Second, the localization of theFaPFRUlocus on our LG14 disagrees with prior studies in whichFaPFRUhas been assigned to theF. vesca(A subgenome) member of HGIV.

Our two LB48 linkage maps display predominant marker collinearity, with one notable exception: the 29th group in the pentaploid‐based map could not be assigned to any group in this study. On the other hand, the 29th group of the octoploid‐based LB48 map contains a single SNP marker that was mapped on LG12 of the pentaploid‐based map. BLAST analysis of sequences associated with markers on this study's LG29 corresponds to HGVI ofF. × ananassaRoyal Royce v1.0 (Hardigan et al.,2021). No trait associations were found for the 29th group.

In the present study, all three QTL mapping approaches consistently showed a strong association of MTAs in LG14 with PF (Figure5). Given the extensive characterization ofFaPFRUas a significant QTL in HGIV ofF. × ananassa, we aimed to ascertain whether MTAs 14a and 14b, mapped on our HGIV, colocalize with it. TheFaPFRUinitially mapped in LGIV‐b ofF. × ananassa‘Capitola’ (Gaston et al.,2013) was refined to a 1.1 Mb region in the diploidF. vescagenome (Perrotte et al.,2016; Shulaev et al.,2011). Several other studies identified SSR (Castro & Lewers,2016; Castro et al.,2015; Honjo et al.,2020; Sooriyapathirana et al.,2015) and SNP (Cockerton et al.,2023; Verma et al.,2017) markers associated with theFaPFRU. However, our octoploid‐based LB48F. virginianamap lacks those markers. Furthermore, BLAST results did not clarify the subgenomic identity of LG14 (TableS8). Thus, we cannot definitively confirm or dispute the possibility of colocalization of MTAs in LG14 withFaPFRU, and they may represent homeo‐QTLs.

FaPFRUhas been mapped in populations with various breeding parents but a common PF pedigree:F. virginianasubsp.glauca(Wats.) (Gaston et al.,2013; Lewers et al.,2019; Verma et al.,2017). In our study, the PF trait also originates fromF. virginianasubsp.glauca, but from a different geographic location (British Columba), which could explain the discovery of putatively new loci contributing to the PF response in the divergent germplasm employed in the present study. From a breeding perspective, it is important to determine whether the gene(s) functionally defining thePFRUlocus exist on different HGIV LGs across germplasm. Homologous exchange of this locus could create new linkage associations that might pose challenges or opportunities for marker‐assisted breeding. The hypothesis thatPFRUcan exist in multiple chromosomal locations due to prior homologous exchange between homeologs is reasonable in the octoploid strawberry (Mason & Wendel,2020).

The use of new sources of PF and SFF. virginianagermplasm, as reported here, has contributed to the identification of MTAs defining six loci influencing PF inF. virginiana: MTA‐02, MTA‐03, MTA‐08, MTA‐10, MTA‐14a, and MTA‐14b. While the HGIV QTL is strongly supported, other QTLs identified in this study should be considered preliminary until validated by multi‐year data from the same location using closely related plant populations. Pending illumination of the relationship between the MTAs in LG14 and the knownFaPFRUQTL assigned to the A‐subgenome of HGIV, we speculate that homeo‐QTLs ofPFRUmay exist and may result from translocations between HGIV homeologs. Notably, the possibility of variable location ofFaPFRUamong members of HGIV may be a source of confusion that helps to explain why the gene(s) underlyingFaPFRUhave remained unidentified in the 13 years since its discovery. This study also establishes that PF flowering can be productively treated as a qualitative trait in octoploid strawberry under favorable experimental conditions and demonstrates the effectiveness of the chi‐square test for independence in MTA mapping when phenotypic variation is qualitative. As future projects enhanceF. virginianareference genomes, this study will be a valuable resource for the molecular identification of candidate genes involved in PF flowering in octoploid strawberries.
