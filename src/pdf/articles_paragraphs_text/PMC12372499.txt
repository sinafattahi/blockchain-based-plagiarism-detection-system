Duck enteritis virus (DEV) was identified as the etiological agent responsible for an outbreak of morbidity and mortality in adult ducks on a farm in Jiangsu, China. Diagnostic approaches confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the highly pathogenic DEV-JS2024 isolate. The clinical progression of the disease, characterized by lethargy, anorexia, ocular discharge, and high mortality, was accompanied by extensive hemorrhagic lesions in critical organs such as the liver, spleen, lungs, and bursa of Fabricius, consistent with known signs of DEV infection. Genomic analysis of DEV-JS2024 revealed a 45% G+C content and 76 open reading frames. BLASTn analysis revealed that the genome of DEV-JS2024 shares the highest sequence similarity with the Chinese virulent strain CV and the DEV attenuated vaccine strain C-KCE in the database. These results indicate a close genetic relationship between DEV-JS2024 and both the virulent and attenuated strains, suggesting potential similarities in their genomic architecture. Comparative genomic analysis identified 28 nucleotide mutations, including 15 non-synonymous mutations potentially related to virulence factors. The study also highlighted the first reported 528 base pairs deletion in theUL2gene of a virulent strain, challenging its utility as a marker for distinguishing virulent from attenuated strains. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that DEV-JS2024 may result from recombination between the vaccine and virulent strains, further complicating our understanding of DEV pathogenicity. This study provides new insights into the molecular evolution of DEV and stresses the importance of continued genomic surveillance to enhance vaccine development and control measures for duck plague.

Duck enteritis virus (DEV), also known as duck plague virus (DPV), is a highly contagious pathogen that predominantly affects waterfowl, including ducks, geese, and swans [1,2]. The disease is notorious for its severe impact, with mortality rates reaching up to 100% and egg production in affected birds plummeting by as much as 50% [3–5]. DEV has emerged as a global threat since its first documentation in the Netherlands in 1923, infiltrating duck farms worldwide [6–8]. In China, DEV was initially detected in 1957, and the virus has since become endemic, causing significant losses to the nation’s duck farming industry due to its high morbidity and mortality rates [9]. Taxonomically, DEV is designated as Anatid herpesvirus 1, within the genusMardivirus, subfamilyAlphaherpesvirinae, and familyHerpesviridae[10,11]. Infection with DEV typically induces a rapid rise in body temperature above 43°C, along with clinical signs such as lethargy, anorexia, tearful eyes, eyelid edema, and adhesion [12]. Prominent gross lesions include hepatic hemorrhages, necrotic or hemorrhagic bands at the junction of the esophagus and proventriculus, and various degrees of congestion, hemorrhage, necrosis, and detachment of the intestinal mucosa, often accompanied by the formation of button-like ulcers [13,14]. The virulence of DEV varies among isolates, with attenuated or naturally apathogenic strains serving as effective live vaccines under industrial conditions to prevent clinical manifestations of duck plague [10].

Complete genome characterization of DEV is critical for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity and advancing diagnostic tools, therapeutics, and control strategies. The DEV genome is a double-stranded, enveloped DNA virus with icosahedral symmetry, spanning approximately 158–162 kilobase pairs and containing 76 coding genes [15,16]. Of the 76 open reading frames (ORFs), 65 were located in the UL region, 9 in the US region, and the remaining two in the IRS and TRS regions [17].

Only a few complete genomes of Anatid herpesvirus 1 have been reported in GenBank. The sequenced virulent strains include DEV CV, isolated in 1962 in East China [18], 2085 from the 2005 outbreak in Germany [10], CHv from outbreaks in southwestern China in the 2000s [19], SD from the 2012 outbreak in Shandong, China [20], and DP-AS-Km-19 from the 2014 outbreak in Guwahati, Assam, India [5]. The limited availability of whole-genome data underscores the need for additional DEV sequences to enhance our understanding of the virus’s pathogenicity and evolutionary dynamics.

In 2024, a duck farm in Jiangsu Province, China, reported unusual symptoms in 8-week-old breeder ducks, including head and neck swelling, moist eyes with mucus secretion, difficulty in ambulation, neck retraction, and disheveled plumage. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed DEV infection. We isolated the virus and conducted whole genome sequencing, aiming to provide a theoretical framework for further investigation into the pathogenic mechanisms of DEV.

In 2024, a fatal disease outbreak, suspected to be caused by DEV, occurred on a duck farm in Jiangsu, China. A preliminary diagnosis of duck plague was carried out based on clinical signs and autopsy dissection. During outbreaks, deceased ducks are promptly transported to the laboratory within a few hours using specialized vehicles equipped with ice-filled, airtight containers. Liver samples are collected aseptically in a designated autopsy room. Following external sterilization, the abdominal cavity is opened with sterile instruments to expose the liver, which is then meticulously excised and transported to the testing laboratory in a sterile container maintained on ice. The liver samples used in this study were provided by Qilu Animal Health Products Co., Ltd. Total DNA and RNA were extracted from the samples using the MolPure® Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Cat No. 19321; Yeasen, Shanghai, China). Routine virus detection was conducted using PCR with 2×Phanta UniFi Master Mix (Dye Plus) (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). The primers used for amplification are listed inTable 1. The remaining samples were stored at − 80°C in an ultra-low temperature freezer for subsequent virus isolation.

aThe PCR fragment is 1018 bp for the virulent DEV strain and 493 bp for the attenuated strain.

bThe PCR fragment is 2454 bp for the virulent DEV strain and 573 bp for the attenuated strain.

Furthermore, a statistical analysis was also performed on DEV-positive tissue samples collected from various provinces in China during 2024. A total of 49 DEV-positive samples were obtained from the provinces of Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hubei. These samples were derived from tissues of ducks that succumbed to the disease, and were submitted for diagnostic testing following mortality events on affected farms. To assess the prevalence of DEV, PCR detection was conducted using two primer pairs, DEV-UL2 and DEV-LORF5 (Table 1). These primers were specifically designed to differentiate between virulent and attenuated strains of the virus [9,21].

Liver samples were homogenized with twice their volume of physiological saline, followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing at − 80°C. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm bacterial filter to eliminate bacterial contaminants. The filtered suspension was inoculated into the chorioallantoic membrane of 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) duck embryos (0.2 ml per embryo). The chorioallantoic membrane and fluid from duck embryos that died 24 h later were collected, homogenized in physiological saline, and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. After three consecutive passages, the allantoic fluid was harvested and stored at − 80°C for future analyses.

The complete genome sequence was obtained using the next generation sequencing (NGS) conducted by Insight Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Qingdao, China). Large gene fragments, identified based on known sizes of the DEV genome, were extracted and submitted to the BLAST module of NCBI. DEV-related genes were selected from the BLAST search results to construct the full-length DEV genome. The Map Reads to Reference module was employed to remap all NGS raw reads to these DEV-related genes, enhancing the length and coverage of each assembled fragment. The consensus sequence derived from the remapped reads was considered the final assembly of the DEV whole genome. The highest sequence similarity between the studied DEV genomic fragments and published sequences was determined using the BLAST online search program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The Neighbor-Joining method implemented in MEGA version 11.0 software was employed to construct a phylogenetic tree based on whole-genome data.

20-day-old SPF ducks were sourced from Shandong Health-tech Laboratory Animal Breeding Co., Ltd. (Jinan, China) and housed in isolators until use, with unrestricted access to feed and water. To evaluate the pathogenicity of the isolated DEV strains, 20 healthy 26-day-old SPF ducks were randomly divided into two groups for experimental infection. 10 ducks in the experimental group were subcutaneously injected with 1000 minimum lethal doses (MLD) of the isolated virus, while the remaining 10 ducks in the control group were inoculated with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) [28,29]. All ducks were grouped separately and monitored daily for mortality. Tissue samples, including kidneys, spleens, and livers, were collected for pathological examination and viral isolation. The tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4-μm slices. Histopathological analysis was performed following hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining [30].

The commercial Duck Enteritis Virus (DEV) vaccine, DEV C-KCE, and the reference virulent strain AV1221 used in this study were provided by the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control (Beijing, China). To evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against currently circulating virulent and novel DEV isolates, 100 healthy 26-day-old SPF ducks were selected and randomly assigned to five groups of 20 animals each. Each group of animals were kept separately in SPF duck isolators. Groups A and B were immunized intramuscularly with 1 × 105TCID₅₀ of the DEV vaccine at 26 days of age, while Groups C and D were injected with PBS as controls. Fourteen days post-immunization, ducks in Groups A and C were challenged with 1000 MLD of the virulent DEV strain AV1221, while ducks in Groups B and D received the novel DEV isolate JS2024 at the same dose. Group E served as a blank control. Daily observations were made to record mortality and clinical symptoms across all groups.

In this study, all experiments involving live animals were conducted in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.

In 2024, a fatal outbreak occurred on a duck farm in Jiangsu, China, suspected to be caused by DEV, resulting in a mortality rate of up to 50% among 8-week-old ducks. Affected ducks exhibited clinical signs including inappetence, ataxia, crowding in corners and against walls, head and neck swelling, ocular edema with viscous discharge, reluctance to move, and lethargy. Necropsy revealed petechial hemorrhages in the liver, intestines, and lungs, along with subcutaneous edema in the neck, hemorrhages in the esophageal mucosa and tracheal rings, and abundant inflammatory exudates. Additionally, white necrotic foci were observed in the enlarged liver (Figure 1). Diagnostic tests for common duck pathogens, including DEV, Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV), Duck Hepatitis A Virus (DHAV), avian influenza virus (AIV), Duck circovirus (DuCV), Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), Waterfowl-originated reovirus (WRV), duck astrovirus (DAstV), Goose parvovirus (GPV), and duck adenovirus (DAdV), confirmed the presence of DEV, while all other pathogens tested negative.

Clinical and pathological observations in ducks infected with DEV on a farm. (A) swollen head and neck. (B) severe lung hemorrhage. (C) white necrotic spots on the enlarged liver. (D) neck subcutaneous edema. (E) extensive esophageal hemorrhage. (F) intestinal hemorrhages. (G) severe tracheal ring hemorrhage.

Liver samples exhibiting prominent lesions were collected, processed, and inoculated into duck embryos for further culture. Embryonic development was monitored daily, and any embryos that died within 24 hours were discarded. Most inoculated embryos succumbed within 72–96 hours of incubation and tested positive for DEV. The deceased embryos exhibited thickened cystic membranes and widespread hemorrhaging throughout the body (Figure 2).

Pathological changes in duck embryos due to DEV infection. (A) DEV-JS2024 infected duck embryo displaying severe hemorrhage. (B) uninfected control duck embryo with normal development.

Following infection with the DEV strain, the infected animals exhibited marked clinical symptoms within 2–4 days, including lethargy, loss of appetite, and ocular discharge (Figure 3A). Necropsy revealed punctate hemorrhages in the liver, spleen, lungs, bursa of Fabricius and cecum, as well as extensive hemorrhaging in the thymus. Severe hemorrhages were also observed in the esophageal mucosa and tracheal rings, accompanied by significant inflammatory exudate (Figure 3B–I). These findings suggest that the outbreak on the farm was caused by a virulent strain of duck plague. To further investigate the tissue and organ damage caused by DEV, histopathological analysis using H&E staining was conducted. As shown inFigure 4A,B, liver and spleen tissues exhibited widespread hemorrhage and necrosis. In the lung, there was a significant accumulation of exudate fluid in the bronchioles, and numerous red blood cells were observed in the pulmonary alveolar walls (Figure 4C). The bursa of Fabricius displayed central hemorrhage within the lymphoid follicles, with mild infiltration of inflammatory cells in some of the follicles (Figure 4D). In the thymus, parenchymal cells in the thymic lobules were markedly reduced, and a considerable amount of pale pink fluid was present in the stroma. Additionally, the epithelial cells of the thymic corpuscles showed pronounced keratinization (Figure 4E). In the esophagus, there was epithelial detachment of the mucosal layer, accompanied by mild hemorrhage, necrosis, and surrounding inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 4F). Disruption of the intestinal villi was observed, with hemorrhage in the mucosal layer and inflammatory cell infiltration throughout the affected tissue (Figure 4G). The tracheal tissue exhibited submucosal edema with a small infiltration of inflammatory cells, resulting in mild congestion (Figure 4H). These histopathological findings from the regression study strongly suggest that the DEV-JS2024 strain exhibits high virulence, capable of inducing disease and mortality in affected duck populations.

Clinical and pathological signs in 26-day-old ducks infected with DEV: (A) eye swelling and discharge; (B) thymus hemorrhages; (C) tracheal ring hemorrhages; (D) enlarged liver with hemorrhage; (E) pulmonary hemorrhages; (F) enlarged spleen with hemorrhagic areas; (G) punctate hemorrhages in the bursa of Fabricius; (H) punctate hemorrhages in the cecum; (I) severe esophageal hemorrhage.

Histopathological analysis of ducks infected with the DEV JS2024 isolate reveals: (A) liver cell swelling and necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration; (B) reduced white pulp and necrosis in spleen cells; (C) fluid and red blood cell accumulation in lung alveolar walls; (D) hemorrhage and mild inflammatory cell infiltration in bursa of Fabricius lymphoid follicles; (E) pale fluid in thymic lobules and epithelial cell keratinization; (F) esophageal mucosal detachment with bleeding, necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration; (G) intestinal villi necrosis and shedding with bleeding and inflammatory infiltration; (H) tracheal submucosal edema, cilia loss, and mononuclear cell infiltration.

Survival curves of ducks were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10 (Figure 5A). Following infection, all ducks in the challenged group developed severe acute clinical disease. The challenged group exhibited a marked peak in mortality between days 4 and 6 post-infection. All ducks infected with the classic virulent strain AV1221 died by day 5 post-infection, while those infected with the novel DEV isolate JS2024 displayed a mortality rate of 95% (19/20). In contrast, ducks immunized with the DEV vaccine (C-KCE strain) demonstrated a survival rate of 75% (15/20) following infection with AV1221 and 95% (19/20) following infection with JS2024. These immunization and challenge assays results suggest that the current DEV vaccine (C-KCE strain) provides a notable level of protection against both classic and the novel DEV strains.

The complete genome sequence of strain JS2024 (Supplemental material) comprises 161,603 nucleotides (nt), with a G+C content of 45%. A total of 76 ORFs were predicted to encode potential functional proteins. The BlastN analysis revealed that the most related genome sequences to JS2024 genome in the database were Chinese virulent strain CV (accessionJQ673560.1, 100% query coverage and 99.99% identity) and DEV attenuated vaccine strain C-KCE (accessionKF263690.1, 97% query coverage and 99.99% identity). In comparison to the Chinese virulent strain CV and the vaccine strain C-KCE, the isolated strain JS2024 exhibited a total of 28 nucleotide variations (Figure 6A). Five of these were synonymous mutations located in theUL49.5,UL49,UL29,UL21, andUL14genes, while the changes in the remaining coding regions were non-synonymous. Notably, JS2024 harbors a distinct single nucleotide mutation in the UL7, along with two unique single nucleotide alterations in noncoding regions. The mutations in the other nucleotides were identical to those observed in either CV or C-KCE strains.

Genomic analysis of the novel DEV isolate.

Nucleotides identical to those in CV are highlighted in red, those matching C-KCE are highlighted in blue, and those differing from both reference strains are marked in black. (B) phylogenetic analysis of the DEV isolate and reference strains was performed. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the distance-based, neighbour-joining method implemented in the MEGA program. The reliability of the tree was assessed using the bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications. Red triangles indicate new isolate. (C) sequence alignment ofLORF11from 15 DEV strains.

Wu et al. investigated theLORF5gene and partial 5’ untranslated region (UTR) sequences of DEV virulent and attenuated strains prevalent in China, revealing significant length variations between the two forms in this genomic region [9]. Building on these sequence differences, they developed a PCR-based diagnostic method to distinguish virulent from attenuated DEV strains. TheLORF5gene and partial 5’UTR sequences of the DEV 2085 and DP-AS-Km-19 strains were collectively designated asLORF11[5,10]. In keeping with this nomenclature, the present study adopts the same convention, referring to the combinedLORF5and partial 5’UTR sequences asLORF11.

TheLORF11region of the DEV-JS2024 strain spans 4341 base pairs (bp) and encodes a protein of 1447 amino acids. This sequence exhibits 100% nucleotide homology with the Chinese virulent strain CV (accessionJQ673560.1). Using the PCR detection method developed by Wu et al. to differentiate virulent and attenuated DEV strains, we classified the DEV-JS2024 isolate as a virulent strain [9]. Wu et al. had previously observed an additional non-target band of 1596 bp (designated fragment X) during PCR amplification of a commercial DEV vaccine (CVCC AV1222) and an attenuated DEV strain (CHa) [9]. At present, there is no DEV virulent strain lacking LORF11 in China. Building on these findings, we performed a comparative analysis of theLORF11gene sequences from 10 virulent and 5 attenuated strains. This analysis revealed a 901 bp region (nt 1663 to 2564) that serves as a reliable marker for distinguishing between virulent and attenuated DEV strains in China (Figure 6C).

TheUL2gene of DEV strain JS2024 is 474 bp in length, encoding a 158 amino acid protein. It exhibits complete nucleotide identity (100%) with the DEV Chinese vaccine strain C-KCE (accessionKF263690.1). Xie et al. previously compared theUL2genes of 10 virulent and 11 attenuated DEV strains, revealing that theUL2ORF in attenuated DEV strains is 474 bp, while in virulent strains it is 1002 bp [4]. Based on these observations, a PCR assay targeting the DEVUL2gene was developed for the simultaneous detection of both virulent and attenuated strains [4]. However, whole-genome sequencing of the virulent isolate JS2024 revealed a 528 bp deletion within theUL2gene. Comparative analysis ofUL2genes from 15 virulent and 7 attenuated strains deposited in GenBank highlighted that this is the first reported instance of a deletion in theUL2gene of virulent DEV strains in China (Figure 6D).

Whole-genome sequence evolutionary relatedness showed that JS2024 isolate was closely related to DEV attenuated vaccine strain and forming one clade (Figure 6B). Combined with the clinical and pathological features analysis, it was suggested that the JS2024 isolate may be a recombinant strain of the virulent and attenuated vaccine strains.

A statistical analysis was performed on DEV-positive samples collected in 2024, which identified the presence of JS2024-like novel DEV strains across several provinces in China (Figure 5B). Out of 49 DEV-positive samples, 13 were identified as classic DEV strains, while 36 were classified as novel DEV strains. Notably, the prevalence of novel DEV strains has surpassed that of the classic strains, establishing the novel strains as the predominant group.

The DEV was identified as the etiologic agent responsible for the morbidity and mortality observed in adult ducks on this farm. The gross and histopathological lesions were consistent with previously documented symptoms of DEV infection [14,31,32]. Diagnostic analyses, including PCR identification, pathogen isolation, culture, and whole-genome sequencing, confirmed that the outbreak was caused by DEV. The virulence of the isolated DEV-JS2024 strain was evident from the rapid onset of clinical signs, with affected ducks exhibiting lethargy, anorexia, and ocular discharge within 2 to 4 days post-infection. This timeline coincided with the peak mortality observed between days 4 and 6, highlighting the aggressive nature of the strain. Pathological examination revealed extensive hemorrhagic lesions in critical organs, including the liver, spleen, lungs, and bursa of Fabricius, confirming the strain’s ability to induce severe systemic damage and immunosuppression, which predisposes to secondary infections. Histopathological analysis, including H&E staining, further delineated the extent of tissue damage, with diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis observed in both the liver and spleen. Pulmonary involvement was particularly pronounced, characterized by fluid accumulation in the bronchioles and red blood cell infiltration in the alveolar walls, indicative of a strong inflammatory response. Notably, the observed hemorrhage within the bursa of Fabricius and thymus suggests a significant immunocompromise, with a reduction in parenchymal cells in thymic lobules raising concerns about the long-term impact on avian immunity. The multifocal lesions, including severe hemorrhagic necrosis in the esophagus and trachea, indicate that the DEV-JS2024 isolate possesses distinct pathogenic features warranting further investigation. The inflammatory response in the tracheal submucosa, characterized by edema, underscores the respiratory involvement of the infection and its potential to exacerbate disease transmission within the flock.

Building on methodologies established by Wu et al., theLORF11gene can be used as a molecular marker to distinguish between virulence and attenuated DEV strains [9]. TheLORF11gene of the DEV-JS2024 isolate comprises 4,341 bp and exhibits 100% nucleotide homology with the Chinese virulent representative strain CV, reinforcing its classification as a highly pathogenic variant. Additionally, the unexpected amplification of a nontarget band (X fragment) during PCR, as observed by Wu et al., further underscores the genetic complexity of DEV strains [9]. Sequencing revealed this fragment to be approximately 1,596 bp, and comparison ofLORF11across multiple strains confirmed that the 1,663 to 2,564 nt region reliably differentiates virulent from attenuated strains in China (Figure 6C). Moreover, the analysis of theUL2gene has further deepened our understanding of DEV genetics. A 528 bp deletion in theUL2gene of JS2024 isolate represents the first such deletion identified in virulent DEV strains in China. This contrasts with previous findings, which only identified partial deletions of theUL2gene in attenuated strains [21]. Despite this deletion, the newly isolated JS2024 strain retains strong pathogenicity, suggesting that theUL2gene is no longer a reliable marker for distinguishing between virulent and attenuated strains. These findings also imply that the partial deletion of theUL2gene in DEV vaccine strains may not be the primary factor responsible for their reduced virulence. TheUL2gene is often targeted in PCR assays for DEV identification due to its specificity and relevance to viral function [4]. However, the presence of a major deletion withinUL2in a virulent strain challenges the assumption that deletions are exclusive to attenuated strains, thereby undermining its utility as a differentiating marker. If theUL2gene is incomplete, PCR assays targeting this region may fail to amplify viral DNA, resulting in false-negative results or inaccurate assessment of viral load. This limitation not only compromises diagnostic sensitivity but also impacts clinical monitoring and outbreak control efforts. Therefore, these findings highlight the critical need for the development of new diagnostic primers or methodologies to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of DEV detection assays. Additionally, ongoing genomic surveillance is essential to track emerging variations and ensure the robustness of diagnostic tools. Collectively, these measures will improve the accuracy and reliability of DEV detection assays, which is vital for effective disease management in affected regions.

The Chinese virulent strain of DEV, designated CV (accessionJQ673560.1), was subsequently renamed DEV C20E85 (accessionKU216226.1) following continuous attenuation [37]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the attenuated strain, DEV C20E85, remained within the same clade as the virulent DEV CV strain (Figure 6B). Similar to the above results, the clinical and pathological outcomes of experimental infection with the DEV JS2024 isolate in 26-day-old ducks confirmed its virulence. However, whole-genome sequence analysis revealed that the JS2024 isolate was closely related to the attenuated DEV vaccine strain, clustering within the same phylogenetic clade (Figure 6B). The JS2024 isolate may have originated from recombination between the vaccine strain and the virulent strain. Specifically, the JS2024 isolate may have been generated through recombination at specific loci, such as theUL2gene, with the vaccine strain serving as the template. Further research is needed to investigate this hypothesis in greater detail.

The statistical analysis of DEV-positive samples collected in 2024 indicates a significant transformation in the epidemiological landscape of duck plague in China. Of the 49 DEV-positive samples, 36 (73.5%) were identified as novel JS2024-like strains, whereas only 13 (26.5%) were categorized as classic DEV strains. This predominance of novel strains across various provinces highlights their enhanced adaptability and potential evolutionary advantage over traditional variants. The extensive geographical distribution of JS2024-like strains, detected in Jiangsu, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces, suggests increased transmissibility or environmental persistence, potentially facilitated by genetic recombination or mutations that enhance viral fitness. Such a shift may pose challenges to existing biosecurity protocols, particularly if the novel strains exhibit altered tropism or immune evasion capabilities.

In summary, these findings not only provide a comprehensive understanding of the genetic landscape of JS2024 isolate but also highlight the critical need for ongoing genomic surveillance of DEV. The observed attenuation of virulence may result from a complex interplay of genetic variations within the DEV genome, but attributing this attenuation to any single gene remains challenging. The molecular basis for the differential pathogenicity of DEV strains is still unclear, likely arising from multiple genetic factors. A deeper understanding of these molecular variations is essential for the development of more effective vaccines and control strategies to mitigate the impact of duck plague on avian populations. Future research should prioritize investigating the functional consequences of the identified mutations and deletions, thereby advancing our ability to combat this emerging threat to poultry health.

In summary, this study characterizes the JS2024 isolate as a virulent strain of DEV with significant pathogenicity. Genomic analysis shows that JS2024 is closely related to virulent strains but contains key mutations in the genome, which may enhance its virulence and immune evasion. Notably, a 528 bp deletion was identified for the first time in theUL2gene of the virulent strain, presenting potential challenges to current diagnostic methods. The widespread distribution of JS2024-like strains across multiple regions of China indicates an evolving epidemiological trend, thereby presenting potential challenges to existing biosecurity measures. Furthermore, the potential for genetic recombination between vaccine and virulent strains adds complexity to the understanding of DEV evolution. Ongoing research is imperative to enhance the comprehension of the virus’s adaptability and transmissibility, and to facilitate the development of more effective control strategies.
