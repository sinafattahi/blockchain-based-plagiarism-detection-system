Plasmonic polarization conversion offers significant
advantages
over conventional methods, including a smaller device footprint and
easier integration into photonic circuits. In this work, we numerically
and experimentally investigate the polarization conversion properties
of a plasmonic double-hole structure surrounded by circular nanograting,
i.e., a bull’s eye antenna. Using a combination of polarimetric
imaging via back focal plane (BFP) microscopy and Stokes parameter
analysis, we demonstrate the functionality of our structure as a miniature
on-chip polarization converter. Our results show that this nanostructure
enables complex polarization transformations, including converting
linear to circular polarization and vice versa. Polarization conversion
efficiency is found to be dependent on the periodicity of the circular
gratings and is particularly pronounced in the central region of Fourier
space. Moreover, strong asymmetric scattering leads to distinctive
patterns in the Stokes parameters across various incident polarization
states. This work provides insights into the plasmonic manipulation
of light polarization at the nanoscale with potential applications
in miniature on-chip polarization convertors, polarization-controlled
emitters, and advanced sensing technologies.

Over the past two decades, significant
advancements have been made
in the fields of nanophotonics and plasmonics thanks to the rapid
development of novel materials and nanofabrication technologies.−These advancements have enabled the precise manipulation of light
at the nanoscale, unlocking a wide range of applications, from photocatalysis
and electrocatalysis to various optoelectronic devices for sensing,
energy harvesting, and biotreatment. Additionally, the versatile design
of metasurface, chiral structures, and electromagnetic field localization
have led to a deeper understanding and control over the fundamental
properties of light.,In particular, it has been demonstrated
that plasmonic structures can enable precise control of amplitude,
phase, direction, and polarization states of electromagnetic waves
through engineered geometries, resonances, and near-field interactions.−
,−Plasmonic polarization conversion offers significant advantages
over conventional methods, including a smaller device footprint, easier
integration into photonic circuits, higher wavelength selectivity,
and more tunable polarization control.

We previously demonstrated that the bull’s eye antenna
can
function as a refractive index sensor by efficiently coupling SPPs
to the far field and creating a distinct interference pattern that
is highly sensitive to refractive index changes within the subwavelength
aperture. In this work, we exploit the
use of a bull’s eye antenna to manipulate the polarization
characteristics of the transmitted light, with an aperture consisting
of a pair of plasmonic holes. We further explored its function as
a polarization converter. We used back focal plane (BFP) imaging to
characterize the spatial distribution of the transmitted light transmitted
through the structure and measured the Stokes parameters at all points
collected by the microscope objective. Our plasmonic metasurface introduces
structural asymmetry, enabling polarization conversion across Fourier
space. Notably, it has the potential to direct two orthogonal polarization
states to different locations in k-space, allowing for simultaneous
polarization multiplexing.

The proposed nanoplasmonic polarization
converter is based on a
pair of nanoholes embedded in the center of a bull’s eye antenna
with six concentric circular corrugations, with a footprint of approximately
8–10 μm, patterned on a 160 nm thick gold film. The grating
periodicity, ranging from 700 to 800 nm, is used to modify the polarization
of the incident beam. The gold film is supported by a 170 um thick
fused silica substrate with a chromium adhesion layer, and the structure
is fabricated using focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The nanoholes
have a center-to-center separation of 400 nm and an average aperture
diameter of 150 nm. The schematic and scanning electron microscope
(SEM) of the device are shown inFigurea,b, respectively. The dimensions are verified
by SEM images. We use the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method
through commercial software Lumerical FDTD (Ansys, 2021) to simulate
the transmitted field from the bull’s eye antenna with double
holes, where a broadband plane wave light with various polarizations
illuminates the structure, and observations are made from the glass
substrate side. For circularly polarized light, two orthogonally polarized
plane waves with a 90° phase shift are applied. The substitution
of the plane wave by a Gaussian beam does not cause changes to the
simulation results (Supporting Information SI.4). Transmitted fields are collected, and a near-to-far field transformation
is performed to analyze the far-field patterns, with Stokes polarimetry
used to study the polarization state. Experimentally, we use BFP microscopy
to study light transmitted through the bull’s eye. BFP microscopy
is widely used in biology and photonics to study properties of transmitted
or emitted light, including polarization, intensity, phase, and spatial
frequency (momentum), by capturing images at the back focal plane
of the objective lens.

deposited on a 170 μm-thick fused silica substrate, with a 5–10

(p) ranging from 700 to 800 nm, with a width (w) ofp/2 and a depth (h) of 40 nm. At
the center of each device, a pair of nanoholes is arranged with a
center-to-center separation (S) of 400 nm and an
average aperture diameter (D) of 150 nm. (b) SEM

scale bar in (c) is 280 μm.

To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the
polarization state,
we performed Stokes parameter analysis on all pixels corresponding
to wave vectors within the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective
lens. The optical testing setup, shown inSupporting Information SI.2, is a transmission microscope with an 800
nm laser focused onto the sample with a long working distance objective.
Polarization is controlled by a quarter-waveplate (QWP) and a linear
polarizer. Transmitted light is collected by a second microscope objective,
collimated with a convex lens, and recorded by a CCD to capture the
radiation pattern. Polarimetry uses a QWP and polarizer between the
collimating lens and a flip mirror, while imaging in real and Fourier
spaces is achieved with a plano-convex lens. To measure the four Stokes
parameters experimentally, we conducted six different experiments
with various angles of the QWP and linear polarizer relative to thex-axis.

Tableoutlines the configuration
of the polarizer and QWP
for the six experiments, where Φ and θ represent the angles
of the linear polarizer and QWP relative to thex-axis, respectively.

Ia–Ifdenoting the transmitted light intensity.
The first Stokes parameter,S0=Ia+Ib, represents
the total intensity of the transmitted light. The second parameter,S1=Ia–Ib, which measures the vertical or horizontal
polarization of light. The third parameter,S2=Ic–Id, indicates whether the linear polarization aligns with
±45° angles. The fourth parameter,S3=Ie–If, captures the circular polarization component, reflecting
the left- or right-handiness of the circular polarization state.

To understand how our design of plasmonic double holes embedded
in a bull’s eye antenna affects the polarization states and
radiation pattern, we performed FDTD simulation and numerically compare
the optical response of bare plasmonic double holes to that of a double
hole encompassed by circular grooves, under various incident polarization
conditions. To quantify the polarization state of the transmitted
light in the simulation, a near- to far-field transformation is applied
to the electromagnetic field data collected by a plane monitor. The
Stokes parameters are then calculated using the standard formulations
provided ineq, which
offer a full numerical description of the polarization state of the
transmitted light in terms of intensity and phase relationships between
orthogonal field components.

Figurea,c depicts
the simulated optical response of the bare double holes under circular
(RCP) and lineary-polarized incident radiation,
respectively. Analysis of the Stokes parametersS3andS1reveals that the
transmitted light largely preserves the polarization state of the
incident light with other Stokes parameters being close to zero across
all angles in the Fourier space, indicating minimal polarization conversion
(almost no polarization conversion). In contrast, in our design,Figureb,d demonstrates
that the antenna induces significant polarization modifications (more
details inSupporting Information SI.3).
TheS3parameter identifies regions in
the Fourier space where the handedness of the incident beam is completely
reversed, forming a ring-shaped pattern of opposite helicity. Furthermore,
nonzero values ofS1andS2in specific regions indicate a complete conversion from
circular to linear polarization.Figured illustrates the transformation of linearly
polarized incident light to circularly polarized transmitted light.
These observations provide evidence of strong interaction of light
with the bull’s eye, resulting in substantial alterations in
the polarization state of the transmitted light.

highlight the subtle 3-fold rotational symmetry (b) under linear (y-polarized) polarization of the incident beam. The periodicity
and width of the groove are 700 and 350 nm, respectively. The scale
bar in (a) is 300 μm.

In the case of circularly polarized illumination,
theS1parameter, which corresponds to
the vertical and horizontal
states of polarization, reveals pronounced linear polarization components
at wave vectors corresponding to the 3-fold rotationally symmetric
regions. However, the Stokes parameterS2, which represents the degree of polarization aligning with ±45°
angles, exhibits a spatial distribution in the Fourier space that
closely resembles that observed under linear polarization. Notably,
theS3parameter, which describes the
circular state of the polarization, under circular illumination indicates
that the central region weakly preserves the incident polarization
state. On the other hand, undery-polarized illumination,Figureb shows that the
Stokes parameterS0exhibits an angular
distribution characterized by two high-intensity lobes separated by
a region of reduced intensity. The distribution ofS1indicates that most of the Fourier space retains the
polarization state of the incident light. However, distinct regions
display orthogonal polarizations relative to those of the incident
beam, confirming polarization conversion to the orthogonal state.
The distribution ofS2reveals a cross-shaped
pattern with alternating positive and negative values, suggesting
the presence of diagonal linear polarization components. TheS3parameter displays four mutually orthogonal
lobes with distinct circular polarization states, including a notable
region with circular polarization at normal incidence (kx=ky= 0). In summary,
in both experimental configurations, we observed significant polarization
state conversion, particularly pronounced in the central region of
the Fourier space. The wave vectors of different colors (blue and
red) inFigureconfirm
not only polarization conversion, as evident inS1(Figurea) andS3(Figureb), but also the angular distribution of
light with orthogonal polarizations. These experimental observations
validate the polarization manipulation achieved by our structure.

To quantitatively assess the polarization conversion efficiency
and study the impact of the bull’s eye antenna periodicity,
we focus our analysis on the central region (see analysis of other
regions inSupporting Information SI.6),
highlighted by the blue circle inFigurea, of the Fourier plane (kx=ky= 0). This region is of
particular interest due to its fundamental significance in both theoretical
photonics and practical applications like slow light and beaming.,,Figureb presents the area-averaged Stokes parameters
when an RCP beam is normally incident on the structure. The comparison
ofS1under different grating periodicities
shows high values for all periodicities. This confirms that a significant
portion of the transmitted light is converted from circular to linear
polarization. On the other hand, small values ofS2for all periodicities imply a negligible conversion
to the diagonally linear polarization states. The same quantity is
presented inFigurec when ay-polarized beam is normally incident on
the structure. The values ofS1show that
the transmitted light preserves the polarization of the incident illumination.
However, the values ofS3reveal noticeable
linear to circular polarization conversion for all periodicities.
Our results highlight a key distinction between our plasmonic double-hole
bull’s eye structure and conventional bull’s eye plasmon
antennas. Unlike the structures investigated in prior studies, where the preservation of the incident polarization
state atk= 0 is attributed to the system’s
symmetry, our design inherently breaks this symmetry due to the presence
of the double-hole aperture. This asymmetry enables significant polarization
conversion, even in the central region of Fourier space.

Effect of the
bull’s eye periodicity on the device’s
performance in polarization conversion. (a) The blue circle in the
image indicates the region utilized for averaging the Stokes parameters.

ranging from 700 to 800 nm, RCP of the incident beam. (c) Same as
(b) but undery-polarization of the incident beam.

The periodicity-dependent polarization conversion
observed inFigurecan be explained
by two contributing factors: [1] the phase relation between the transmitted
light from the ZMWs and the scattered light from the rings that are
directly influenced by the distance from the center of ZMWs to the
first ring and [2] the excitation of SPPs, which is inherently dependent
on the periodicity. As demonstrated in the study by Yi et al., the distance from the center of ZMWs to the
first ring determines the phase relationship between the directly
transmitted light and SPPs. When this distance closely matches the
periodicityP, a stronger constructive interference
occurs in the normal direction (aroundk= 0), resulting
in a more pronounced central beam. As shown inSupporting Information SI.5, the radiation pattern from structures
with different periodicities under vertically polarized incident light
exhibits distinct features. ForP= 700 nm, a weak
central spot and two lobes are observed in the intensity distribution,
and forP= 760 nm, the central spot is even weaker.
Finally, for periodicity ofP= 800 nm, the central
spot almost disappears, suggesting destructive interference along
the optical axis due to a mismatch between the distance from the center
of ZMWs to the first ring andP. Therefore, the efficiency
of the polarization conversion at the central region is linked to
the angular distribution of light.

To show that periodicity
impacts polarization conversion via the
excitation of SPPs, as shown inSupporting Information SI.6, we have analyzed the polarization conversion of these
devices (P= 700, 760, and 800 nm) under different
polarization of the incident light across different regions and numerical
apertures (NA). Our results indicate an overall stronger polarization
conversion for a periodicity ofP= 760 nm. As demonstrated
by Laux et al., under illumination at
800 nm, SPPs are optimally excited when the grating periodicity is
approximately 750 nm, which is close to our observed optimal periodicity
of 760 nm. This suggests that the periodicity-dependent SPP plays
a significant role in enhancing the polarization conversion efficiency.
The efficient coupling of incident light into SPP modes atP≈ 760 nm likely facilitates stronger light–matter
interactions, leading to more effective polarization transformation.

The study highlights the sophisticated
polarization conversion
properties of a plasmonic double-hole surrounded by a bull’s
eye antenna, examined through a combination of FDTD simulation and
experimental BFP microscopy along with Stokes parameter analysis.
This work reveals that the structure is capable of significantly altering
the polarization state of the incident light, namely, the conversion
from linear to circular polarization, and vice versa. These transformations
are highly dependent on the periodicity of the bull’s eye geometry,
with notable effects in the central region of the Fourier space.

The research observed asymmetric scattering and distinct Stokes
parameter patterns across various incident polarization states. These
results emphasize the bull’s eye with plasmonic double holes’
ability to manipulate light polarization at the nanoscale, which opens
new avenues for developing polarization-controlled emitters and sensors.
Moreover, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the light–matter
interaction in plasmonic nanostructures, which may pave the way to
potential applications in quantum optics and biomedical sensing. Future
research could focus on optimizing the geometry for specific polarization
tasks and exploring its wavelength dependence.
