Statistically significant differences in key clinical measures across study groups at baseline, which are inconsistent with proper randomization and raise concerns about potential selection bias.

Incomplete or unclear descriptions of the randomization process, lack of information on block sizes, and no clear statement regarding participant blinding.

Low variability in baseline measurements and possible misreporting of standard deviations versus standard errors.

Insufficient detail in the description of statistical analyses, no formal tests for dose–response effects despite this being a primary study aim, and lack of appropriate adjustments for multiple comparisons.

Unusually high reported participant adherence and no loss to follow-up, which is uncommon for clinical trials and requires clarification.

Despite multiple efforts over an extended period, the Panel has been unable to establish contact with the authors to request clarification and to obtain access to the underlying data.

Therefore, the ADA is issuing this statement to alert readers to concerns involving the methodological approaches and, thus, the plausibility of the data reported in this study. We will update the scientific record should additional information become available.
