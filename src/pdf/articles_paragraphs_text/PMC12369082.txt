Urethral foreign body insertion is an underreported issue in adolescents. Migration to the scrotum is exceptionally rare, with < 20 cases reported. We highlight diagnostic and management challenges.

A 14-year-old boy presented with 11 days of progressive scrotal pain, swelling, and fever (38.5 °C). Computed tomography (CT) revealed an 8-cm hyperdense foreign body extending from the urethra into the scrotum. Surgical exploration identified an embedded cotton swab with purulent exudate. Combined scrotal exploration and cystoscopy achieved complete retrieval. After a 3-week catheterization, recovery was uneventful. One-year follow-up showed spermatic cord fibrosis but preserved testicular function.

Cross-sectional imaging is critical for diagnosis. Combined surgical approaches optimize outcomes for large migrated foreign bodies. Adolescents require psychological intervention to prevent recurrence.

Self-inserted urethral foreign bodies occur predominantly in adolescents, though underreporting obscures the true incidence [1–3]. While most foreign bodies localize to the bladder or distal urethra, migration to adjacent regions such as the scrotum remains exceptionally rare, with limited documented cases globally [4–6]. Predisposing factors include sexual curiosity, underlying psychiatric conditions, and delayed presentation due to embarrassment; these often lead to complications such as urethral strictures, abscesses, or urinary obstruction [7,8]. We report a pediatric case of cotton swab migration into the scrotum, emphasizing multimodal management and prevention strategies.

A 14-year-old male presented with progressive left scrotal pain, swelling, and fever (peak 38.5 °C) over 11 days. Confidential history revealed he had inserted a cotton swab into his urethra during masturbation 11 days earlier. Physical examination showed left scrotal erythema, warmth, and tenderness without skin violation. A firm cord-like mass was palpable. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (WBC: 14.2 × 10³/µL) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP: 32 mg/L). Uroflowmetry demonstrated a maximum flow rate (Qmax) of 18 mL/s (normal > 15 mL/s). Final diagnosis: migrated urethral foreign body with scrotal abscess.

Scrotal ultrasound (Fig.1). Heterogeneous echotexture, non-vascularized mass (8.1 × 0.5 cm) adjacent to the left testis. No evidence of torsion or hydrocele. Pelvic CT (Fig.2). Linear hyperdense foreign body (Hounsfield units: 250–300) extending from the penile urethra into the left scrotum, with surrounding soft-tissue edema.

Under general anesthesia, a 3-cm scrotal incision evacuated 20 mL of pus and extracted an intact cotton swab (Fig.3). Concurrent cystoscopy revealed mild bulbar urethral mucosal erythema without tears or strictures, suggesting migration through an inflammatory pseudotract rather than acute urethral perforation. A 16-Fr silicone catheter was placed postoperatively.

Upon catheter removal at 3 weeks, he reported no dysuria or hematuria. One-year magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed left spermatic cord fibrosis without testicular atrophy (Fig.4). The patient received psychological counseling addressing risk-taking behaviors, with no recurrence or long-term complications.

While most foreign bodies localize to the bladder or distal urethra, migration to adjacent anatomical regions such as the scrotum remains exceptionally rare, with limited documented cases globally (Table1). Migration of urethral foreign bodies to the scrotum involves urethral wall injury, pseudotunnel formation, perforation due to inflammation, and proximity of the bulbar urethra to scrotal contents [4,9–11]. In this case, the cotton swab had a wooden core (standard commercially available design), providing sufficient rigidity for tissue penetration. While the cotton tip is soft, repetitive physical activity generated shear forces that facilitated gradual migration through fascial planes—likely traversing Buck’s fascia via an inflammatory pseudotract rather than acute perforation. This contrasts with sharp objects that typically embed in the urethral wall [7,12], aligning with reports of migrated pelvic foreign bodies requiring laparoscopic retrieval [4].

This presentation necessitates differentiation from other acute scrotal pathologies (Table2). Although endoscopic retrieval remains first-line for most urethral foreign bodies [3,19], a combined surgical approach was indicated in this case for three reasons: (1) Risk of failed endoscopic extraction for objects > 5 cm, with reported failure rates of 30–40% due to fragmentation risk [5]; (2) Concurrent scrotal abscess requiring immediate drainage [7]; (3) Need for direct visualization to ensure testicular viability [20]. This hybrid strategy mitigated iatrogenic urethral trauma, aligning with evidence advocating combined techniques [5,7,21].

While ultrasound is initial modality for scrotal pain, CT was indicated here to delineate the full extent of the migrated foreign body and surrounding inflammation, which ultrasonography could not comprehensively assess. Follow-up MRI at one year provided high-resolution evaluation of spermatic cord fibrosis, a known long-term complication not reliably detected by ultrasound.

The patient underwent Pediatric Depression Scale (PHQ-A) screening and was referred to a psychologist specializing in adolescent risk behaviors, with monthly sessions for 6 months.

This case underscores the need for improved sexual health education [2,3]. Only 53–54% of American adolescents receive standards-based education [22]; rates in China are likely lower. Future strategies should prioritize community mental health screening and age-appropriate education targeting high-risk groups [23,24]. Multidisciplinary collaboration among urologists, psychiatrists, and educators is essential.

This case provides the first documented management protocol for scrotal-migrated cotton swabs, highlighting: (1) The role of inflammatory pseudotracts in soft foreign body migration; (2) Long-term MRI surveillance for fibrosis; (3) A validated psychological intervention framework. These insights address critical gaps in adolescent urological emergencies.

Ethical approval was waived for this case report. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and his parents/guardians for publication, including images.

This case demonstrates: (1) Inflammatory pseudotracts may enable foreign body migration without acute urethral tears; (2) CT remains valuable when ultrasound cannot define migration extent; (3) Combined surgery is optimal for objects > 5 cm with abscess formation; (4) MRI effectively monitors long-term fibrotic complications.
