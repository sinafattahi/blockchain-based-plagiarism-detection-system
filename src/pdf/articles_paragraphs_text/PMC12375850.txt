Fusarium graminearumcolonizes the maize ear, causing Gibberella ear rot (GER) and producing harmful mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA). The disease can be managed in part by breeding and planting resistant maize cultivars. Resistance to GER is a quantitative and complex trait. Evaluation of diverse germplasm to identify regions and candidate genes associated with resistance may be useful for crop improvement efforts. Screening for GER is time‐consuming and costly. Thus, identifying other traits that may serve as a proxy for GER resistance may accelerate resistance breeding efforts. We hypothesized that grain phenylpropanoid content and kernel composition are genetically and mechanistically related to GER resistance. We screened a diverse set of maize inbred lines for disease severity, DON, ZEA, ferulic acid,p‐coumaric acid, pericarp thickness, and several kernel composition traits. Using a genome‐wide association study, we identified markers associated with each phenotype and genomic regions that harbor alleles for both disease and metabolite‐related phenotypes. Pathways significantly associated with GER‐related traits were related to detoxification, cell wall integrity, and lignin biosynthesis. End‐season ferulic acid andp‐coumaric acid concentrations are not strong proxies for GER resistance, but secondary metabolites are important components of the maize–Fusarium graminearumpathosystem. Furthermore, lignin‐deficient brown midrib mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to GER, underscoring the importance of lignin composition in limiting fungal colonization. The study highlights the multifaceted nature of GER resistance, involving both biochemical and structural defenses. These findings provide valuable targets for breeding programs aiming to enhance GER resistance and reduce mycotoxin contamination in maize.

Gibberella ear rot (GER) is a global threat to human health as it contaminates maize with harmful toxins. To protect the food supply against mycotoxin contamination, resistant maize cultivars are needed. Identifying candidate genes and potential mechanisms of GER resistance can assist the breeding process. We screened an inbred maize panel for disease severity, toxin accumulation, and several kernel characteristics. We identified candidate genes and pathways involved with resistance. We examined metabolites in the phenylpropanoid pathway, and there appears to be a role for these metabolites in resistance. Lignin‐deficient mutants were more susceptible to GER, stressing that maize grown for silage should be monitored for mycotoxin accumulation. The candidate genes and pathways identified in this study can be targets of future studies related to GER resistance.

The health of people and animals worldwide is threatened by grain rots and mycotoxin‐contaminated grain. Maize is an important global staple, but 19.5%–41.4% of yields are lost due to plant pathogens and pests (Savary et al.,2019).Fusarium graminearum, a major pathogen of maize, is the fourth most threatening plant‐pathogenic fungus in the world (Dean et al.,2012). On maize,F. graminearumcauses Gibberella ear rot (GER), Gibberella stalk rot, Fusarium root rot, and seedling rots and blights (Munkvold & White,2016).Fusarium graminearumproduces multiple mycotoxins, which are a threat to human and animal health. Yield losses due to GER have been reported (Mueller et al.,2020,2016). However, post‐harvest deductions and losses due to mycotoxins, the most important risk associated with GER, are challenging to estimate. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) are common mycotoxins produced byF. graminearum. DON is commonly referred to as vomitoxin, as it causes vomiting, food refusal, gastroenteritis, and impaired reproduction (Desjardins,2006; Pestka,2010; Ueno,1985; Vesonder et al.,1973). ZEA has estrogenic effects, which can cause hormone imbalances, reproductive toxicity, and potentially cancer (Desjardins,2006; Kuiper‐Goodman et al.,1987; Rogowska et al.,2019). In North America, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has employed advisory levels for DON contamination in grain products depending on the intended end product (Center for Veterinary Medicine,2010). There are no guidelines for ZEA contamination in the United States. The European Union has detailed guidelines for DON and ZEA in commodities destined for human and animal consumption (European Commission,2006,2023,2024). Despite these regulations, mycotoxin exposure in North America and Europe is still prevalent (Bulder et al.,2011; Mahato et al.,2021; Munkvold et al.,2019; Patriarca & Fernández Pinto,2017). Furthermore, outside of North America and Europe, many countries lack the infrastructure to effectively mitigate mycotoxin risk in foodstuffs, leaving many communities at risk to mycotoxin exposure (Echodu et al.,2019; Foerster et al.,2024; Mishra et al.,2020).

TheF. graminearumdisease cycle is well established (Sutton,1982). The fungus either overwinters on infested residue or lives endophytically on other grass species (Leplat et al.,2012; Lofgren et al.,2018). Ascospores and macroconidia are produced as temperatures warm and are typically disseminated via wind and rain to a susceptible host (Munkvold,2003b).Fusarium graminearumtypically infects via the silk channel (Oldenburg et al.,2017; Thompson & Raizada,2018), but can also directly infect kernels if the husk has been wounded, such as from insect feeding (Mesterházy et al.,2012; Munkvold,2003b). Infection rates are the highest when silks have just emerged until they begin to brown (Reid, Bolton et al.,1992). After infection, the ear is colonized by a bright pink to white mold from the first inoculation point outward. During the penetration, infection, and colonization phases, mycotoxins are produced and accumulate in the cob and different parts of the kernel (Oldenburg & Ellner,2015; Schaafsma et al.,2004).

Integrated management strategies and the deployment of resistant cultivars are critical to effectively control GER. Host resistance to GER is quantitatively inherited, and maize genotypes with complete resistance are not available. Disease severity is considered a moderately reliable predictor of DON accumulation (Hart & Gendloff,1984; Reid, Stewart et al.,1996). Therefore, breeding programs aim to reduce disease severity as a proxy for lowering DON accumulation (Mesterházy et al.,2012). However, DON levels well above FDA thresholds can occur in seemingly healthy grain (Dalla Lana et al.,2021; Lofgren et al.,2018). It seems that maize defends against mycotoxin accumulation and fungal colonization differently, and further exploration of the underlying mechanisms of GER resistance is necessary.

For GER resistance, several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified for disease severity, DON, and ZEA concentration (Lipps et al.,2024). However, only three studies have mapped QTLs for DON accumulation (Han et al.,2018; M. Martin et al.,2011; M. Martin et al.,2012), and a single study reported QTL for ZEA accumulation (M. Martin et al.,2011). There is a need to identify loci that reduce toxin accumulation, as, ultimately, toxin concentration is the trait of most interest. Continued screening for GER resistance enhances breeding efforts by identifying highly resistant donors and facilitating the development of resistant cultivars. A challenge associated with screening for ear rot resistance is the need for inoculated trials with sufficient disease pressure for evaluation and genetic mapping (Butoto et al.,2021). Even with appropriate inoculation techniques, GER is environmentally variable, and disease ratings are subject to rater variability. Identifying quantifiable, environmentally stable deterrents of disease may be useful in both understanding resistance mechanisms and streamlining breeding progress.

Secondary metabolites, like products of the phenylpropanoid pathway, generally function as antimicrobial phytoalexins (Muñoz‐Hoyos & Stam,2023) or as signaling molecules for the production of other downstream compounds such as lignin (Upadhyay et al.,2024). The phenylpropanoid pathway has been well characterized, starting with phenylalanine through the production of lignin (Biala & Jasinski,2018; Chateigner‐Boutin & Saulnier,2022; Deng & Lu,2017). Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs), flavonoids, and lignin are products of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Bothin plantaHCAs and flavonoids may potentially be involved in resistance to GER, but their role is less clear for DON and ZEA accumulation (Lipps et al.,2024). HCAs like ferulic acid (FerA) andp‐coumaric acid (PCoA) are environmentally stable and highly heritable traits (Butts‐Wilmsmeyer et al.,2017,2020). Studies in maize have shown that phenolic compounds are produced during the early stages of GER development (Reid, Mather et al.,1992; Sekhon et al.,2006). Silk FerA levels sharply increase after inoculation and subsequently decrease over time (Reid, Mather et al.,1992). The rate of silk FerA decrease is much slower in resistant genotypes compared to susceptible genotypes (Cao et al.,2011; Reid, Mather et al.,1992). At the kernel level, HCAs and flavonoids are localized in the pericarp and aleurone layers (Chatham et al.,2019; Sen et al.,1994). This is particularly interesting as 55% of quantified DON can be found in the pericarp in maize kernels (Schaafsma et al.,2004). Pericarp thickness is highly heritable (Helm & Zuber,1972; Ho et al.,1975), and genotypes with thicker pericarps have higher concentrations of secondary metabolites (Chatham et al.,2019). Anecdotally, the GER‐resistant inbred line, K127, was reported to have thick pericarps compared to more susceptible lines (Chungu et al.,1997). However, the relationship between HCAs, pericarp thickness, and GER resistance has not been thoroughly examined in a genetically diverse population.

Our overarching hypothesis is that grain phenylpropanoid content and kernel composition are genetically and mechanistically related to GER resistance. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated a diverse panel of maize lines with three objectives: (1) examine the effect of inoculation with GER on grain secondary metabolites, (2) quantify the relationship between GER resistance, secondary metabolites, and kernel composition, and (3) examine similarities and differences in the genetic architecture underlying GER and secondary metabolites. We employed both a genome‐wide association study (GWAS) to identify significant markers and the Pathway Association Study Tool (PAST) to identify influential metabolic pathways underlying our phenotypes. Here, we apply multiple statistically robust methods to examine the biochemical and structural potential of the maize kernel in GER resistance.

Resistance mechanisms for Gibberella ear rot (GER) likely involve detoxification and cell wall fortification.

Lignin concentration and composition are important for defense againstFusarium graminearumcolonization in maize.

End‐season ferulic andp‐coumaric acid are not reliable proxies for GER resistance.

We developed and screened a GER diversity panel (n= 318) for GER in 2021 and 2022 (Supporting InformationS1). Our panel included a subset of lines from the USDA Plant Introductory extension in Ames, IA (Romay et al.,2013), as well as lines previously evaluated for GER resistance (Hart & Gendloff,1984). We selected lines that are well adapted to the growing conditions in east‐central Illinois and that flower no later than 80 days after planting. All lines are publicly available, and seed can be requested through the US National Plant Germplasm System.

The GER diversity panel was screened in 2021 and 2022 (FigureS1). Field experiments were organized in an augmented alpha‐lattice incomplete block design using theagricolaepackage (de Mendiburu & Muhammad,2021). Each incomplete block was augmented with PHZ51 as a check line. Each environment was further blocked by flowering time: early, intermediate, and late. Within each flowering time, block plots of NC344, Oh7B, A554, and MS153 were added to meet alpha lattice parameters. NC344 and Oh7B were selected as they have previously been reported to be resistant to and susceptible to multiple fungal diseases, respectively (Lopez‐Zuniga et al.,2019). A554 and MS153 were included as susceptible and moderately susceptible check lines, respectively, based on results from preliminary experiments.

In 2021, the augmented alpha‐lattice design was set up as a split‐plot and repeated twice at each field in the Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Urbana, IL (CFAR2021) and in Savoy, IL (Maxwell2021). At CFAR2021 and Maxwell2021, one replication was inoculated, and the other was uninoculated. Due to field size constraints, we could not have the split‐plot design replicated twice in the same field. Inoculation treatments were spatially separated within each environment to facilitate easy and efficient inoculation. Plots at CFAR2021 received supplemental overhead irrigation. In 2022 the GER diversity panel was evaluated once in each of two fields at the Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Urbana, IL (CFAR2022 and ANSC2022). In 2022, all plots were inoculated. Supplementary drip irrigation was provided for the CFAR2022 plots.

Plants were inoculated with a prepared spore suspension (Lipps et al.,2025). We used a singleF. graminearumisolate, 16Fg001, collected from wheat that is aggressive and an excellent producer of DON (Fall et al.,2019; Krone et al.,2024). To maximize conidia production, the isolate was cultured on potato dextrose at room temperature with a 12‐h light/12‐h dark photoperiod, then transferred to potato dextrose broth and cultured at room temperature in complete darkness (Lipps et al.,2025). Three days before inoculation, 4 mL of liquid culture was transferred to half‐strength potato dextrose agar plates and cultured for 48 h under constant black light at 25°C. To inoculate, a spore suspension was prepared and stored at 4°C. Sterile water was poured on 48‐h‐old plates and gently scraped with a glass rod to dislodge conidia. The concentrated suspension was diluted to 1 × 105spores/mL using a hemacytometer. Plants were inoculated by injecting 1 mL of the prepared suspension into the midpoint of a 14‐ to 15‐day‐old ear with a perforated needle. Care was taken to not puncture the cob. A maximum of 10 ears per plot were inoculated.

During each growing season, all plots were evaluated for days to anthesis (DTA) and days to silking (DTS). DTA is defined as the number of days after planting when 50% of the plot has visible anthers, while DTS is the number of days after planting when 50% of the plot has visible silks. Inoculation occurred 14–15 days after silking. At the end of the growing season, plots were harvested when the black layer was visible. Ears were bulked on a per plot basis. All ears were dried for 7–10 days in a dryer to remove excess moisture. Ears were visually evaluated for disease severity, or the percentage of visibly colonized kernels (SEV) on a 0%–100% scale, with 0 representing no disease and 100 representing the ear completely covered in mold (Lipps et al.,2025). The mean disease rating per plot was calculated. After disease evaluation, ears were shelled, and the grain was bulked on a per‐plot basis (FigureS1). Grain samples were finely ground to a homogenous consistency using a grain mill.

DON and ZEA were extracted using a modified version of the protocol presented by Sulyok et al. (2006). First, 0.5 g of milled grain was mixed with 2 mL of a 79:20:1 mixture of acetonitrile, water, and glacial acetic acid. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27°C then centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 rpm (3300 g). The supernatant was collected and stored at −20°C until HPLC (high‐performance liquid chromatography) analysis. The frozen supernatant was thawed to room temperature and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm (3300 g) for 20 min. Finally, 900 µL of supernatant was collected for HPLC analysis.

Insoluble‐bound PCoA and FerA were extracted following the protocol described by Butts‐Wilmsmeyer et al. (2017). We collected PCoA and FerA profiles for both inoculated (PCoAinoc and FerAinoc) and uninoculated (PCoAun and FerAun) experiments. Samples were defatted using hexane, and 70% acetone was used to remove water‐soluble compounds. Samples were subjected to overnight starch digestion followed by alkaline hydrolysis using 2N NaOH for 2 h. The pH was adjusted using 7N HCl. We extracted insoluble‐bound HCAs via liquid–liquid phase extraction with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction was separated and concentrated to dryness using a Labconco CentriVap system with a cold trap. Samples were reconstituted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm (2200 g) for 30 min. For HPLC analysis 500 µL of the reconstituted, centrifuged extract was collected.

Both mycotoxin and HCA extracts were analyzed on a Shimadzu iSeries 2020 HPLC with Gemini C18column, 100Å, 150 × 4.5 mm inner diameter, and 5 µm particle size. DON and ZEA were quantified from the same mycotoxin extract, while FerA and PCoA were quantified from the same HCA extract. Carrier solvents were H2O with 0.1% formic acid (Solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (Solvent B). We used a previously published gradient programming (Sulyok et al.,2006). The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min at 30°C. All chemical reagents used in this study are HPLC grade and available from Fisher Scientific. Purified water was obtained using a Milli‐Q water purification system (MilliporeSigma). Mycotoxin standards are available from MilliporeSigma. HCA standards are available from Fisher Scientific. All extractions used 0.5 g of milled grain in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. One centrifuge tube was prepared for each of the mycotoxin and HCA extraction procedures.

Kernel composition was assessed on open‐pollinated grain collected from the uninoculated plots in 2021 (FigureS1). Concentrations of starch, protein, and oil were estimated from bulked, shelled grain using near‐infrared reflectance spectra acquired from a Perten DA 7200 Analyzer (Perkin Elmer), with two subsample readings per sample. The Perten DA 7200 Analyzer was previously calibrated using the following protocols. Grain composition was predicted from a custom calibration developed from partial least squares modeling of wet chemistry analysis of diverse maize samples as described (Perten Instruments Application,www.perkinelmer.com). Kernel starch content (starch) was determined using acid hydrolysis (Vidal et al.,2009), protein/total nitrogen (protein) via combustion analysis with an elemental analyzer (CE Elantech/ThermoFisher), and oil concentration (oil) by Soxhlet extraction, Method 920.39 (AOAC,2003). Calibration sample values ranged from 5.2% to 35.8% protein, 1.6% to 20.0% oil, and 31.0% to 76.1% starch. Standard errors of prediction were 0.21, 0.58, 0.38, and 0.88 for kernel moisture, protein, oil, and starch concentrations, respectively. Kernel content values are presented as percentages.

Lines were assayed for pericarp thickness (FigureS1). We indirectly measured pericarp thickness by removing and weighing kernel pericarps (Diaz,2003; Serna‐Saldivar et al.,1991). Briefly, five kernels per genotype from the same plot were evaluated, with each genotype tested four times using seeds from the same packet. We selected uniform seeds from each packet for all replications. Mo17 was included as a check every 30 samples to control for any variation due to extraction, drying, or weighing. Whole kernels were dried in an oven at 100°C for 72 h and weighed. Dried kernels were nixtamalized in 0.02 M NaOH for 15 min and cooled in deionized H2O. Pericarps were separated from the kernels with a scalpel and tweezers. The dissected kernels were dried at 100°C for 48 h. Pericarps were weighed separately from the remaining portion of the kernels. Pericarp percent weight (PCpct) is the percentage of the total dry kernel weight attributed to the pericarp. Here, a higher PCpct represents a thicker pericarp.

The maize inbred lines were previously genotyped (Romay et al.,2013) using genotyping by sequencing (Elshire et al.,2011; Glaubitz et al.,2014). Missing data were imputed previously using the haplotype‐based imputation method described by Romay et al. (2013). The genotypic dataset was recently uplifted to the AGPv4 coordinates and consists of 943,000 SNPs for 17,280 taxa and is available at: panzea.org/genotypes. We filtered the marker dataset to include markers with no more than 20% missing data and a minor allele frequency greater than 5%. Our final marker dataset for all 318 lines consists of 203,465 markers spanning the entire genome.

The 2021 split‐plot experiment was first analyzed separately to examine the effect of inoculation on insoluble‐bound HCA concentration. A mixed model was fit using the PROC MIXED feature in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,2024).

The fixed effects for genotype were extracted and used for further analysis. For all previously mentioned phenotypes, LS Means of Oh7B were not estimated for any trait as there was little to no seed set in every environment. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between all LS Means were estimated using thercorr()function in theHmiscpackage v5.1‐3 (Harrell,2023).

We conducted association mapping with SEV, DON, and ZEA and any traits that were strongly correlated with SEV, DON, or ZEA (FigureS1). First, we employed the FarmCPU (fixed and random model circulating probability unification) method (Liu et al.,2016) in GAPIT (genome association and prediction integrated tool) version 3 (Lipka et al.,2012; Wang & Zhang,2021) to identify markers associated with SEV, DON, ZEA, PCoAinoc, PCoAun, FerAinoc, FerAun, and PCpct. For all traits, we included no principal components for population structure for association mapping, as determined using the ‘Model.selection’ feature. Significant markers were determined by using Benjamini–Hochberg adjustedp‐values (Benjamini & Hochberg,1995), and a threshold ofα= 0.1 was used.

We then employed the PAST to identify metabolic pathways associated with SEV, DON, ZEA, PCoAinoc, PCoAun, FerAinoc, FerAun, and PCpct (FigureS1). PAST analyzes association mapping results and annotated metabolic pathways to identify metabolic pathways associated with a phenotype of interest (Thrash et al.,2020). PAST requires TASSEL results as input, so association analysis was also conducted using TASSEL. First, using TASSEL v.2.81 (Bradbury et al.,2007), we generated a centered IBS (identical‐by‐state) kinship matrix and ran association mapping using the mixed linear model (MLM) approach with an optimum compression level. We also generated a linkage disequilibrium file using TASSEL v2.81 (Bradbury et al.,2007). We did not include a principal component matrix for the MLM in TASSEL, as the GAPIT software did not include principal components. We conducted the PAST analysis with R v4.4.1 (R Core Team,2024) using thePASTpackage v1.22.0 (Thrash et al.,2020). A gene assignment window of 1000 base pairs was used, anR2cutoff of 0.8 was applied, and pathways with at least five genes were considered. Significance was determined based on 1000 permutations and a threshold ofα= 0.05 was used to identify significant pathways. For all association analyses, we used the same filtered marker dataset and phenotypic file (Supporting InformationS1).

We screened brown midrib single mutants with mutations inbm1,bm2,and bm4, and double mutants ofbm1andbm2(bm1bm2), andbm3andbm4(bm3bm4) in an A619 background (Barrière & Argillier,1993). Lignin‐deficient genotypes were screened in 2022 and 2023 at the Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Urbana, IL. In both years, experiments were organized in a randomized complete block design with four complete blocks per year. All lines were inoculated and evaluated for GER severity as previously described. We first identified and removed two outliers within our data that had studentized residuals more than two standard deviations from the mean and had significantly elevated Cook's distance values. We then fit the filtered data to a linear model and ran an ANOVA to ensure that genotype was significant. SEV was transformed by a value of 0.63 based on a boxcox transformation. The best lambda was identified using ‘boxcox’ feature from theHmiscpackage v.5.1‐0 (Harrell,2023). We then used a Dunnett's test to identify brown midrib mutants that were statistically different from the A619 control (α= 0.1). The Dunnett's test was performed using the ‘DunnettTest’ feature from the package DescTools v0.99.57 (Signorell,2024).

In the 2021 experiment, SEV, DON, and ZEA values were higher in inoculated trials than in untreated trials (Table1). In the uninoculated treatments, the highest observed SEV was 6.5%. The FDA guideline for DON in grain products intended for human consumption is 1 part per million (ppm) (Center for Veterinary Medicine,2010). Two uninoculated plots had DON levels above 1 ppm, with a maximum concentration of 1.48 ppm. Advisory levels are not set for ZEA in the United States. The European Commission (2023) has set a threshold of 0.35 ppm (350 µg/kg) for ZEA in “unprocessed maize grains before first‐stage processing.” Three uninoculated plots were above this threshold and the maximum uninoculated ZEA concentration was 8.2 ppm. There was no overlap between uninoculated plots with the highest DON and ZEA levels nor with the highest severity scores. All plots with DON and ZEA levels above regulatory thresholds had less than 1% average disease severity. In the inoculated treatments, we observed between 0% and 100% disease severity, DON levels as high as 2977.96 ppm, and ZEA levels as high as 80.53 ppm (Figure1).

Toxin levels and GER severity exhibited environmental variability. Correlations for SEV between environments and years were strong and highly significant (Table2). In contrast, we observed weak, but significant correlations for DON between the 2021 environments (r= 0.13,p< 0.05) and Maxwell2021 and ANSC2022 (r= 0.11,p< 0.05). For ZEA we observed significant correlation coefficients between the 2022 environments (r= 0.15,p< 0.01) and between CFAR2021 and CFAR2022 (r= 0.17,p< 0.01). Despite the strong effect of environment, we observed moderate correlations between SEV, DON, and ZEA within the inoculated environments, except for DON and ZEA in CFAR2022 (TableS1). SEV, DON, and ZEA are generally positively correlated (Han et al.,2018; Martin et al.,2012; M. Martin et al.,2011; Reid, Stewart et al.,1996), but in this study, DON had nonsignificant correlations with both ZEA and SEV in CFAR2022.

Spearman rank correlations between disease severity (SEV), deoxynivalenol (DON), and zearalenone (ZEA) between the four inoculated environments from 2021 to 2022.

To test whether inoculation had an effect on HCAs, we conducted a split‐plot trial in 2021 that included inoculated and uninoculated plots of the GER diversity panel and evaluated the plots for HCA concentrations. We observed significant genotypic variation in PCoA and FerA concentration (Figure2; TableS2). Inoculation had a significant effect on end‐season FerA but not end‐season PCoA (TableS2). Significant treatment × genotype interactions were observed for both FerA and PCoA (TableS2), indicating that end‐season HCA varied in response to inoculation and responses varied by genotype. Some genotypes had a stronger response to inoculation compared to others (FiguresS2andS3). Specifically, NC344 and PHZ51 had elevated mean PCoA concentrations after inoculation, while mean A554 and MS153 PCoA concentrations were reduced after inoculation. This trend was also similar for mean FerA concentrations across the same set of lines (FigureS2). Inoculation has a significant effect on end‐season FerA and PCoA concentrations, but the extent of the effect is genotype specific.

Levels ofp‐coumaric acid and ferulic acid in ppm between treatments. Quantitative variation forp‐coumaric acid (A) and ferulic acid (B) are observed between treatments. Treatment did not have a significant effect on end season hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) concentration alone. Inoc., inoculated; Uninoc., uninoculated.

A similar distribution of FerA and PCoA concentrations was observed across all inoculated environments (Figure1). Variance component estimates for Environment and Genotype × Environment explained minimal variation for PCoAinoc and FerAinoc (TableS3). For PCoAun and FerAun environment also explained minimal variation (TableS3).

We examined the correlations among LS Means estimates for all traits in our dataset (Table3). SEV and DON were weakly correlated (r= 0.22,p< 0.001). ZEA was moderately correlated with SEV (r= 0.42,p< 0.001) and DON (r= 0.49,p< 0.001). We observed moderate, positive correlations between DTA and DTS with SEV, DON, and ZEA (Table3), indicating that later flowering plants tended to be more susceptible to GER than earlier flowering plants, even in inoculated studies. This relationship between flowering time and GER and resistance is well established (Kebede et al.,2016; Mesterházy et al.,2012).

Spearman rank correlation coefficients between least squared means (LS Means) estimated for severity (SEV), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA), inoculated and uninoculated ferulic acid (FerAinoc and FerAun), inoculated and uninoculatedp‐coumaric acid (PCoAinoc and PCoAun), oil, percent pericarp weight (PCpct), protein, starch, days to anthesis (DTA), and days to silking (DTS).

One of our objectives was to identify traits that may function as proxies, such as HCAs and kernel composition, for SEV, DON, and ZEA. SEV was significantly, negatively correlated with FerAinoc (r= −0.54,p< 0.001) and PCoAinoc (r= −0.19,p< 0.001), indicating that as PCoA and FerA levels increased, SEV levels decreased. ZEA was also negatively correlated with FerAinoc (r= −0.14,p< 0.05). DON was not significantly correlated with FerAinoc or PCoAinoc. Interestingly, FerAun and PCoAun were not significantly correlated with either SEV, DON, or ZEA. Oil was not significantly correlated with any of the disease phenotypes. DON was not significantly correlated with PCpct, protein, or starch. Protein was significantly negatively correlated with both SEV (r= −0.21,p< 0.001) and ZEA (r= −0.26,p< 0.001). Starch was significantly positively correlated with both SEV (r= 0.27,p< 0.001) and ZEA (r= 0.24,p< 0.001). PCpct was negatively correlated with SEV (r= −0.26,p< 0.001), suggesting that lines with thicker pericarps have decreased SEV values. Given the correlations, it is possible that SEV, PCpct, FerAinoc, and PCoAinoc are interconnected.

We conducted a GWAS using LSMeans for SEV, DON, ZEA, FerAinoc, FerAun, PCoAinoc, PCoAun, and PCpct (Supporting InformationS1). Our goal was to identify candidate genes for SEV, DON, and ZEA and examine whether there was overlap in the genetic architecture of these traits. LSMeans estimates show quantitative variability in the GER diversity panel (Figure3; FigureS4; Table4; TablesS3andS4). In total, we identified 59 significant markers (α= 0.1) for all traits except for DON (Figure4; Table5; TableS5; FigureS5). Twenty‐seven of the 59 significant markers were within 1000 bp of an annotated gene (TableS5). We identified candidate genes with annotations related to pathogen defense, secondary metabolite production, and other functions. For all traits, there were no common significant markers (TableS5).

Multiple significant markers for HCAs were proximal to significant markers for SEV and ZEA. On chromosome 1, the significant markers for SEV, S1_82157423, and PCoAun, S1_83011288, were 870 kb apart. On chromosome 8, a significant marker for SEV, S8_171137903, was 1.1 Mb from the significant marker for PCoAinoc S8_170035427. We also identified a 3.1 Mb region on chromosome 3 where significant markers associated with FerA, pericarp thickness, and disease severity colocalized. The significant marker for SEV, S3_3558135, is 85 kb from the significant marker for FerAun, S3_3472166, and 3 Mb from the significant marker for PCpct S3_6682050. While we cannot directly say these markers and traits are interrelated, we can speculate that these regions harbor important alleles for disease severity, FerA production, and pericarp thickness.

Our goal was to examine the role of secondary metabolites in disease resistance. Using PAST, we identified 130 metabolic pathways associated with SEV, DON, ZEA, FerAinoc, FerAun, PCoAinoc, PCoAun, and PCpct (Supporting InformationS2). We identified 19 metabolic pathways in common for phenotypes in the inoculated experiments, namely, SEV, DON, ZEA, PCoAinoc, and FerAinoc (Table6). The most interesting of these pathways are those associated with detoxification, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant cell integrity.

Significant metabolic pathways identified in the Pathway Association Study Tool (PAST) analysis that are shared between disease severity (SEV), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA), inoculated grain ferulic acid (FerAinoc), and inoculated grainp‐coumaric acid (PCoAinoc).

A central hypothesis of this study is that HCAs underlie GER resistance in maize. Two pathways were associated with increasing either FerAinoc or PCoAinoc levels: PWY‐5041:S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine salvage II and PWY‐6457:cinnamoyl‐CoA biosynthesis, respectively. S‐Adenosyl‐l‐methionine production is a key substrate in the phenylpropanoid pathway and is necessary for FerA and downstream lignin production (Sauter et al.,2013; Tang et al.,2014; FigureS6). PWY‐5041 was also associated with decreasing SEV levels, suggesting that lignin may be associated with GER resistance. Cinnamoyl‐CoA is reduced by cinnamoyl‐CoA reductase to produce cinnamaldehydes, which are immediate precursors to the various lignin subunits (Davin et al.,2008; FigureS6). Additionally, PWY‐6457 was associated with increasing DON levels.Fusarium graminearumisolates that produce DON are more efficient in intracellular colonization (Armer et al.,2024). Interestingly, PWY‐6040:chlorogenic acid biosynthesis II significantly decreased PCoAinoc and ZEA levels. PWY‐5313:superpathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis was associated with increasing SEV and ZEA. Anthocyanin is a separate branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway that can be produced in place of lignin (FigureS6). Finally, the pathway R‐ZMA‐1119314.1:cellulose biosynthesis was significantly associated with increased PCoAinoc and DON. The plant cell wall is comprised of cellulose and lignin, which form orthogonally arranged layers that are typically cross‐linked with polysaccharides (Alberts et al.,2002). PCoA is associated with cell wall fortification (Ishii,1997). Ultimately, the association of these phenylpropanoid‐related pathways with GER‐related traits suggests that lignin may be important in GER resistance.

There were significant differences in GER susceptibility for the brown midrib mutants (TableS6). The double mutants ofbm1andbm2(bm1bm2) (p= 0.10) and the single mutant ofbm4(p= 0.07) were significantly more susceptible to GER when compared to A619 (Figure5; TableS6). A previous study that screened brown midrib mutantsbm1,bm2,bm3, andbm4in a W64A background found that single mutantsbm1andbm3were significantly more susceptible to GER compared to the W64A control (Kolkman et al.,2023). We did not have enough seed for thebm3mutant to examine the effect of thebm3single mutant in our experiment. Thus, there are varying degrees of GER susceptibility among different brown midrib mutants, withbm1bm2double mutant andbm4single mutant showing increased susceptibility compared to A619.

The maize–F. graminearumsystem is beautifully complex. There is an established foundation regarding the genetic architecture of resistance (Akohoue & Miedaner,2022; Lipps et al.,2024). Breeding programs continue to work toward decreasing disease severity and mitigating mycotoxin accumulation (Mesterházy et al.,2012; Miedaner et al.,2020; Munkvold,2003a). Epidemiological studies have elucidated contributing environmental covariates that are drivers for mycotoxin production (Dalla Lana et al.,2021). Still, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of GER resistance. There is a critical need to identify and exploit GER resistance mechanisms to develop resistant germplasm. We comprehensively screened a diverse panel of inbred maize lines for GER in relation to HCA content and kernel composition. We observed correlations between secondary metabolites and GER, identified markers for secondary metabolites in the same regions as markers for GER, and identified metabolic pathways shared between secondary metabolites and GER. We identified candidate genes related to detoxification, and cell wall integrity, among others. These results provide a platform for future research to continue to examine distinct mechanisms to mitigate fungal colonization and mycotoxin detoxification.

In the maize–F. graminearumsystem environmental covariates, tissue type, biochemical composition, host genetics, and pathogen genetics all interact to produce visual disease symptoms and mycotoxin (Agrios,2005; Leveau,2024).Fusarium graminearumemploys separate genetic machinery to synthesize DON and ZEA (Desjardins,2006). The relationship between SEV and mycotoxin levels is nuanced. In many genetic backgrounds, disease severity is not predictive of mycotoxin concentration, and DON concentration varies across the growing season (Miller & Young,1983; Reid & Sinha,1998). We observed strong, significant correlations for SEV among environments, while correlations for DON and ZEA between environments were nonexistent. Furthermore, we observed weak but significant correlations between DON, ZEA, and SEV. This is consistent with the GWAS results, where there are no overlapping markers for these traits. Thus, there are likely alternative mechanisms underlying mycotoxin accumulation that are separate from disease severity.

We report very high values for DON but not for ZEA. DON concentrations from 0 to 1922 ppm have been reported in inoculated studies (Han et al.,2018; Hart & Gendloff,1984; M. Martin et al.,2011; Reid, Mather et al.,1996; Reid, Stewart, et al.,1996). ZEA levels up to 74 ppm have been reported in other inoculated studies (Hart & Gendloff,1984; M. Martin et al.,2011). OurFusarium graminearumisolate was isolated from wheat and was the most aggressive and prolific DON producer on wheat from a population of 56 isolates collected in Illinois (Fall et al.,2019; Krone et al.,2024). Previously, DON has been evaluated in small samples of inbred lines (Hart & Gendloff,1984; Reid, Mather et al.,1996), in elite European Flint and Dent populations (Han et al.,2018), or in a biparental population developed from elite European germplasm (M. Martin et al.,2011). Similarly, ZEA has previously been evaluated in a biparental population developed from elite European germplasm (M. Martin et al.,2011). It is possible that we have lines that exhibit extreme susceptibility to DON accumulation. Additionally, the environment and management of the field sites likely contributed to high mycotoxin concentrations.

Resistance to mycotoxin accumulation is the most important GER resistance phenotype. Only three mapping studies have identified QTL for DON (Han et al.,2018; M. Martin et al.,2011; Martin et al.,2012) and one mapping study for ZEA (M. Martin et al.,2011). For SEV, the candidate geneZm00001d029716on chromosome 1, encoding a putative heavy metal transport/detoxification superfamily protein identified by the GWAS, implicates detoxification as a potential mechanism of resistance. DON detoxification mechanisms have been characterized in wheat and Arabidopsis (W. J. He et al.,2024; McLaughlin et al.,2021). In wheat infected with Fusarium crown rot,TraesCS5D01G141600.1, a gene encoding a heavy metal transport/detoxification superfamily protein, was significantly upregulated in two wheat cultivars after inoculation withF. pseudograminearumandFusarium culmorum(Jin et al.,2020). In barley, two defense responses to manage trichothecene accumulation have been proposed: detoxification and neutralization of the mycotoxin via ubiquitination and transportation, and ubiquitination that leads to eventual programmed cell death (Boddu et al.,2007). Within this proposed model, the maize candidate geneZm00001d029716could function in the transportation and detoxification of DON and ZEA. For ZEA,Arabidopsis thalianaemploys other transporters such as ABC (ATP synthase‐binding cassette) transporters and glucosyltransferases are effective host detoxification strategy (Adam et al.,2015). Another detoxification candidate gene isZm00001d051863, which encodes a cytochrome P450 on chromosome 4. Cytochrome P450s are implicated in the production of various phytoalexins such as camalexin, isoflavonoids, and DIMBOA (Dixon,2001; Dixon et al.,2002). In plants, cytochrome P450s function in detoxification of herbicides (Goldberg‐Cavalleri et al.,2025; Powles & Yu,2010) and activated oxygen species (Werck‐Reichhart & Feyereisen,2000). In insects, cytochrome P450s are also functional in detoxifying many mycotoxins (Berenbaum et al.,2020; De Zutter et al.,2016). Detoxification solutions within maize seem a promising avenue to further explore to manage mycotoxin accumulation.

We also identified candidate genes associated with pathogen defense for PCoAinoc and FerAinoc (TableS5). For PCoAinoc, two defense‐related candidate genes areZm00001d028999, which encodes a NAC (N‐acetyl cysteine) transcription factor N‐acetylmuramic acid2 on chromosome 1, andZm00001d018620, which encodes a Peroxidase 1 on chromosome 7. NAC transcription factors are associated with stress response and hormone signaling in response to invasion from many fungal pathogens (Yuan et al.,2019). Peroxidases serve many potential functions in plant defense including cell wall reinforcement and as signaling molecules for phytohormones and phytoalexins (Almagro et al.,2009). We also identified the candidate geneZm00001d029940on chromosome 1, which encodes an ethylene‐response transcription factor 5 for FerAinoc. Ethylene is a plant hormone associated with biotic and abiotic stress response and often interacts with other defense‐related hormones (Broekaert et al.,2006). It seems that when infested withF. graminearum, HCA levels are, in part, controlled by defense‐related mechanisms.

Fusarium graminearumsecretes many putative cell wall degrading enzymes (Brown et al.,2012). Thus, resistance strategies that prevent cell death by fortifying the cell wall or maintaining cell integrity are essential. The mobilization of antifungal compounds and compounds that strengthen the cell wall is one plausible defense strategy against necrotrophic pathogens likeF. graminearum. We identified candidate genes involved with cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell wall reinforcement (Table5; TableS5). A candidate gene for SEV,Zm00001d006549, encodes a putative formin‐like protein 11 on chromosome 2, and a candidate gene for FerAinoc,Zm00001d044819, encodes a putative myosin‐11 protein encoding gene on chromosome 9. Myosin and actin are interconnected. Myosin traffics vesicles by moving across actin filaments within the cell (Duan & Tominaga,2018). Formin proteins aid in cytoskeleton reorganization to assist in targeted defense response at the plant cell wall (Deeks,2021; Sassmann et al.,2018). We also identified candidate genes associated with cell wall composition for ZEA and PCoAun. For ZEA on chromosome 1,Zm00001d026066encodes a xyloglucan galactosyltransferase and is functionally important in xyloglucan biosynthesis (Jensen et al.,2012), which is a key component of the cell wall in pericarp cells (Santiago‐Ramos et al.,2018). For PCoAun, the candidate geneZm00001d015186on chromosome 5 encodes a glycosyltransferase. Glycosyltransferases function to build complex polysaccharides that are structural components of the plant cell wall (Amos & Mohnen,2019). We also identifiedZm00001d012477on chromosome 8, annotated as a putative laccase family protein (TableS5). Laccases are associated with downstream lignin production and the formation of plant cell walls (Bai et al.,2023). The plant cell wall is a complex, layered matrix of polysaccharides, HCA‐amides, lignin, and pectin (Alberts et al.,2002; Ishii,1997; Santiago‐Ramos et al.,2018).

The first tissueF. graminearumencounters during kernel colonization is the pericarp (Lipps et al.,2024). Thicker pericarps have the potential to contain larger quantities of secondary metabolites (Chatham et al.,2019). In the GER diversity panel, PCpct was positively correlated with inoculated and uninoculated FerA and PCoA. Furthermore, PCpct and SEV were negatively correlated. While we did not observe significant relationships between PCpct and mycotoxin accumulation, the pericarp is where the most DON is found in infested maize grain (Schaafsma et al.,2004). Thus, a thicker, more complex pericarp with higher HCA concentration may limit fungal spread, but it may increase DON and ZEA accumulation.

The role of kernel composition in GER resistance is not well understood. For Aspergillus ear rot, caused byAspergillus flavus, kernel fiber and ash content were strongly negatively correlated with aflatoxin, and carbohydrate levels were positively correlated with aflatoxin (Mideros et al.,2012). We observed similar, albeit weaker, trends with SEV and ZEA in the GER resistance panel. In wheat, cellulose levels decreased in grain due to infection (Boyacioǧlu & Hettiarachchy,1995). In infected barley, β‐glucan, a soluble fiber in endosperm cell walls, significantly decreased after infection withF. graminearum(C. Martin et al.,2018). Furthermore, the most resistant barley cultivars had the highest β‐glucan levels (C. Martin et al.,2018). The grain structure, the physical arrangement of components within the grain, rather than simply composition, the chemical makeup of grain, is important for GER resistance. The more efficientlyF. graminearumcan break down cell walls, and access starches, the more aggressive the pathogen seems to be.

HCAs and other secondary metabolites are multifunctional components of plant response to biotic stress. These metabolites can act as phytoalexins and signaling molecules; however, the underlying mechanisms by which they regulate plant defense are not fully understood (Erb & Kliebenstein,2020; Muñoz‐Hoyos & Stam,2023; Upadhyay et al.,2024; Zeiss et al.,2021). Adding to the complexity, the multiple functions of these compounds are highly interconnected. In horticultural crops, both FerA and PCoA function as weak antimicrobials effective against fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens (J. He et al.,2019; Hu et al.,2023; Islam et al.,2018,2019; Shu et al.,2021). In the case ofFusariumsp., amending media with either FerA or PCoA significantly reduces fungal colonization (Assabgui et al.,1993; Fajardo et al.,2025; Martínez‐Fraca et al.,2022; Ponts et al.,2011; Yan et al.,2023). This antimicrobial function may partially explain the elevated PCoA observed in our inoculated treatments; however, the interactions are quite complex and genotype specific. HCAs may also serve as signaling molecules or damage‐associated molecular pattern, triggering defense signaling upon their release or activation during pathogen invasion (Erb & Kliebenstein,2020; Upadhyay et al.,2024; Zeiss et al.,2021). In tomato, the accumulation of HCA amides, derivatives of HCAs, has been associated with the upregulation of WRKY transcription factors, hypersensitive response genes, and increased salicylic acid concentrations (Campos et al.,2014; Etalo et al.,2013). HCA production is dynamic over the course of the disease cycle, complicating the interpretation of their role in pathogen defense (J. He et al.,2019; Hu et al.,2023; Islam et al.,2018,2019; Shu et al.,2021). In the maize–F. graminearumsystem, HCA levels fluctuate, but resistance seems to depend on the host's ability to produce HCAs at rates that are faster than the pathogen can metabolize them (Cao et al.,2011; Fajardo et al.,2025; Reid, Mather et al.,1992). Overall, HCAs are likely functioning at multiple levels to provide resistance to diseases such as GER. Key open questions in the maize–F. graminearumsystem include what specific defense responses are elicited by HCAs in the ear and howF. graminearumperceives, detoxifies, or otherwise interacts with these compounds.

A final product of the phenylpropanoid pathway is lignin (FigureS6). In maize,Ustilago maydismanipulates the phenylpropanoid pathway to produce anthocyanin over lignin (Tanaka et al.,2014,2018). Many proteins secreted byF. graminearumhave predicted functions associated with cellulose degradation, phenolic polymer lignin, laccases, peroxidases, and FerA esterases (Brown et al.,2012). In maize, the brown midrib genes affect distinct aspects of the final steps in lignin biosynthesis (FigureS6). TheBm1gene encodes a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (Barrière et al.,1994; Halpin et al.,1998), one of the final enzymes in lignin synthesis. BothBm2, a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, andBm4, a folypolyglutamate synthase, are within the S‐adenosyl‐methionine pathway (Li et al.,2015; Tang et al.,2014). S‐Adenosyl methionine functions as a methyl donor for both caffeoyl CoA 3‐O‐methyltransferase and caffeic acidO‐methyltransferase (FigureS6), encoded byBm3(Barrière et al.,1994; Vignols et al.,1995). The lignin‐deficient, brown midrib maize mutants are more susceptible to multiple foliar diseases, anthracnose stalk rot, and GER (Kolkman et al.,2023). We also observed increased susceptibility to GER in brown midrib maize mutants (Figure5). Thebm1andbm3mutants in a W64A background are more susceptible to GER (Kolkman et al.,2023). In this study,bm1bm2andbm4mutants in an A619 are significantly more susceptible to GER. These discrepancies could be partially attributed to differences in the genetic background between A619 and W64A or differences betweenF. graminearumisolates. Brown midrib mutants have reduced overall lignin content and altered ratios of the lignin subunits: guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), andp‐hydroxyphenol (P). (Spangler,2008). Maizebm2andbm4mutants have a higher S/G lignin ratio despite decreased total lignin content (Vermerris et al.,2010). A higher S/G lignin ratio in maize cobs increases resistance toA. flavus(Spangler,2008). It is surprising to see that thebm1bm2andbm4mutants were more susceptible to GER, as they likely also have higher S/G lignin ratios.Fusarium graminearumandA. flavusare distinct pathogens. Meta‐analyses have reported some overlap betweenF. graminearumand other ear rot pathogens (Akohoue & Miedaner,2022; Mideros et al.,2014).Fusarium graminearumclearly possesses the molecular machinery to degrade and break down lignin. It is unclear howF. graminearuminteracts with lignin during colonization. However, it does seem that lignin is a critical component of GER resistance. Maize grown for silage has altered lignin concentrations and ratios compared to maize grown for grain. The increased susceptibility ofbmmutants to GER implies that silage corn is at risk for mycotoxin contamination and should be monitored for mycotoxin accumulation (Reed et al.,2022).

GER is a complex, quantitative disease, and it is unlikely that a single gene or metabolic pathway will completely control the disease. In our comprehensive screening of the GER diversity panel, we identified traits, markers, candidate genes, and metabolic pathways that are associated with resistance to GER. We identified regions on chromosomes 1, 3, and 8 with markers significantly associated with SEV, ZEA, HCA concentration, and PCpct. HCAs, like FerA and PCoA, are multifunctional but their roles as antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and cell wall fortifiers appear critical in GER resistance. Furthermore, lignin concentration and composition appear to be meaningful in limiting fungal colonization. Of note, we identified candidate genes and pathways associated with HCA production, lignin biosynthesis, and cell wall fortification. Brown midrib mutants, particularlybm1bm2andbm4, had higher fungal colonization compared to wild type, suggesting that lignin, specifically the ratio of lignin subunits, may be important in limiting fungal spread. Further studies examining the temporal dynamic of the maize–Fusarium graminearumsystem will provide insight into the complexities of the host–pathogen interaction.
