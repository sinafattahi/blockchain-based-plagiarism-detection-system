AlthoughRhizoma Chuanxionghas been used for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), the relevant mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential targets and mechanisms ofRhizoma Chuanxiongin treating DKD, utilizing network pharmacology.

Active compounds ofRhizoma Chuanxiongwere obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database. SwissTargetPrediction was used to obtain the potential targets of active ingredients. DKD-associated targets were gathered from the GeneCards, DisGeNET, and OMIM databases. The STRING database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 were used for investigating core targets and interactions among targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene Genomes enrichment were performed using DAVID database. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock-1.5.7 based on the crystal structures of the targets as deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank.

The top 10 core targets were identified, namely PPARG, AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, CASP3, PPARA, ICAM1, PTGS2, SRC, and MMP9. Enrichment analysis revealed that the primary pathways involving these targets including prolactin signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, TNF signaling pathway, relaxin signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Molecular docking demonstrated that mandenol exhibited a strong binding affinity toward EGFR domain, and wallichilide displayed pronounced binding affinity toward AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, and PTGS2 domains. Additionally, myricanone and senkyunone also showed strong binding affinity for AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, and PTGS2 domains.

This study revealed the potential multi-component and multi-target mechanisms ofRhizoma Chuanxiongin treating DKD through network pharmacology. Supplementary experiments are required to further verify these findings.

Diabetes, a group of metabolic diseases, has become a significant global public health concern and a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. According to data from the Global Burden of Disease, 529 million people worldwide were living with diabetes in 2021, and this number is expected to increase to 1.31 billion by 2050 [1]. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the common microvascular complications in patients with diabetes, and the main cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide, significantly increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes [2]. DKD is a complex disease process that involves several pathophysiologic mechanisms, such as metabolic dysregulation (hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia), hemodynamic change, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Metabolic dysregulation leads to the activation of polyol pathway, advanced glycation end-products formation, protein kinase C activation, and hexosamine pathway flux, and these pathways contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, creating a vicious cycle [3,4]. Hyperglycemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RASS) results in increased intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration, which leads to glomerular capillary hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and podocyte injury [5]. Current treatments for DKD include RAAS inhibition, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [3]. These treatments are not universally applicable to patients across all stages of DKD. And they are focus on managing risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and proteinuria, rather than directly targeting the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of DKD. The absence of targeted therapeutic strategies significantly restricts capacity to delay the progression of the disease. Therefore, identifying effective medications is critical in the treatment of DKD.

Traditional Chinese medicine has shown positive effects on the treatment of DKD.Rhizoma Chuanxiong, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine dried from rhizome ofRhizoma chuanxiong Hort, has been demonstrated to increase blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and alleviate pain [6]. Several studies have revealed thatRhizoma Chuanxiongexerts anti-thrombotic effects and prevent liver and kidney fibrosis. Furthermore, studies have indicated thatRhizoma Chuanxiongexhibits protective effects against acute renal injury [7–10]. Recent clinical and experimental studies suggested that the active ingredients ofRhizoma Chuanxiongmay have a positive effect on DKD [11–13]. However, the related mechanism remains unclear.

Network pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary approach rooted in systems biology and network analysis of biological systems, employs advanced informatics technologies and biomedical databases to predict drug-disease interactions and elucidate underlying therapeutic mechanisms [14]. This study aimed to investigate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the effects ofRhizoma Chuanxiongon DKD using network pharmacology approach.

The active components ofRhizoma Chuanxiongwere systematically retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) (http://tcmspw.com, Version 2.3) with screening criteria based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) [15,16]. The ADME parameters were achieved by satisfying the following standards: drug-likeness (DL) ≥ 0.18, oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30%, hydrogen bond donors (Hdon) < 5, and hydrogen bond acceptors (Hacc) < 10 [17,18]. Canonical SMILES obtained from PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) were imported into SwissTargetPrediction (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/) for potential targets prediction ofRhizoma Chuanxiong[19]. GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/, version 5.23), DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/home/, version 24.2), and OMIM (https://omim.org/) were utilized to collect DKD-associated targets, with all target data restricted to ‘Homo sapiens’. In the Genecards database, the targets with a score greater than the median were identified as a potential target for DKD [20,21]. In the DisGeNET database, the targets with a score of gda >0.1 were identified as potential targets for DKD [22,23]. The disease targets from OMIM database were obtained from established scientific studies and experimental results. Therefore, all the DKD-associated targets were included in the analysis. Venny2.1 was utilized to identify and visualize the overlapping genes between active compounds ofRhizoma Chuanxiongand DKD.

To elucidate the interplay betweenRhizoma Chuanxiongand DKD, we conducted protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using overlapping genes identified betweenRhizoma Chuanxiongcompounds and DKD. The gene set was uploaded to the STRING database (https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl, Version 12.0) for PPI network construction [24]. The software Cytoscape 3.10.1 was used to further visualize the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The further visualize of PPI network was performed using the CentiScaPe 2.2 plugin in Cytoscape 3.10.1. Key topological parameters, including closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and degree centrality, were calculated for each node. Nodes were filtered based on the average values of these parameters to identify biologically significant hubs. Specifically, nodes with values above the average for closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and degree centrality were identified as core targets for further analysis [25]. The size of the node is directly related to the degree of the core target, reflecting core target topological significance in the pharmacological-disease network [26].

To investigate the biological functions of potential targets in DKD, the David database (version 6.8) was utilized to collect information on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene Genomes (KEGG) analysis data, and GO enrichment analysis was carried out at three different levels: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC) [27]. The threshold was set atp< 0.05, FDR < 0.05 for GO enrichment and pathway screening. Considering thep-value reflects only the statistical significance of target enrichment in the pathway, not the biological correlation, we excluded the non-relevant pathways in our results. A dot plot was used to visually represent the findings of the KEGG pathway enrichment study. The gene ratio is illustrated on the horizontal axis, while the names of the enriched pathways are shown on the vertical axis. The color scale represents specific thresholds of thep-value, and the size of each dot correlates with the number of genes associated with each pathway. The dot plot and bar plot were constructed using the web-based platform for data analysis and visualization,https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn(last accessed on 20 Feb 2024) [28]. The KEGG pathway maps were generated using the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/, Release 111.1, September 1, 2024). We utilized software Cytoscape 3.10.1 to construct and visualize the drug–compound–target–signaling pathway network.

The core targets in the PPI were ranked by degree value in descending order, and the top five core targets overlapping with those in the drug-component-target-signaling pathway network were selected for molecular docking. The molecular docking technology was executed using AutoDock (Version 1.5.6 Sep_17_14) based on the crystal structures of the targets obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org/). The primary objective gene was searched in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, and the selection criteria were confined to (homo species with X-ray resolution ≤ 2 A). The active components ofRhizoma Chuanxiongwere analyzed using AutoDock Vina software (Version 1.5.6 Sep_17_14) to evaluate their binding energy with specific proteins. To ensure the reliability of the results, we conducted 50 times independent molecular docking experiments for the same ligand-receptor complex, and based on the principle of energy minimization selected the lowest binding energy value as our result. A binding energy threshold of lower than −5 kcal/mol indicated stable affinity between the components and proteins, the affinity between components and proteins improved. The components with the highest binding affinity were combined with proteins and visualized using PyMOL 3.1.

The active components ofRhizoma Chuanxiongwere screened based on ADME parameters from the TCMSP database, including Myricanone, Mandenol, wallichilide, and senkyunone (Table 1). After removing duplicates, a total of 248 potential compound-related targets were identified using the SwissTargetPrediction platform. There were 1780 therapeutic targets of DKD that were acquired from GeneCards, DisGeNET, and OMIM databases after deleting duplicates. The potential targets ofRhizoma Chuanxiongand DKD were imported into the Venny 2.1 online tool to generate a Venn diagram. Finally, 95 overlapping targets were identified for further analysis (Figure 1andTable 2).

Figure 2illustrates the PPI network of overlapping targets constructed using the STRING database. The subsequent analysis was conducted with Cytoscape3.10.1 software, and the network consisted of 95 nodes and 780 edges was constructed without any filtering. Following a screening process with the parameters: betweenness > 95.65263158, closeness > 0.00536038, and degree > 16.42105263, we refined the network to 21 nodes and 157 edges (Figure 3). The 21 core targets were hierarchically ranked by degree value in descending order: PPARG, AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, CASP3, PPARA, ICAM1, PTGS2, SRC, MMP9, CCND1, SCARB1, MAPK14, ACE, NR3C1, KDR, MAPK8, APOB, CYP19A1, FASN, and SLC2A2. The size and color of each node inFigure 3correspond to its degree (larger node and redder color indicate higher degree). To allow the readers to quantitatively compare node importance, we have presented the degree values of the key targets inTable 3. The higher degree value indicates the more pivotal role of the node within the network, the more biological functions involved, and the greater the biological importance. The top 10 targets, ranked by degree, were PPARG, AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, CASP3, PPARA, ICAM1, PTGS2, SRC, and MMP9.

The DAVID database was used for enrichment analysis of 21 core targets, including the BP, MF, and CC of GO, as well as the KEGG pathway. The top 20 entries were selected based on thep-value. The results implied that the main BP involved in the treatment ofRhizoma Chuanxiongfor DKD included response to UV-A, xenobiotic stimulus, cellular response to cadmium ion, signal transduction, and so on (Figure 4(a)). Regarding MF, the results indicated that the targets were predominantly enriched in enzyme binding, protein phosphatase binding, nuclear receptor activity, integrin binding, and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, and so on (Figure 4(b)). The enrichment results of CC involved were mainly integral component of cytoplasm, membrane raft, receptor complex, caveola, plasma membrane, and so on (Figure 4(c)). The KEGG pathway was primarily enriched in the Prolactin signaling pathway, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the TNF signaling pathway, the Relaxin signaling pathway, the VEGF signaling pathway, and the FoxO signaling pathway (Figure 5,Figures S1–S6, and Table S1).

A drug–component–target–signaling pathway network for the treatment of DKD withRhizoma Chuanxiongwas constructed (Figure 6). The integrative network revealed four principal bioactive active components with distinct pharmacological profiles. Mandenol acted on five targets (EGFR, PTGS2, CCND1, and KDR), regulating six key pathways, including the Prolactin signaling pathway, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, the Relaxin signaling pathway, the VEGF signaling pathway, and the FoxO signaling pathway. Myricanone acted on two targets (EGFR and STAT3), regulating four key pathways, including the Prolactin signaling pathway, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, the Relaxin signaling pathway, and the FoxO signaling pathway. Wallichlide acted on eight targets (AKT1, STAT3, CASP3, SRC, CCND1, MAPK14, MAPK8, and SLC2A2), influencing six key pathways, including the Prolactin signaling pathway, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, the Relaxin signaling pathway, the VEGF signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. And senkyunone interacted with five targets (ICAM1, SRC, MMP9, KDR, and MAPK8), affecting the same six key pathways.

Molecular docking was performed for the top five core targets (AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, and PTGS2) overlapping with the targets in the drug-component-target-signaling pathway network and their corresponding active ingredients ofRhizoma Chuanxiong(Myricanone, Mandenol, wallichilide, and senkyunone) (Table 4). Mandenol exhibited stable binding efficacy to EGFR. The binding affinity between Myricanone, senkyunone, and five protein targets (AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, and PTGS2) were less than −5.0 kcal/mol, which indicating the stable binding patterns between the active compounds and protein targets. Additionally, wallichilide demonstrated stable binding affinity to AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, and PTGS2. Among them, the lowest binding affinity of 2RGP protein was −7.85 kcal/mol between EGFR and Myricanone. The molecular docking results visualized using PyMOL indicate that Myricanone binds more strongly to GLY796, MET793, ASP855, and LYS745 in 2RGP, with a total of six hydrogen bonds with lengths of 2.7, 2.2, 1.9, 3.5, 2.9, and 1.8 angstroms (Figure 7).

DKD is a chronic microvascular complication caused by diabetes, which occurs in about 20–40% of diabetic patients, and causes a significant economic and social burden [29]. Although current therapeutic strategies, including intensive control of glucose, lipid, urinary protein, and aggressive blood pressure, can delay the progression speed of DKD to end-stage renal disease, there is still no effective therapy to completely halt its progression to end-stage renal disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic alternatives. Clinical and experimental studies have shown thatRhizoma Chuanxiongexhibits promising nephroprotective effects in DKD patients, with a favorable safety profile [11–13]. However, the related mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we used a network pharmacological approach to uncover the major constituents, potential therapeutic targets, and significant pathways ofRhizoma Chuanxiongin the treatment of DKD.

We discovered that the primary active components ofRhizoma Chuanxiong, including Mandenol, Myricanone, senkyunone, and wallichilide, may play significant roles in the treatment of DKD. Although we selected active components ofRhizoma Chuanxiongbased on the parameters ADME, which cannot fully predict the metabolic fate of the componentsin vivo. After metabolism in thevivo, active components may undergo structural modifications or lose critical functional groups, which can impair their ability to bind with targets. In addition, the metabolism of active componentsin vivomay reduce the amount of effective components entering systemic circulation, resulting in insufficient concentrations at target tissues and ultimately leading to reduced drug bioavailability. Therefore, we further reviewed the relevant literature and found that Mandenol, Myricanone, senkyunone still retain the therapeutic efficacy even after undergoing metabolismin vivo[30–35]. No relevant literature reported the therapeutic efficacy of wallichilidein vivoexperiment. It is noteworthy that Mandenol has a DL value of 0.19, which is close to the lower threshold, and its low polarity (Hdon = 0, Hacc = 2) may influence its bioavailability and target binding capacity. However, the small molecular size and lipophilic nature of Mandenol could facilitate its absorption through passive diffusion, compensating for its low DL value and polarity. In addition, several fundamental research have demonstrated the therapeutic effect of Mandenol for disease (such as erectile dysfunction, atherosclerosis, xanthomatous biliary cirrhosis)in vivo[30–32].

The active components ofRhizoma Chuanxiongare associated with multiple proteins and signaling pathways, indicating their potential for further investigation. Based on the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, drug–component–target–signaling pathway network revealed that numerous targets in DKD are regulated by various compounds. These targets include, but are not limited to AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, CASP3, ICAM1, PTGS2, SRC, and MMP9. AKT1, also known as protein kinase B, participates in multiple signaling pathways related to DKD. These complex signaling pathways underscore the diverse regulatory roles of AKT1 in kidney cell processes affected by DKD and contribute to renal protection [36]. EGFR, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB family, is widely expressed in the mammalian kidney, including the podocyte, and plays a critical role in regulating and maintaining the filtration function of glomeruli [37]. Podocyte-specific deletion of EGFR significantly ameliorates the progression of glomerular injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in DKD, and this protection was associated with reducing reactive oxygen species, increased podocyte integrity, and the maintenance of autophagy through the inhibition of rubicon expression [37,38]. STAT3, a member of the STAT family, plays a crucial role in the early inflammatory response in DKD, and contributes to proteinuria, glomerular cell proliferation, renal fibrosis of in diabetic mice [39,40]. Inhibition of STAT3 attenuates progression of DKD. CASP3, a protease involved in apoptosis, triggers cell apoptosis upon activation [41]. Reduced CASP3 activity in db/db mice has been shown to inhibit the progression of DKD [42]. ICAM1, an acute-phase protein marker of inflammation, is overexpressed in the glomeruli and tubular epithelial cells of diabetic animal models, and it participates in the development of DKD [43]. PTGS2 is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to the inflammatory mediator prostaglandins and key markers of ferroptosis [44]. PTGS2 influences renin release and regulation of the RAAS, as well as renal blood flow and hemodynamics [45]. The activation of RASS system and ferroptosis are significant contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of DKD [46,47]. In this study, we discovered that EGFR and PTGS2 exhibit stronger binding affinities with Mandenol, Myricanone, senkyunone, and wallichilide than with other targets, suggesting that EGFR and PTGS2 may play crucial roles in the therapeutic effects of Rhizoma Chuanxiong on DKD.

According to KEGG enrichment analysis, the pharmacological effects ofRhizoma Chuanxiongon DKD are closely associated with six signaling pathways: Prolactin signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Relaxin signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that urine albumin excretion was significantly and positively correlated with serum prolactin levels and with mRNA expressions of the prolactin receptor, suggesting a potential role of prolactin in the development of renal injury in DKD [48,49]. The AGE-RAGE signaling pathway is associated with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, ultimately leading to kidney damage in animal models of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Potential treatment options for DKD through the inhibition of AGE-RAGE have been reviewed [50,51]. The TNF pathway is closely associated with systemic inflammation and may mediate the progression of DKD pathogenesis [52]. Elevated TNF levels are associated with increased epithelial damage and deathin vitroandvivo, and TNF has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target for DKD [53]. Studies have indicated that TNF-α is highly expressed in DKD, and elevated levels of TNF-α promote renal lipid accumulation and tubular injury [54]. Relaxin, a kind of peptide hormone, mediates its actions through relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). Relaxin treatment can increase the production of bile acids in the kidney cortex of streptozocin-induced diabetic mice, and ameliorate the increase of markers of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and renal fibrosis [55]. VEGF is a critical regulator in endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis, and upregulation of VEGF in glomerular is related to the pathogenesis of DKD [56]. Inhibition of VEGF signal pathway attenuate DKD by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis [56,57]. The FoxO pathway primarily plays a role in the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in DKD [58–61]. Research has shown that FOXO1 activity is significantly diminished in diabetic kidneys, and the upregulation of FoxO1 markedly alleviates renal functional impairment, delays renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and reduces apoptosis in diabetic mice [62–64]. In our study, we found that Prolactin signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, Relaxin signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway are all related to the core targets (AKT1, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, and PTGS2).

Previous studies primarily focused on the general nephroprotective effects ofRhizoma Chuanxiongour research provides a more comprehensive and mechanistic perspective by identifying specific active compounds (Mandenol, Myricanone, senkyunone, wallichilide) and their multi-target interactions with key proteins and signaling pathways implicated in DKD pathogenesis. The targets and pathways related to therapeutic efficacy ofRhizoma Chuanxiongfor DKD in our study are known to play pivotal roles in key pathological processes of DKD, such as chronic inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, which reminds usRhizoma Chuanxiongmay treat DKD by improving these key pathological processes of DKD. The ethanol extract ofRhizoma Chuanxiong Hort.has been demonstrated to attenuate both structural and functional renal damage in a streptozotocin-induced DKD modelin vivothrough inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. These findings are consistent with our findings [12]. The clinical implication of our findings is particularly noteworthy. The identification of specific active compounds ofRhizoma Chuanxiongand their associated targets provides a solid foundation for future drug development and precision medicine approaches in DKD treatment. However, our study has a notable limitation that should be acknowledged. We relied exclusively on network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches to elucidate the potential mechanisms ofRhizoma Chuanxiongfor the treatment of DKD, without experimental validation. Therefore, our findings provide only preliminary mechanistic insights rather than definitive conclusions, and they must be confirmed by real experimental data.

In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the potential mechanisms ofRhizoma Chuanxiongin treating DKD, based on network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis. The results suggest that the therapeutic efficacy ofRhizoma Chuanxiongfor DKD may be associated with multiple pathways, such as Prolactin signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Relaxin signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway through targets, such as AKT1, EGFR, STAT3, CASP3, ICAM1, PTGS2, SRC, and MMP9. This study establishes a theoretical foundation for further research on the mechanisms ofRhizoma Chuanxiongfor the treatment of DKD, and additional experimental validation is necessary.
