Anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare but serious autoimmune disorder that is typically characterized by a broad spectrum of psychiatric and neurological symptoms. In the academic literature, memory deficits often occur alongside psychiatric symptoms, seizures, motor dysfunctions, and other cognitive issues; it is rare to find it dominated by memory impairment with only one previous seizure. We present a unique presentation of anti‐NMDAR encephalitis in a 70‐year‐old Middle Eastern male patient who primarily exhibited memory impairment along with one unrepeated recent seizure. The patient's initial clinical picture did not align with the classic presentation of anti‐NMDAR encephalitis, which often includes prominent psychiatric symptoms and neurological features of motor dysfunction. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and the presence of anti‐NMDAR antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid support the diagnosis. Physicians should be aware to consider anti‐NMDAR encephalitis in patients with memory impairment and a single previous seizure, even in the absence of typical psychiatric or neurological features.

Anti‐NMDAR encephalitis typically presents with psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and movement disorders.

We present a case of a 70‐year‐old man with dominant memory impairment and a history of seizures, without neurological or psychiatric features.

Clinicians should consider anti‐NMDAR encephalitis in patients with cognitive decline and a history of a single seizure.

Anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis represents a distinct form of autoimmune encephalitis, typified by the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) class autoantibodies that specifically target the NR1 subunit of the NMDA‐type glutamate receptor [1]. The understanding of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) has improved recently. In the last 18 years, many new antibodies have been discovered. One important type is encephalitis, caused by antibodies against the Anti‐NMDAR. This type is common in teenagers and young adults, accounting for approximately 86% of AE cases in people under 18 years old [2]. This condition is more common in females, with a gender distribution ratio of approximately 8:2 [1].

Anti‐NMDAR encephalitis mainly causes psychiatric manifestations, behavioral changes, seizures, and cognitive problems. Some patients might also have autonomic instability and central hypoventilation [1,3,4].

In the academic literature, it is rare to find reports of a syndrome where only one symptom appears in individuals with psychiatric disturbances [5] or seizures [6]. However, we present a unique case of a patient with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis who exhibited only memory impairment and one unrepeated seizure a month ago.

A 70‐year‐old Middle Eastern male with a history of type 2diabetes mellitus, who was managed with oral hypoglycemic agents, presented to Damascus Hospital with progressive recurrent memory complaints. One month before this presentation, the patient experienced one unwitnessed seizure with loss of sphincter control, followed by short‐term progressive recurrent memory impairment, which persisted until the day of admission; however, the seizures did not repeat.

He reported no fever, headache, or other accompanying symptoms. The initial assessment revealed the patient to be alert and oriented, exhibiting normal speech, cranial nerve function, motor skills, reflexes, and plantar responses. There was an absence ofmeningismus.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis following lumbar puncture revealed a marked leukocytosis of 15 000 cells/μL, strongly suggestive of an underlying encephalitis (Table1).

The Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 21 out of 30, indicating mild cognitive impairment, particularly with recall of time and location. Given the clinical suspicion of viral encephalitis, the patient was administered acyclovir at a dosage of 750 mg three times daily for 15 days and concomitant antiepileptic therapy (Levetiracetam). Subsequent CSF analysis for herpes simplex virus using polymerase chain reaction yielded a negative result; the patient's memory impairment persisted.

Further investigations were conducted. Imaging studies, including head CT (computed tomography) scans, yielded normal results. Brain MRI revealed generalized, heterogeneous hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe on T2 and FLAIR (Fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery) sequences, with hypointensity on T1. A similar signal pattern was observed in the left hippocampal gyrus, which is most likely indicative of the sequelae of a recent inflammatory event (Figure1).

Diffusion‐weighted imaging was not performed because the patient was uncooperative during the MRI procedure. EEG findings included a significant amount of paroxysmal spike‐and‐wave activity bilaterally, and there was evidence of an L temporo‐parietal epileptogenic focus; however, no additional abnormalities were noted during hyperventilation or photic stimulation.

CSF analysis by ELISA revealed elevated protein concentrations and was positive for anti‐NMDAR antibodies (Table2). Screening for abnormal cells in the CSF yielded negative results (Figure2). A multislice axial tomography scan has ruled out the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes.

Based on the clinical presentation, in conjunction with laboratory test results and other relevant assessments, a diagnosis of anti‐NMDAR encephalitis is considered. The patient was prescribed the anticonvulsant medication (Levetiracetam). Additionally, he received intravenous methylprednisolone for 7 days, administered at a dosage of 1 g per day, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 2 g/kg for 5 days. Furthermore, the patient received a course of rituximab immunotherapy.

Five‐month follow‐up MRI revealed a high signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences in the right temporal lobe with a similar, smaller subcortical focus in the left temporal lobe (Figure3). The patient continued taking levetiracetam. Additionally, the patient continued to exhibit memory impairment, as evidenced by a MMSE score of 19 out of 30.

Anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis is a neurological condition, where the immune system attacks the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR. This leads to a complex condition of psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Although it is rare, affecting about 1.5 people per million each year, it has significantly impacted both neurology and psychiatry [1].

This disease predominantly manifests in individuals between the ages of 12 and 29 years [5], with a significant prevalence of up to 86% observed in patients younger than 18 years [2]. This condition is more common in females [1,5]; however, our patient is a 70‐year‐old male.

The progression of the illness can be delineated into phases: the initial prodromal phase, followed by a psychotic phase, a neurological phase (including seizures), a catatonia phase, and altered consciousness, and finally, a slow recovery phase [5].

In individuals diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis associated with NMDAR‐IgG, it is common to observe memory impairments as the condition progresses. However, to the best of our knowledge, memory deficits often occur alongside psychiatric symptoms [3,4], seizures, motor dysfunctions, and other cognitive issues [3]. By contrast, having only memory impairment with a previous seizure, as in our case, makes it particularly rare and remarkable.

In 2022, Iorio et al. reported a rare case of a 29‐year‐old woman with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis presenting with isolated memory dysfunction [7]. However, in our case, there is a history of one unrepeated seizure. While this previous event is relevant, it is not enough to make the diagnosis clear, particularly given the patient's history ofType 2 diabetesand Immunological Imbalances Associated with Epileptic Seizures in Type 2Diabetes Mellitus[8].

It is important to note that it is unclear whether additional neurological symptoms would have developed without immunotherapy.

In patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis, MRI scans show inflammation in 11% to 83% of cases [9]. EEG tests reveal abnormalities in 85% to 96% of patients [2]. The most definitive diagnosis is made by detecting anti‐NMDAR antibodies in the CSF or blood after ruling out other causes [1,5].

In the case under discussion, the diagnosis was established through findings from MRI, EEG, and the presence of anti‐NMDAR antibodies in the CSF. However, before the performance of neural antibody assays, a diagnosis of anti‐NMDAR encephalitis could not have been established based on the current criteria (Table3).

Diagnostic criteria for anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis [10].

The established therapeutic regimen comprises corticosteroid treatment, intravenous administration of immunoglobulins (IVIG), and plasmapheresis. After completing pulsed IV corticosteroid therapy, oral prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day is typically started, followed by a gradual taper over weeks to months. The need for an oral taper and its optimal duration, however, are uncertain. In a large multi‐center pediatric cohort of anti‐NMDAR encephalitis, Guang et al. found no difference in complete recovery rate (mRS = 0) between patients who received short‐term (≤ 3 months) and long‐term (> 3 months) regimens; the absence of an oral prednisolone course was not associated with relapse, suggesting prolonged steroid use may not confer additional benefits [11]. In our case, we did not provide the patient with any subsequent oral tapering.

In instances where these interventions fail to yield progress, second‐line treatments such as azathioprine, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate mofetil are employed [1,4].

Moreover, the management of symptoms is conducted, encompassing the utilization of antiepileptic medications [6].

It is noteworthy that persistent impairments in executive functions and memory are observed with greater frequency; this is attributed by researchers to the consequences of the inflammatory process, frequently affecting hippocampal structures and subcortical nuclei [5].

This may explain the persistence of memory impairment in our case study.

Typically, anti‐NMDAR encephalitis is characterized by a collection of symptoms that may include psychiatric disturbances, behavioral changes, seizures, and cognitive problems. While memory loss is known to be a potential symptom associated with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis, it is relatively uncommon for patients to present solely with memory impairment on a history of a single previous seizure. Physicians should consider anti‐NMDAR encephalitis in patients who exhibit memory impairment and a single prior seizure, even if typical psychiatric or neurological symptoms are absent.
