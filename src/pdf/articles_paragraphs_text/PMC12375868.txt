22q11.2 deletion syndrome is associated with schizophrenia, seizures, and often experience intolerance to antipsychotics. Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a neuronal migration disorder that can also be observed in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. However, to our knowledge, the use of clozapine in adolescent patients with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia and comorbid 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and PNH has not been previously reported.

A 17‐year‐old female with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia was referred to our hospital. She presented with auditory hallucinations, disorganized behavior, and insomnia. Multiple antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and modified electroconvulsive therapy were either ineffective or poorly tolerated due to extrapyramidal symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed under sedation revealed PNH. Genetic testing confirmed a diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Clozapine was initiated with close monitoring, and her symptoms gradually improved following a slow titration. She was discharged after approximately 6 months and has remained clinically stable for 15 months.

Brain MRI and genetic testing—even when performed under sedation—may be valuable diagnostic tools in adolescents with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. Furthermore, the presence of structural brain abnormalities does not preclude the efficacy of clozapine, which may remain a viable and effective treatment option in such cases.

Here, we present the case of a patient who was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia. After being referred to our hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed PNH, leading to the subsequent diagnosis of comorbid 22q11.2 DS. Following the initiation of clozapine, her psychiatric symptoms—previously unresponsive to various psychotropic medications—significantly improved. Although prior treatments failed to achieve symptom relief, clozapine resulted in marked clinical improvement.

The patient was a 17‐year‐old Japanese female. At the age of 2, developmental delays were noted during a routine infant health checkup. Subsequent intelligence testing led to a diagnosis of borderline intellectual functioning.

Upon entering elementary school, she experienced difficulties in social communication with peers and displayed signs of inattention. At the age of 14, she began expressing persecutory thoughts. She subsequently visited a psychiatric clinic. However, her symptoms had worsened; she reported being stared at and hearing others spread malicious rumors about her. Her hallucinations and delusional thinking gradually intensified.

Following auditory hallucinations instructing her to harm herself, she attempted suicide by stabbing herself in the abdomen with a kitchen knife. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was prescribed olanzapine 2.5 mg and risperidone 1 mg, taken separately. However, these medications had minimal effects. She was then admitted to a psychiatric hospital, but her condition showed no significant improvement. Over time, her symptoms progressively worsened, and she eventually lost the ability to communicate, even in simple interactions.

At the age of 15, the patient was referred to our hospital and admitted for medical care. Due to persistent violent behavior, involuntary behavioral restrictions and isolation measures were required. A brain MRI scan was performed under sedation with flunitrazepam and revealed PNH (Figure1). The results of genetic testing confirmed a deletion in the 22q11.2 region, consistent with 22q11.2 DS.

(a–c) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Brain MRI revealed bilateral, multiple periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) located at the dorsal pole of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricles. (a) Axial T1‐weighted image, (b) coronal view, and (c) sagittal view. The sagittal image (c) shows multiple PNHs along the lateral ventricular walls. The area circled in red indicates the locations of the PNHs.

Despite trials with multiple antipsychotics, treatment was limited due to intolerable extrapyramidal symptoms. Other interventions, including mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and modified electroconvulsive therapy (mECT), were ineffective.

The patient was hospitalized multiple times, but her condition remained largely unchanged. She avoided eye contact, isolated herself in her room, repetitively sucked her fingers, and was unable to engage in even simple conversations. At times, she exhibited violent behavior toward family members, triggered by hallucinations and delusional thoughts.

In July 2023, the patient was involuntarily admitted to our hospital for medical care and protection. On Day 52 of hospitalization, clozapine was initiated for the treatment of TRS. The dose was titrated gradually and with close monitoring.

After 4 weeks of treatment, the dose was increased to 75 mg, and her impulsive and explosive behaviors began to subside. At 8 weeks, the dose was raised to 100 mg, during which time her ability to communicate improved, and she became able to engage in simple conversations. After 16 weeks, with the dose increased to 250 mg, she expressed a desire to return to school and demonstrated improved emotional expression. At 24 weeks, the dose was increased to 350 mg, and she was subsequently discharged. The blood concentration of clozapine was 503 ng/mL.

After clozapine was introduced, antiepileptic drugs were not administered. Routine electroencephalography (EEG) was performed during treatment, with no significant abnormalities detected. Her clinical progress was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),7with total scores of 160, 144, 121, 97, and 89 at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24, respectively. Her Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)8score improved markedly, from 10 at admission to 55 at discharge, which occurred on Day 252 of hospitalization.

Following discharge, the patient was able to lead a stable daily life and resumed regular attendance at her special‐needs school. She began going out by car more frequently, eating her favorite foods at shopping malls, and communicating in simple language with visiting nurses and staff. As of 15 months post‐discharge, she has maintained remission while receiving outpatient care.

In this case, various psychotropic medications and mECT produced minimal therapeutic benefit. In contrast, clozapine demonstrated marked efficacy. Notably, despite the presence of PNH, which is associated with a high risk of epileptic seizures, no seizures were observed during treatment.

To our knowledge, this is the first published report documenting the marked effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of TRS in a patient with comorbid 22q11.2 DS and PNH, without any significant adverse events.

When treating the psychiatric symptoms of 22q11.2 DS, physicians must remain vigilant about the associated risk of epilepsy.1It is therefore advisable to select medications with a lower potential to induce seizures. However, Colijn reported that epilepsy is the most frequently observed serious adverse effect of clozapine in patients with 22q11.2 DS.9In our case, the presence of PNH, a known risk factor for epilepsy, further increased the likelihood of seizure occurrence. As a result, we introduced clozapine with extreme caution, employing a slow titration strategy. No epileptic activity was observed either on EEG or through clinical monitoring during the post‐initiation period.

Although clozapine carries a known risk of inducing seizures, it can be highly effective in managing TRS associated with 22q11.2 DS when administered under careful observation.

Recent studies have identified a population of migratory neurons in the infant human brain, referred to as Arc cells. These cells originate in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and migrate around the dorsal pole of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles (DPAHLV) toward the prefrontal cortex.10This migration is organized into four anatomical tiers: Tiers 1 and 2 are located near the ventricular zone, whereas Tiers 3 and 4 extend toward the cortical surface11(Figure2). In patients with 22q11.2 DS, anatomical studies suggest that PNH may represent Arc cells that failed to migrate beyond Tiers 1 or 2. Accordingly, PNH may be regarded as one of the more severe forms of heterotopia.

Despite the presence of PNH, clozapine was effective in alleviating the patient's psychotic symptoms, suggesting its utility even in cases with severe structural abnormalities.

We report a case of TRS comorbid with 22q11.2 DS and PNH, in which clozapine treatment was successful and no epileptic seizures were observed.

In cases of TRS, if there is no evident history of congenital anomalies such as characteristic facial features or congenital heart defects, it is advisable to conduct an organic evaluation, including brain MRI—even under sedation—and genetic testing. Importantly, the presence of structural brain abnormalities does not preclude the efficacy of clozapine, which may remain a viable and effective treatment option in such cases.
