Following publication of the original article [1], the authors noticed that the 95% confidence interval of ORx was slightly wrong in Table 3, which was revised in the published article. However, the authors realized that they did not update this reference in the main text of theResults>ORx in relation to outcomesection.

In a multivariable logistic outcome regression (Table 3), mean ORx (OR [95% CI] = 11.3 [25.87–12,271.11],p= 0.01) was independently associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, GCS, and PRx. However, ORx was not independently associated with favourable outcome.

In a multivariable logistic outcome regression (Table 3), mean ORx (OR [95% CI] = 11.3 [1.82–73.67],p= 0.01) was independently associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, GCS, and PRx. However, ORx was not independently associated with favourable outcome.

The last paragraph in the Results > ORx in relation to outcome section has been updated in this correction article and the original article [1] has been corrected.
