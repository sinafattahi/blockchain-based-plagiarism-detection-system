Fractal dimension (FD) analysis is a method used to numerically characterize the complexity of structures or tissues. After sinus lift procedures, the graft material gradually transforms into natural bone over time. This study aimed to evaluate the interpretability of this transformation by assessing changes in FD values.

In this retrospective study, data from a total of 36 patients (42 hemimaxillae), including 13 females (17 hemimaxillae) and 23 males (25 hemimaxillae), were analyzed. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images obtained preoperatively and at six months postoperatively from patients who underwent sinus lift surgery with graft placement in the maxillary molar region were included in the evaluation. The pre- and postoperative images were superimposed using anatomical reference points. Examination areas were determined on cross-sectional slices from the grafted and adjacent non-grafted bone areas (used as control) within the maxillary molar region. FD analysis was performed on these areas. FD values from the grafted and control bone regions at baseline and six months were recorded. Paired and independent sample t-tests were used for statistical analysis, with statistical significance set atp< 0.05.

FD values derived from CBCT images showed a statistically significant difference between the initial state of the graft immediately after placement (G0) and its state six months postoperatively (G1) (p< 0.05). The mean FD values were 1.297 for G0 and 1.279 for G1. However, no significant difference was observed between the initial state (B0) and the six-month follow-up state (B1) of the trabecular bone in the posterior region used as a control (p> 0.05). The FD values in the G0 group showed minimal variation across gender and age groups, consistently ranging between 1.295 and 1.299. No significant differences in FD values were identified based on gender or age groups (p> 0.05).

The findings of this study suggest that FD analysis may serve as a useful adjunctive tool for evaluating graft osteogenesis.

Dental implant procedures have become increasingly prevalent in clinical practice, accompanied by rising expectations regarding their long-term success. The prognosis of implant therapy is influenced by multiple interrelated factors, which can be broadly categorized into patient-related variables, surgical technique, and implant-specific characteristics. Key determinants include the availability of sufficient bone volume, favorable bone quality, appropriate implant dimensions and design, accurate patient selection [1], and the suitability of the surgical approach [2].

As a widely accepted principle, direct implant placement is feasible when the alveolar bone possesses sufficient quality and quantity to provide stable initial support for the implant. However, in cases where sufficient bone volume is lacking in the posterior maxilla, advanced surgical procedures become necessary. To meet this requirement, the sinus lift procedure was first introduced in 1980 by researchers Boyne and James and has since evolved into a widely practiced routine method to increase bone volume for implants placed in the posterior maxilla. The sinus lift is a surgical technique that involves elevating the maxillary sinus membrane to create space for the placement of bone graft material, which is then inserted into the gap between the lifted sinus membrane and the newly created bony window [3–5].

Radiographs can be utilized to evaluate bone quality. Two-dimensional radiographs are commonly employed to determine bone trabeculation; however, these radiographs are prone to bias and inconsistencies among clinicians [6]. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged that such radiographs produce superimpositions of buccal and lingual bone, grayscale variations, and inconsistent pixel values, which fail to adequately represent the microarchitecture of the region under examination [7,8].

In contrast, three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging offers several notable advantages. CBCT enables high-resolution scanning with minimal distortion, provides accurate linear measurements, and demonstrates a strong correlation with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) in terms of histomorphometric accuracy [9,10]. Moreover, three-dimensional imaging is strongly recommended for the detailed assessment of critical anatomical structures—such as the maxillary sinuses and nasal cavities—as well as for evaluating the bone composition of the maxilla [11].

Research in dental implant applications has indicated that assessing the bone’s microarchitecture plays a crucial role in predicting the bone’s resistance to biomechanical forces during chewing, its response to healing processes, and the integration of the bone with the implant [12,13]. Therefore, evaluating the microarchitecture of the trabecular structure in radiographs is also expected to provide insights into the status of graft osteogenesis.

Histomorphometry is regarded as the gold standard for assessing bone microstructure. However, this method has several drawbacks, including being in vitro, time-consuming, and costly [14]. Micro-computed tomography (µCT) has emerged as a promising tool for the evaluation of bone microarchitecture. However, its clinical applicability remains limited, as µCT has not yet been sufficiently validated in clinical studies and is primarily utilized in preclinical research involving small animals (in vivo) or excised biopsy specimens (ex vivo) [15].

Fractal dimension (FD) analysis is a non-invasive and quantitative method for evaluating the complexity of bone microarchitecture. It mathematically describes the structural irregularity and spatial complexity of biological tissues by assigning a numerical value—the fractal dimension—calculated through specialized algorithms [16]. FD analysis utilizes an algorithm that counts the bone marrow and the trabecular bone interfaces to measure the trabecular bone pattern [17]. This analysis is used in various fields of dentistry, including treatment and healing assesment, dental materials, dental tissues, caries, osteoporosis, periodontitis, cancer, and Sjögren’s syndrome [18].

There are several studies in the literature suggesting that changes in bone structure are associated with FD [13,17,18]. Due to the advantages of FD analysis, such as its non-invasive nature, the ability to perform it without obtaining a bone biopsy from the patient, and its practical applicability, it is considered to have significant potential for evaluating bone quality before implant placement. The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the relationship between the osteogenesis of the graft placed after sinus lift surgery and the FD analysis performed on CBCT images.

This study was reviewed and approved by the Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee of İzmir Katip Çelebi University (Decision No: 52, dated 24.03.2016). The study material comprised CBCT scans obtained for the clinical evaluation of patients who had undergone sinus lift surgery at the Department of Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, İzmir Katip Çelebi University.

All CBCT images were acquired using a NewTom 5G flat-panel CBCT device (Verona, Italy) with a 15 × 12 cm field of view (FOV), 110 kVp, and automatic milliampere (mA) settings adjusted by the device in standard mode. The scans were reconstructed with a voxel size of 200 μm. For data analysis, both NNT software (QR-NNT version 9.1.0, Quantitative Radiology, Verona, Italy) and ImageJ software (version 1.51) were utilized.

The sinus lift procedure is performed to enhance bone volume in the posterior maxilla for patients undergoing implant placement. During this procedure, CBCT scans are taken at three different times: preoperative anatomical assessment, postoperative perforation, and graft formation at six months postoperatively [19–22]. At our institution, all CBCT scans are acquired based on clinical necessity and with informed patient consent. For this retrospective study, suitable CBCT datasets were selected from an existing clinical archive under these ethical and procedural standards. Two CBCT scans—one obtained immediately after surgery and the other at the six-month postoperative follow-up—were used for the FD analysis.

This study was conducted using data obtained from 36 patients, examining a total of 42 hemimaxillae. Of these, 13 patients were female (17 hemimaxillae) and 23 were male (25 hemimaxillae). Patients were divided into two age groups: those aged 45 years and younger (14 hemimaxillae) and those older than 45 years (28 hemimaxillae). The findings from the study were classified into four main groups: G0, G1, B0, and B1.

A post hoc Gpower analysis was carried out to determine whether the study had adequate power. According to the relationship between greft and bone; the effect size was calculated to be 0.85. And the post hoc power of the study (1 - β) was 0.82 (α = 0.05).

Maxillary sinus floor augmentation through the lateral approach, commonly referred to as the lateral window technique, has been thoroughly covered in existing research. This technique involves several steps, including the design and elevation of the window, lifting of the sinus membrane, placement of the sinus graft material, application of a collagen barrier, and closure of the flap [23]. In a staged approach, the waiting period for graft osseointegration typically ranges from 3 to 12 months [24]. In our study, patients with grafts left without implants for 6 months were included.

FD analysis can be affected by several factors, including the chosen region of interest (ROI) [25], the shape and size of the ROI [26], data compression format [27], angulation [28], and noise [29]. To ensure standardization, the following steps were carefully followed.

Anatomical landmarks were used to align the first and second CBCT images precisely. During image adjustment, the angulation between the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes was maintained at a constant 90 degrees.

In the axial plane, the sagittal reference line was oriented to pass through the anterior and posterior nasal spines (Fig.1a).

In the sagittal plane, the axial reference line was aligned with the most prominent points of the anterior and posterior nasal spines (Fig.1b).

To identify the starting point in the coronal plane, axial slices were scrolled until the pterygoid hamulus of the sphenoid bone first appeared.

In the coronal plane, the axial reference line was then adjusted to pass through the lowest points of the pterygoid hamuli (Fig.1g).

Finally, in the axial plane, the sagittal slice passing through both nasal spines was used to locate the most prominent posterior wall of the incisive canal, which was defined as the central reference point of the study (Fig.1e).

In the axial slices, the axial section where the maxillary sinus cavity is visible in the maxillary molar region is opened. In this section, a line is drawn extending from the posterior border of the maxilla along the maxillary molar region, and the angle of the line is measured. Cross-sections are adjusted to a 1 mm interval, and slices are taken along the line. Among these cross-sections, one that meets the criteria for the ROI is selected. The axial slice number, line angle, and the selected cross-section are recorded using the device’s screenshot feature.

When obtaining cross-sections from the second image of the same patient, the axial slice with the same number as the first image is opened. In this section, a line with the same angle is drawn from the posterior border of the maxilla, and the same cross-section is selected among the slices taken along the line (Fig.2).

The ROI was selected to cover the maximum possible area, and it was determined that ROIs with dimensions of 4 mm² (54 × 54 pixels) could be utilized. When selecting the ROI for bone, the most appropriate trabecular bone area closest to the graft site in the maxillary molar region was preferred. Considering the potential reduction in the size of the bone graft due to resorption, the ROI was determined during the second imaging session. For the bone graft, the ROI was chosen from the region closest to the alveolar crest at the center of the graft material.

In our study, image processing and analyses were performed using the ImageJ (1.51) software, which is freely available through the National Institute of Health. The box-counting method was employed to perform FD analysis on the images. The box-counting method is one of the most widely used and practical techniques for estimating the FD in digital biological images. As demonstrated by Osman et al. [30], this method reliably quantifies the structural complexity of trabecular bone, showing low sensitivity to image resolution and good discriminatory power across different samples. Furthermore, compared to other fractal estimation techniques, the box-counting approach offers advantages in terms of automation and reproducibility, making it particularly suitable for medical image analysis.

The ROI image in BMP format was opened and copied into the ImageJ program.

Variations at fine and medium scales were removed from the image, ensuring that only high-scale variations remained; this was achieved by blurring the image.

The blurred image was removed from the original image.

The image was converted to binary by adding 128 to each pixel location and using a brightness value of 128 as the threshold.

To reduce noise, erosion, and dilation processes were applied to the image.

The image underwent inversion to enhance the visibility of the trabeculae.

The binary image was skeletonized, leaving only the central portions of the trabeculae.

Finally, FD analysis was applied to the skeletonized image (Fig.4).

Statistical analyses were conducted using R software version 3.6.0. The minimum (min.), mean, median (median), maximum (max.), standard deviation (sd), and standard error (SE) values were determined for the G0, G1, B0, and B1 groups. The distribution of variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. When the normality assumption was satisfied, the Paired Samples t-test and Independent Samples t-test were applied.

A total of 42 hemimaxillae were evaluated in this study. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 70 years, with a mean of 50.24 ± 11.25 years. The sample included 25 males (59.5%) and 17 females (40.5%). For group analysis, hemimaxillae were categorized based on the age of the corresponding individuals: Age 1 (≤ 45 years;n= 14, 33.3%) and Age 2 (> 45 years;n= 28, 66.7%).

The minimum FD value obtained from all data was 1.175, while the maximum FD value was found to be 1.426. For the same ROI, the FD value for the G0 group was 1.297, while the FD value for the G1 group decreased to 1.279. In contrast, for the same ROI, the FD value for the B0 group was 1.293, whereas it increased to 1.305 in the B1 group (Table1).

The average FD values for the G0, G1, B0, and B1 groups were determined based on the subgroups of gender, age group 1, and age group 2. The FD values for the G0 group were found to be nearly identical across all subgroups, ranging from 1.295 to 1.299. In contrast, the FD values for the G1 group across the subgroups ranged from 1.268 to 1.285. The average FD values for all G1 subgroups were consistently lower than those for the G0 subgroups (Table2).

The Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to assess whether the K0, K1, G0, and G1 groups followed a normal distribution. The test results indicated that all four variables were normally distributed. Therefore, both the dependent (paired) t-test and the independent samples t-test were performed on the dataset (Table3).

The comparison between the B0 and B1 groups, and between the G0 and G1 groups, was performed using the dependent (paired) t-test. No significant difference was detected between the B0 and B1 groups (p> 0.05), whereas a significant difference was noted between the G0 and G1 groups (p< 0.05). A significant difference was found between the FD values obtained at the start of the graft application and those taken 6 months later, with a decrease in FD values observed (Table4).

When the group pairs were compared using the independent samples t-test, a significant difference was found only between the B1 and G1 groups (p< 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the other groups (Table5).

The changes in the values of the B0, B1, G0, and G1 groups based on gender (male or female) were evaluated using the independent samples t-test. No significant differences were found based on gender (p> 0.05) (Table6).

The changes in the values of the B0, B1, G0, and G1 groups based on age (under 45 years, age 1, and over 45 years, age 2) were evaluated using the independent samples t-test. No significant differences were found based on age groups (p> 0.05) (Table7).

A significant difference was found between G0 and G1 for all data (p < 0.05). The G1 values were significantly lower than G0.

A significant difference was also found between B1 and G1 for all data (p < 0.05). The mean of B1 was higher than that of G1.

No significant difference was found based on gender (p > 0.05).

No significant difference was found based on age groups (p > 0.05).

In this study, the relationship between CBCT images obtained immediately after and 6 months post-sinus lift surgery was evaluated using the FD analysis method to assess the osteogenesis of the graft. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the FD analysis of grafts using CBCT images taken at both the initial and 6-month follow-up stages, without the placement of implants following sinus lift surgery.

The availability of bone with appropriate quality, shape, and volume for direct implant placement poses significant challenges, particularly in the posterior maxillary region. The main reasons for these challenges include the poor structure of the bone in this region, the thin cortical layer, the downward expansion of the maxillary sinus, and the faster progression of bone resorption compared to other jaw areas following tooth loss [31,32]. Therefore, insufficient bone is often encountered in implant applications in the posterior maxilla, and to overcome this issue, the maxillary sinus augmentation technique is utilized. When the bone height between the maxillary sinus floor and the alveolar crest is less than 4–5 mm, sinus lift surgeries are performed using a lateral approach, while in cases where greater bone height is available, the crystal approach is employed. In both approaches, bone graft material is placed into the space created by elevating the sinus membrane [33].

In sinus lift surgeries performed with the lateral approach, implant placement can be carried out in two different ways. In the first method, the implant is placed immediately along with the graft (immediate approach). In the second method, the implant is placed after a certain period to allow for graft osteogenesis (staged approach). The choice between these methods should be determined based on the amount of residual bone and the ability to achieve primary stability for the implant [24]. In their studies, Tawil and Mawla [34] reported a success rate of 56% for the direct approach when 5 mm or less residual bone was present, while the success rate was 100% when the residual bone exceeded 5 mm. The consensus is that in cases where 4–5 mm or less residual bone is present, or in cases of low bone quality, the staged approach is preferred over the immediate approach [35].

The complication rate associated with maxillary sinus grafting is not high [35]. Losses in the volume of the sinus due to grafting do not negatively affect sinus functions [36]. The most common complication encountered in sinus lift surgeries is perforation of the sinus membrane. However, this condition is generally well tolerated and heals over time without the need for special intervention in the vast majority of cases [35]. Kim et al. [37] reported that the incidence of sinusitis after sinus lift surgery is 9.8%, with a higher rate observed in the lateral approach (12.1%) compared to the crestal approach (4.1%). Nevertheless, the majority of sinusitis cases can be effectively managed with antibiotic therapy. The incidence of chronic maxillary sinusitis requiring surgical intervention is 1.3% [38]. Complications such as sinusitis typically arise from sinuses that were not healthy before the surgery [36]. However, the potential causes of chronic maxillary sinusitis following implant procedures include uncontrolled graft infections [39], oroantral fistula formation [40], implant penetration into the sinus [39], foreign body reactions with displacement of the implant or graft [41], sinus membrane perforations [42] and postoperative narrowing of the ostium [43].

In dentistry, panoramic imaging techniques are used for the evaluation of paranasal sinuses due to their positive features, such as rapid acquisition, low radiation doses, and cost advantages. However, the two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional structures in these images, distortions and inconsistencies caused by patient mispositioning, potential magnifications, and the superimposition of real and imaginary structures, soft tissue and air shadows, and adjacent anatomical structures can lead to misleading or insufficient information [44,45]. Furthermore, these imaging techniques can result in false positive or false negative findings regarding the presence of the maxillary sinus septum, and they may not provide sufficient detail for the evaluation of the sinus floor in conditions such as chronic sinusitis or mucosal thickening. Additionally, due to their low sensitivity in showing the length of the subantral bone, evaluations based solely on this radiographic technique can lead to unnecessary exaggeration of the need for sinus lift surgery [44]. Therefore, the necessity of three-dimensional imaging in sinus lift surgeries is emphasized, and CBCT imaging is commonly used for this purpose in dentistry. It is recommended to evaluate the region before the sinus lift operation and perform a follow-up three-dimensional imaging before implant placement, as this allows for better planning of the sinus lift, evaluation of the procedure, selection of an appropriate implant, and determination of the optimal area for implant placement [46].

The term “fractal” comes from the Latin word “fractus,” meaning “broken.” It is a method used to characterize the complexity of self-similar shapes numerically. Fractal structures statistically maintain a similar pattern at every level of magnification or scaling. Regardless of how much a fractal image is magnified, the level of detail remains constant. Theoretically, fractals exhibit self-similarity over an infinite range of scales, while natural fractals display this property within a limited scale range [18]. When examining the microarchitecture of bone, trabecular structures and the voids between them stand out. Trabecular bone has a branching pattern that exhibits fractal characteristics, such as self-similarity and the absence of a specific scale level. Therefore, applications of fractal geometry and FD measurements can be used to evaluate trabecular complexity and bone structure [47]. Many previous studies have examined changes in the alveolar bone surrounding implants using FD analysis [48–50].

After implant procedures, studies evaluating the trabecular structure of the alveolar bone surrounding the implant have shown changes in FD values over time [48]. These changes can either show an increase [49] or a decrease [50] in FD values. In our study, a change in FD values was also observed. According to our findings, the change in FD values at the 6-month post-operation mark is in the direction of a decrease. However, unlike the studies mentioned above, the main evaluation in this study was focused not on the alveolar bone but on the graft, specifically assessing graft osteogenesis. Graft osteogenesis consists of three fundamental phases: the formation of the bone-graft complex (union), the replacement of the graft by new bone through resorption (replacement), and the shaping of the bone-graft complex in response to mechanical stimuli (morphogenesis) [51]. Therefore, there may be differences between the changes in graft osteogenesis over time and the changes in the alveolar bone surrounding the implant, and the reflections of these processes on FD may also vary.

Wen and Zang [52], in their study evaluating graft material osteogenesis, examined the CBCT images of patients who underwent immediate implant placement after a sinus lift surgery. They noted that there was no significant change in the FD values of the graft in the mesial, distal, and sagittal regions surrounding the implant in the first and sixth months. The different results obtained from these various regions suggest that the presence of an implant around the graft may influence the outcome. Titanium implants, due to their structure, can lead to beam-hardening and streak artifacts, which may prevent the detection of changes in the regions surrounding the implant [53]. However, when all groups were assessed together, they reported a significant decrease in FD values, similar to the findings of the current study [52].

There are several studies in the literature that perform FD analysis around implants [48–50,52]. However, a study by Molon et al. [54] is similar to the current study in that it evaluated the osteogenesis of the graft in the first and sixth month after sinus lift, without the use of implants. This study was performed using panoramic images, and no significant difference in FD values was found between the first and sixth-month graft images. The key difference between the current study and the aforementioned study lies in the use of CBCT images rather than panoramic images. The result of the current study, showing a significant change in FD values in the graft area between the first (FD = 1.297) and sixth months (FD = 1.279), differs from the previous study (p= 0,019). This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that panoramic devices may be affected by air spaces in the head and neck region, as well as the superimposition of soft and hard tissues, which can impact the clarity of the images. Additionally, the bone healing occurring in the lateral window opened during the surgical operation could overlap with the region of interest, thus potentially influencing the FD values. Typically, bone healing tends to show an increase in FD values, while the results in the current study, as observed, indicate a tendency for a decrease in FD values in the osteogenesis of the graft material. In this study, the alveolar bone that did not undergo surgery was evaluated as a control, and the lack of significant changes in the FD analysis results of the control group, coupled with significant changes in the graft group, suggests that the observed changes are likely due to the osteogenesis of the graft.

Therefore, the decrease in FD values observed in this study during the six-month healing period may be attributed to the biological remodeling dynamics of the grafted region. In the early post-operative phase, the graft material typically presents a porous and irregular trabecular architecture, which contributes to elevated FD values due to increased structural complexity. As osteogenesis progresses, the graft is gradually resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone, resulting in a more organized and homogeneous trabecular network and, consequently, a reduction in FD. This finding is consistent with the results of Wen and Zhang [52], who also reported a significant decrease in FD values after sinus augmentation using Bio-Oss, and attributed it to the degradation of the graft material and its substitution with less complex bone structures. In contrast, Molon et al. [54] did not report a significant change in FD values over the same healing period. A potential explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the imaging modality used; Molon et al. relied on panoramic radiographs, whereas the present study utilized CBCT. Since FD analysis is highly sensitive to image quality and the definition of the region of interest, the two-dimensional nature and lower resolution of panoramic imaging may limit its capacity to detect subtle changes in trabecular architecture associated with early bone remodeling. Therefore, the lack of significant FD variation in Molon’s study may reflect methodological limitations rather than the absence of biological remodeling.

Due to the potential risks associated with ionizing radiation, it is not ethically appropriate to perform CBCT imaging solely for the purpose of FD analysis. As a result, such analyses are inherently limited to CBCT scans acquired for other clinically justified indications. This constraint directly affects both the sample size and the broader applicability of FD analysis in clinical research.

All measurements and image processing procedures in this study were performed by a single investigator. Consequently, intra-operator reliability was not assessed. The absence of such reliability tests in imaging studies may represent a potential source of bias regarding the reproducibility of the results. Given that ROI selection and image preprocessing are inherently operator-dependent steps, this represents a notable methodological limitation specific to FD analysis. Uncontrolled potential confounding factors, such as variations in healing, patient compliance, or surgical technique—even if standardized—may have influenced the results.

FD analysis, as a non-invasive technique that obviates the need for bone biopsy, holds considerable promise for wider clinical application due to its practicality. When conducted with rigorous standardization, FD analysis may serve as a valuable quantitative indicator for assessing trabecular bone structure and graft osteogenesis. The results of the present study suggest that FD analysis may have the potential to reflect the dynamic changes associated with graft osteogenesis and could therefore serve as a useful parameter in the evaluation of graft maturation. Nonetheless, to substantiate these preliminary findings, mitigate methodological constraints, and fully elucidate the clinical relevance of FD analysis in monitoring bone regeneration post-grafting, larger-scale, well-designed prospective investigations are necessary.
