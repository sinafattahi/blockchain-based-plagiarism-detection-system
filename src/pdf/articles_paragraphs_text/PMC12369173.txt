This study investigated the potential role ofTXNRD2_FA44 promoter methylation in chronic heart failure (CHF) and its influence on disease mechanisms. Additionally, we explored the association between specific Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) site methylation levels within theTXNRD2_FA44 promoter and various biochemical markers in CHF patients.

The study included 20 individuals suffering from chronic heart failure and an equal number of healthy participants. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF–MS), CpG sites in theTXNRD2_FA44 promoter region were pinpointed and measured. The comparison of methylation levels was conducted between CHF patients and healthy individuals. Statistics was used to analyze the relationship betweenTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various key biochemical indicators.

Patients with CHF exhibited significantly higher methylation levels atTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 compared to controls (P= 0.0008). This elevated methylation level correlated with levels of creatinine (Crea), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), percentage of lymphocytes (LYMPH), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), and the albumin-to-globin ratio (A/G) in CHF patients.

The methylation level ofTXNRD2-FA44 in patients with chronic heart failure is significantly higher than controls, and the methylation level ofTXNRD2-FA44 is related to multiple liver and kidney function indicators. These findings suggest that TXNRD2-FA44 could serve as a biomarker for CHF diagnosis and may affect the occurrence and development of CHF through liver and kidney function.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) represents a terminal clinical syndrome of progressive cardiovascular diseases, affecting over 64 million individuals worldwide and posing a significant public health burden [1]. The etiology of CHF is multifactorial, primarily arising from myocardial injury or chronic hemodynamic overload. Major contributors include coronary artery disease (e.g., myocardial infarction), hypertensive heart disease, diabetic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease [2]. CHF is classified into three subtypes based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤ 40%), heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41–49%), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 50%) [3,4]. Disease severity is clinically stratified using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (I-IV), complemented by biomarkers (e.g., B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]/N-terminal pro-BNP) and imaging modalities for prognostic evaluation [5]. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF encompasses quadruple foundational pharmacotherapy: angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), evidence-based beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), which collectively reduce mortality by 30–50% [6]. In contrast, HFpEF management focuses on comorbidity control (hypertension, diabetes) and symptom relief due to the lack of disease-modifying therapies [3].

An increasing volume of research associates abnormal DNA methylation with CHF. Gene regulation, a dynamic, multi-layered process, further underscores the clinical relevance of DNA methylation in modulating downstream gene expression [7]. Studies have revealed that aberrant DNA methylation is closely associated with the pathological progression of CHF, manifesting as key phenotypes including cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction [8]. For example, Epigenetic dysregulation of theSETD7-RELA-IL6axis in CD4 + T cells may promote pro-inflammatory responses and cardiac remodeling in obese HFpEF patients [9]. Moreover, age-related methylation changes (e.g., epigenetic clock) are significantly associated with cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting DNA methylation as a molecular marker for early heart failure [10].

Selenium (Se) is a vital trace element needed by animals, including humans. Thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2), a selenoprotein encoded by theTXNRD2, regulates intracellular redox homeostasis and free radical scavenging [11], with studies indicating its essential role in cardiac function [12,13]. Studies have demonstrated that cardiac-specific knockout of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase exacerbates age-related metabolic dysregulation and contractile dysfunction in the myocardium, mediated by sustained oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [14], andTXNRD2regulates mitochondrial integrity during the age-dependent progression of heart failure [15].

Numerous studies have explored the link between DNA methylation and chronic heart failure development [16,17]. However, the specific mechanism and the relationship between chronic heart failure andTXNRD2_FA44 methylation in the gene's promoter region remain unclear. This study employed matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF–MS) to identify and analyze CpGs in the promoter region ofTXNRD2_FA44 among chronic heart failure patients and healthy subjects. We then compared the methylation levels of these CpGs between chronic heart failure patients, patients with varying degrees of cardiac function, and healthy individuals. Chronic heart failure diagnosis often relies solely on symptoms and signs, presenting challenges. Therefore, analyzing and elucidating the role ofTXNRD2_FA44 methylation in chronic heart failure development and its underlying mechanisms hold great significance. This knowledge can pave the way for future development of therapeutic targets, diagnostic markers, and personalized treatment regimens for chronic heart failure. It can also provide a novel research direction and theoretical foundation for improved treatment and prevention strategies.

The current study involved the recruitment of individuals from the Stroke Center located at the People’s Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. A total of 40 blood samples were obtained, comprising 20 samples from patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and 20 samples from healthy individuals undergoing routine medical examinations. The healthy control group included individuals with confirmed normal cardiac function. All participants were Han Chinese of varying ages. The CHF group consisted of 10 men and 10 women (includes 16 ischemic CHF cases and 4 non-ischemic CHF cases), while the healthy control group had 13 men and 7 women. All participants underwent relevant examinations, and their diagnoses and cardiac function measurements (for the CHF group) were in accordance with the “2018 Chronic Heart Failure Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines” issued by the Cardiovascular Disease Committee of the Chinese Medical Association [2]. Blood pressure measurement was conducted in accordance with the “2018 Chinese Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension” [18]. Approval for the complete design of this research was granted by the Ethics Committee of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region People’s Hospital (ZDYF-046; 2021) (Clinical trial number: not applicable). Each subject fulfilled the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria and voluntarily engaged in the research following the signing of the informed consent document.

The workflow of this study is illustrated in Fig.1.

The assay process involved several steps: bisulfite conversion, conventional PCR, in vitro transcription, RNase A digestion specific to single-stranded RNA, and finally, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Through these steps, the assay converted the methylation status of CpG sites in the DNA template into sequence differences following RNase A digestion. These sequence differences were then distinguished by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry based on variations in their molecular weight.

On the morning following study enrollment, 5 mL of fresh antecubital venous blood was collected from each fasting participant using K2 EDTA-coated tubes. Genomic DNA was subsequently isolated and aliquoted for long-term storage at − 80 °C. QIAamp DNA Mini Kit was used to extract DNA from the blood samples, DNA was quantified by spectrophotometer and 100 ng of DNA was taken, and 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis was used for quality control.

Primer design was performed using Sequenom Epidesigner (https://www.epidesigner.com). Amplified fragments typically ranged from 100 to 600 base pairs (bp) in size. A 10-mer tag was incorporated at the 5' end of the forward primer to optimize PCR reaction conditions. Additionally, a T7 promoter sequence is incorporated at the 5' end of the reverse primer for use in subsequent in vitro transcription (IVT). The specific sequence information of the primers as Table1. The aforementioned primers were synthesized by Beijing Liuhe Bgi Co., Ltd [19].

PCR amplification was carried out after bisulfite treatment of the DNA samples that passed the quality control. For theTXNRD2gene promoter region, we took 2000 bp upstream and 1000 bp downstream of the transcription initiation site (spanning −2000 to + 1000 bp), resulting in a total of 3000 bp, usingNM_001352300.2as the reference transcript, the relevant gene sequence was sourced from the NCBI website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/). The potential CpG islands of the sequence were predicted using the CpG Island Online Prediction Network (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/seqstats/emboss_cpgplot) [20], and one CpG island was found; the primer scheme of the sequence was designed using the Agena EpiDesigner program, andTXNRD2_FA44, which has a relatively high number of CpGs, was selected in this study. As shown in Fig.2A, the position of the amplified fragment in the chromosome was chr22: 19,942,656–19,943,142. The primer was proposed to amplify the 1839 bp-2325 bp region of the promoter region, which was 487 bp in length and contained 39 CpG sites (Fig.2B: CpG sites labeled in blue were not detected and therefore not counted).

After PCR amplification, alkaline phosphatase treatment (SAP), in vitro transcription (IVT), and RNase digestion, the purified products were assayed on the MassARRAY Compact System using the MassARRAY Nanodispenser RS1000 dispenser. Data analysis was performed using EpiTYPER 1.0 software.

Analysis of the data was conducted with SPSS v.23.0 and Stata 17.0. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was employed to assess the normality or log-normality of the collected measurement data. Data following a normal distribution were presented as an average ± standard deviation () and analyzed through t-tests, whereas data deviating from normal distribution were shown as median values and evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test. Pertaining to a range of clinical testing variables (such as lipid levels, blood clotting, liver and kidney performance, electrolyte levels, total blood count). In CHF patients, methylation levels at specific CpG sites were categorized into the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles as three distinct points to develop a Restricted cubic spline (RCS), aiding in the exploration of the dose–response link between methylation levels and biochemical markers. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the clinical indicators linked to CHF and CpG sites with varying methylation. Subsequently, Sangerbox (http://sangerbox.com/) was utilized to create forest plots for depicting these correlations. Ap-value below 0.05 was deemed to hold statistical significance.

The comorbidities of both study groups were systematically categorized. In the CHF group, comorbidities were predominantly cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Among the 20 CHF patients, the top five comorbidities were: coronary atherosclerosis (16/20), arrhythmia (7/20), hypertension (7/20), diabetes mellitus (7/20), and dilated cardiomyopathy (6/20), collectively accounting for 55.13% (43/78) of all comorbidity records. In contrast, the control group (n= 20) demonstrated a heterogeneous, multi-system distribution of comorbidities without dominant disease clustering: respiratory disorders (9 cases), gastrointestinal conditions (7 cases), musculoskeletal diseases (5 cases), followed by endocrine and neurological disorders (3 cases each), with ocular and circulatory system diseases (2 cases each). Note that the total frequency counts exceed 20 per group due to prevalent multimorbidity among participants. Patients with CHF received combination therapy based on their heart failure subtype and comorbidities, in addition to foundational pharmacological treatments such as renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). In contrast, the control group received symptom-targeted medications according to their underlying conditions.

This study encompassed 20 individuals suffering from chronic heart failure and an equal number of healthy participants. Initial attributes like age and gender showed no notable differences between the CHF and control groups (P< 0.05) (Table2).

An analysis and comparison were conducted on the clinical characteristics of both the case and control groups. Table3displays the findings, notable variances were observed in the prothrombin time (PT), prothrombin time ratio (PTR), international normalized ratio (PT-INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P< 0.05). No significant differences were identified in the remaining biochemical parameters.

Figure3presents a violin plot generated using Prism 8.0 software to compare the methylation levels of theTXNRD2_FA44 selenoprotein gene's promoter region between chronic heart failure patients and healthy controls. In the figure, green represents the healthy control group, and red represents CHF patients. The results revealed significant differences (P< 0.05) in methylation levels between CHF patients and healthy controls forTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 (P= 0.0008) andTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_30 (P= 0.0443) within theTXNRD2_FA44 promoter region.

However, the methylation ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_30 in CHF patients was incomplete due to missing data, this CpG was excluded from subsequent analyses exploring the dose–response relationship between differentially methylated CpG and various biochemical indices. Consequently, only the methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 was evaluated in relation to these biochemical parameters.

Figure4depicts the relationship between the methylation level at theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various liver function indices in chronic heart failure patients. The solid line represents the odds ratio (OR) for each liver function index.

The analysis revealed a non-linear correlation between methylation levels and GLB and total bilirubin (TBIL) (P-value for non-linearity < 0.05). Nevertheless, a clear dose–response relationship was not detected (P-value for overall effect > 0.05). Specifically, an increase in the methylation levels ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 resulted in a gradual initial decline in the odds ratio (OR) for GLB, which was subsequently followed by a swift increase (Fig.4H). In contrast, the OR for TBIL progressively increased with rising methylation levels before sharply declining (Fig.4E).

Unlike the nonlinear associations seen with globulin and bilirubin, ALB and the A/G ratio showed a linear relationship with the methylation levels ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29, accompanied by a clear dose–response effect (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity > 0.05). With rising methylation levels, the odds ratio (OR) for ALB increased consistently, reflecting a nearly linear pattern (Fig.4G). The albumin-to-globulin ratio initially rose slowly but then declined rapidly with increasing methylation levels (Fig.4I).

Adenosine deaminase (ADA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mAST), and indirect bilirubin (IBIL) all exhibited non-linear correlations with theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation level, but a dose–response relationship was also observed (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity < 0.05). The ORs for ADA, AST, and mAST initially decreased and then increased with higher methylation levels (Fig.4A, B, C). The relationship between IBIL and methylation displayed an inverted U-shape, with the OR for IBIL showing a gradual initial increase followed by a sharp decrease as methylation levels increased (Fig.4F).

Figure5presents the results of a dose–response analysis exploring the relationship between the methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various lipid indices in CHF patients. The solid line in each plot represents the OR for the corresponding lipid index. Notably, none of the analyzed lipid indices, including total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), exhibited a significant association with theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation level (P-value for overall effect > 0.05,P-value for non-linearity > 0.05) (Fig.5A, B).

Figure6depicts the results of a dose–response analysis investigating the relationship between the methylation level at theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various coagulation indices in CHF patients. The solid line in each plot represents the OR for the corresponding coagulation index. Here, no significant associations were observed between the methylation level and any of the analyzed coagulation indices, including D-dimer (DD) and fibrinogen (FIB)P-value for overall effect > 0.05,P-value for non-linearity > 0.05) (Fig.6A, B).

Figure7presents the results of a dose–response analysis exploring the relationship between the methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various renal function and electrolyte indices in CHF patients. The solid line in each plot represents the OR for the corresponding index.

While non-linear associations were observed between methylation levels and both Urea and eGFR (P-value for non-linearity < 0.05), no significant dose–response relationship was evident (P-value for overall effect > 0.05). In contrast to the non-linear associations observed for Urea and eGFR, carbon dioxide (CO2) and Crea exhibited a linear correlation with theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation level, and a dose–response relationship was evident (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity < 0.05).

The relationship displayed a U-shape, with the ORs for both Crea and Urea initially decreasing and then increasing as methylation levels increased (Fig.7A, C). Specifically, the relationship between methylation and both eGFR and CO2displayed an inverted U-shape, with the ORs initially increasing slowly and then rapidly decreasing as methylation levels rose (Fig.7B, E).

However, no significant correlations were observed between the methylation level and various electrolyte indices, including potassium (K) and sodium (Na) (P-value for overall effect > 0.05,P-value for non-linearity > 0.05) (Fig.7D, F).

Figure8depicts the results of a dose–response analysis examining the relationship between the methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and various blood routine indices in CHF patients. The solid lines in each graph denote the OR for the respective hematological indices. A linear relationship with a dose–response effect was identified between methylation levels and lymphocyte percentages (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity > 0.05). With the rise in methylation levels, the OR for LYMPH progressively increased in an almost linear fashion (Fig.8B).

Figure9presents the results of ROC curve analysis to evaluate the methylation levels of differentially methylated CpG sites in CHF patients, along with other clinical indicators, as predictors of CHF risk. The area under the curve (AUC) is also shown for each factor. The analysis revealed that the AUC forTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 (AUC = 0.783) was significantly higher than those for other factors, including ADA (AUC = 0.526), AST (AUC = 0.518), mAST (AUC = 0.641), TBIL (AUC = 0.556), IBIL (AUC = 0.554), A/G ratio (AUC = 0.526), Crea (AUC = 0.605), and Urea (AUC = 0.570). All these factors had AUC values greater than 0.5, indicating a fair to good ability to predict CHF risk. Factors such as eGFR (AUC = 0.370) and LYMPH (AUC = 0.345) showed lower AUC values, suggesting limited efficacy in CHF risk prediction using this method. A methylation value of 0.035 for theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 was considered a potential threshold for CHF risk prediction, considering a reference value similar to the maximum value of the Jordan index (around 0.4).

To investigate the relationship between CHF and various biochemical indices and the methylation siteTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29, biochemical indices and methylation levels that correlated with CHF were first categorized into four groups based on their quartiles (P25, P50, P75). These quartile values served as the independent variables in a binary logistic regression analysis, with the first quartile group serving as the reference category. The dependent variable was whether a patient suffered from CHF. Figure10presents the results of a one-way binary logistic regression analysis examining the relationship between various biochemical indices, the methylation siteTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29, and CHF. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference (P< 0.05) between the second quartile group of globulin and the first quartile group (reference group). Interestingly, globulin levels showed a negative correlation with CHF risk (OR < 1). This indicates that as serum globulin levels increased, the risk of CHF decreased. Furthermore, the methylation level of the differentially methylated locusTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 in quartile group IV was statistically different from group I (reference group) (P< 0.05). Here, the methylation level exhibited a positive correlation with CHF risk (OR > 1). This observation implies that the odds ratio (OR) increases progressively with higher methylation levels at this locus, consequently raising the risk of chronic heart failure (CHF). There were no significant differences noted among the other biochemical parameters (P> 0.05).

Following the univariate analyses (Fig.10), we performed a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis to assess the combined effects ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation and other biochemical indices on CHF risk. The results are presented in Fig.11. This analysis revealed a significant interaction between the methylation level ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and serum urea levels (P< 0.05). Both parameters emerged as risk factors for CHF (OR > 1), indicating that individuals with higher levels of both methylation and urea exhibited a progressively increased risk of developing CHF.

CHF is a major clinical and public health concern [21], particularly for individuals aged 65 and over [22]. Recent years have witnessed a worrying increase in CHF prevalence, even among younger populations [1]. This growing burden is likely due in part to population aging [23]. While traditional CHF treatment focused on hemodynamics, research efforts are now shifting towards understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapies. These include directly targeting intracellular proteins and delivering genes to correct enzyme abnormalities [24].

DNA methylation, a key regulatory process in gene expression, primarily occurs on CpG dinucleotides. DNA methyltransferases attach a methyl group to the cytosine ring in these CpG sites, resulting in the formation of 5-methylcytosine [25]. This methylation can influence both the structure of DNA and its interactions with proteins, ultimately regulating gene activity [26]. The role of DNA methylation is critical in sustaining cell-type-specific gene expression profiles and has been linked to both the onset and advancement of various diseases. For example, in cancer, abnormal DNA methylation patterns can silence tumor suppressor genes while activating oncogenes, thereby promoting tumor formation and progression [27].

Among the 25 identified human selenoproteins, only 13 have known functions. Thioredoxin reductase 2 stands out for its crucial role in various physiological processes, including intracellular redox reactions, antioxidant defense, and immune regulation [28,29]. This selenoprotein is essential for maintaining organismal homeostasis.

Protein gene methylation refers to modifications to DNA that regulate the genes coding for proteins. These modifications can significantly impact gene expression, leading to a cascade of biological effects. One key consequence of protein gene methylation is gene silencing. This occurs when methylation inhibits the transcription of certain genes, preventing their proper expression in cells and ultimately affecting cellular function. This process has the potential to lead to the onset and advancement of a range of diseases [27,30,31].

Our study revealed significantly higher methylation levels ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 andTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_30 in CHF patients compared to the control group. This hypermethylation of theTXNRD2gene, which encodes TrxR2, a selenoprotein, could potentially impair TrxR2 gene expression. Consequently, this might lead to reduced TrxR2 protein production, potentially contributing to the development of CHF.

Besides, ROC curve analysis yielded an AUC of 0.783 forTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation. This finding suggests promising potential for this locus as a diagnostic indicator of CHF in future studies using larger sample sizes. Further research will be necessary to determine the optimal diagnostic value ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation in CHF diagnosis.

The methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 in CHF patients exhibited various relationships with different biochemical indices. A non-linear dose–response relationship was observed between methylation and ADA, AST, mAST, IBIL, CO2, and Crea (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity < 0.05). In contrast, a linear dose–response relationship was evident for A/G and ALB (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity < 0.05). Finally, non-linear associations were observed with GLB, TBIL, eGFR, and Urea (P-value for overall effect > 0.05,P-value for non-linearity < 0.05). These diverse associations between theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation level and various biochemical markers suggest that this locus may influence specific pathways and mechanisms underlying CHF development. In particular, the interaction between TXNRD2_FA44 methylation and key clinical biochemical indicators could represent a potential etiological mechanism of CHF.

The RCS curves ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation level revealed non-linear dose–response relationships with both TBIL and IBIL (P-value for overall effect < 0.05,P-value for non-linearity < 0.05). By comparison, methylation shows no notable correlation with DBIL (P-value for overall effect > 0.05). These findings suggest a potentially stronger link between indirect bilirubin levels andTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation, which may be relevant to CHF pathogenesis.

The linear dose–response relationship observed between the methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and LYMPH suggests a potentially stronger inflammatory response in CHF patients with higher methylation at this site. Glomerular filtration rate is a crucial indicator of kidney function and is closely linked to chronic heart failure [32]. In CHF patients, inadequate heart pumping can lead to decreased eGFR due to compromised renal perfusion [33]. Additionally, fluid retention and the use of diuretics, common in CHF, can further affect eGFR [34]. The findings of our research demonstrate a significant discrepancy in eGFR between CHF patients and healthy controls, reinforcing the previously established link between eGFR and CHF. Notably, we also identified a non-linear association between the methylation levels ofTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and eGFR. However, the specific nature of this three-way interaction remains to be elucidated.

A highly significant non-linear correlation (P-value for overall effect = 0.0054,P-value for non-linearity = 0.002) was observed between the methylation level of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and Crea. Crea, a muscle byproduct, is typically filtered by the kidneys. In CHF patients, elevated Crea levels often indicate impaired kidney function [35]. Diminished cardiac pumping in CHF leads to inadequate renal perfusion, consequently reducing the glomerular filtration rate and causing Crea accumulation [36]. In addition, fluid retention in CHF can further exacerbate kidney dysfunction and elevate Crea levels [37]. This significant non-linear association betweenTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation and Crea suggests a potential interaction between this gene locus and Crea metabolism. Crea may represent one pathway through whichTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation influences CHF development.

Our multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed a joint effect of theTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 methylation level and serum Urea level on CHF development. This suggests that the altered methylation at this locus might influence CHF development through pathways involving serum Urea.

It is well-established that CHF is often accompanied by comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [4]. Recent studies have further demonstrated that comorbidities can modulate epigenetic patterns, including DNA methylation in metabolic and inflammatory genes, which may synergize with TXNRD2 methylation to drive CHF progression [38]. Although our study did not systematically assess comorbidities, their significant role in CHF pathogenesis cannot be overlooked. Future research should integrate comorbidity status with epigenetic analyses to uncover their combined effects and inform personalized treatment strategies.

This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the relatively small sample size and recruitment from a single hospital introduce selection bias. Second, the study population exclusively comprised individuals of Han ethnicity, limiting generalizability. Third, the investigation's screening nature precludes establishing causality between the methylation level of the CHF-associated CpG locusTXNRD2_FA44_CpG_27.28.29 and chronic heart failure. Additionally, it does not provide a deep exploration of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Future studies addressing these limitations are necessary. Multicenter trials with larger, more diverse samples are needed to strengthen the evidence, refine our understanding of the relationship betweenTXNRD2_FA44 methylation and chronic heart failure, and elucidate the specific pathways and mechanisms involved.

In comparison with the control group, the methylation levels ofTXNRD2_FA44 were significantly elevated in patients with CHF. Additionally, in CHF patients, this methylation level correlated with various biochemical indices, including urea, eGFR, and IBIL. These findings suggest that methylation change inTXNRD2_FA44 might influence CHF pathogenesis and development by impacting liver and kidney function. The underlying biological mechanisms urgently require further investigation to establish a scientific basis for the clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CHF.
