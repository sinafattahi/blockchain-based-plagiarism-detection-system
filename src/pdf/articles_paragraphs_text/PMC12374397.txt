Nurses face challenges in accessing professional development because of high workloads, workforce shortages, and shift-based schedules. Limited availability of and negative perceptions toward web-based learning may affect clinical performance and job satisfaction, potentially increasing turnover rates. This study aimed to examine the impact of nurses’ attitudes toward web-based learning on clinical performance, job satisfaction, and anticipated turnover in Saudi Arabia.

A nonexperimental, cross-sectional quantitative design was used. The study was conducted in various healthcare settings in Saudi Arabia using a nonprobability convenience sampling method. Data were collected using the Attitudes Toward Web-Based Continuing Learning Survey to assess attitudes toward online learning, the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire to evaluate clinical performance, the Nursing Workplace Satisfaction Questionnaire to measure job satisfaction, and the Anticipated Turnover Scale to assess turnover intention.

A total of 177 registered nurses participated in the online survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and linear regression analysis. The findings revealed a significant, moderate positive correlation between attitudes toward web-based learning and clinical performance (r= 0.314,p< 0.001), indicating that more favorable attitudes were associated with higher clinical performance. A significant, weak negative correlation was observed with job satisfaction scores (r= − 0.224,p= 0.004), indicating that more favorable attitudes were associated with greater job satisfaction. No significant association was found between attitudes toward web-based learning and anticipated turnover (r= − 0.083,p= 0.300). Regression analysis showed that attitudes toward web-based learning significantly predicted clinical performance (β = 0.331,p< 0.001) but did not significantly predict job satisfaction (β = − 0.148,p= 0.061) or turnover intention (β = − 0.035,p= 0.658).

The study highlights web-based learning as an effective and flexible training modality for nurses, offering accessible professional development that enhances knowledge and clinical competency. Nurses demonstrated positive attitudes toward web-based learning, supporting its potential to improve clinical performance and job satisfaction. Future initiatives should focus on optimizing and expanding web-based learning programs to maximize their impact on nursing education and workforce development.

In contemporary healthcare, technology has a crucial role in shaping nursing practice, integrating evidence-based knowledge with web-based learning to enhance education and clinical competency. Web-based learning leverages technological advancements to facilitate professional development by providing nurses with flexible, accessible, and efficient training opportunities. This learning modality allows nurses to engage in continuous education anytime and anywhere, addressing traditional barriers to learning [1].

The availability of online educational resources has the potential to improve clinical performance and enhance job satisfaction. Ongoing professional development is essential for ensuring that nurses remain current with evolving clinical guidelines and best practices. Web-based learning technologies enable nurses to control their learning experience by selecting content, adjusting the sequence and pace of learning, and utilizing various media formats to meet individual educational needs [2]. Moreover, web-based learning can positively influence nurses’ attitudes toward patient care by fostering a patient-centered approach and improving clinical decision-making, ultimately leading to optimal clinical performance. The integration of web-based training in nursing has been associated with increased job satisfaction, which contributes to improved healthcare outcomes [3]. The incorporation of technology into nursing education supports career advancement by expanding access to specialized courses and professional development programs. Online nursing courses often include multimedia elements, such as videos, interactive simulations, and virtual reality experiences, providing learners with immersive, hands-on educational opportunities that enhance clinical skills [4]. Web-based learning offers flexibility and accessibility; however, some studies highlight concerns regarding self-directed learning challenges, technological barriers, and the need for interactive engagement in professional education [5].

Nevertheless, nurses strive to achieve high job satisfaction, which is a critical factor in delivering quality patient care. Healthcare institutions have a central role in identifying and addressing factors that influence job satisfaction, ultimately improving nursing performance and patient outcomes. In particular, nursing education departments are responsible for fostering continuous learning and equipping nurses with the skills necessary for professional growth and enhanced clinical practice.

Despite these efforts, nurse turnover remains a significant challenge. According to the Saudi Health Council, the nursing turnover rate in Saudi Arabia is approximately 20%, which is twice that of countries, such as the United Kingdom [6]. This high turnover is frequently associated with job dissatisfaction and an increasing intent to leave the profession, often linked to unmet professional development and training needs.

Beyond turnover concerns, nurses encounter substantial barriers to accessing training and development opportunities, largely because of heavy workloads, staffing shortages, and demanding shift schedules [7]. Additionally, limitations in the availability and effectiveness of web-based learning resources may adversely affect clinical performance and job satisfaction, thereby further exacerbating the risk of turnover.

The effectiveness of web-based learning in clinical settings is influenced by multiple factors, including nurses’ motivation to engage with digital learning and their perception of its value as a professional development tool [1]. Research suggests that nurses with higher levels of job satisfaction are more likely to participate in continuous learning activities, ultimately enhancing their clinical expertise and efficiency as healthcare providers [3]. Furthermore, nurse retention is essential for maintaining a stable healthcare workforce, and job satisfaction plays a crucial role in motivating nurses to remain in their positions [8].

In Saudi Arabia, nurses encounter various challenges, including low clinical performance, job dissatisfaction, and high turnover rates. Research consistently indicates that the turnover rate among nurses in Saudi Arabia is significantly higher than that in other countries [6]. Studies have also reported widespread job dissatisfaction among nurses in the country [9]. Additionally, evidence suggests a positive correlation between job performance, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction [10].

Despite these challenges, limited research has explored nurses’ attitudes toward web-based learning and its potential impact on clinical performance, job satisfaction, and turnover within Saudi Arabia’s healthcare sector. Therefore, this study aimed to examine nurses’ attitudes toward web-based learning and investigate its effect on their clinical performance, job satisfaction, and intention to remain in the profession.

Bandura’s Social Learning Theory provided the theoretical foundation for this study. Developed by Albert Bandura, Social Learning Theory emphasizes the interaction among cognitive, personal, behavioral, and environmental influences on the learning process [11]. In clinical settings, learning occurs through observation, modeling, and engagement with the professional environment, shaping both knowledge and behavior. This theory offers a conceptual lens for examining how personal factors, such as attitudes toward web-based learning, may relate to professional behaviors and workplace outcomes [11].

In this study, attitudes toward web-based learning represent a cognitive-affective component of personal factors. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, education level, income, nationality, and professional role, may also shape learning experiences and perceptions of web-based education. Based on the theory, individuals who view learning opportunities positively may be more inclined to engage with professional content and reflect it in their work. Clinical performance may reflect the uptake of new knowledge or skills; job satisfaction may relate to perceived competence and growth opportunities; and turnover intention may reflect disconnection between learning experiences and job expectations. The framework highlights the dynamic interaction between personal factors (e.g., attitudes toward web-based learning), individual characteristics (e.g., sex, age, years of experience, income, and education), environmental conditions (e.g., peer interactions, access to resources), and behavioral outcomes (e.g., clinical performance, job satisfaction, and anticipated turnover). The theory thus supports the examination of how attitudes and individual factors relate to professional outcomes within specific organizational contexts [11].

This study employed a nonexperimental, cross-sectional, quantitative research design. Registered nurses were recruited from various healthcare sectors in Saudi Arabia using a convenience-based, nonprobability sampling approach. Data were collected between July 2024 and August 2024. Inclusion criteria required participants to be registered nurses currently employed in either governmental or nongovernmental healthcare sectors in Saudi Arabia, with a minimum of 1 year of work experience and proficiency in reading and understanding English. Registered nurses in administrative roles who did not provide direct patient care were excluded. A priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power software (version 3.1; Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) for linear multiple regression (fixed model, R² deviation from zero) to ensure adequate power for planned multivariate analyses. Assuming a medium effect size (f² = 0.15), in accordance with Cohen’s (1988) guidelines [12], and setting the alpha level at 0.05 with power at 0.80, the analysis indicated a minimum required sample size of 135 participants. To improve data quality, the target sample size was increased by at least 10% to account for potentially incomplete, inconsistent, or otherwise invalid responses. Ultimately, more valid responses were received than expected during the final phase of data collection. All eligible responses were retained, resulting in a final sample of 177 participants.

The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for cross-sectional studies. The survey instrument included two main sections. The first section gathered sociodemographic data, including age, sex, region, educational level, work sector, type of contract, nationality, marital status, monthly income level, years of experience, position, and work area. The second section assessed nurses’ attitudes toward web-based learning, clinical performance, job satisfaction, and anticipated turnover within the Saudi Arabian healthcare sector.

This study assessed attitudes toward web-based learning using the attitudes toward web-based learning (AWCL) survey, developed by Liang et al. [13]. The scale included self-reported, attitude-focused items and consisted of 15 questions categorized into four dimensions: perceived usefulness (5 items), perceived ease of use (4 items), behavior (3 items), and affection (3 items). Responses were measured on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 7 (“strongly agree”). All positively worded items were coded accordingly. An example item is, “Web-based continuing learning helps my work become more interesting.” Total scores ranged from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating a more positive attitude toward web-based learning. In this study, the scale demonstrated strong reliability in assessing nurses’ attitudes toward web-based learning, with Cronbach’s alpha values for the subscales ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 and an overall alpha of 0.96, indicating high internal consistency.

Nursing clinical performance was evaluated using the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ), developed by Koopmans et al. [14]. This scale included self-reported, performance-based items and consisted of 18 questions across three dimensions: task performance (5 items), contextual performance (8 items), and counterproductive work behavior (5 items). Responses were measured on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (“seldom”) to 4 (“always”). All positively worded items were coded accordingly. An example item is, “I was able to plan my work so that I finished it on time.” The maximum score was 72, with higher scores reflecting greater clinical performance. In this study, the scale demonstrated strong reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values for the subscales ranging from 0.84 to 0.92 and an overall alpha of 0.90, indicating high internal consistency.

Job satisfaction was measured using the Nursing Workplace Satisfaction Questionnaire (NWSQ), developed by Fairbrother et al. [15]. The scale comprised self-reported items categorized into three dimensions: “How much you enjoy your job” (6 items), “Doing your job” (8 items), and “The people you work with” (4 items). Responses were measured on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “(strongly agree”) to 5 (“strongly disagree”). The scale included positively and negatively worded items. An example of a positively worded item is, “My job is very meaningful for me,” whereas an example of a negatively worded item is, “I feel isolated from my colleagues at work.” (item 12), which was reverse-scored for consistency, as per the scoring protocol [15]. Total scores ranged from 18 to 75, with lower scores indicating higher job satisfaction. In this study, the scale showed strong reliability, with subscale alpha values ranging from 0.77 to 0.92 and an overall alpha of 0.93, indicating high internal consistency.

Turnover intention was assessed using the Anticipated Turnover Scale (ATS), originally developed by Hinshaw and Atwood [16], and adapted for the Saudi healthcare context by Almarashi et al. [17]. The self-reported scale included 10 items, five of which were reverse-scored. Responses were measured on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 7 (“strongly agree”). An example of a standard item is, “I plan to leave this workplace in the near future,” whereas a reverse-scored item is, “I have no intention of leaving my current workplace.” Total scores ranged from 10 to 70, with higher scores reflecting a greater intention to leave. In this study, the ATS demonstrated good reliability for assessing turnover intention among nurses in Saudi Arabia, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79.

This study received Institutional Review Board approval from all participating institutions prior to participant enrollment. Upon approval, the survey was distributed to nursing administrators, who facilitated dissemination to the target population. Participants received an information sheet outlining the study’s objectives, voluntary participation, and the right to withdraw at any time without repercussions. They were assured that no personal identifiers would be collected and that all data would be used exclusively for research purposes. To ensure confidentiality and privacy, all responses were anonymized, coded, and securely stored. Completion of the survey was considered implied consent. After data collection, responses were exported from Qualtrics (Provo, UT, USA) and prepared for analysis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Descriptive statistics were computed for continuous variables (mean, standard deviation [SD]) and categorical variables (frequency, percentage). Inferential statistics, including Pearson’s correlation and point-biserial correlation coefficients, were used to examine associations between primary study variables and sociodemographic characteristics. Additionally, linear regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of attitudes toward web-based learning on clinical performance, job satisfaction, and anticipated turnover. Cases with missing data for any of the primary outcome variables were excluded from the respective analyses using listwise deletion. Statistical significance was determined at a two-sidedp-value of < 0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 28.0.

A total of 282 individuals responded to the online survey. However, only 177 participants were included in the final analysis; 95 respondents were excluded for completing only the sociodemographic section, and 10 individuals did not meet the inclusion criteria. As shown in Table1, most participants were male (n= 108, 61%), Saudi nationals (n= 154, 87%), and married (n= 132, 74.6%). The majority held undergraduate degrees (n= 119, 67.2%). Regarding income distribution, more than half of the participants reported a monthly income exceeding 15,000 Saudi riyals (SAR;n= 97, 54.8%), followed by those earning 10,000–15,000 SAR (n= 52, 29.4%), whereas 15.8% (n= 28) reported a monthly income below 10,000 SAR. The participants’ mean age ± SD was 36.47 ± 5.85 years, and the average years of experience was 13.32 ± 6.30 years. In terms of geographical distribution, the highest proportion of participants practiced in the southern region (n= 76, 42.9%), followed by the central region (n= 32, 18.1%), western region (n= 26, 14.7%), eastern region (n= 22, 12.4%), and northern region (n= 21, 11.9%). Most participants (n= 153, 86.4%) were employed in the governmental (i.e., Ministry of Health [MOH]) sector, followed by the governmental non-MOH sector (n= 19, 10.7%). Only 2.8% (n= 5) were employed in the private sector. Additionally, 68.4% (n= 121) of participants were employed under civil service regulations, whereas 31.6% (n= 56) were on annual contract regulations. Regarding professional roles, 59.9% (n= 106) were staff nurses, whereas 40.1% (n= 71) held managerial positions, such as nurse managers, head nurses, or nursing supervisors. Participants worked in various healthcare settings, with the largest proportion in inpatient care (n= 55, 31.1%), followed by other hospital care (n= 33, 18.6%), primary care (n= 33, 18.6%), critical care (n= 21, 11.9%), emergency care (n= 18, 10.2%), and outpatient care (n= 17, 9.6%).

As presented in Table2, the total mean ± SD score of the AWCL was 5.56 ± 1.20. Among its subscales, the mean score for affection was 5.65 ± 1.27, followed by perceived usefulness (5.58 ± 1.34), behavior (5.54 ± 1.26), and perceived ease of use (5.48 ± 1.29). No missing values were detected in the AWCL. For the IWPQ, the mean score was 2.59 ± 0.73. Among its subscales, the mean ± SD for contextual performance was 2.98 ± 0.75, followed by task performance (2.94 ± 0.82) and counterproductive work behavior (1.63 ± 1.35). The IWPQ had 12 missing values (n= 12, 6.7%). For the NWSQ, the total mean score was 32.48 ± 10.27. Among its subscales, the mean score for intrinsic satisfaction was 12.90 ± 4.99, followed by extrinsic satisfaction (11.56 ± 3.21) and relational satisfaction (8.01 ± 3.05). The NWSQ also had 12 missing values (6.7%). Finally, the total mean score of the ATS was 38.96 ± 6.29, with 18 missing values (10.1%).

As illustrated in Table3, no significant correlations were observed between attitudes toward web-based learning and any of the sociodemographic factors examined in the study. This finding suggested that none of the sociodemographic variables were significantly associated with participants’ attitudes toward web-based learning.

As presented in Table3, a moderate, positive, and statistically significant correlation was observed between attitude toward web-based learning and clinical performance (r= 0.314,p< 0.001), indicating that higher attitudes toward web-based learning were associated with higher levels of clinical performance among participants. Additionally, a weak, negative, but significant correlation was found between attitudes toward web-based learning and job satisfaction (r= -0.224,p= 0.004), suggesting that higher attitudes toward web-based learning were associated with lower job satisfaction levels. However, no significant association was observed between attitudes toward web-based learning and anticipated turnover.

As shown in Table4, linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of attitudes toward web-based learning on clinical performance while accounting for other independent variables in the model. The model demonstrated a good fit [F(13, 144) = 1.813,p< 0.05] and explained 14.1% of the variance in clinical performance. The results indicated that only attitude toward web-based learning significantly influenced clinical performance (β = 0.331, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.105–0.303,p< 0.001), after adjusting for other variables. This finding suggests that participants with more positive attitudes toward web-based learning exhibited higher levels of clinical performance. However, no statistically significant effects were found for sociodemographic variables, job satisfaction, or anticipated turnover on clinical performance.

As shown in Table5, linear regression was used to examine the impact of attitude toward web-based learning on job satisfaction, accounting for other independent variables in the model. The model demonstrated a good fit [F(13, 144) = 4.027,p> 0.001] and explained 26.7% of the variability in job satisfaction. The findings indicated that turnover significantly influenced job satisfaction (β = 0.432, 95% CI [0.468, 0.955],p <0.001), after adjusting for other variables. This finding suggested that participants with higher turnover intentions had lower job satisfaction levels. Additionally, marital status (β = -0.198, 95% CI [-9.235, -0.112],p< 0.05) and job position (β = 0.173, 95% CI [0.304, 7.016],p< 0.05) significantly predicted job satisfaction. These results indicated that married participants and those in managerial roles, including managers, head nurses, and nursing supervisors, reported higher job satisfaction levels.

As shown in Table6, linear regression analysis was applied to examine the impact of attitude toward e-learning on anticipated turnover, while accounting for other independent variables in the model. The model demonstrated a good fit [F(13, 144) = 3.912,p> 0.001] and explained 26.1% of the variability in anticipated turnover. The findings indicated that job satisfaction significantly influenced anticipated turnover (β = 0.436, 95% CI [0.174, 0.355],p> 0.001), after adjusting for other variables. This finding suggested that participants with lower job satisfaction levels had higher anticipated turnover rates. Additionally, marital status (β = 0.303, 95% CI [1.622, 7.081],p< 0.05) and job position (β = -0.236, 95% CI [-5.052, -1.014],p< 0.05) significantly predicted anticipated turnover. These results indicated that married participants and staff nurses reported higher anticipated turnover.

This study explored attitudes toward web-based learning and examined their impact on clinical performance, job satisfaction, and anticipated turnover among nurses in the Saudi Arabian health sector. The findings revealed that participants generally held positive attitudes toward web-based learning. This aligns with prior studies reporting that nurses view web-based learning favorably and as an accessible mode of continuing education [13,18,19].

Several contextual factors may contribute to these positive attitudes. First, participants were relatively young, which may have contributed to their comfort and familiarity with digital tools and online educational resources. Moreover, most participants were employed in MOH facilities, where web-based learning is promoted through institutional programs. Additionally, national efforts, such as the Learning Experience Platform launched by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties, offer continuing education opportunities that reinforce the use of web-based learning across healthcare settings. Despite institutional efforts, challenges remain. Barriers such as limited technological infrastructure, unreliable internet, and the need for self-directed learning can hinder engagement [5]. Structured training, continuous technical support, and user-friendly platforms may improve learning experiences. Centralized resources, digital literacy training, and incentives like professional development credits can further promote adoption. Additionally, short, flexible courses tailored to shift schedules may enhance accessibility for nurses.

This study revealed that more favorable attitudes toward web-based learning were significantly associated with higher clinical performance. This aligns with earlier research linking digital learning with improved nursing competencies [20,21], and suggests that nurses who embrace web-based learning may apply knowledge more effectively in clinical settings. The learner autonomy and flexible nature of web-based platforms may empower nurses to continuously refine their skills, contributing to better performance. Further, studies have shown that web-based learning promotes clinical competence, better patient outcomes, and stronger documentation practices [22–24]. These findings collectively support web-based learning as a mechanism for improving both technical and cognitive aspects of nursing care. As healthcare becomes increasingly complex, enabling nurses to access relevant, timely information through online platforms is essential for ensuring evidence-based practice. Although web-based learning is associated with improved clinical performance, its effectiveness may depend on contextual factors such as organizational culture, leadership support, and peer mentorship. Designing digital programs with these influences in mind can strengthen their impact and encourage sustained professional development.

This study also found that nurses who expressed more favorable attitudes toward web-based learning reported greater job satisfaction in the bivariate analysis. This is consistent with literature suggesting that accessible, interactive digital learning can boost engagement in professional development [2,25]. However, this relationship did not remain significant in the multivariate analysis, suggesting that other factors may have a stronger influence on job satisfaction. This result is inconsistent with prior research linking technology use to increased job satisfaction among nurses [8,26,27,28]. These inconsistencies may be attributed to contextual factors such as limited organizational support or frustration with online platforms, particularly under time constraints [8,16]. These findings highlight the complexity of influences shaping job satisfaction. Within Saudi Arabia’s healthcare system, factors such as workload, institutional support, and cultural expectations may mediate the relationship between educational interventions and satisfaction. Nevertheless, web-based learning remains a promising strategy for supporting professional development and should be thoughtfully integrated into nursing education frameworks. Future research is needed to explore how these contextual variables interact with web-based learning and affect job satisfaction across diverse healthcare environments.

Despite initial expectations, this study did not identify a statistically significant association between attitudes toward web-based learning and anticipated turnover. This contrasts with the assumption that professional development opportunities reduce turnover intention, suggesting that other factors such as workload, job stress, and organizational support may play a more influential role [5,7,8,9]. The lack of significance in both bivariate and multivariate analyses may also reflect unmeasured contextual variables, including organizational climate, leadership style, and institutional support structures. Demographic factors may also explain the low levels of turnover intention observed. The sample was relatively young (mean age: 36.47 years), predominantly composed of Saudi nationals (87%), and more than half reported a monthly income exceeding 15,000 SAR. These factors have been previously associated with increased job stability and reduced turnover intention [7,29,30]. Despite the availability of professional development resources, cultural norms emphasizing stability in government employment and loyalty to public healthcare institutions may buffer turnover intention regardless of educational attitudes [7,9]. Additionally, organizational or technological readiness such as insufficient integration of web-based learning into performance systems or limited institutional incentives for online participation could weaken the perceived impact of digital learning on career decisions [5,8]. These combined factors may have outweighed the influence of web-based learning attitudes in this context. While educational interventions remain valuable, they may not be sufficient on their own to improve nurse retention. Future research should explore mediating and moderating variables to clarify how web-based learning fits within the broader dynamics of nurse turnover.

In contrast, job satisfaction was significantly associated with anticipated turnover, with higher satisfaction linked to greater retention, which was consistent with previous research [31]. Additionally, marital status and job position significantly predicted turnover intention: married nurses were more likely to express intent to leave, while those in managerial positions (e.g., head nurses, nursing supervisors) were less likely to do so compared to staff nurses. These findings suggest that improving job satisfaction—particularly among married nurses and staff nurses—may help reduce turnover. Strategies such as flexible scheduling, work–life balance programs, and targeted support could enhance satisfaction and promote retention.

Although attitudes toward web-based learning were significantly associated with clinical performance, they were not significantly related to turnover intention. This contrast may reflect differences in how web-based learning impacts immediate versus long-term professional outcomes. While clinical performance is more directly influenced by skills, knowledge acquisition, and application (areas where web-based learning offers direct support), turnover intention is shaped by broader structural and emotional factors, such as institutional culture, leadership, and work–life balance [7,9,30]. These factors may overshadow the influence of continuing education attitudes, particularly in contexts where cultural norms emphasize employment stability [7] or where organizational incentives for retention are minimal [5,8].

Although web-based learning was found to enhance clinical performance, other contextual factors, such as organizational support, digital infrastructure, prior e-learning experience, and workplace mentorship, may also influence the outcomes examined in this study [3,8]. These factors could act as mediating variables that shape the strength or direction of the observed relationships. For example, while a positive association was observed between attitudes toward web-based learning and job satisfaction in the bivariate analysis, this relationship did not remain statistically significant in the multivariate model. Such results suggest that unmeasured contextual factors may moderate or mediate the impact of attitudes on professional outcomes. Future research should investigate these variables to better understand the mechanisms through which attitudes toward web-based learning translate into changes in satisfaction, performance, and retention.

This study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional design captures associations at a single point in time, limiting the ability to make causal inferences or assess the long-term effects of web-based learning on clinical performance and turnover intention. Second, although the study aimed to include nurses from various healthcare sectors, most participants (n= 153, 86.4%) were employed in MOH facilities, which may skew the findings toward experiences more typical of governmental institutions and limit their applicability to nurses working in other sectors, such as private or military hospitals, where workplace structures, expectations, and support systems may differ. Third, although nurses from all five regions of Saudi Arabia were included, the sample was disproportionately represented by participants from the southern region (n= 76, 42.9%). This regional imbalance may limit the generalizability of the findings, as nurses’ experiences, healthcare challenges, and organizational environments may differ across regions. The results may not fully reflect the perspectives of nurses in underrepresented areas, such as the central or eastern regions, which may have distinct cultural, institutional, and workforce characteristics. Additionally, the use of convenience sampling, combined with the concentration of participants from the southern region and MOH sector, introduces the potential for selection bias. Certain types of nurses may have been more likely to participate (e.g., those with access to online surveys or institutional encouragement), which could affect the representativeness of the sample and the validity of inferences drawn from the results. Fourth, data collection relied on self-reported questionnaires rather than observational methods, potentially introducing response bias and affecting the objectivity and accuracy of the data. Fifth, the use of English-only instruments may have limited participation from nurses more comfortable with Arabic, which can reduce the depth of information collected. This may have affected the diversity of the sample and made it harder for some participants to fully express their views. It may also have influenced how certain questions were understood or interpreted, potentially introducing measurement bias and affecting the accuracy of self-reported attitudes or outcomes. Future studies should consider using tools available in both English and Arabic to better capture a wider range of perspectives and improve the interpretability and generalizability of the findings. Finally, the relatively small sample size may further limit the generalizability of the results to the broader nursing population.

The findings of this study highlight the value of web-based learning as a flexible, accessible, and cost-effective approach to professional development for registered nurses. Positive attitudes toward web-based learning were significantly associated with improved clinical performance and increased job satisfaction. These findings highlight the growing importance of digital learning in modern healthcare education and suggest that integrating web-based training models may enhance clinical competency across diverse nursing environments. Future studies should explore the long-term impact of web-based learning on nurse retention and examine additional workplace factors that may influence job satisfaction and turnover. This includes investigating organizational variables, such as leadership support, workload, and institutional climate, that may mediate or moderate these relationships. A longitudinal design with a more diverse nursing sample and broader workplace variables could strengthen the generalizability and applicability of future findings.
