Myroides odoratimimus(M. odoratimimus) is a rare, multidrug-resistant bacterium that occasionally causes opportunistic infections in the environment. We report the first documented case of acute prostatitis caused byM. odoratimimusin a 95-year-old man following transurethral water vapor energy therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient developed fever and prostatic tenderness postoperatively, with CT findings consistent with prostatitis. The initial empirical treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was ineffective. Urine culture revealed a multidrug-resistant bacterium susceptible only to minocycline, which was identified asM. odoratimimusby matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA sequencing. Treatment with minocycline led to clinical improvement. This case underscores the importance of considering rare pathogens in patients with indwelling catheters or postoperative infections, particularly when standard antimicrobial therapies prove ineffective. Accurate microbiological diagnosis and appropriate treatment based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential in managing such infections.

Acute prostatitis is an inflammatory condition of the prostate gland, commonly caused by Gram-negative bacteria, most frequentlyEscherichia coli. Indwelling urinary catheters, transurethral surgical procedures including water vapor energy therapy (WAVE), and instrumentation are recognized risk factors for the development of acute prostatitis. While typically responsive to antibiotic therapy, it can lead to severe complications if untreated or inadequately treated.

Infections caused by uncommon or rare organisms are of particular clinical interest, especially when they present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.Myroidesspecies are Gram-negative, non-fermenting bacilli commonly found in environmental sources such as water and soil [1]. Historically considered low-virulence opportunistic pathogens that primarily affect immunocompromised individuals, recent reports have demonstrated thatMyroidesspecies can also cause serious infections in immunocompetent hosts [2,3]. Among these,Myroides odoratimimus(M. odoratimimus) has been implicated in various infections, including urinary tract infections, soft tissue infections, and sepsis [2,4]. A major concern regardingMyroidesinfections is their intrinsic multidrug resistance, which limits therapeutic options [3,5].

We report a case of acute bacterial prostatitis caused byM. odoratimimusfollowing WAVE for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a patient with an indwelling bladder catheter. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of prostatitis attributable toM. odoratimimus. The clinical course and microbiological findings are described in this section.

A 95-year-old Japanese male with a history of hypertension and dementia underwent indwelling urinary catheter placement one month prior due to urinary retention associated with a markedly enlarged prostate (volume: 156 mL). He was referred to our institution for surgical management of BPH and scheduled to undergo transurethral WAVE therapy. Preoperative urinalysis revealed pyuria (WBC 50-99/high-power field) and bacteriuria; therefore, intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ) 4.5 g was administered twice daily for two days before surgery.

On the first postoperative day, the patient developed a fever of 38.8°C. He reported chills and discomfort in the urethral and perineal areas. Physical examination revealed prostatic tenderness on digital rectal examination. There were no respiratory symptoms, abdominal pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, or signs of epididymitis. Laboratory findings (Table1) showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and elevated CRP. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a low-density area within the prostate, likely attributable to the effects of WAVE therapy, along with enhancement of the prostatic parenchyma and periprostatic fat stranding, findings suggestive of prostatic inflammation (Figure1). There was no evidence of infection in other organs.

White blood cells, neutrophils, and C-reactive protein levels were elevated compared to normal values.

Despite continued PIPC/TAZ administration for five days, the fever persisted. At this point during treatment, the urine culture obtained before surgery yielded 103CFU/ml ofChryseobacteriumsp. andCorynebacteriumsp. using the WalkAway system (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), while blood cultures were negative. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Table2) demonstrated multidrug resistance, with susceptibility only to minocycline (MIC <2 μg/mL). Intravenous minocycline (100 mg twice daily for five days) led to resolution of fever and clinical improvement, followed by five additional days of oral minocycline. Inflammatory markers normalized (Figure2), and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 28. Three months post-surgery, he regained spontaneous voiding, and the catheter was removed.

#1 and #2 were identified asChryseobacteriumsp. andCorynebacteriumsp., respectively, using the WalkAway system.

To accurately identify the causative pathogen, preoperative urine specimens were cultured aerobically at 30°C on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), producing gray-colored colonies (Figure3). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (MALDI Biotyper, MBT Compass Library Ver. 8; Bruker Daltonics, Japan) identified the isolate asM. odoratimimuswith a confidence score >2.0. No other bacteria were detected. 16S rRNA gene sequencing (primers: 27F and 1494R) confirmed a 100% sequence identity withM. odoratimimus, thereby establishing the definitive diagnosis.

Although urinary tract infections caused byM. odoratimimushave been reported [4,6,7], no prior cases have explicitly documented genital tract infections, such as prostatitis or epididymitis. The present case represents the first report implicatingM. odoratimimusin acute prostatitis.

Although bacterial isolation from prostatic tissue was not feasible, several lines of evidence strongly support the diagnosis of prostatitis caused byM. odoratimimus: (1) the urine culture performed before fever onset revealed onlyM. odoratimimusand the infection responded only to minocycline, which was the sole effective agent identified in susceptibility testing; (2) fever developed immediately after transurethral prostate surgery, likely facilitating bacterial entry into the prostate; (3) digital rectal examination revealed prostatic tenderness, a hallmark of acute bacterial prostatitis; and (4) CT findings were consistent with prostatitis, though postoperative changes could not be entirely excluded.

Furthermore, the possibility thatM. odontimimuswas detected in the urine represented colonization or contamination, which is unlikely, based on the following considerations.M. odoratimimushas been reported as a causative agent of urinary tract infections. To date, no cases of colonization of the urinary tract or prostate byMyroidesspecies have been documented. In our case,M. odoratimimuswas isolated as the sole organism at 10⁵ CFU/mL from an aseptically collected catheterized urine sample, and the clinical course matched the antimicrobial susceptibility profile. These observations provide strong evidence thatM. odontimimusacted as a true pathogen rather than representing colonization or contamination.

WhileM. odoratimimusis generally considered a low-virulence organism, advanced age and the presence of an indwelling catheter likely contributed to this patient’s increased susceptibility to infection. Detection ofM. odoratimimusin urine before urogenital surgery may portend a risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative eradication is therefore recommended, especially in immunocompromised patients or those with catheters. However, the bacterium’s multidrug resistance presents a significant challenge. In the case series reported by Ktari [6] and Kutlu et al. [7],M. odoratimimusdemonstrated resistance to all tested antimicrobial agents in every case. In our case, as well as in four cases reported by Khan et al. [4], minocycline was the only agent demonstrating activity. These findings underscore the necessity of early culture and susceptibility testing in managing infections caused by rare, drug-resistant pathogens.

The WalkAway system misidentified the pathogen asChryseobacteriumsp. andCorynebacteriumsp., likely due to overlapping biochemical profiles.M. odoratimimus,Chryseobacteriumsp., and non-fermentingCorynebacteriumsp. share several biochemical characteristics, including oxidase positivity, non-fermentation of glucose, and catalase positivity, complicating differentiation by automated systems. In addition, since the WalkAway system identifies organisms based on database matching, it may fail to accurately identify rare bacterial species. In suspected cases of rare infections, advanced techniques such as MALDI-TOF MS or 16S rRNA sequencing are essential for accurate pathogen identification.

This case illustrates thatM. odoratimimus, although rare, should be considered a potential causative organism of prostatitis, particularly in high-risk patients. Accurate microbiological diagnosis and susceptibility-guided antibiotic therapy are critical for successful management. Clinicians should remain vigilant when encountering unusual clinical presentations or lack of response to empiric therapy and initiate prompt microbiological evaluation to ensure appropriate treatment.
