Rehabilitation following successful ACL reconstruction (ACLR) requires restoring physical strength, neuromuscular function, and psychological readiness. However, the interplay between reactive agility, strength, and psychological confidence across rehabilitation phases remains unclear, particularly when compared to uninjured individuals.

This study investigates the interrelationships between the reactive agility test (RAT), the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), and the anterior cruciate ligament return-to-sport after injury (ACL-RSI) scale across three rehabilitation phases (Phase 4 [P4], return-to-play [RTP]1, and RTP2) following ACLR. The aim was to examine how reactive agility, strength, and psychological readiness evolve over time and compare ACLR participants to a healthy control group.

Fifteen ACLR participants (15–27 years old) and thirty healthy controls (18– 30 years old) completed RAT, isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP), and ACL-RSI assessments. ACLR participants were assessed at three rehabilitation phases (P4, RTP1, and RTP2), while controls completed a single testing session. Repeated measures analyses were used to track mean changes in performance across rehabilitation phases, and between-group comparisons were conducted using independent samples tests.

ACL-RSI scores improved significantly across phases (p = 0.001), exceeding the smallest worthwhile change (SWC), indicating progressive psychological recovery. Reactive agility improved, with faster left-side decision-making (split 2) from P4 to RTP1 (p = 0.037), while right-side agility remained stable but met the SWC threshold (1.1%). Limited between-group differences in total RAT times and sub-phases suggest ACLR participants regained agility comparable to controls. IMTP strength plateaued after RTP1, reinforcing the greater role of agility and cognitive factors within the RTP framework.

Reactive agility and psychological confidence progressively improved post-ACLR, with decision-making speed recovering earlier than acceleration ability. Minimal between-group differences suggest rehabilitation effectively restores agility, but directional asymmetries and plateaued strength warrant targeted interventions. Future research should explore neurocognitive training to optimize RTP outcomes and minimize re-injury risk.

The primary purpose of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is to restore knee stability and function following ACL rupture [1]. While surgical reconstruction is often successful, return-to-sport (RTS) and long-term knee health (e.g., preservation of joint function, reduction of osteoarthritis risk, and sustainable return to high-level activities) remain significant challenges [2]. Current rehabilitation protocols primarily emphasise biomechanical recovery (i.e., restoration of joint kinematics and kinetics) and neuromuscular recovery (i.e., re-establishing muscle strength symmetry, motor control, and movement coordination), yet high reinjury rates and suboptimal performance outcomes suggest that traditional assessment methods may not comprehensively capture the multifaceted nature of post-ACL rehabilitation [3].

Isometric strength assessments, particularly of the quadriceps, have been widely used to gauge neuromuscular recovery [4,5]. Within recent years the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) has emerged as a valid and reliable assessment of whole-body strength that may provide insights into neuromuscular function that extends beyond isolated muscle groups [6]. In contrast to traditional single-joint assessments, the IMTP offers an integrated approach to strength assessment, especially of the posterior chain and lower limb musculature, that may be more relevant to the rehabilitation processes given the multi-planar demands of sport-specific movements [7]. Quadriceps weakness post ACLR is well-documented and strongly associated with impaired knee function and reinjury risk [8–11]. However, isometric strength alone may not fully predict dynamic athletic performance given that RTS demands tend to extend beyond static force production to explosive movements, direction changes, and cognitive-motor integration [12,13]. As such, reactive agility, which encompasses rapid decision-making and movement execution in response to external stimuli, remains an underexplored component within ACL rehabilitation [14]. Traditional agility tests often lack the cognitive and perceptual demands encountered in real-world sports scenarios, limiting their applicability in evaluating true functional readiness and presenting a gap in the current ACL RTS literature [15–17]. The reactive agility test (RAT) therefore presents a possible method by which changes in reactive agility can be measured and monitored during late-stage rehabilitation in ACLR patients.

Psychological readiness is a crucial yet frequently underexplored component of post-ACL rehabilitation [18]. Fear of reinjury, reduced confidence, and altered movement strategies, such as reduced knee flexion angles, increased trunk lean, or shifting load toward the uninjured limb to offload the ACLR limb, can significantly influence movement patterns and neuromuscular control, potentially increasing the risk of secondary injury [19,20]. While various psychological assessment tools exist, their integration into clinical practice is somewhat inconsistent, and their relationship with objective performance metrics remains unclear, especially over multiple rehabilitation phases. The ACL Return-to-Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) questionnaire has been utilized to measure the progression of psychological readiness after ACL injury over time and has been significantly related to return-to-play (RTP) [21,22]. Furthermore, the ACL-RSI has also been found to be a predictor of two-year RTS and is therefore likely useful in the long-term tracking of athletes as they progress through the rehabilitative process [23]. The ACL-RSI at 6 months has been shown to predict return to sport at 2 years [24] which may support its use for long-term tracking. While the individual components of strength, agility, and psychological readiness are discretely recognised within the literature, their dynamic interplay during late stages of rehabilitation and comparisons to healthy controls are poorly understood [19]. An integrated approach may provide a more holistic view of recovery which presents a gap in the current literature [25–27].

Subsequently, with respect to three end-stages of the ACL rehabilitation process, the primary objectives of this study were to: (i) assess changes in the ACL-RSI and IMTP strength scores, (ii) evaluate changes in RAT completion times, average speed, and decision-making ability, and (iii) examine the relationships between ACL-RSI scores, RAT performance, and IMTP strength in ACLR patients.

The research was conducted in a controlled clinical setting within the facilities of the Centre for Health and Human Performance (CHHP) and Physical Activity, Sport, and Recreation (PhASRec) Research Focus Area, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa. The setting provided a standardised environment for performing tests on calibrated dual force plate systems, ensuring consistent data collection and measurement accuracy.

A minimum sample size of 28 participants (i.e., 14 per group) was determined a priori using the following inputs: (i) an anticipated effect size of f = 0.25, (ii) a type-1 error rate of 0.05, (iii) a type-2 error rate of 0.20, (iv) two groups (control vs. ACLR), (v) three repeated measures, and (vi) a correlation of 0.50 among repeated measures. The inclusion criteria for the ACLR group were individuals aged 14–30 who had undergone ACLR and were assessed between 16- and 24 weeks post-operatively. A control group consisting of healthy individuals without a history of ACLR or related injury was matched for age, sex, and activity level such that both groups consisted ofactiveindividuals (e.g., rugby, hockey, netball). Activity levels were based on self-reported engagement in competitive sports (e.g., ≥ 3 sessions/week). Exclusion criteria for both groups consisted of any additional or recent (within the last six months) lower limb surgeries or conditions that could affect strength measurement such as, but not limited to ankle ligament sprain, hip labral injury, hamstring or quadriceps strain.

All adult participants completed an informed consent form prior to data collection and voluntarily enrolled in the research study. For instances where participants were under the age of 18, informed assent was obtained together with informed consent from their parents or legal guardians. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the institution (ethics number: NWU-00335-21-A1) as well as the regional Department of Health.

Assessments of the IMTP were conducted bilaterally on a Hawkin Dynamics force plate system (3rd Generation, model 0486; Westbrook, Maine, USA) with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz. The force plates used show excellent validity (intercept: 0.01 CI 95% [−0.03, 0.05]; slope: 0.98, CI95% [0.93, 1.04] across all parameters of interest [28]. Peak force was normalized to bodyweight (BW), where BW was measured on the force plates for a 1-second interval immediately before the force measurement.

To evaluate the split times during the RAT, a total of four timing gates (Smartspeed, Fusion Sports, Australia) were used which were interfaced with the cell phone Smartspeed application (VALD ltd ACN 603446171) allowing directional randomisation of trials.

A shorter validated version of the ACL-RSI scale was used to measure psychological readiness over time [29]. The shortened version consists of six items and is equally as robust as the full version in predicting RTP outcomes (reliability: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92; validity: receiver operating characteristic [ROC] = 0.75) [29]. The ACL-RSI was completed once at the beginning of each of the three distinct testing sessions Phase 4 (~ 20 weeks post-ACLR), RTP1 (~ 24 weeks), and RTP2 (~ 28 weeks) prior to any physical testing on that day.

The IMTP assessment protocol, as described by Comfort et al. [30]. was used for the present study. Prior to testing, each participant performed a general- and specific warm-up procedure consisting of BW squats and lunges (general) and low-to-moderate load (i.e., 50%, 75%, and 90% of perceived maximal effort) mid-thigh pulls, comprised of 3 × 3-second IMTP trials coupled with 60 s rest in between repetitions.

After the warm-up, participants stepped onto the dual force plate system and adjusted the bar and lifting straps to ensure no slack in the bar, preventing pre-tensioning of the muscles. The participant’s weight was then recorded on the system, during which it was imperative to cue the participant to remain as still as possible. The participant was then informed that the test was about to begin, followed by a 3-second countdown, and was cued to “push their feet into the ground as fast and as hard as possible while gripping the bar” for approximately 5-seconds. Verbal encouragement was given throughout the trial. The IMTP was performed in a position approximating the second pull position of the clean, with the knee angle between 125–145° and the hip angle between 140–150° [30]. To ensure grip strength did not limit maximal force production, a clean grip with lifting straps and hands strapped to the bar was used. Participant grip width was measured and recorded to ensure standardization and repeatability. Foot position (i.e., neutral, inverted, or everted) was also noted, measured, and recorded to ensure repeatability.

After completion of the trial, the participant was cued to remain still on the system until the effort was recorded. A minimum of three successful trials were performed and the ensemble average was retained for analysis. A rest period of 2-minutes was allocated between trials.

The ACL-RSI was completed before testing during phase 4, RTP1 and RTP2 with the overall score being retained for analysis.

The RAT made use of timing gates and flashing lights to produce a visual stimulus to which athletes had to respond [31]. The RAT was conducted during phase four testing and was also used in each RTP phase.

The protocol described by Dawes [32] was used in the present study as follows: a total of four sets of timing gates were utilized with the starting gate positioned on the starting line, and the second set of timing gates placed 5 m from the starting line. The third and fourth gates were positioned at 45° angles to the left and right respectively, also at 5-meter distances from the centre trigger gate (see Fig.1). The choice of direction was randomized, with only the researcher being aware of which gate would be activated during each trial.

Prior to the initiation of a trial, the participant adopted a two- or three-point stance 0.30 m from the starting gate. The participant was cued not to try and anticipate which gate would activate, thereby being better prepared to perform a reactive cutting manoeuvre in either direction. A total of six successful trials were recorded for each participant (three left, three right). Unsuccessful trials were classified when participants clearly anticipated the movement, slipped or fell, were inattentive, or committed a technical error, necessitating a repeat trial. All timing data were recorded to the nearest 0.01 s. Trials were separated by 45-second intervals with the ensemble average being retained for analysis.

All statistical analyses were performed using JASP (version 0.18.1, JASP Team, Netherlands) and R (RStudio, version 2023.06.01, Build 524, Posit Software, PBC). The data were evaluated for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, with a p-value exceeding the alpha-threshold of 0.05 indicating a likely parametric distribution. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant characteristics and performance metrics which are reported as means and standard deviations (SD).

For the first objective to assess the changes in ACL-RSI scores across the different phases, a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted (afexpackage). Sphericity was evaluated using Mauchly’s test, upon which the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied when assumptions of sphericity were violated. Effect sizes were reported as partial omega squared (ωp2) (ggstatsplotpackage). Post hoc analyses incorporated the Holm correction to adjust pairwise contrasts for multiple comparisons (emmeanspackage).

For the second objective, a repeated measures ANOVA was employed to explore differences in the completion time for the RAT for the different components of the RAT across the relevant phases. Sphericity was assessed using Mauchly’s test, with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections applied when violations occurred. Post hoc comparisons were conducted using Holm corrections to control for multiple comparisons. Effect sizes for ANOVAs were calculated using ωp².

Between-group differences were explored using independent t-tests for pairwise comparisons at each phase. The Holm correction was used to adjust the p-value for multiple comparisons. Hedge’s g was employed as the standardised effect size and was qualitatively interpreted as: trivial (< 0.10), very small (0.10–0.19), small (0.20–0.49), medium (0.50–0.79), large (0.80–1.19), and very large (> 1.20) [33].

For the third objective a Spearman’s Rank correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between ACL-RSI scores, RAT performance, and isometric mid-thigh pull normalized to body mass (IMTP/BM) across P4, RTP1 and RTP2. The absolute magnitudes of the correlation coefficients were interpreted as follows: negligible: 0.00-0.10; weak: 0.10–0.29; moderate: 0.40–0.69; strong: 0.70–0.89; very strong: 0.90-1.00 [34]. All results were considered statistically significant at an alpha level less than 0.05.

The participant characteristics from 15 ACLR participants (males/females = 12/3) and 30 controls (males/females = 20/10) are indicated in Table1.

The within-group differences for the ACL-RSI scores across end-stage rehabilitation phases are shown in Fig.2. Although some inter-individual variability is evident, linear improvements of approximately 10 points per phase progression are apparent.

The results for the left and right directional components of the RAT are highlighted in Figs.3,4and5. General left/right within- and between-group differences are evident, with small but meaningful differences being observable. Here, ‘split 1’ represents the time from the start to the first 5-m center gate (reflecting initial acceleration), while ‘split 2’ represents the time from the center gate trigger to the final gate (reflecting decision-making and cutting time). More specifically, the total sprint time of the left directional cut (Fig.3A) yielded statistically significant improvements in the transition from P4 to RPT1, with limited improvements thereafter. This is echoed by the lack of evidence for significant differences between the ACLR and Control groups at each phase. Similar improvements were noted for the decision-making sub-phase of the left directional cut from P4 to RTP2 (Fig.4B). Limited between-group differences were noted such that ACLR and Control group times were statistically similar, generally exhibiting small standardised effect sizes. Similar interpretations hold true for the sub-phase components of the right directional cuts.

Direct comparisons of RAT sprint times to the left versus right are highlighted in Fig.6. It is evident that movements to the right are considerably slower compared to the left which holds true for both the ACLR group across all phases as well as for the control group.

Within- and between-group differences for relative IMTP strength are exhibited in Fig.7. Across the three end-stage rehabilitation phases the overall strength scores were statistically similar to that of the control group, although small-to-moderate standardised effect sizes are present.

Finally, a correlation analysis between ACL-RSI scores, relative IMTP strength, RAT times across all phases revealed moderate-to-strong negative associations between RAT times and IMTP strength. A moderate negative association was also evident for the RAT and ACL-RSI scores in the final RTP phase showing that faster RAT times were associated with higher ACL-RSI scores.

Our research evaluated the utility of various components of reactive agility, relative IMTP strength and psychological readiness in RTP decisions, especially during end stage rehabilitation in those with ACLR.

Our study contributes novel insights into these interrelationships within the sample of ACLR patients evaluated by showing: (i) significant and meaningful improvement in readiness to return to sport, as indicated by ACL-RSI scores across rehabilitation phases, (ii) notable improvements in RAT performance, including total completion times, speed (split 1), and decision-making ability (split 2) across multiple end-stage rehabilitation phases, and (iii) moderate negative correlations between relative isometric strength, ACL-RSI scores and overall RAT performance.

It has previously been established that psychological readiness is critical to RTP post ACLR on the basis that player confidence and athletic ability are tightly coupled [35]. As expected, psychological readiness as measured by the ACL-RSI significantly improved over the various rehabilitation phases in our study from P4 to RTP2 [22]. Our findings align with previous research where pooled ACL-RSI scores have been reported as 61.5 at 3 to 6 months post-ACLR, increasing to 70.7 at two to five years post-ACLR [36]. While our P4 scores were marginally lower than these averages, the scores at RTP2 were comparable to those of patients who have successfully returned to sport, indicating a typical trajectory of psychological recovery. We investigated whether changes in ACL-RSI scores were essentially mediated by changes in actual performance outcomes such as strength and reactive agility. Our findings showed moderate negative correlations between ACL-RSI scores and RAT times for RTP2 (r= −0.64,p= 0.010) implying that higher ACL-RSI scores were associated with faster RAT times, especially during RTP2 [24]. Whether improved confidence drives performance or vice versa remains unclear; the relationship is likely bidirectional. The magnitude of the association between ACL-RSI scores and RAT times progressed over the phases, suggesting that psychological readiness may become more closely tied to reactive agility as participants progress toward RTP. This latter interpretation appears justified on the grounds that ACL-RSI scores are deemed meaningful if a change of ~ 15 points is observed [37]. Our study showed a change in scores from P4 to RTP2 of ~ 19 points (p= 0.001), indicating consequential improvements in confidence during these phases. However, whole-body strength, as assessed by the IMTP, appears to be only weakly associated with ACL-RSI scores (r= 0.26–0.30). This may be explained by the fact that ACL-RSI scores continued to increase over the phases whereas IMTP strength tended to plateau after RTP1. Although the ACL-RSI is widely used, conflicting evidence exists regarding its validity and responsiveness at the individual level, as well as its ability to accurately predict return to sport or future injury risk. For example, Faleide et al. [38] found that cut-off values vary, and that responsiveness may not be adequate for individual monitoring. Moreover, systematic reviews and expert consensus emphasize that psychological readiness scores, such as the ACL-RSI, should be interpreted in conjunction with objective biomechanical and performance data to enhance their clinical utility [36,39]. This may partly explain why ACL-RSI scores in our study continued to increase over time, whereas IMTP strength plateaued after RTP1, indicating a potential disconnect between psychological confidence and measurable strength gains. This is reiterated by the fact that the change in IMTP strength did not exceed the smallest worthwhile change (SWC) (34.41 N/kg) (CV = ~ 8%) across any of the phases nor exceed the difference with the control group (see Fig.7) [40]. SWC refers to the smallest change in a variable that exceeds test variability and has practical significance. Such a result may suggest that rehabilitation programs successfully restore foundational strength by RTP1, after which the focus shifts to more dynamic, sport-specific qualities. Importantly, although the IMTP is an excellent tool for evaluating whole-body maximal strength, capturing force contributions from both the anterior chain (primarily the quadriceps) and the posterior chain (including the gluteals and hamstrings) it also strongly correlates with change-of-direction performance, supporting its relevance to sports requiring multidirectional agility [41]. However, it may also be postulated that it lacks sensitivity for differentiating healthy from ACLR individuals. Therefore, practitioners need to carefully evaluate the role of the IMTP in the RTP assessment battery and further research is required to determine whether a strength ceiling has implications for long-term outcomes or re-injury risk.

It has been proposed that there are a lack of reactive agility assessments on ACLR patients and that pre-planned tests of agility seem to be favoured [42]. Importantly it has also been determined that knee loads are doubled in reactive compared to pre-planned situations which make reactive movements more comparable to the real-life conditions encountered in multi-directional field sports [43]. Additionally, there is also evidence suggesting that reactive agility is compromised following severe knee injury whereby the time to completion of the RAT is substantially increased [44]. Our study addresses the current limitations by investigating the change in RAT completion times over three phases of ACLR rehabilitation. The relationships between the IMTP and agility test performance have previously been investigated in healthy populations but are lacking in the ACLR population [45].

The SWC for the RAT has been reported to be 1.1% (CV = 4%) which translates to ~ 0.04 s for total RAT times in our study [46]. Within our study, the total RAT completion times improved with 2.1–4.3% (depending on phase and direction), suggesting that both agility and cognitive factors become more relevant for RTP (see Fig.3). This is supported by the correlation between total RAT times and ACL-RSI scores that were strongest at RTP2 (r= −0.64,p< 0.01) (see Fig.8).

Reactive agility performance is closely linked to cognitive processing speed, as demonstrated in a study of injury-free collegiate-level basketball players [47]. Research in athletes has shown that reaction and decision-making times significantly influence RAT outcomes, and that these are diminished by injury [47]. In our study, decision-making speed (split 2) significantly improved for left-side cuts from P4 to RTP1 (Mdiff= 0.08s,p= 0.037) (see Fig.4), indicating progressive early-phase cognitive-motor adaptation in reactive agility. Additionally, for cuts to the left regarding split 2, the 1.1% threshold for the SWC was exceeded, indicating true and meaningful improvements in decision-making speed throughout rehabilitation. Clinically, this implies that unpredictable visual and auditory cues should be incorporated into late-stage agility drills (e.g., using reaction lights or coaching commands) which may be beneficial to specifically train the decision-making component of agility rather than relying solely on pre-planned drills [48,49]. Regarding cutting to the right side, no significant within-group improvements for decision-making speed (split 2) were observed, highlighting a potential ‘asymmetry’ in agility recovery. This discrepancy may be attributed to limb dominance and compensatory movement patterns on the basis that similar results were observed for the control group (see Fig.6). More specifically, given that most ACLR participants were right-leg dominant, the persistence of faster movements to the left (i.e., the right leg is typically used to cut to the left) suggests that rehabilitation programs may need to incorporate targeted drills to account for limb dominance in addition to ACLR-related deficits. While no statistically or clinically significant improvements were observed in split 2 for right-side cuts, the 1.1% threshold for the SWC was still surpassed, suggesting small but potentially meaningful refinements in decision-making speed. Similarly, no statistically significant changes were found in left split 1 times across phases; however, a SWC was attained in split 1 for right-side cuts. Given that split 1 primarily reflects straight-line acceleration rather than directional changes, this result suggests meaningful incremental performance improvements that reflect the improvements in confidence as indicated by the ACL-RSI.

The ultimate goal of ACL rehabilitation is to return athletes to previous levels of performance such that they are essentially indistinguishable from healthy participants [50,51]. The current study showed that limited between-group differences were present for split 1, split 2, and total directional RAT times (all g < 0.50,p> 0.05; see Figs.3,4and5) suggesting that ACLR participants successfully regained reactive agility performances that were comparable to healthy controls. However, similar performance times may mask underlying biomechanical asymmetries. As noted by King et al. [52], restored function does not necessarily imply restored movement quality. This underscores the need to interpret functional outcomes in conjunction with biomechanical assessments. The observed performance parity may be attributed to effective rehabilitation programs restoring change of direction capabilities (e.g., strength, neuromuscular coordination, balance and proprioception, motor planning and technique) as well as enhanced confidence to optimally load the musculoskeletal structures involved in both sprinting and change-of-direction tasks [53–55]. Additionally, the inherent left-right asymmetries in overall RAT times were observed in both groups (see Fig.6), indicating that directional differences are likely driven by limb dominance rather than injury status, further explaining the lack of statistically significant between-group differences. Similarly, only limited differences were present in IMTP strength between groups, indicating that the ACLR group would be practically indistinguishable from the control group towards the end of the ACLR rehabilitation process.

The present study exhibited some limitations that should be acknowledged. Although we exceeded the required priori sample size for adequate statistical power, the sample size was relatively small which may limit the generalisability and the ability to detect small between-group differences. Second, this study relied on healthy controls (and/or the uninvolved limb) as a comparator instead of true pre-injury baseline measurements for the ACLR athletes. The absence of pre-injury data makes it difficult to know if the reconstructed limbs fully returned to their prior level, since using contralateral or normative data as a proxy has inherent uncertainty​ [56]. Third, the cohort represented team sport athletes which may limit the generalizability of the findings to athletes at different levels of play. Only one adolescent athlete was part of the ACLR cohort in the present study, but it is acknowledged that adolescent athletes may differ biomechanically and psychologically from adults. It is important however to mention that the performances of the adolescent athlete were on par with adult performances likely due to the competitive sporting background of the individual. Our sample was predominantly male, which may limit applicability to females, who often demonstrate different neuromuscular and biomechanical recovery patterns post-ACLR. For instance, sex-specific muscle activation timing during gait has been observed post-ACLR [57], and females have shown greater multiplanar knee joint loading during change-of-direction manoeuvres [58], suggesting important sex-based differences in movement mechanics. It is important to remember however that the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen tests to track and monitor changes across time and that the characteristics of the ACLR group were largely matched in the control group. Finally, we did not account for certain biomechanical factors that could potentially influence outcomes such as individual differences in movement technique (e.g. limb positioning or trunk control during COD tasks) as this would have required an approach incorporating 3-dimensional motion analysis.

This study highlights the progressive recovery of psychological readiness, reactive agility, and isometric strength following ACLR. While ACLR participants achieved agility performance comparable to controls, limb dominance and inherent asymmetries should be considered when interpreting reactive agility outcomes. Additionally, the plateau in whole-body strength suggests that speed and agility may play a greater role in athlete confidence during RTP. Future research should investigate the role of interventions targeting processing speed, visual scanning, and divided attention given their theoretical links to the observed decision-making components (i.e., split 2) of the RAT.

We would like to thank all the participants for their tireless efforts and contribution towards this study. We would also wholeheartedly like to thank the CHHP and PhASRec for making their equipment and facilities available for testing.
