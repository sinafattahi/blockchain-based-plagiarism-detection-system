To investigate the correlation between corneal nerve and meibomian gland morphological changes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and to provide an objective basis for early detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

A total of 150 subjects were enrolled, including 130 T2DM patients and 20 healthy controls. T2DM patients were divided into two groups based on HbA1c levels: well-controlled group (HbA1c < 7.0%,n= 65) and poorly-controlled group (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%,n= 65). All subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for corneal nerve analysis and infrared meibography for meibomian gland evaluation. Disease duration, medication history, and microvascular complications were recorded for all diabetic patients. Age-related meibomian gland changes were controlled by age-matching between groups. Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), and meibomian gland parameters were measured and compared among groups. Correlation analysis was performed between HbA1c levels and ocular surface parameters.

Compared with the healthy control group, T2DM patients showed significantly reduced CNFD, CNBD, CNFL, and increased meibomian gland dropout (allP< 0.05). These parameters were significantly worse in the poorly-controlled group compared to the well-controlled group (allP< 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that HbA1c levels were independently associated with corneal nerve parameters (CNFD: β = -0.462,P< 0.001; CNBD: β = -0.437,P< 0.001; CNFL: β = -0.443,P< 0.001) and meibomian gland dropout (β = 0.389,P< 0.001) after adjusting for age, disease duration, medication types, and presence of microvascular complications.

Corneal nerve fiber and meibomian gland morphology are significantly correlated with HbA1c levels in T2DM patients. These ocular surface changes may serve as early, non-invasive biomarkers for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and could potentially be incorporated into routine diabetic follow-up examinations. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish the causality and evaluate the clinical significance of these findings for individualized ocular surface management in diabetic patients.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, which affects multiple organ systems through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The global prevalence of diabetes has been steadily increasing, with the International Diabetes Federation estimating that 537 million adults were living with diabetes in 2021, a number projected to rise to 783 million by 2045 [1]. Among its numerous complications, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects approximately 50% of patients with long-standing diabetes and significantly impairs quality of life [2,3].

The cornea is one of the most densely innervated tissues in the human body, containing small-fiber C-type sensory nerves similar to those found in peripheral tissues affected by diabetic neuropathy. Recent advances in in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) have enabled non-invasive assessment of corneal nerve morphology, offering a potential window into systemic neuropathic processes [4]. Several studies have demonstrated that changes in corneal nerve parameters precede clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy and correlate with its severity, suggesting that corneal nerve assessment could serve as an early biomarker for DPN [5].

Concurrently, the meibomian glands, which are sebaceous glands embedded within the tarsal plates of the eyelids, play a crucial role in maintaining tear film stability by secreting meibum into the tear film lipid layer. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) has been reported to be more prevalent in diabetic patients compared to healthy individuals. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association may involve impaired meibocyte differentiation and function due to hyperglycemia, increased oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation [6].

While previous studies have separately examined corneal nerve changes and meibomian gland alterations in diabetes, comprehensive investigations integrating both parameters and their relationship with glycemic control are limited. Understanding these relationships is essential for several reasons: (1) both structures may reflect the systemic impact of hyperglycemia on specialized tissues, (2) their alterations may contribute to the higher prevalence of dry eye disease observed in diabetic patients, and (3) they could potentially serve as non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring diabetic complications and therapeutic efficacy.

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a well-established marker for long-term glycemic control in diabetic patients, reflecting average blood glucose levels over the preceding 2–3 months. The American Diabetes Association recommends maintaining HbA1c below 7.0% for most adults with diabetes to reduce the risk of microvascular complications. However, the relationship between HbA1c levels and ocular surface parameters, particularly corneal nerve morphology and meibomian gland structure, remains incompletely understood.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the correlation between corneal nerve and meibomian gland morphological changes and HbA1c levels in T2DM patients. By examining these relationships while controlling for potential confounding factors such as disease duration, medication history, and microvascular complications, we aim to elucidate the impact of glycemic control on ocular surface structures and explore their potential as early indicators of diabetic complications. Our findings may contribute to the development of improved screening protocols and personalized management strategies for ocular surface disorders in diabetic patients.

This cross-sectional study was conducted at Hebei General Hospital from January 2023 to December 2023. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hebei Provincial People's Hospital (Approval No. K-2024–2522) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.

A total of 150 subjects were recruited, including 130 patients with T2DM and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Sample size was calculated based on previous studies with similar designs, aiming to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 for detecting a correlation coefficient of 0.3 between HbA1c and corneal nerve parameters.

The inclusion criteria for T2DM patients were: (1) age ≥ 18 years; (2) diagnosed with T2DM according to the American Diabetes Association criteria; and (3) willing and able to comply with the study procedures. The exclusion criteria were: (1) history of ocular surgery or trauma; (2) contact lens wear within the past month; (3) active ocular infection or inflammation; (4) use of topical medications (except artificial tears); (5) systemic conditions other than diabetes that could affect the ocular surface (e.g., autoimmune diseases); and (6) pregnancy or lactation.

The T2DM patients were stratified into two groups based on their HbA1c levels, following the American Diabetes Association guidelines: well-controlled group (HbA1c < 7.0%,n= 65) and poorly-controlled group (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%,n= 65). This stratification was chosen to reflect clinically relevant glycemic control targets associated with reduced risk of microvascular complications.

Healthy controls were recruited from individuals undergoing routine physical examinations with no history of diabetes, normal fasting blood glucose levels, and meeting the same exclusion criteria as the T2DM patients.

All participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure measurement. For T2DM patients, detailed information regarding disease duration, current medication regimens (oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, or combination therapy), and the presence of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy) was recorded. Diabetic retinopathy was assessed through dilated fundus examination and graded according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. Diabetic nephropathy was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g or estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Diabetic neuropathy was assessed using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument.

Blood samples were collected from all participants after overnight fasting for the measurement of HbA1c levels using high-performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad D-10 Hemoglobin Testing System, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

Corneal nerve morphology was evaluated using in vivo confocal microscopy (Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph 3 with Rostock Corneal Module, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). After the application of topical anesthetic (0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride), the central cornea was examined. At least three high-quality images of the sub-basal nerve plexus were selected for analysis using automated CCMetrics software (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK) [7].

The following parameters were quantified: (1) corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), defined as the number of main nerve fibers per square millimeter; (2) corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), defined as the number of branch points per square millimeter; and (3) corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), defined as the total length of all nerve fibers and branches per square millimeter. The mean values of these parameters from the three selected images were used for statistical analysis (Figs.1,2,3,4,5,6,7and8).

Meibomian gland morphology was assessed using non-contact infrared meibography (Keratograph 5 M, OCULUS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Upper and lower eyelids were everted, and high-quality images were captured. Meibomian gland dropout was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) by calculating the percentage of meibomian gland loss area relative to the total tarsal area. The mean value of upper and lower eyelid meibomian gland dropout was used for statistical analysis.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation, while non-normally distributed variables were presented as median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (percentages).

For comparisons among the three groups (healthy control, well-controlled, and poorly-controlled), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post-hoc test or Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc test was used, as appropriate. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables.

Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationships between HbA1c levels and ocular surface parameters. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the independent association between HbA1c and ocular surface parameters after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including age, disease duration, medication types, and the presence of microvascular complications. Standardized regression coefficients (β) were reported to indicate the strength and direction of associations.

Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Power analysis was performed using G*Power 3.1 to ensure adequate statistical power for the detected associations.

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation or numbers (percentages). BMI, body mass index; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; N/A, not applicable.

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Table1. There were no significant differences in age and gender distribution among the three groups. The BMI was significantly higher in both T2DM groups compared to the healthy control group. Within the T2DM groups, patients with poor glycemic control had significantly longer disease duration, higher prevalence of microvascular complications, and were more likely to be on insulin therapy or combination therapy compared to those with good glycemic control.

As shown in Table2, all corneal nerve parameters (CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL) were significantly reduced in T2DM patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, patients with poor glycemic control exhibited significantly worse corneal nerve parameters compared to those with good glycemic control. The reduction in corneal nerve parameters followed a stepwise pattern from healthy controls to well-controlled T2DM to poorly-controlled T2DM patients, suggesting a potential dose-dependent effect of hyperglycemia on corneal nerve damage (Table3).

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation. *P< 0.05 compared with healthy control group (Bonferroni post-hoc test). †P< 0.05 compared with well-controlled T2DM group (Bonferroni post-hoc test).

In our study, we analyzed the morphological changes of corneal nerves and meibomian glands in T2DM patients. The results showed that compared to healthy controls, T2DM patients had significantly reduced CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL (see Table4). Similarly, meibomian gland dropout was significantly increased in T2DM patients compared to healthy controls, with the poorly—controlled group showing the most severe meibomian gland loss (Table4). This pattern parallels the changes observed in corneal nerve parameters, suggesting that both structures may be affected by similar pathophysiological mechanisms related to chronic hyperglycemia.

The relationships between HbA1c levels and ocular surface parameters in T2DM patients are presented in Table5. All correlations were statistically significant, indicating strong associations between glycemic control and ocular surface health.

Significant correlations were observed between HbA1c levels and all ocular surface parameters in T2DM patients. HbA1c exhibited strong negative correlations with CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL, and a strong positive correlation with meibomian gland dropout. These correlations remained significant when analyzed separately within the well-controlled and poorly-controlled groups (data not shown), indicating that the associations exist across the spectrum of glycemic control.

To evaluate the independent effects of various factors on ocular surface parameters, we performed multiple linear regression analysis. The results, summarized in a single comprehensive table, demonstrate that HbA1c remains the strongest predictor even after adjusting for confounding variables.

After adjusting for age, disease duration, insulin use, and the presence of retinopathy, HbA1c levels remained significantly associated with all corneal nerve parameters and meibomian gland dropout. The standardized regression coefficients indicate that HbA1c had the strongest impact on these parameters compared to other variables, supporting the hypothesis that glycemic control plays a crucial role in the development of ocular surface alterations in diabetic patients.

Interestingly, disease duration and the presence of retinopathy also showed significant independent associations with ocular surface parameters, suggesting that both the duration and severity of diabetes contribute to these changes. Age was significantly associated with meibomian gland dropout, consistent with the known age-related changes in meibomian gland morphology, but had less impact on corneal nerve parameters in this cohort.

This study investigated the relationship between corneal nerve and meibomian gland morphological changes and glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Our findings demonstrate significant alterations in both corneal nerve parameters and meibomian gland structure in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls, with the severity of these changes correlating with HbA1c levels. Moreover, multiple regression analysis revealed that HbA1c remains independently associated with these ocular surface parameters after adjusting for potential confounding factors, highlighting the importance of glycemic control in maintaining ocular surface health.

The reduction in corneal nerve parameters (CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL) observed in our diabetic cohort is consistent with previous studies reporting corneal nerve damage in diabetes. Ziegler et al. demonstrated that corneal nerve fiber loss occurs early in the course of diabetes and precedes the clinical diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. Similarly, Petropoulos et al. reported a correlation between corneal nerve abnormalities and the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Our findings extend these observations by establishing a direct link between HbA1c levels and corneal nerve parameters, suggesting that poor glycemic control exacerbates corneal nerve damage.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying diabetes-related corneal nerve damage are likely multifactorial [8]. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to increased oxidative stress, polyol pathway activation, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in neural tissues. These pathways converge to cause mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and ultimately neuronal damage. Additionally, microvascular changes in diabetes may compromise the perfusion of tissues supporting corneal innervation. Our finding that retinopathy was independently associated with corneal nerve parameters supports the concept that microvascular and neuropathic complications may share common pathogenic mechanisms [9–12].

Similarly,the increased meibomian gland dropout observed in diabetic patients, particularly those with poor glycemic control, aligns with emerging evidence on the impact of diabetes on the ocular surface. Meibomian glands are specialized sebaceous glands that secrete lipids essential for tear film stability. The pathogenesis of meibomian gland dysfunction in diabetes likely involves hyperglycemia-induced alterations in meibocyte differentiation, increased inflammation, and impaired lipid synthesis. AGEs accumulation may also contribute to structural changes in the meibomian glands, as has been demonstrated in other tissues affected by diabetes [13].

The strong correlation between HbA1c levels and both corneal nerve and meibomian gland parameters suggests that these structures may serve as windows to systemic diabetic complications. In particular, the ease of non-invasive assessment of corneal nerves using IVCM makes this approach potentially valuable for early detection and monitoring of diabetic neuropathy. Several studies have proposed corneal nerve parameters as surrogate biomarkers for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, with the advantage of being more sensitive to early changes and therapeutic interventions compared to conventional neuropathy assessments [14–16].

Our regression analysis revealed that while HbA1c had the strongest impact on ocular surface parameters, other factors such as disease duration and the presence of retinopathy also contributed significantly. This multifactorial influence is consistent with the complex pathophysiology of diabetic complications and underscores the importance of comprehensive risk factor management. Age showed a stronger association with meibomian gland dropout than with corneal nerve parameters, possibly reflecting the natural age-related atrophy of meibomian glands that may be accelerated by diabetes [17–20].

The clinical implications of our findings are several-fold. First, they suggest that optimization of glycemic control may help preserve ocular surface integrity in diabetic patients. Second, the assessment of corneal nerve and meibomian gland morphology could be incorporated into routine screening for diabetic complications, potentially allowing earlier intervention. Third, these parameters might serve as objective markers for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions targeting diabetic complications.

A notable strength of our study is the inclusion of a multiple regression analysis that controlled for potential confounding factors, providing more robust evidence for the independent association between HbA1c and ocular surface parameters. Additionally, the use of standardized, automated methods for quantifying corneal nerve and meibomian gland parameters enhanced the reliability of our measurements.

However, several limitations should be acknowledged. The cross-sectional design prevents the establishment of causal relationships and temporal sequences. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether improvements in glycemic control lead to corresponding changes in corneal nerve and meibomian gland parameters. Furthermore, while we adjusted for several potential confounders, other factors such as concurrent medications, lifestyle variables, and genetic predisposition might influence the observed associations. The relatively small sample size of the healthy control group compared to the diabetic groups is another limitation, although our power analysis indicated sufficient statistical power for the detected associations.

Future research directions include longitudinal studies to track the evolution of ocular surface changes with varying levels of glycemic control, investigation of the impact of specific diabetes medications on ocular surface parameters, and exploration of potential therapeutic interventions targeting the mechanisms of diabetes-related ocular surface damage. Additionally, studies incorporating functional assessments alongside morphological evaluations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of these changes.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that corneal nerve and meibomian gland morphological changes are significantly correlated with HbA1c levels in T2DM patients, independent of other potential confounding factors. These findings highlight the importance of glycemic control in preserving ocular surface integrity and suggest that assessment of these parameters may serve as valuable tools for early detection and monitoring of diabetic complications. Further research is warranted to establish their utility in clinical practice and to develop targeted interventions for preventing and managing ocular surface disorders in diabetic patients.
