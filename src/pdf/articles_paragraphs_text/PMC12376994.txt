The mechanistic pathway of the (3 + 2) cycloaddition (32CA) between azomethine ylide 1 and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate 2, affording 4-isoxazoline derivatives, was elucidatedviaDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations employing the B3LYP-D3 functional and the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set in 1,4-dioxane. Reactivity insights derived from Conceptual DFT (CDFT) demonstrated that compound 1 behaves as an ambiphilic species with significant nucleophilic and electrophilic tendencies, whereas compound 2 functions predominantly as an electrophile. These electronic features reveal a marked polarity in the cycloaddition and align with a forward electron density flux (FEDF) governing the reaction process. Natural Population Analysis (NPA) and Parr functions identified the C3 carbon of 1 as the most nucleophilic center and the C4/C5 carbons of 2 as the most electrophilic, suggesting initial C3–C4 bond formation. Thermodynamic analysis showed theendocycloadduct to be more stable, while kinetic data favored theexopathway, suggesting a kinetically controlled mechanism that ultimately leads to thermodynamically preferredendo-selectivity. The geometries of the transition states revealed asynchronous bond formation, with theexopathway exhibiting a higher degree of asynchronicity. Global Electron Density Transfer (GEDT) values confirmed the moderately to distinctly polar nature of the pathways. Finally, detailed Electronic Localization Function (ELF) topological analysis and Bonding Evolution Theory (BET) elucidated the asynchronous, multistage mechanism involving six structural stability domains (SSDs), characterizing the formation of new bonds through a sequence of topological catastrophes. Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) analysis provided visual and quantitative evidence of attractive and repulsive intermolecular forces influencing the TS geometries.

DFT at the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level reveals a polar, asynchronous, multistage 32CA mechanism between azomethine ylide and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate, with kinetic preference for formation of theexocycloadduct.

The (3 + 2) cycloaddition (32CA) reaction stands as a pivotal and highly adaptable methodology for the construction of five-membered heterocycles. Its significance stems from its inherent convergent reactivity and extensive applicability across diverse synthetic scenarios.1–7Fundamentally, this reaction centers on the covalent integration of structurally diverse three atom components (TACs) such as azides, nitrones, carbonyl ylides, nitrile oxides, nitrile imines, and azomethine ylides into unsaturated substrates bearing double or triple bonds. Such 32CAs represent a powerful synthetic route for constructing intricate heterocyclic compounds and exploring reactivity pathways.8–15Azomethine ylides, which possess four delocalized electrons over the C–N–C framework, represent a particularly significant class of TAC. Among various dipoles, azomethine ylides have garnered notable attention due to their synthetic utility, prompting ongoing efforts to develop novel ylide precursors and 2-pi-electron components (2pC).6,16,17These ylides are broadly categorized as either non-stabilized (R1–R5= H or alkyl) or stabilized forms, with stabilization achievedviaelectron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents at terminal positions.17Owing to their high reactivity and transient nature, azomethine ylides are typically generatedin situ, although select stabilized derivatives have been successfully isolated and characterized.18–20The most extensively studied (3 + 2) cycloadditions involving azomethine ylides are those with electron-deficient alkenyl or alkynyl 2-pi-electron component (2pC), affording pyrrolidine derivatives with potential biological activity.21–25The 32CA reactions of stable azomethine ylides with a variety of 2-pi-electron component (2pC) have been extensively studied. Notably, a detailed experimental and kinetic investigation demonstrated that these reactions generally proceedviaconcerted mechanisms, primarily governed by LUMO(ylide)–HOMO(2pC) interactions, with minimal solvent influence on the reaction rate.26These findings support the polar and synchronous nature of such cycloadditions and serve as an important experimental benchmark. More recently, theoretical studies based on density functional theory (DFT) and Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT) have further clarified the electronic and mechanistic aspects of these reactions.27These investigations revealed that cyclic azomethine ylides exhibit ambiphilic character and react through asynchronous, one-step polar mechanisms, with activation enthalpies in good agreement with experimental results. Building upon these experimental and theoretical insights, we examined the 32CA reaction between azomethine ylide 1 and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate 2, which leads to the formation of the propargylN-diazabenzpyrrolidine analog 3, as depicted inScheme 1.

TheDσ(r) andDσ0(r) quantities are measures of the electronic localization for ordinary and homogeneous gases, respectively.

whereρσ(r) is defined as the electron density for a givenσspin |∇ρσ|2and is the kinetic energy.

Bonding Evolution Theory (BET), originally conceptualized by Silvi and Krokidis,64provides a powerful theoretical framework that blends Thom's Catastrophe Theory with quantum chemical principles to elucidate the dynamic evolution of electron density during chemical reactions particularly in regions involving lone-pair-bearing atoms. By tracking the progression of electron localization, BET offers mechanistic insights into bond formation and cleavage events that are often difficult to resolve using conventional approaches.65–72Given that electron density distribution is intimately tied to molecular structure, this evolution is effectively analyzed within the broader context of MEDT.73–78Within BET, chemical transformations are described as sequences of Structural Stability Domains (SSDs), which are topologically invariant regions along the intrinsic reaction coordinate characterized by a fixed number and type of atomic basins. Transitions between SSDs marked by the appearance or disappearance of atomic basins capture the asynchronous, multistage character of processes such as the 32CA reaction. BET fundamentally differentiates between two types of atomic basins: disynaptic basins, V(A,B), which indicate covalent interactions characterized by shared electron density between atoms A and B, and monosynaptic basins, which correspond to regions of localized lone-pair electron density associated with a single atom. Early applications of this approach to the 32CA reaction between 1 and 2 have focused on the formation of key disynaptic interactions, notably the C3–C4 and C5–O1 single bonds. Overall, BET presents a quantifiable and topologically detailed perspective on the electronic structure rearrangements that underpin chemical reactivity, making it a valuable complement to conventional electronic structure analyses. The NCI analysis was conducted through single-point energy calculations on the optimized geometries of the TSs. Subsequently, plots illustrating the relationship between the electron density [ρ(r)] and the reduced density gradient (RDG) were generated to visualize and characterize the NCI present within the TSs.s(r) = |∇ρ(r)/2(3π2)1/3ρ(r)4/3| were obtained by using the NCI Plot program.79,80The Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM)81,82was applied to provide comprehensive insight into chemical reactivity. According to the QTAIM, insights into the nature of chemical bonding can be obtained through the analysis of electron density,ρ(r), and its Laplacian, ∇2ρ(r), at bond critical points (BCPs). A value ofρ(r) exceeding 0.20 e bohr−3typically indicates a shared-shell interaction, characteristic of covalent bonds, whereas values below 0.10 e bohr−3suggest closed-shell interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces. In terms of the Laplacian, a negative ∇2ρ(r) reflects electron density accumulation, supporting a covalent nature, while a positive value corresponds to electron density depletion, consistent with noncovalent interactions. Moreover,eqn (4)and(5)describe the calculation of the local kinetic energy density,G(r), and the potential energy density,v(r), derived from the electron density,ρ(r), and its Laplacian, ∇2ρ(r). The combination of these two components, as outlined ineqn (6), yields the total energy density, which serves as a key descriptor in evaluating the electronic environment and bonding characteristics within the QTAIM formalism.

The ratio [−G(r)/v(r)] is another topological tool to specify the nature of interaction. −G(r)/v(r) greater than 1 indicates an interaction stabilized by a local concentration of the charge. Finally, the positiveH(r) illustrates a shared-shell interaction (covalent bond).

The present MEDT-based study is organized into six main sections to provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the 32CA reactions. (i) Initially, ELF topological analysis is employed to examine the ground-state (GS) electronic structures of the reagents 1 and 2. (ii) Subsequently, CDFT descriptors are analyzed to evaluate the polar character and predict the directionality of electronic flux. (iii) The potential energy surface (PES) is then explored along the plausible reaction pathways to identify all stationary points, and to compute the relative enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies of the TSs and products. In this context, the GEDT values at the TSs are calculated to quantify the polar nature of the reactions. (iv) The electronic structure of the located TSs is further investigated through ELF analysis. (v) The reaction mechanisms of the 32CA reactions involving 1 with 2 are elucidated using the BET framework, offering detailed insight into the sequential changes in bonding along the IRC. (vi) Finally, the electronic structure of the located TSs is further investigated through ELF analysis, while QTAIM and NCI analyses are performed to characterize interatomic interactions.

The ELF analysis serves as a powerful and widely adopted tool for exploring the electronic architecture of TACs in (3 + 2) cycloaddition reactions, offering predictive insights into reactivity by correlating topological features with electronic properties.98,99In this study, a comprehensive ELF topological analysis was performed on the isolated reactants to characterize their valence electron distribution and identify the electronic features that govern their reactivity.Fig. 1displays the attractor positions and electron populations of the most relevant valence basins identified through ELF analysis. For TAC 1, the ELF topology reveals two monosynaptic basins, V(C3) and V′(C3), localized on the C3 atom, with a combined electron population of 1.19e. Additionally, two disynaptic basins, V(C1,N2) and V(C3,N2), were identified, accumulating a total of 3.87e. These features are consistent with a carbenoid electronic configuration at the C3 center, accompanied by a C1–N2 double bond and a C3–N2 single bond. The presence of less than 2.0e in the monosynaptic basins associated with C3 strongly supports the classification of TAC 1 as a carbenoid-type TAC, suggesting its participation in a carbenoid-type (cb-type) 32CA mechanism. In contrast, ELF analysis of 2pC 2 reveals two disynaptic basins, V(C4,C5) and V′(C4,C5), with a combined electron population of 4.61e, indicative of a localized C4Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C5 triple bond. This result highlights the π-rich nature of the 2pC, consistent with its expected reactivity in cycloaddition processes (seeFig. 1).

Natural Population Analysis (NPA) was performed to investigate the atomic charge distribution of species 1 and 2, as illustrated inScheme 2.

For 1, the NPA results reveal a marked polarization within the molecular structure: the nitrogen atom (N2) and carbon atom (C3) exhibit significant negative charges of −0.19e and −0.28e, respectively, while the C1 carbon bears a positive charge of +0.13e. This evident charge separation reflects the pronounced electronic asymmetry of 1, consistent with its designation as a carbenoid-type TAC. In contrast, the charge distribution in 2 is comparatively uniform, with C4 and C5 carrying slightly negative charges of-0.04e and −0.01e, respectively. This near-neutral distribution suggests a low degree of polarization across the CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C bond, affirming the presence of a localized, nonpolar triple bond. Collectively, these findings provide important insight into the electronic factors influencing the reactivity and regioselectivity of the 32CA reaction.

Local reactivity indices, including spin and charge density-based Parr functions (Pk−for nucleophilic andPk+for electrophilic sites), offer detailed insights into specific reactive centers within molecules involved in cycloaddition reactions. These descriptors significantly enhance the predictive capabilities of CDFT, allowing for improved rationalization and alignment with experimental observations in organic synthesis. In this context, analysis ofPk−andPk+functions derived from the spin electron densities of radical cations and anions through the GEDT, rank among the most reliable descriptors for assessing local reactivity in polar and ionic processes. Accordingly, based on the nature of the reactants, a detailed analysis of the nucleophilicPk−Parr functions of 1 and the electrophilicPk+Parr functions of 2 was conducted (seeFig. 2and Table S1). The C1 and C3 carbon atoms of 1 exhibit nucleophilic activation withPk−values of 0.06 and 0.70, respectively, identifying C3 as the most nucleophilic center within 1. Conversely, the N2 nitrogen atom shows nucleophilic deactivation with aPk−value of −0.06. For 2, examination of the electrophilicPk+Parr functions reveals that the C4 and C5 carbon atoms are the most electrophilic centers, both having aPk+value of 0.24. Consequently, it is anticipated that the most favorable nucleophilic/electrophilic interaction during this 32CA reaction will occur between the C3 atom of 1 and the C4 atom of 2. This suggests that the initial interaction between the HOMO of 1 and the LUMO of 2 will lead to the formation of the C3–C4 bond, followed by the formation of the C1–C5 bond. This conclusion is further supported by findings presented in the BET section.

The 32CA reaction between 1 and 2 proceedsviatwo distinct stereoisomeric pathways:endoandexo. Computational analysis of the potential energy surface identified corresponding TSs, denoted as TS-endo(TSN) and TS-exo(TSX), which lead to the formation of two cycloadducts, CN (endocycloadduct) and CX (exocycloadduct), respectively. The presence of a single TS for each stereoisomeric pathway strongly indicates a one-step, concerted mechanism for this 32CA reaction, as depicted inScheme 3. The calculated enthalpies (ΔH), entropies (ΔS), and Gibbs free energies (ΔG), along with their relative values, are presented inTable 2.

Table 2clearly demonstrates that the reaction is both highly exothermic and exergonic, as indicated by the negative ΔHand ΔGvalues for the formation of both CN and CX products (Fig. 3). Notably, the CN product is thermodynamically preferred, exhibiting significantly lower electronic energy (ΔE= −51.34 kcal mol−1), enthalpy (ΔH= −49.15 kcal mol−1), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG= −33.59 kcal mol−1) compared to the CX product (−47.00, −44.90, and −28.10 kcal mol−1, respectively). This enhanced thermodynamic stability of CN is reflected in the equilibrium distribution at 293.15 K, where it constitutes approximately 97.9% of the product mixture, compared to only 2.1% for CX. In contrast, the CX pathway is kinetically favored due to a lower activation Gibbs free energy (ΔG= 22.18 kcal mol−1), which is about 2.2 kcal mol−1less than that of the CN pathway (ΔG= 24.34 kcal mol−1). This difference translates into an approximately tenfold faster formation rate for the CX product. Consequently, the reaction displays a classic case of kineticversusthermodynamic control, where theexo(CX) product forms more rapidly under kinetic conditions, but theendo(CN) product, being thermodynamically more stable, predominates at equilibrium. This interplay explains the observed strongendo-selectivity in the final product distribution.

The optimized geometries of TSs, highlighting the forming C1–C5 and C3–C4 bonds, to evaluate the extent of asynchronicity in the investigated 32CA reaction pathways, a detailed diagnostic analysis was performed on all key stationary points.108Specifically, key parameters including the interatomic distances between reactive centers (r), the bond development index (l), and the bond formation asynchronicity index (Δl) were calculated and are compiled inTable 3. These descriptors offer valuable insight into the synchronicity of bond formation for both theendoandexoreaction pathways.

The TSN and TSX, were rigorously characterized through a topological analysis of the ELF. As depicted inFig. 5, protonated basins are represented in blue, disynaptic basins (signifying shared-electron interactions) in green, and monosynaptic basins (indicating lone pairs or radical centers) in red, with color breaks denoting attractor positions. The ELF analysis consistently revealed a V(N2,C3) disynaptic basin, corresponding to the N2–C3 bonding region, which integrated electron populations of 2.78e in TSN and 2.55e in TSX. Similarly, the V(N2,C1) disynaptic basin was present in both TSN and TSX, each exhibiting a total electron population of 2.78e, underscoring a consistent bonding interaction in this region. Both TSs also featured a V(N2) monosynaptic basin, associated with the non-bonding electron density at the nitrogen atom, each integrating approximately 0.86e. Furthermore, the V(C4,C5) disynaptic basin, indicative of a robust bonding interaction between the C4 and C5 atoms, showed integrated electron populations of 4.60e in TSN and 4.46e in TSX. Monosynaptic basins were also identified at C5, integrating 0.53e in TSN and 0.56e in TSX, and at C4, with populations of 0.45e in TSN and 0.40e in TSX. Notably, TSN exhibited a monosynaptic basin at C1 with a population of 0.45e, while TSX displayed one at C3 with 0.99e. The pervasive presence of these monosynaptic basins on carbon centers, coupled with the partial electron populations observed in the relevant disynaptic regions, strongly indicates that complete covalent bond formation between the C3–C4 and C1–C5 centers has not yet occurred in either TS. This comprehensive ELF analysis thus firmly characterizes both TSN and TSX as early-stage, asynchronous transition structures, providing crucial insights into their electronic nature during the bond-forming processes.

In the 32CA reaction between 1 and 2 by the TS-exostereoisomeric pathway, the BET analysis reveals a total of six structural stability domains (SSDs) during the reaction as shown inFig. 6and7, which summarizes the variation in the basin populations that participate in this reaction. The SSD-I [d(C1–C5) = 3.37 Å and d(C3–C4) = 3.47 Å] visualize the ELFs topologies of the reactants reported in the Table S1. 1 display the following basins: one monosynaptic V(C3) basin that is related to the carbenoid center at C3 with a total population of 0.63e and two disynaptic V(C1,N2), and V(C3,N2) basins covering 3.78, and 2.10e, respectively, in agreement with double and single (C1–N2) and (C3–N2) bonds. Meanwhile, the 2 frameworks show one disymmetric basin related to the C4–C5 triple bond V(C4,C5) is observed with an electron population of 5.27e. SSD-I. The reduction in the V(C1,N2) basin population starts at the SSD-II[d(C1–C5) = 2.77 Å and d(C3–C4) = 2.56 Å], to attain 3.04e due to the formation of a new monosynaptic basin, V(N2), with a total population of 0.79e, resulting from a fold-F type catastrophe. In the SSD-III domain [d(C1–C5) = 2.64 Å and d(C3–C4) = 2.36 Å, the population of the V(C4,C5) basin begins to diminish. This reduction triggers anFcatastrophe, leading to the emergence of a new monosynaptic V(C4) basin, which holds 0.14e. By the end of this domain, the populations of the V(C3), V(N2), and V(C4) basins reach 0.98e, 1.27e, and 0.35e, respectively. Further into SSD-VI (d(C1–C5) = 2.51 Å and d(C3–C4) = 2.15 Å), the V(C4,C5) basin's population continues to decrease due to a fold-F catastrophe, which results in the formation of another new monosynaptic basin, V(C5), with a population of 0.56e. In the SSD-V domain (d(C1–C5) = 2.39 Å and d(C3–C4) = 1.99 Å), the two monosynaptic basins, V(C3) and V(C4), coalesceviaa cusp-C type catastrophe to form the new disynaptic V(C3,C4) basin, holding 1.59e. Simultaneously, an additional F-type catastrophe arises within this domain, resulting in the formation of a monosynaptic V(C1) basin with an electron population of 0.29e. This basin emerges due to the continuous depletion of the disynaptic V(C1,N2) basin. The final topological transformation occurs in the SSD-VI domain [d(C1–C5) = 1.98 Å and d(C3–C4) = 1.65 Å], where a C-type catastrophe leads to the emergence of the disynaptic V(C1,C5) basin, signifying the formation of the C1–C5 bond. At the onset of SSD-VI, this newly formed basin integrates 1.69e, primarily derived from the disappearance of the monosynaptic V(C1) and V(C5) basins.

NCI significantly influence the stereoselectivity of reactions such as the 32CA process.Fig. 8presents scatter plots of the RDGversussign(λ2)ρfor the two TSs, TSX and TSN, providing insight into the nature and intensity of non-covalent interactions in each case. These plots differentiate between attractive interactions (negativeλ2, typically shown in blue or green) and repulsive interactions (positiveλ2, shown in red). In TSX, the RDG plot reveals a dominant blue region between −0.05 and −0.02 a.u., indicative of strong localized attractive interactions, primarily of electrostatic nature. Additionally, a narrow green region corresponds to weak van der Waals forces, while a visible red zone reflects steric repulsion. These features are consistent with the 3D RDG isosurface, which shows an intense blue region between the interacting nitrone carbon atoms, highlighting directional and stabilizing interactions that help lower the activation barrier. Conversely, TSN displays a broader green region and a less intense blue zone, pointing to weaker, more diffuse van der Waals interactions and a reduced degree of electrostatic stabilization. The corresponding RDG isosurface shows more dispersed green zones, reflecting a less compact TS structure with less effective orbital overlap. These differences in non-covalent interaction patterns correlate directly with the calculated activation barriers, where TSX is favored kinetically due to stronger stabilizing interactions that lower its activation Gibbs free energy. This interpretation aligns with the irreversible character of the reaction, as shown inFig. 3, where the product distribution is dictated by the relative transition state energies. In summary, the stereoselectivity arises under kinetic control, and the NCI analysis confirms that the faster formingexoproduct (CX) results from stronger and more localized attractive interactions in TSX. Despite the weaker interactions in TSN leading the higher barrier, the greater thermodynamic stability of theendoproduct (CN) gives its high formation rate. The product formedviaTSX is kinetically favored due to the presence of strong localized attractive interactions that lower the activation barrier despite moderate steric repulsion, whereas the product formedviaTSN, less accessible kinetically, is thermodynamically more stable owing van der Waals interaction stabilization.

Table 4summarizes the topological parameters derintensity of non-ived from the electron density and its Laplacian, specifically at the C3–C4 and C1–C5 bond critical points, for the TSX and TSN. These values were obtained through calculations performed at the IEFPCM-B3LYP-D3/6-311G++(d,p) level of theory. In TSX, the electron density at the C1–C5 interaction is higher than at C3–C4, suggesting that bond formation is more advanced at the C1–C5 site. The Laplacian values follow a similar trend, with the lower ∇2ρvalue at C1–C5 indicating a more covalent character. In contrast, TSN exhibits higher electron density at C3–C4 than at C1–C5, showing a different bonding progression. The more balanced Laplacian values in TSN imply that both bonding interactions are at comparable stages. These differences reflect varying degrees of asynchronicity in bond formation between the two TSs.Fig. 9presents the color-mapped representations of both the Laplacian of the electron density and the Electron Localization Function (ELF) plotted within the molecular plane defined by the O1, C5, C3, and C4 nuclei. These visualizations offer valuable insight into the electronic structure and localized bonding interactions within the specified region.

This study provides a detailed mechanistic understanding of the (3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction between azomethine ylide 1 and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate 2 through a multi-faceted DFT approach. Our computational protocol, employing the B3LYP-D3 functional with the 6-311G ++(d,p) basis set and IEFPCM solvent (1,4-dioxane) model, reliably characterized the stationary points and reaction pathways. Key findings from this investigation include that CDFT global and local reactivity indices consistently indicated a highly polar reaction with a forward electron density flux (FEDF) from azomethine ylide 1 to dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate 2, with NPA and Parr function analyses pinpointing the C3 atom of 1 and the C4/C5 atoms of 2 as the most reactive centers for initial bond formation. The reaction is thermodynamically favorable, as indicated by its highly exothermic and exergonic profile. Although kinetic analysis shows a preference for theexopathway due to its lower activation barrier, the more stableendoproduct predominates experimentally, suggesting a reversible process under thermodynamic control. Analysis of TSs geometries and bond development indices confirmed the asynchronous nature of bond formation for bothendoandexopathways, with theexopathway exhibiting a more pronounced asynchronicity. Furthermore, GEDT values underscored the polar character of the TSs. Mechanistic insights from electron density, gained through ELF topological analysis of the TSs, identified early-stage, asynchronous structures with persistent monosynaptic basins on carbon centers, suggesting incomplete bond formation. The Bonding Evolution Theory (BET) analysis further revealed a complex, six-stage molecular mechanism for theexopathway, characterized by a series of topological catastrophes (fold-F and cusp-C type) that delineate the sequential formation of the C3–C4 and C1–C5 bonds, offering a clear, quantitative picture of bond formation and rupture along the reaction coordinate. Lastly, NCI analysis visually and quantitatively confirmed the presence and nature of non-covalent interactions within the TSs, highlighting their role in stabilizing these crucial intermediates. Overall, this study integrates various computational methodologies to provide a comprehensive and atomic-level understanding of the (3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction, unraveling the intricate electronic and energetic factors that dictate its reactivity, selectivity, and mechanism. The insights gained contribute significantly to the broader understanding of cycloaddition chemistry and can aid in the rational design of new synthetic strategies.
