The psychological well-being of parents during their child’s emergency treatment can significantly influence the overall care experience and outcomes. Parental stress and anxiety may affect their ability to provide accurate information, make informed decisions, and support their child effectively during treatment. The aim of this study was to identify the levels of state anxiety experienced by parents whose children were receiving care in the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED), and related factors that contributing to parental anxiety.

This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The setting of the study was PED at a tertiary hospital with a 700-bed capacity. Participants were parents of children who visited the PED and received least urgent code during triage. The population of the study consists of a total of 426 parents of children admitted to the PED. Data were collected face-to-face between 4 November 2024 and 15 December 2024. Data collection tools included a socio-demographic questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a validated 40-item tool measuring state and trait anxiety. The data were analysed using SPSS Statistics for Windows.

Majority of the visits were made by mothers (66%), while fathers were less active in this process (34%). The mean state anxiety score was 42.45 ± 8.94 and the mean trait anxiety score was 43.70 ± 8.12. Moreover, mothers exhibited significantly higher trait anxiety than fathers (p= 0,003). Significant differences were found in both state and trait anxiety scores according to mother’s education level (p< 0.001). It was found that the trait anxiety levels of non-employed mothers were significantly higher than those of employed mothers (p= 0.046). Anxiety levels were found to be higher in those who visited the PED more frequently. In addition, a significant difference was found in state anxiety scores according to the perceived urgency of the child’s condition, and it was observed that anxiety levels were higher in very urgent conditions (p< 0.001). Anxiety levels were significantly associated with maternal education (p< 0.001), non-employed status (p= 0.046), frequent PED visits, and perceived urgency of the child’s condition (p< 0.001). It was determined that those who were dissatisfied and those who were partially satisfied with the communication of healthcare staff had higher anxiety levels. It was seen that the anxiety levels of those who were dissatisfied and those who were partially satisfied with providing information by healthcare staff were higher (p= 0.020). The adequacy of allocated time for care made a significant difference in both state and trait anxiety scores, and it was observed that the anxiety levels of those who were dissatisfied and those who were partially satisfied with the adequacy of allocated time for care were higher. Dissatisfaction with staff communication and allocated care time also correlated with higher anxiety (p< 0.05).

Effectiveness of healthcare staff, the importance of communication, and the perceived quality of care provided to children in the PED were important indicators for parental anxiety. Effective communication between healthcare providers and parents could lead to increased level of parental satisfaction with healthcare staff and with the PED settings. Effective communication could reduce parental anxiety during the course of care and treatment, and thus enhancing the overall experience of families in the PED settings.

The Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) is a critical care unit where children with acute medical conditions receive immediate attention. The PED environment generates significant stress for parents facing their child’s acute medical needs, with studies showing parental anxiety directly impacts both child outcomes and healthcare experiences. Studies indicates that parental anxiety can significantly influence both the emotional state of the child and the overall healthcare experience [1–3]. The interplay between a parent’s emotional response and the child’s condition is complex; studies have shown that parents’ anxiety levels are often exacerbated by their children’s medical conditions, the perceived severity of the illness, and the uncertainty surrounding treatment outcomes [1–4]. Parents frequently used PED for their children due to worrying about the health condition of their child, delayed recovery, and possible complications of illness, feeling frustrated, fearful, and anxious [5].

The presence of parents during medical procedures has been shown to mitigate anxiety levels for both parties, enhancing satisfaction with care [6]. However, the emergency setting poses unique challenges, as parents may feel overwhelmed by the rapid pace and high stakes of the situation. Factors such as the child’s age, the nature of the medical issue, and the anticipated interventions contribute to varying degrees of parental anxiety [2,3,7]. For instance, parents of younger children often report higher levels of state anxiety compared to those with older children, likely due to concerns about the potential for complications and the child’s vulnerability [8,9]. Moreover, effective communication from healthcare providers is essential in alleviating parental anxiety. Clear explanations regarding the child’s condition and the procedures being undertaken can foster a sense of control and understanding, which in turn can reduce anxiety levels [10,11].

The psychological well-being of parents during their child’s emergency treatment can significantly influence the overall care experience and outcomes. Parental stress and anxiety may affect their ability to provide accurate information, make informed decisions, and support their child effectively during treatment. Recognizing and addressing these psychological factors can lead to improved communication between healthcare providers and families, potentially resulting in better patient care and satisfaction in the PED setting. Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to parental anxiety in the PED settings is vital for developing targeted interventions that can improve both parental and child outcomes during these critical encounters. Identifying the factors contributing to parental anxiety can help healthcare providers develop strategies to alleviate stress and improve overall patient care.

The aim of this study was to identify the levels of state anxiety experienced by parents whose children were receiving care in the PED, and related factors that contributing to parental anxiety. This investigation seeks to identify the specific factors contributing to parental anxiety during these critical healthcare encounters, including the nature of the child’s medical condition, the perceived severity of the situation, and the dynamics of communication between healthcare providers and parents. The study explored correlations between anxiety levels and factors such as the child’s condition severity, waiting times, and communication with healthcare providers.

This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study.

The setting of the study was PED at a tertiary hospital with a 700-bed capacity and located in the southeast of Turkey. Participants were parents of children who visited the PED and received least urgent code during triage. The minimum required sample size was calculated asn= 384 using the Sample Size Calculator based on a 95% confidence level, 5% margin of error, and an assumed response distribution of 50%, which represents maximum variability. A convenience sampling was used to select the participants. Using convenience sampling method may introduce some limitations such as risk of selection bias. To address this limitation, the researcher made efforts to ensure that the sample was as diverse as possible.

Data were collected between 4 November 2024 and 15 December 2024. Participants were approached after initial triage but before physician assessment to capture anxiety levels at peak uncertainty (pre-diagnosis), while avoiding interference with clinical workflows. The researcher (A.B.) invited participants to the study while they are waiting to be seen by a physician and the questionnaire was applied to those who agreed to participate. The questionnaire was asked by the researcher (A.B.) to the participants face-to-face. The time to fill out the questionnaire took about 10 min.

This form was developed by the researcher (A.B.) based on the current literature and his previous experiences (Supplementary file). This questionnaire was piloted with 10 participants and amended based on the feedback received before the actual data collection process. The pilot testing aimed to assess questions clarity, identified and reworded ambiguous terms, and optimize flow (adjusted question order to reduce repetition). While this process enhanced face validity and practicality, we fully acknowledge that formal content validation (e.g., expert panels, psychometric testing) was not performed. The form consists of 22 questions including the age the child and parents, gender of the child, level of education of parents, number of the children in the family, where they live, when they visit the PED, how many times they visit the PED in the last year, the health complaint of the child, waiting time in the PED, parents perception of urgency of their child’s health conditions, satisfaction with the PED healthcare staff, satisfaction with the communication skills of PED healthcare staff, satisfaction with the information provided by PED healthcare staff, satisfaction with the received care in the PED, satisfaction with the time allocated for their child, and their future perception regarding whether they would visit the PED in the future if they their child has the same health complaints.

The STAI was developed by Spielberger and colleagues in 1970 [12], and its Turkish validity and reliability was performed by Öner and Le Compte in 1982 [13]. The STAI consists of 40 questions. The scale consists of a total of 40 questions and the total scores obtained vary between 40 and 160. A high score indicates a high level of anxiety. In the State Anxiety Scale, the response options were (1) not at all, (2) a little, (3) somewhat, (4) very much so; in the Trait Anxiety Scale, the response options were (1) almost never, (2) sometimes, (3) often, (4) almost always.

The data obtained in the study were analysed using SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 statistical software. Frequency and percentage analyses were used to determine the descriptive characteristics of the participants, and mean and standard deviation statistics were used to examine the scale. Kurtosis and Skewness values were analysed to determine whether the research variables were normally distributed (Table3). In the related literature, the results of kurtosis and skewness values of the variables between + 1.5 and − 1.5 [14], + 2.0 and − 2.0 [15] are accepted as normal distribution. It was determined that the variables showed normal distribution. Parametric methods were used to analyse the data. The relationships between continuous variables were analysed through Pearson correlation analyses. Independent groups t-test, one-way analysis of variance (Anova) and post hoc (Tukey, LSD) analyses were used to examine the differences in scale levels according to the descriptive characteristics of the participants.

Ethical approval was obtained from Mardin Artuklu University Ethics Committee (Date: 10/09/2024, Decision No: 2024/9–29). In addition, the necessary permissions were obtained from the Mardin Provincial Directorate of Health (Date: 17/09/2024, REF: E-68051626-770-254151896). In addition, informed consent forms were obtained from all participants. Informed consent to participate was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of any participant under the age of 16. The research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The study was completed with 426 parents of children admitted to the PED. Table1presents descriptive characteristics of the participants. The mean age of the children was 6.29 ± 4.785, the mean age of the mothers was 33.37 ± 7.364 and the mean age of the fathers was 37.58 ± 7.921. The average number of children in the family was 2.92 ± 1.639, ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 8. In addition, it was found that the highest rate of PED visits was in the 1–5 age group with 44.8% and the lowest rate was in the group under 1 year of age with 9.4%. In terms of gender of the child, the proportion of females (54%) was higher than that of male (46%). Majority of the visits were made by mothers (66.0%), while fathers were less active in this process (34.0%). This indicated that mothers play a more active role in their children’s utilisation of healthcare services. Considering the education level of the parents, it was determined that 35.9% of the mothers were primary school graduates and 19.5% had a bachelor’s degree or higher. Among the fathers, the proportion of those with undergraduate and higher education was found to be the highest with 35.4%. In terms of employment status, it was found that 81.2% of the mothers were not employed, while 89.4% of the fathers were employed. According to their place of residence, 59.2% of the visits were made from the city centre, followed by those living in the village with 21.6% and in the district with 19.2%.

Table2presented parent’s experiences with the PED. It was determined that the highest number of visits were made between 08:00 and 17:00 at a rate of 89.7%. It is important to stated that this result could be affected by the time of data collection. According to the frequency of PED visits in the last year, the rate of those who visited the PED 4–5 times in the last year was 28.2%, which constituted the largest group, while the rate of those who visited the PED 10 or more times in the last year was 25.1%. Moreover, the most common health complaints of children brought to the PED included fever (60.3%), cough (38.7%) and vomiting (32.6%), fatigue (28.6%), and sore throat (26.8%). When considering the urgency of the child’s health from parents’ perspective, it was determined that 51.6% of the visits were evaluated as semi-urgent, 34.5% as urgent, and only 4.9% of the very urgent.

It was found that 80.8% of parents were satisfied with healthcare staff, 81.7% of parents were satisfied with the communication style of healthcare staff. In addition, 71.8% of parents were satisfied with the care provided to their children in the PED, while 69.7% of parents were satisfied the information provided to them during the course of treatment and care. In addition, the average waiting time was determined as 32.34 ± 27.953 min, ranging from a minimum of 2 min to a maximum of 150 min.

Table3presents the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the state and trait anxiety scores of the participants, as well as kurtosis and skewness values expressing the distribution. The mean state anxiety score was 42.45 ± 8.94 and the mean trait anxiety score was 43.70 ± 8.12. The minimum values of both variables were 20 and 21, and the maximum values were 65 and 64, respectively. These results indicate that the measured anxiety levels show a wide distribution.

Table4presents the correlation values between state and trait anxiety scores and child’s age, mother’s age, father’s age, number of children and waiting time. According to the results of this study, no significant correlation was found between the age of the child, the age of the mother and the age of the father and both anxiety scores (allp> 0.05). This shows that age factors did not have a significant effect on anxiety levels. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between the number of children and trait anxiety (r= 0.237,p< 0.01). This result indicates that the level of trait anxiety increases with the increase in the number of children. There was no significant relationship between state anxiety and number of children (p= 0.180). The results of this study showed that the number of children and waiting time were important variables affecting anxiety levels. No significant relationship was found between other variables (age of the child, age of the mother, age of the father) and anxiety scores. Moreover, waiting time showed a significant positive correlation with both state anxiety (r= 0.141,p< 0.01) and trait anxiety (r= 0.096,p< 0.05). This suggests that prolonged waiting time may lead to an increase in both types of anxiety.

In Table5, the state and trait anxiety scores were analysed according to some demographic and descriptive characteristics. No significant difference was found between the age of the child and both state and trait anxiety scores (p> 0.05). This shows that the age of the child does not affect anxiety levels. No significant difference was found between both state and trait anxiety scores according to the gender of the child (p> 0.05). Moreover, mothers had higher anxiety levels than fathers in trait anxiety scores and the difference were significant (p= 0.003). However, no significant difference was found in terms of state anxiety (p= 0.076). Significant differences were found in both state and trait anxiety scores according to mother’s education level (p< 0.001). Anxiety levels of mothers who graduated from secondary school were found to be higher than the other groups. There was no significant difference in both state and trait anxiety scores according to father’s education level (p> 0.05). For father’s educational level, non-significance (p> 0.05) may be resulted from smaller sample size (n= 145 fathers) or gender differences in anxiety expression.

When the mother’s employment status was examined, it was found that the trait anxiety levels of non-employed mothers were significantly higher than those of employed mothers (p= 0.046). There was no significant difference in state anxiety (p= 0.697). It was determined that the father’s employment status did not have a significant effect on both state and trait anxiety levels (p> 0.05). In the analyses according to the place of residence, there was no significant difference in both state and trait anxiety scores (p> 0.05).

Significant differences were found in state and trait anxiety levels according to the time slots of PED visit (p= 0.017 for state anxiety,p= 0.011 for trait anxiety). It was determined that the anxiety levels of the PED visitors were higher between 24:00 and 08:00 at night. Parents may interpret nighttime symptoms as more severe, as they often represent breakdown of normal coping mechanisms or failed home management. In addition, according to the number of PED visits in the last year, significant differences were found in both state and trait anxiety scores (p< 0.05). Anxiety levels were found to be higher in those who visited the PED more frequently. In addition, a significant difference was found in state anxiety scores according to the urgency of the child’s condition, and it was observed that anxiety levels were higher in very urgent conditions (p< 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in terms of trait anxiety (p= 0.067). The significant elevation in state anxiety during PED visit reflects parents’ transient stress response to the immediate crisis. The non-significant result for trait anxiety remains relatively stable across situations.

A significant difference was found in trait anxiety levels according to satisfaction with staff, and it was determined that the anxiety levels of those who were partially satisfied were higher than the other groups (p< 0.001). There was no significant difference in state anxiety (p= 0.068). Significant differences were observed in satisfaction with the communication of healthcare staff in both state and trait anxiety scores (p< 0.05). It was determined that those who were dissatisfied and those who were partially satisfied with the communication of healthcare staff had higher anxiety levels. In addition, a significant difference was found in state anxiety scores according to satisfaction with providing information by healthcare staff, and it was seen that the anxiety levels of those who were dissatisfied and those who were partially satisfied with providing information by healthcare staff were higher (p= 0.020). There was no significant difference in trait anxiety scores (p= 0.511). A significant difference was found in state anxiety scores according to satisfaction with the care of the child, and it was determined that the anxiety levels of those who were partially satisfied were higher (p= 0.002). There was no significant difference in terms of trait anxiety (p= 0.172).

The adequacy of allocated time for care made a significant difference in both state and trait anxiety scores, and it was observed that the anxiety levels of those who were dissatisfied and those who were partially satisfied with the adequacy of allocated time for care were higher (p= 0.005 for state anxiety,p= 0.050 for trait anxiety). A significant difference was found in trait anxiety levels according to the status of revisit in the future, and it was determined that the anxiety levels of those who planned to visit partially were higher than the other groups (p= 0.015). There was no significant difference in state anxiety (p= 0.344).

This study revealed the anxiety levels of parents admitted to the PED, and the factors that contributed to parental anxiety. The investigation of anxiety levels among parents admitted to the PED revealed significant insights into caregivers’ emotional and psychological challenges. The hospitalization of a child is often accompanied by heightened anxiety and stress for parents, exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding their child’s health and the hospital environment itself. The existing literature found that that parents experience stress during their child’s hospitalization, which can be attributed to factors such as uncertainty about their child’s health, the unfamiliar hospital environment, and the perceived severity of the medical issue [16–18]. The results of this study may also reflect parents’ prior experiences with emergency services, which were not explicitly measured but could influence anxiety levels. Negative past experiences in healthcare settings can exacerbate parental distress during subsequent visits. Future studies should formally evaluate this relationship.

This study revealed that majority of the visits were made by mothers. This showed that mothers play a more active role in using healthcare services which is consistent with traditional societal norms regarding parenting and healthcare responsibilities. Consistent with this result, Boland et al. [16] noted that parental decision-making involvement often varies by gender, with mothers more frequently taking on active roles in healthcare settings. In addition, this study revealed that mothers had higher anxiety levels than fathers in trait anxiety scores. This concurred with the existing studies [19,20]. Mothers are often socialized to be more attuned to their children’s needs and health issues, which can lead to increased vigilance and, consequently, higher anxiety levels [21]. Moreover, this study revealed that anxiety levels of mothers who graduated from secondary school were found to be higher than the other groups. This presents a nuanced perspective on the relationship between education and parental anxiety. This study suggested that mothers with secondary education may be more likely to seek help and support for their children’s health issues, leading to a higher likelihood of reporting anxiety. Furthermore, this study found that the trait anxiety levels of non-employed mothers were significantly higher than those of employed mothers. In line with this result, the existing literature indicates that non-employed mothers often face unique challenges, including social isolation and a lack of engagement in external activities, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety [22].

This study revealed that parents were frequently used the PED. The rate of those who visited the PED 4–5 times in the last year was 28.2%, which constituted the largest group, while the rate of those who visited the PED 10 or more times in the last year was 25.1%. Frequent use of PED contributes to overcrowding in PED setting and thus leading to many negative consequences including increased workload, decreased quality of care, staff burnout, causes stress in the staff, causes long waiting times, increased resource use, and healthcare cost [23–28]. There are approximately 2050 emergency department visits per 1000 population in Turkey, which is greater than the country’s total population [29]. While PED overcrowding was not directly measured in this study, it likely contributed to observed anxiety levels through prolonged waiting times, staff stress spillover, reduces staff-patient interaction time, and environmental stressors as overcrowded conditions may heighten perceptions of chaos. Therefore, this study calls for an urgent reform to alleviate overcrowding in emergency care settings.

The results revealed that general satisfaction of parents with PED settings was high. Of parents, 80.8% were satisfied with healthcare staff, 81.7% were satisfied with the communication style of healthcare staff, 71.8% were satisfied with the care provided to their children in the PED, and 69.7% were satisfied the information provided to them during the course of treatment and care. Similarly, parent’s satisfaction with healthcare staff was found to be high in the existing studies [30,31]. In line with the results of this study, Power and Franck [32] found that parents should be both integral to the daily care plan and actively involved in decision-making, receiving the necessary support and information along the way. This aligns with results from Zdun-Ryżewska et al., who noted that a lack of information regarding medical procedures can exacerbate parental anxiety, underscoring the importance of effective communication between healthcare providers and parents [33]. Effective communication is essential in healthcare settings, particularly in paediatrics, where parents often seek reassurance and clarity regarding their child’s condition and treatment. In line with the results of this study, existing literature showed that clear and empathetic communication enhances parental satisfaction and helps mitigate anxiety during medical encounters [34]. The ability of healthcare providers to convey information in an understandable and supportive manner is vital for building trust and ensuring that parents feel informed and involved in their child’s care. This study suggested to provide targeted communication training for PED staff, particularly in delivering clear information about wait times and treatment plans, and empathetic communication with anxious parents.

One of the strengths of this study is to collect data from a large sample of 426 parents. The study’s sample size and diversity contribute to its robustness. By including a wide range of parents from various backgrounds, the research captures a comprehensive picture of parental anxiety in the PED setting. In addition, collecting data face-to-face allows to obtain more reliable data.

Despite its strengths, the study also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, this study was conducted only in one PED of tertiary hospital, therefore, its single-centre design may limit generalizability to other paediatric emergency settings with differing patient demographics, resource availability, or clinical protocols. Future multicentre studies could validate these results across diverse healthcare contexts. Another limitation is the reliance on self-reported measures of anxiety, which may be subject to bias. Parents may underreport or overreport their anxiety levels based on social desirability or their perceptions of how they should respond in a healthcare setting. Additionally, the study may not fully account for external factors that could influence anxiety levels, such as previous experiences with healthcare systems, the severity of the child’s condition, or the presence of support systems during the emergency visit. Moreover, as with all cross-sectional studies, the design of this study cannot establish causal relationships between the observed factors (e.g., communication quality, wait times) and parental anxiety levels. While we identified significant associations, the directionality of these relationships requires verification through longitudinal or experimental designs.

The investigation of state anxiety levels among parents in the PED reveals a complex interplay of factors contributing to their anxiety. The evidence suggests that both the healthcare environment and the nature of the child’s illness significantly influence parental anxiety. Therefore, healthcare providers should recognize these dynamics and implement strategies that not only address the medical needs of the child but also support the emotional well-being of parents. This holistic approach could contribute to more positive experience for parents.

In addition, effectiveness of healthcare staff, the importance of communication, and the perceived quality of care provided to children in the PED were important indicators for parental anxiety. Effective communication between healthcare providers and parents could lead to increased level of parental satisfaction with healthcare staff and with the PED settings. Effective communication could reduce parental anxiety during the course of care and treatment, and thus enhancing the overall experience of families in the PED settings.

This study highlights the significant anxiety levels experienced by parents in the PED, particularly among mothers, those with lower education, and parents facing longer waiting times or communication gaps. This study revealed the critical role of effective healthcare communication, adequate time allocation, and empathetic staff interactions in mitigating parental distress. These results advocate for targeted interventions such as staff training programs and family-centred care protocols that can directly inform healthcare policies to improve paediatric emergency care experiences.

This study could inform healthcare policy-makers and staff aimed at reducing parental anxiety, thereby improving the overall experience for families in paediatric emergency settings. Although this study cannot determine causality due to its cross-sectional nature, the identified associations between healthcare communication, waiting times, and parental anxiety provide a strong foundation for future intervention studies to test causal hypotheses. Future studies could build on these descriptive results using analytical designs to model causal pathways.
