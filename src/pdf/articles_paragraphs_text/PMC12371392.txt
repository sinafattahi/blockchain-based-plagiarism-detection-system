Diabetes mellitus, affecting 10% of the global population, stands as one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. Over half of these patients experience inadequate glycemic control, highlighting the shortcomings of conventional management methods. Given the economic and personal impact of diabetes, including decreased productivity, higher healthcare costs, severe complications and shortened lifespan, there is a pressing need for more efficient and cost-effective glycemic management tools. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI), which harnesses the power of big data and sophisticated algorithms, has offered promising solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare providers. In this context, we demonstrate the current applications of AI in glycemic management and discuss the opportunities and challenges that AI faces in diabetes management.

Glucose monitoring plays a pivotal role in diabetes management, encompassing hemoglobin A1C (A1C) measurement, blood glucose monitoring (BGM) by capillary (finger-stick) devices, and continuous (interstitial) glucose monitoring (CGM). AI has been employed in glucose monitoring and prediction to provide an early indicator of glycemic control status and detection of adverse events in patients with diabetes.

While traditional diabetes management confronts challenges such as poor patient adherence, lack of personalized care, and limited medical resources, there are increasing applications of AI in diabetes education, lifestyle guidance, and pharmacologic therapy, offering a promising solution to provide optimal diabetes treatments.

Selecting target-specific anti-diabetic drug therapy is crucial but challenging in patients with diabetes (particularly T2D) due to complicated prescriptions and the individual heterogeneity. A review of studies leveraging AI to predict the use of anti-diabetic agents highlights the promise of precision medicine, tailored to individual patient traits using AI.[6]Meanwhile, recent research showed the responses generated by the commercially available large language model GPT-4 were superficially reasonable and personalized to align with clinical guidelines, but differed systematically from endocrinologists’ responses in clinically meaningful ways. The results indicate that AI tools have potential for optimizing drug treatment plans for people with complex diabetes, but further validation through randomized controlled trials is necessary.[7]In addition, due to the exhaustive medication guides, it’s hard for patients to retain the necessary information, which can result in hospitalizations and medication nonadherence. The advancements in AI also allow researchers to improve the design of AI- and human factor-based tool that supports patients’ medication information comprehension and potentially improves medication adherence.

Optimizing insulin therapy is indispensable for T1DM and important for T2DM with disease progression. However, most patients receive suboptimal doses and do not achieve glycemic control due to inertia insulin titration, fear of hypoglycemia, and so on. Although a series of clinical guidelines on rational insulin use for patients with diabetes have been proposed by experts, they cannot fully take into consideration the heterogeneity of each patient in the real world. Several digital technologies have emerged to support the insulin management and glucose control, including basic bolus dose calculations, insulin titration algorithms based on AI, and autonomous continuous insulin infusion closed-loop systems.

The advancement of AI technology enables more precise monitoring and prediction of short-term and long-term blood glucose levels and offers personalized lifestyle guidance, anti-diabetic medication, and insulin decision-making, providing new tools to improve glycemic control in diabetic patients and reduce the risk of complications (Figure 1).

Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in glycemic management for diabetes.

However, AI applications in diabetes management still face challenges. First, low-quality or small datasets can result in inadequate model performance and biases, harming clinical practice. Collaborative efforts to establish standardized data collection platforms are crucial for overcoming this obstacle. Furthermore, the emergence of wearable devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) promises to yield a wider range of high-precision data. However, as the gathered data may encompass sensitive personal details, data privacy remains a paramount concern in healthcare AI. To safeguard privacy, regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have been enacted. Simultaneously, innovative techniques such as federated learning (FL), blockchain technology, and generative adversarial networks are evolving to tackle this challenge. Second, while high-performance deep learning models are powerful tools, they often function as “black boxes”. Clinical practice requires interpretability from these models to ensure patient safety and foster trust among physicians. Hence, there is an urgent need for algorithmic innovation to construct high-performance transparent models or advanced interpretability algorithms to further expand the applicability of models. Third, a notable disparity exists between laboratory environments and actual clinical situations, and current evaluations of models are still inadequate. Consequently, during the implementation of AI, it is necessary to follow guidelines for step-by-step validation and iterate and optimize models based on real-world requirements to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Simultaneously, ethical questions arise regarding accountability in the event of AI errors, highlighting the importance of robust safety measures and unambiguous policies assigning responsibility in AI applications (Figure 2).

Challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) application in glycemic management and possible strategies.

In conclusion, the advancement of AI is transforming diabetes management yet several challenges remain to be addressed. As physicians, we should not only embrace and refine these technologies to offer better healthcare services but also keep a cautious, patient-centered orientation to ensure safety.
