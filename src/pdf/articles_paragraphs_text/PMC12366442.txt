Bursa of Fabricius (BF) is a primary lymphoid organ in birds, crucial for lymphocyte development and immune function. This study investigates age‐related alterations in the histomorphology and ultrastructure of the bursal tissue in green‐winged teal (Anas crecca) at 8thand 24thweeks of age. Twenty ducks were examined, and the sample tissues were collected post‐euthanasia for histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. At the 8thweek, the histological sections exhibited normal lymphocyte distribution and structural organization, characterized by a well‐developed muscular layer and plicae. In contrast, by the 24thweek, significant involution was observed, marked by reduced bursal weight, diminished muscular layer and increased fibrosis. Histological changes included necrosis and depletion of lymphocytes, alongside alterations in the follicular‐associated epithelium. SEM revealed collagen fibre spreading and loss of microvilli, indicating advanced involution. This study highlights the developmental and involutionary stages of the organ inA. crecca, providing essential insights into the age‐dependent changes in this critical immune organ. This is the first report detailing these histomorphometric and ultrastructural alterations inA. crecca, highlighting the age‐dependent nature of these changes, besides contributing to our understanding of avian immunology.

This scientific diagram illustrates age‐related changes in the Bursa of Fabricius (BF) of green‐winged teal (Anas crecca) ducks at two developmental stages. In the 8thweek, the BF shows maximum maturation with peak morphometric measurements (body weight, bursal dimensions), the thickness of cortex and medulla layers and well‐developed ultrastructure, including microvilli and regular borders. By the 24thweek, the BF undergoes involution with decreased measurements, reduced tissue thickness and structural deterioration, including absent microvilli, irregular borders and collagen fibre deposition. The study demonstrates the natural developmental progression from functional maturity to age‐related regression in this important immune organ of waterfowl.

Bursa of Fabricius is a pouch organ with an abstracted lumen, which is peculiar to the birds. It is a vital primary lymphoid organ that functions as a peripheral immunological organ associated with the intestine, which is responsible for the performance of 50% of the bird's immune response (Islam et al.2024; Penchev2020). It is responsible for humoral immunity and provides a suitable habitat for the development, maturation and differentiation of lymphocytes (Lavanya et al.2019). It is situated on the dorsal wall of the cloaca and appears as a smooth, globular to oval diverticulum with slight anterior and posterior compression. It remains in a higher activation status at the early stages of development. However, at different progressive ages of maturation in various avian species, it is exposed to different involuntary alterations. Deka et al. (2020) revealed that full maturation of the studied organ occurs in the 12th–16thweek, whereas Penchev (2020) referred to the significant involutory signs that appeared at the 20th–26th‐week stage in most avian species.

Bursa of Fabricius (BF) is constructed of three layers: the external tunica of serosa, the intermediate tunica of muscularis and the internal tunica of mucosa. Tunica mucosa is constituted by longitudinal thick plicae folds that obliterate the lumen and range from 11 to 13 folds (Ameen et al.2025; Ciriaco et al.2003). Many studies referred to one plica formed of multiple lymphoid follicles, ranging from 8000 to 1200 follicles that were arranged into densely stained cortical and lightly stained medullary lymphocytes (Deka et al.2020; Indu et al.2000). The follicular surface is lined by stratified columnar epithelium called follicular‐associated cells and cuboidal epithelial cells called interfollicular cells.

Several studies demonstrated that involuntary signs such as dispersion of necrosis, depleted lymphocytes and cytoplasmic involution begin to appear directly after sexual maturation is completed (Bora and Deka2024; Leena et al.2009). Previous literature referred to the involution of this organ as undergoing gradual replacement of adipose tissue inside plicae that in turn increased the length and width of plical folds (Singh2018). The complete regression to the bursal involution occurred in the 27thweek according to Sari et al. (2015) and Shukla and Karmore (2023).

Anas creccais a wild duck called the green‐winged teal distributed throughout many countries of Asia and Europe. It has a full migration trip from the wintering area to the breeding ground in spring (Al‐lahaibi et al.2021; Dessborn et al.2011). It is a small bird that is 34–43 cm in length and has an average weight of 350 g in males and 320 g in females. Their wings are long, 17.5–20.5 cm, and the bill also reaches 3.2–4.0 cm in length. Their dietary habits varied from molluscs, worms and ground insects to water plankton (Marzban Abbasabadi et al.2020).

Several studies explored the age‐related changes in the lymphoid organs of other birds, such as Sonali chicken (Ayman et al.2020), domestic ducks (Sultana et al.2011), Japanese quail (Kadam and Waghaye2022) and turkey (Gultiken et al.2010), but still, the data about the age‐dependent alterations of green‐winged teal bursa are lacking; besides, the anatomical organization in this species has not been explored. Consequently, the present investigation aimed to examine the bursal tissue as a primary lymphoid organ grossly, histologically and ultrastructurally in detail and determined the average age of full maturation and complete involution for enhancing the immune response of this wild species.

The research was carried out in the research laboratory of the Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Beni‐Suef University, Beni‐Suef, Egypt. The samples were processed in the same laboratory.

The study utilized 20 ducklings of the speciesA. crecca. The ducklings were newly hunted and were purchased from two specific locations in Egypt: Abu‐Rawash, Giza Governorate and Damietta Governorate. It is well known that theA. creccais considered a migratory duck that migrates to warm destinations like Egypt, escaping from very cold regions in Europe for the mating season; therefore, some bird keepers bring them for sale. This indicates that the researchers sourced the ducklings from reputable suppliers in these regions, ensuring that the animals were healthy and suitable for the experimental conditions.

After procurement, the ducklings were transported to the Department of Zoology at the Faculty of Science, Beni‐Suef University, located in Beni‐Suef, Egypt. The transportation process was conducted with care to minimize stress and ensure the well‐being of the ducklings during their transfer to the research facility.

Then, the 20 ducklings were divided into two age groups for the study. Ten ducklings were captured at two ages: the first age group was the 8thweek/age, whereas the second age group was the 24thweek. The two ages were differentiated from each other according to careful observation of several features such as feathering, beak length, strength, colour and body size (Banerjee et al.2024; Winker et al.2013). Therefore, this experimental design allowed for a comparative analysis of the BF at different developmental stages. It is important to note that the collected ducklings were reported to have neither developmental disorders nor detectable diseases that could interfere with the experiment or affect the results. This aspect is crucial for ensuring the validity and reliability of the study findings, as healthy subjects are essential for accurate scientific research.

The ducks had ad libitum access to a feeding basal diet according to Table1and fresh water, whereas the automatic drinkers were installed so that there were two nipple drinkers in each pen. There was sufficient airflow with daily ambient temperature during this study averaging 37°C and relative humidity was from 70% to 80%. The collected ducks had neither any developmental disorders nor detectable diseases that may cause any problems in the experiment or affect the result of the study. The present study was conducted with a focus on comparing the morphology of two age groups ofA. crecca(2‐month‐old juveniles and 8‐month‐old subadults). The birds were captured for a limited time and did not undergo long‐term observation. As such, the study did not include tracking mortality rates, as the primary objective was to assess age‐related morphological differences.

Laboratory analysis of nutrient content of feed (g/kg) (El‐Rayes et al.2025; Youssuf et al.2025).

The total number of experimental ducks was 20. They were divided into two groups: the 8thand the 24thweeks; each group consisted of 10 ducks.

The location, colour, shape, size and weight were examined at the studied ages every week during the experiment period.

After the humane sacrifice of ducks by euthanasia using 6.50–13.00 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride injection, the feathers were removed manually, whereas each duck was put on its back and a surgical incision in the midline of the abdomen was made, and then the peritoneum and the organ after removing the adjacent tissue were made. The samples were collected after carefully separating them from the adjacent organs. Thereafter, the organ was washed thoroughly with 1% phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or 0.9% normal saline. The samples were dissected for histological and ultrastructural observations. Then, they were immediately taken into two halves; one of them was preserved in 10% neutral buffer formalin for more than 24 h for histological examination, and the other half was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and post‐fixed in 2% veronal acetate‐buffered OsO4for ultrastructural preparation.

The fixed sections in neutral buffer were dehydrated in an elevated concentration of alcohol, whereas the clearing with xylene was done. After that, they were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned with a manual rotary microtome with retraction (MR3000, Lasec Group company) (Shaw and Mitchell‐Olds1993) according to Bancroft and Gamble (2008) and Yoon et al. (2024). The histological structures of the bursal tissue were examined under a Nikon E100 binocular microscope (Microscope Central) and were photographed by a Nikon COOLPIX P950 digital camera featuring a 16.0‐megapixel resolution. All morphometric measurements, such as the thickness of muscular and follicular layers, the thickness of the cortex and the diameter of medullary regions, were calculated by image processing of ImageJ software (Version 1.54k) according to the protocols of Gewehr et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2022). The results were analysed by SPSS to get an accurate comparison between the two studied groups.

The glutaraldehyde‐fixed samples were washed with 0.1 M PBS and then were dehydrated in a graded ethanol–water series up to 100% ethanol. They were dried at a critical point using CO2, coated with gold and mounted on an aluminium sheet. The samples were then scanned using a 20 kV JMS‐35CF SEM (FlexSEM 1000 II Vp‐SEM, Hitachi High‐Tech Company).

The statistical analysis of the data was made using SPSS 25 (SPSS Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 25, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). An independent samplest‐test was conducted to compare the mean downtime between two age groups (e.g., 8thweek vs. 24thweek). Apvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of two ages for assessing the differences in various histomorphometric parameters (Shaw and Mitchell‐Olds1993; Vijayvargiya2009).

BF of both investigated ages of common teal duck was an asymmetric organ belonging to the primary lymphoid system. It was situated on the dorsal wall of the cloaca and appeared as a smooth, globular to oval sac‐like diverticulum with slight anterior and posterior compression. The colour of the organ was yellowish to milky white (Figure1b,c). The gross examination revealed a muscular wall that enclosed a tiny, axial primary cavity and several plicae, which were lengthy mucosal folds of the bursal wall that resembled villous extensions. The core lumen of the organ was discovered to be significantly obstructed (Figure1d,e).

The current morphometrical study provided detailed baseline data on the age‐wise involution of the BF in the progressed age, more towards younger ones. However, the duck weight exhibited a reversible relationship with the bursal weight and the developmental age. Figure2a–fand Table1indicate a significant increase (p< 0.001) in body weight (401.81 ± 94.22 g) in the 24thweek compared to the 8thweek (302.82 ± 73.91 g). On the other hand, the bursal weight (0.02 ± 0.00 g), width (25.83 ± 0.88 µm) and length (0.06 ± 0.01 µm) expressed an obvious (p< 0.001) decrease in the 24thweek compared to the 8thweek. Conversely, the data analysis of the internal bursal structure illustrated a significant elevation (p< 0.001) in the width (2768.32 ± 351.82 µm) and length of plicae (16.02 ± 0.68 µm) as the age progressed in comparison to the 8thweek that recorded 1146.24 ± 105.52 µm for the width and 10.52 ± 0.76 µm for plicae length.

Values were represented as mean ± Std andn= 8 ducks. The means within the same parameter and not sharing the common superscript symbol (s) differ significantly fromp< 0.05.

The microscopical examination of the 8thweek displayed well‐developed bursal tissue. It is constructed of three layers: external serosa, muscularis and internal mucosa. Tunica mucosa is constituted by longitudinal thick plicae that obliterate the lumen. Each plica is formed of large‐sized and elongated‐shaped follicles with a dark‐stained cortex and a lighter medulla. The longitudinal follicles appear with sharp margins and are separated from each other by a framework connective tissue (Figure3a,b). At the higher power magnification, each follicle is covered externally by pseudostratified columnar epithelium called follicular‐associated epithelium that is infiltrated with various goblet cells and stratified cuboidal cells called interfollicular‐associated epithelium that covers the lateral sides of the follicles. Cellular density at this age includes various‐sized lymphocytes, besides reticular cells and a few smooth muscle cells. Additionally, the cortical‐medullary arch‐forming cells (CMAFC) represented the corticomedullary border that separates the external cortex from the internal medulla (Figure3c–e).

At the 24th‐week stage, the involutory alterations were recorded in Figure4a–f, which showed the decline of the surface epithelium, dispersion of vacuolation over the whole plicae and beneath follicles, shrinkage of follicles from elongated to rounded shape and increasing deposition of collagen fibres, reticular fibres and follicular connective tissues. Besides, severe depletion and necrosis were observed at this age.

By comparing the two ages (Figure5a–dand Table2&3), the data analysis revealed that the 24th‐week BF had significantly (p< 0.001) a very thin tunica muscularis (1320.21 ± 177.81 µm) in comparison to the 8thweek (4031.51 ± 159.61 µm) (p< 0.001). Moreover, the number of follicles showed a significant (p< 0.001) decline in the 24thweek (3.82% ± 0.33%) in comparison to the 8thweek (5.33% ± 0.31%) (Figure6a,b). From a histological point, the cortical layer displayed an obvious (p< 0.001) higher thickness (668.09 ± 30.42 µm) in the 24thweek than in the 8thweek (159.16 ± 31.72 µm). Conversely, the medullary region was exposed to a severe (p< 0.001) reduction in its diameter (4896.31 ± 435.85 µm) as age increased in comparison to the early stage (9229.93 ± 567.66 µm) (Figure6c,d). Similarly, the interfollicular epithelial thickness exhibited a significant (p< 0.001) thickness (334.92 ± 77.51 µm) in the 24thweek in comparison to the 8thweek (271.75 ± 44.53 µm). On the other hand, the follicular epithelial cells registered a lower thickness at the 24thweek (102.64 ± 42.22 µm) significantly (p< 0.001) than in the 8thweek (143.63 ± 33.54 µm) (Figure6e,f).

Clearly, at the 8th‐week stage, the bursal surface appeared as elongated foliated follicles that were infiltrated by the bursal lumen. The majority of the bursal surface was perforated and covered with short microvilli. The marginal surface of the plicae comprises wavy portions with raised and depressed pitted areas (Figure7a–d). The follicular surface was lined by follicular‐associated epithelium, and an interfollicular area was covered by interfollicular epithelial cells beside dispersed blebs (Figure7e).

Scale bar: a: 100 µm; b, c, e: 10 µm; d: 3 µm.

The aging of the bursal tissue seemed to be more elongated and more foliated in its arrangement. Additionally, it exhibited a rough surface in the outer follicular and interfollicular surface, with cellular debris and deposition of collagen fibres. Pores and blebs were still dispersed over the follicular surface (Figure8a–e).

Among avian species, BF is considered a vital primary lymphoid organ responsible for the development and maturation of premature lymphocytes, which originate from bone marrow (Deka et al.2020). Various studies revealed that the morphological features of the bursal organ varied among different species of birds. Their shapes varied from round, pear and oval to elongated sacs (Dahariya et al.2020; Indu et al.2005). A similar wall bursal structure was recorded in many species like white pekin duck (Indu et al.2005), geese (Gülmez and Aslan1999; Kadam et al.2023), turkey (Sari and Kurtdede2007), long‐legged buzzards (Sari et al.2015) and chickens (Dahariya et al.2020). It consists of the outer serosa, middle muscularis and inner mucosa layers, whereas the mucosal layer is filled with numerous plica folds containing numerous follicular tissues that are distinguished into an externally densely stained cortical region and an internally lighter stained medullary region. Kuloğlu and Boydak (2023) referred to the 16thweek after hatching as the average age for maximizing the size of the bursa and becoming fully mature, whereas the 20thweek represents the average age of complete involution.

The current study displayed the age‐dependent alterations of common teal ducks on the bursal organ as a primary lymphoid organ. Grossly, BF is a dorsally attached sac of the diverticulum of the cloacal proctodeum. Similar observations were recorded by Ameen et al. (2025) and Ciriaco et al. (2003) in rose male broiler chicken. A similar colour of the current organs in the two investigated age stages was observed in ducks (Sultana et al.2011; Yoon et al.2024). The recent analysis of morphometric measurements of bursal tissue displayed that duck weight increased, and the bursal weight decreased during aging. Mehra and Kumar (2020) confirmed the recent analysis of gizzard weight during aging and added the decrease in gizzard weight and increasing body weight resulting from the decline of organ muscular mass during the involutory age of birds. An analogous decrease in the relative organ weight was illustrated in the liver, kidney, gizzard and spleen of guinea fowls due to a reduction of the skeletal frame around the organ (Musundire et al.2018). This might also be attributed to the width and length of bursal tissue that were registered lower values during the aging stage compared to the early ones. These findings agree with the results of the boiler chicken (Shihah et al.2021). However, the microscopical measurements indicated that both plicae breadth and length showed higher recordings in the 24thweek (Tamilselvan et al.2017). This could be due to the fibrous state's impact on the length and breadth of plicae in the 27thweek in guinea fowl (Numida meleagris).

Histologically, previous literature stated that the normal structure of the bursa forms from the outer serosa, intermediate muscularis layer and inner mucosa. However, the mucosal layer consists of many folds of plicae with numerous follicular follicles of cortical and medullary regions that are stacked with the normal density of lymphocytes and lining follicular and interfollicular epithelial cells (Shukla et al.2022). Similar observations were illustrated in the current study in the 8thweek. Singh et al. (2024) described an analogous histological description of chabro birds. The involuted alterations that were associated with aging deformed the normal organization of the lymphoid follicles. Tamilselvan et al. (2017) illustrated that the 24thweek in bursal age represented the advanced involuted stage inN. meleagrisdue to dispersion of the depleted lymphocytes, which in turn decreased the diameter of the medullary region. The expansion of the cortical region was mostly due to reticular cells as well as the growing deposition of connective tissue fibers. Additionally, Shukla and Karmore (2023) validated the earlier results in Kadaknath and Narmada Nidhi birds and also explained how fatty changes help form epithelial cysts in interfollicular epithelial tissue, which increases the thickness of the follicular‐associated epithelium, and the spread of cytoplasmic vacuolation in the epithelium, which decreases its thickness. The previous changes were registered in the current involuted 24th‐week stage. A similar description was recorded by Gultiken et al. (2010) onAnas platyrhynchosduck in the 13thweek. Another suggestion by Yadav et al. (2020) revealed that the involuntary stage began in the 8thweek in guinea fowl in both sexes. Another study revealed that the rapid involution in the 24thweek was due to the diminutive number of follicles per plicae and the thickness of the tunica muscularis. A similar observation in the number of follicles per plicae was estimated in Sonali chickens by Ayman et al. (2020).

Ultrastructurally, the SEM showed perforated foliated elongated follicles covered by numerous microvilli which spread on the plicae folds at the 8th‐week stage. Follicular‐associated epithelium appeared as polygonal cells lining the follicular tissue. Oláh et al. (2024) indicated that the follicular‐associated epithelium in chickens covered the major surface area due to its capability to mix the intestinal materials or microorganisms that were adsorbed through its apical microvilli into the intercellular spaces, which in turn assisted in their developmental stages. Relative ultrastructure was recorded by Mahanta et al. (2018) in hill fowl at an early age. Moreover, turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) possessed dome‐shaped follicles in the 5thweek (Gultiken et al.2010). The involuntary signs invaded the bursal surface of the duck in the 24th‐week stage by cellular debris, collagen fibre invasion, irregular borders of follicular‐associated epithelium on the surface and absence of microvilli from the follicular surface. Relative registrations were recorded in the turkey (M. gallopavo) by Gultiken et al. (2010) on the 24thweek, and they explained that the disappearance of microvilli was a vital atrophic sign in the involuted tissue. Briefly, the absence of mortality data is a limitation of the current study, as the focus was specifically on short‐term morphological analysis rather than long‐term survival or health monitoring. Future research could benefit from tracking mortality to correlate any potential health impacts with age‐related morphological differences.

The BF plays a crucial role in the immune system of birds, particularly in the development and maturation of lymphocytes. The BF exhibits distinct morphological features across different avian species, with variations in shape and structure. InA. crecca, the BF is described as a dorsally attached sac, similar to observations in other birds like rose male broiler chicken (Talab et al.2022; Ameen et al.2025). The study confirms that the BF consists of three layers: the outer serosa, middle muscularis and inner mucosa, with the mucosal layer characterized by numerous plicae folds containing lymphoid follicles. Additionally, the study identifies critical age stages in the development and involution of the BF, whereas the 8thweek marks the peak of BF development, characterized by well‐organized lymphoid follicles and a normal distribution of lymphocytes, whereas the 24thweek represented the significant involution period, evidenced by a decrease in BF weight, reduction in muscular layer thickness and alterations in the structure of lymphoid follicles, including necrosis and depletion of lymphocytes. Histomorphometric analysis revealed that although the weight of the duck increased with age, the weight of the BF decreased, indicating a decline in its functional capacity. This aligns with findings in other species, such asM. gallopavo(Febriana et al.2023; Yıldırım2024), where similar involution patterns were also observed. The study also noted that the breadth and length of plicae were greater at the 24thweek, suggesting a complex correlation between aging and structural changes in the BF. The SEM findings provide a detailed view of the BF's surface at different ages. At 8thweek, the BF displayed well‐formed follicles with microvilli, essential for immune function. However, by the 24thweek, signs of involution were evident, including the disappearance of microvilli and the presence of collagen fibres, indicating a decline in the organ's functional integrity. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive examination of the age‐related changes in the BF inA. crecca, contributing valuable knowledge to the understanding of avian immunology and the developmental biology of lymphoid organs. The findings underscore the significance of monitoring BF health in poultry management and breeding practices, as the involution of this organ.

In conclusion, the current findings, either gross, histological or ultrastructural observations of common teal bursal tissue, indicate that the developmental alterations and involuntary signs were mainly age‐dependent. Although the 8thweek represented the maximum full maturation of the bursal organ, the 24thweek represented the full involution stage inA. creccaspecies. Thus, the current results align with the previous studies on different avian species and agree with the anatomical and histological features of the bursa during its functional and involutionary phases. Although this study seems to be the first report investigating this organ, as a primary lymphoid organ inA. creccafrom the histological and ultrastructural point of view, our group is currently trying to understand the functional and physiological causes of the structural alterations in this immunological organ.
