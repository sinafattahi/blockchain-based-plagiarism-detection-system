Galls are abnormal plant structures formed through interactions between host plants and insects, providing shelter and nutrients for gall-inducing insects. As distinct insect species can generate unique gall morphologies even on the same host plant, galls are often viewed as an extended phenotype of the insect. However, since galls consist of plant-derived cells, it is also hypothesized that plant factors shape their morphology. Previous studies exploring this possibility have been restricted to one or a few plant species, limiting broad evolutionary inference. Here, we used citizen science observations to analyze gall morphological complexity across 26 plant orders. Quantitative comparisons using fractal dimension indices revealed that stem-derived galls display significantly less morphological variation than leaf-derived galls. After accounting for the phylogeny of both insects and plants, our model indicated that the originating plant organ influences morphological complexity of galls. Our findings suggest that while gall-inducing insects orchestrate gall development, the developmental properties and plasticity of the plant organ modulate the final morphological outcomes. This study provides a large-scale, cross-species analysis of gall formation and illustrates the power of citizen science in studying morphological evolution.

Citizen science has emerged as a powerful tool for biodiversity and ecological studies1. Online platforms enable the public to share observations of organisms, generating a vast amount of biodiversity data that significantly expands the spatial and temporal scope of scientific research2. An influx of publicly contributed data has revolutionized multiple research fields, allowing scientists to reveal large-scale species distribution patterns at unprecedented scales3. One such tool is iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/), a community-driven, free-access platform that allows users to share observations of animals, plants, and other organisms through a dedicated website and mobile application4. Users can upload photos of organisms to iNaturalist, and AI-powered identification suggests possible species, which are then verified by a community of experts and enthusiasts. This approach enables quick and accurate species identification, and iNaturalist has gained increasing recognition among researchers worldwide for its potential applications in biodiversity and conservation researches5. Recent studies have integrated iNaturalist data for species distribution modeling and biodiversity assessment across various taxa. For example, how to track the spread of exotic species and examine geographic variation in traits like color changes in ratsnakes depends on the latitude6melanism in monarch butterfly larvae7and roadkill patterns in rattlesnakes8. Furthermore, iNaturalist has facilitated documentation of rare species9,10and even the discovery of new ones11. Whereas iNaturalist enables instantaneous collection of large-scale global data, community science data must meet quality standards to be effectively utilized in research, as observer bias and data variability can affect the results12,13. To reduce these concerns, advanced statistical approaches have enabled researchers to extract meaningful conclusions from citizen science datasets. This methodology has proven to be particularly effective in biogeography, species monitoring, and conservation studies14–16. Yet, its application to morphological studies and species interactions remains relatively underexplored.

To investigate the potential of citizen science data in morphological studies, we focused on insect-induced plant galls—specialized structures formed by complex plant-insect interactions17,18(Fig.1a). Gall formation is a dynamic and highly specialized process, driven by a combination of mechanical stimuli, chemical stimuli, and genetic responses of insects and plants19. Gall morphology serves important ecological functions for gall-inducing insects, including regulating the microenvironment, nutrient acquisition, and defense against natural enemies20,21. Traditionally, gall morphology has been attributed to the inducing insect species, as different insects generate distinct gall structures even on the same host plant22,23. That is why the galls are considered the `extended phenotype` of gall-inducing insects21. Although gall-inducing insects play a pivotal role in shaping these structures, the developmental properties of plant tissue from which galls arise are likely to influence their final morphology. Previous studies have shown that closely related insect species can induce morphologically diverse galls depending on the plant organ they affect24. A different study suggested that stems have lower morphological plasticity than leaves, potentially resulting in more constrained morphologies of galls25. Such observations suggest that morphological diversity of galls varies partially based on the originating plant organ, which may impose structural constraints on gall development, offering a different perspective from the conventional views. However, these studies have been limited to single or few plant species, leaving a gap in our understanding of whether this pattern holds across diverse plant taxa.

Green circle and pink triangle indicate leaf-derived galls and stem-derived galls respectively. (c,d) The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the log-transformed counts of insect (c) or plant (d) orders recorded in book data and iNaturalist data. Each point represents an order, with its name displayed next to the corresponding point. The solid gray line represents the linear regression trend, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is displayed in the upper-left corner.

To address this limitation, we leveraged the iNaturalist data to conduct a large-scale comparative analysis of gall morphology. By analyzing hundreds of gall observations spanning 26 plant orders, we quantitatively assessed morphological complexity using fractal dimension analysis and tested whether originating plant organ imposes constraints on gall development. Additionally, we applied Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed models (MCMCglmm) to evaluate the relative influence of the plant organ on gall morphology, while accounting for phylogenetic relationships. Our study aims to test the hypothesis that gall morphology is influenced not only by the gall-inducing insect but also by structural constraints imposed by the host plant organ. By integrating large-scale citizen science data, this study demonstrates the potential of community-sourced biodiversity observations for addressing fundamental questions in morphological evolution across diverse taxa.

We first retrieved observation records tagged with the keyword “gall” from iNaturalist (Fig.S1). Most records originated from North America and Europe, although some originated from Brazil, Asia, and Australia (Fig.1b). Because iNaturalist is an unstructured, user-driven platform, its data are susceptible to observer bias26. On the contrary, the illustrated book represents structured sources and often offer more comprehensive coverage of local taxa. To evaluate the randomness of data sampling, the proportions of host plants and gall-inducing insects between iNaturalist and the gall book were compared. Given the most of the location of the iNaturalist-obtained data, the comparison was made to with taxa published in North America (‘Galls of Western United States’)27. We compared the proportions of each insect and plant order, divided into stem-derived and leaf-derived galls. As for plant orders in total, 26 orders were included in the iNaturalist-derived data (Fig.S2a) and 22 orders were included in those derived from the gall book (Fig.S2b). This difference in numbers is probably due to the difference in the size of the area of the acquired data. The number of insect orders retrieved from both data sources were same, six orders (Fig.S2c, d). Diptera were the most common inducer of stem-derived galls in iNaturalist data (64.2%), while Hymenoptera dominated in the book-derived data (44.8%). Despite these differences, the overall correlation in taxonomic frequencies was high (r= 0.97 for insects,r= 0.95 for plants; Fig.S2e, f). Log-transformed counts also showed strong correlation (r= 0.70 for insect order,r= 0.59 for plant order) (Fig.1c, d), suggesting minimal sampling bias in the acquired iNaturalist dataset.

Galls are formed by the combinations of insect and plant species. The number of combinations of insect and plant species at the order level is suggested that most combinations of insect and plant species are less than five (Fig.2a). A heat map presenting the relationship between gall-inducing insect and host plant showed that Hymenoptera–Fagales was the most frequent pairing, followed by Diptera–Fagales (Fig.2b). This result is consistent with previous report that the insect galls induced by the Cynipidae (Hymenoptera) and Cecidomyiidae (Diptera) are found on many Fagaceae (Fagales) plants28. Diptera showed the broadest host range, while Lepidoptera was found to be parasitic on a specific group of plant species (Caryophyllales and Asterales) (Fig.2b). To clarify whether these specific insect–plant combinations determine the diversity of gall morphologies, fractal dimension analysis was performed. Fractal dimension provides a quantitative, scale-independent measure of morphological complexity, capturing structural irregularity and self-similarity more effectively than traditional shape descriptors29–31. This metric allows for objective comparisons across different sizes and biological forms, making it particularly suitable for analyzing intricate structures such as leaves and root morphologies32,33. We quantified the fractal dimension values of all galls and summarized the results by insect order. Values ranged from 1.0 to 1.2 across all orders, with Diptera reaching up to 1.4, indicating its potential to induce highly complex galls (Fig.S3a). However, no significant differences in fractal dimension were detected among insect orders (Wilcoxon rank-sum test,p> 0.1). To further examine whether particular insect–plant combinations generate distinct morphological patterns, we visualized the mean fractal dimension for each insect–plant order pair (Fig.S3b). While some combinations— such as Diptera–Fagales or Mites–Myrtales —appear to yield higher or lower complexity on average, the overall pattern does not indicate any consistent or systematic relationship. That is, morphological complexity varied across combinations but without clear phylogenetic structuring or interaction patterns. This suggests that, although individual cases of high or low complexity exist, the average gall morphology might be difficult to determine by the specific combination of insect and host plant lineages.

(b) Heatmap showing the number of observed combinations between gall-inducing insect and plant orders. The color scale represents the base-10 logarithm of the number of observed insect–plant interactions per order combination. Combinations with only a single observation (n= 1) were excluded to minimize sampling noise.

Given that morphological variation was not significantly different among insect orders, we next examined whether the plant organ of gall origin influences morphological diversity. Galls were categorized as leaf-derived or stem-derived, and their fractal dimensions were compared. The images of stem-derived galls were taken from the side. However, many images of leaf-derived galls were taken not only from the side but also from above or diagonal angle. In order to compare differences in morphological diversity depending on the photo angle, images of leaf-derived galls taken from three different angles were used. Fractal dimension values ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 for leaf-derived galls and from 1.0 to 1.2 for stem-derived galls. Median values were 1.08 for leaf-derived galls (regardless of angle) and 1.06 for stem-derived galls (Fig.3). This variation in morphological diversity was significantly greater for leaf-derived galls, indicating that leaf-derived galls are more complex compared to those derived from stems (Wilcoxon rank sum test,p< 0.05). To test whether this pattern holds within insect groups, we analyzed galls induced by Diptera and Hymenoptera—the two most abundant taxa in our dataset. In both groups, leaf-derived galls showed significantly greater complexity than stem-derived galls (Fig. S4a, 4b), suggesting that the influence of plant organ on gall morphology persists across different insect taxa.

Having found that the originating plant organ influences gall morphological variation, we further quantified the effect of plant organ on gall morphology using a phylogenetically informed Bayesian mixed model (MCMCglmm). The response variable was the fractal dimension of gall morphology, and the explanatory variable was plant organ (leaf vs. stem). To account for potential phylogenetic non-independence, we incorporated phylogenetic relationships among host plant and gall-inducing insect as random effects. This modeling framework allowed us to estimate the fixed effect of plant organ while statistically controlling for shared evolutionary history (i.e., phylogenetic inertia). The MCMCglmm analysis revealed that stem-derived galls exhibited consistently lower fractal dimension values than leaf-derived galls, even after correcting for phylogenetic structure (Fig.4and 95 % credible interval: − 0.0413 to − 0.0093; TableS3). The effect of organ type was statistically significant (pMCMC< 0.001), with the posterior distribution of the stem effect clearly separated from zero, indicating a robust negative effect of stem-derived origin on gall complexity. Moreover, convergence diagnostics confirmed that these inferences are reliable: trace plots for both the leaf effect and stem effect showed rapid mixing without sustained trends, and PSRF values for all parameters were < 1.1 (Fig. S5). To assess the relative contribution of plant organ identity, we compared a set of models with and without the plant organ effect using the residual deviance information criterion (ΔDIC). The model including plant organ as a fixed effect had a moderately better fit than the organ-excluded model (ΔDIC = 7.91) (TableS3), suggesting that plant organ contributes to explaining gall morphology.

The horizontal axis represents the coefficients obtained from the MCMCglmm analysis, showing the fixed effects (originating plant organ; leaf and stem) and random effects (phylogeny of plant and insect). The lines indicate the 95% credible intervals, and the points represent the mean values. An asterisk denotes significant coefficients, where the 95% credible interval does not overlap with zero.

While fractal dimension analysis was useful for quantifying overall morphological complexity across structurally diverse galls, it requires analysis based on binarized images, which inevitably resulted in the loss of certain morphological information. To complement this limitation and assess whether image-based features align with human-perceived complexity, we quantified six morphological traits and conducted principal component analysis (PCA). The traits measured were: (1) aspect ratio, (2) thickness of the gall relative to its organ of origin (relative thickness), (3) deviation from an ideal ellipse (variance from ellipse), (4) number of thorns, (5) color difference from the source organ, and (6) hairiness (Fig.5a). For this analysis, only side-view images of galls were used to calculate the aspect ratio and thickness. The PCA plot revealed a clear separation between stem- and leaf-derived galls, primarily along PC1 (Fig.5b). Stem-derived galls clustered mainly on the negative side of PC1, whereas leaf-derived galls were more widely distributed across the PCA. Leaf-derived galls were more strongly associated with qualitative traits such as color change and hairiness, as well as quantitative features including relative thickness and deviation from elliptical shape. These findings suggest that plant organ influences gall morphology in terms of both qualitative and quantitative traits.

Traditionally, gall morphology has been considered an `extended phenotype` of the gall-inducing insect, determined by insect-specific factors21. In this study, we support this established view and recognize that gall formation is a complex process orchestrated by the insect. The contribution of this study, however, is to highlight the role of the plant organ as the developmental context in which this insect-led manipulation occurs. Specifically, our findings suggest that while the gall-inducing organism directs gall development, the plant tissue can modulate the degree of morphological elaboration enabled by the inducer. The hypothesis that stems exhibit lower morphoplasticity than leaves was previously proposed by Formiga et al.. (2014)25. Whereas their work was limited to a single plant species, our study provides broad phylogenetic validation for this hypothesis by analyzing over 500 observations across 26 plant orders, enabling broader phylogenetic validation for the influence of plant organ-derived factors on gall morphology. Advantages of our research lies in the approach of extracting large-scale trait data from citizen science database, and the quantitative evaluation of morphological complexity using fractal dimension analysis. In addition, the use of Bayesian mixed models that incorporate family-level phylogenies of both insects and plants to test the robustness of our conclusions. Therefore, our study is positioned as a methodological contribution that provides extensive evidence for an existing framework.

The lower morphological diversity observed in stem-derived galls can likely be explained by fundamental physical and developmental differences between stems and leaves. Stems particularly those undergoing secondary growth in woody plants, are characterized by high structural rigidity and lignification34. Such physically and chemically robust tissues may limit cell proliferation and reprogramming in response to insect stimuli. In contrast, leaves are developmentally more plastic, exhibiting higher cellular totipotency and greater sensitivity to hormonal and mechanical signals35–37potentially allowing for more elaborate and diverse morphological responses to insect manipulation. These organ-level constraints may reflect fundamental developmental factors influencing how plant organs respond to insect cues. The MCMC model including plant organ showed a better fit compared to without plant organ, but the ΔDIC was moderate, indicating that other factors such as insect-derived stimuli to determine gall morphology. For example, gall morphology is also known to be influenced by the life cycle duration of the gall-inducing insect38. Insect species with longer life cycles may induce more complex tissue differentiation. From an evolutionary perspective, the greater morphological complexity observed in leaf-derived galls may have important implications for the diversification of gall-inducing insects39. Insects that exploit more developmentally flexible organs may be subject to fewer structural constraints, enabling a broader repertoire of gall forms and possibly enhancing ecological specialization or host manipulation. This view complements prior findings suggesting that leaf-derived galls tend to exhibit higher morphological innovation and host specificity than those induced on stems21,25. These results collectively highlight the importance of integrating both plant and insect factors when examining the evolutionary dynamics of gall formation and morphological diversity.

A critical next step is to move from identifying correlative patterns to elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent transcriptomic studies have revealed that gall-inducing insects broadly activate host developmental regulators involved in cell proliferation, meristem maintenance, and floral organ identity, suggesting a conserved “toolkit” used across taxa40–42. Hormone-related genes, particularly those in the auxin and cytokinin pathways, are also commonly upregulated43,44. However, tissue-specific responses are evident: leaf-derived galls often suppress photosynthesis-related genes, while stem-derived galls downregulate cell wall biosynthetic pathways45,46. These findings suggest that while gall-inducing insects initiate partially similar developmental programs, the resulting morphologies depend on the structural and developmental context of the targeted plant organ. To test these hypotheses mechanistically, experimental systems are needed that allow manipulation of both plant and insect components. The Arabidopsis-based Gall-Forming Assay (Ab-GALFA) offers such a platform, enabling controlled exposure of model plants to insect-derived factors47. This system could be used to test whether the same insect-derived factors elicit distinct responses depending on the plant organ, thereby helping to uncover causal relationships.

While our study demonstrates the utility of a citizen science-based approach, it also has several methodological limitations. First, our dataset is biased toward well-documented regions such as North America and Europe, limiting the global applicability of our findings. Future studies should aim to incorporate data from underrepresented regions rich in biodiversity, such as Southeast Asia and South America, to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of gall morphology worldwide. Second, the number of images used in our analysis (555) is relatively small compared to other iNaturalist studies (for example, the paper on ratsnake color patterns used over 8,000 images6. One reason for the small number is that while color patterns can be analyzed using RGB values, the analysis is limited to high-resolution images when considering the extraction of features with respect to morphology. In other words, the criteria for selecting images have become stricter in order to ensure that the morphological quantifications are reliable. Increasing the dataset size through improved data acquisition methods would enhance the robustness and increase the statistical power of future studies. Another limitation is the potential for misidentification of gall-inducing taxa. One reason for this is that many iNaturalist images of galls capture only the gall structure itself, without showing the insect inside or the full morphology of the host plant, making accurate identification difficult despite distinctive gall morphology. While we attempted to filter for high-confidence records, expert-level identification of gall-forming insects remains still challenging. Consequently, some taxa included in our dataset may be misclassified, which could affect trait associations and phylogenetic modeling. In this situation, deep learning approaches have the potential to improve large-scale morphological analyses. Automated image recognition and classification could facilitate the processing of massive datasets, reducing manual screening efforts and increasing the consistency of morphological assessments48. Given the compatibility of deep learning with large, community-driven databases like iNaturalist, integrating machine learning models could revolutionize future studies on gall morphological diversity.

In conclusion, our study indicates that gall morphology is shaped by the interplay between insect-driven developmental programs and the developmental constraints imposed by the host plant organ. In particular, the high developmental plasticity of leaves appears to permit greater morphological complexity and diversity compared to stems. This finding demonstrates the need to consider both insect and plant factors in understanding gall morphological diversity. Moreover, our study demonstrates how combining large-scale citizen science image data with quantitative morphological analyses such as fractal dimension analysis offers a powerful approach to uncovering the patterns in diverse species interactions and morphological evolution. This approach opens new avenues for research in functional morphology and evolutionary ecology by enabling the use of data covering broad taxonomic and geographic scopes.

The workflow for data acquisition is illustrated in Fig.S1. Gall images and associated metadata were retrieved from iNaturalist.org (retrieval date: July 23, 2023) by selecting only observations labeled as “Research Grade” to ensure basic quality standards. Using the keyword “gall”, we initially obtained approximately 130,000 observations, and the metadata were downloaded via an R script using therinatpackage49. To refine the dataset, duplicate insect species entries were removed, narrowing the dataset to 3,253 observations. Further filtering was applied to select only images that were of high resolution, captured from appropriate angles, and clearly showed the originating plant organ (leaf or stem), along with observations that included location metadata and taxonomic identification of both the host plant and gall-inducing insect at least at the family level. Given the variability in image quality and metadata completeness, manual screening was conducted to ensure that only images meeting these criteria were retained. After filtering, host plant species and insect species were identified to the using taxonomic literature and expert assessment. The final dataset included 555 high-quality gall observations spanning 26 plant orders, and these data were used for subsequent morphological and phylogenetic analyses. All metadata for the final dataset, including taxonomic classifications, are provided in TableS1. To visualize the distribution of iNaturalist observation data, the map was created with the map_data() function in themapspackage50of R (v4.2.1) and added the latitude and longitude information coordinates with iNaturalist observation.

Gall images and metadata were also collected from “Plant Galls of the Western United States” by Ronald A. Russo27. Non-insect-induced galls, such as those caused by bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and mistletoe, were excluded, along with galls of unknown inducers. Ultimately, 422 out of 536 entries were retained for analysis, with exclusions primarily due to missing inducer information, non-insect gall inducers, or insufficient data on host plant identification. Each gall was annotated with the order/family name of its host plant and gall-inducing insect, as well as the originating plant organ. Metadata from the gall book data are listed in TableS2.

The order-level proportions of insect and plant species were extracted from both datasets, and their total percentages were calculated. Correlation analyses were conducted for the number of insect and plant orders in each data source, using both raw counts and log10-transformed values. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated using R (v4.2.1).

To assess which insect-plant combinations were more common in the iNaturalist data obtained, the number of insect-plant combinations at order level was counted and indicated as a histogram. Heatmap also indicated the number of insect-plant combinations in a log scale with removing single combinations of insect-plant.

Gall images were manually classified as leaf-derived or stem-derived ones. Each gall shape was binarized using Photoshop (v26.4.1). Morphological complexity was quantified using fractal dimension analysis with the box-counting method applied to binarized images51,52. We imported JPG files with the import_jpg() function in theMomocspackage53and used the fd.estim.boxcount() function to estimate the fractal dimension in thefractaldimpackage54. The analyses were conducted using R (v4.3.2).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using four quantitative traits and two categorical traits from 50 randomly selected gall images. The measured quantitative traits included: (1) aspect ratio, (2) relative gall thickness compared to the originating plant organ, (3) similarity to an ellipse, and (4) thorn number. The categorical traits included (5) color difference between the gall and the originating plant organ, and (6) hairiness. For color difference, a value of 1 was assigned when the gall exhibited a color change compared to the originating organ (leaf or stem), and 0 when no color change was observed. For hairiness which was evaluated by trichome density and length, a categorical scale was used: 0 for no trichomes, 1 for sparse and short trichomes, 2 for sparse and long trichomes, 3 for dense and short trichomes, and 4 for dense and long trichomes. ImageJ (v1.51) was used for trait measurement. PCA was performed using the prcomp() function in R (v4.2.1) with variables centered and scaled to unit variance (`scale = TRUE`). Raw data of all the measured traits are listed in Table S4.

The following analyses and statistical tests were conducted in R (v4.2.1) using the functions of cor() and wilcox.exact(). Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni correction were used for multiple comparisons.

To evaluate the effect of host plant organ on gall morphological complexity while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence, we fitted a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model implemented in the R packageMCMCglmm55. The model included the fractal dimension value of leaf-, and stem-derived gall as the response variable, assuming a Gaussian error distribution. Plant organ (leaf or stem) was included as a categorical fixed effect. To account for phylogenetic relatedness, we incorporated the phylogenetic relationships among gall-inducing insect families and host plant families as separate random effects. Family-level phylogenetic trees for both insects and plants were obtained in Newick format from TimeTree (https://timetree.org/). These were converted to ultrametric trees using the “Grafen” method inapepackage56. We then calculated the inverse of the phylogenetic covariance matrices using the inverseA() function and supplied these to the `ginverse` argument for the respective random effects. We run the model for 130,000 iterations with a burn-in of 30,000 and a thinning interval of 100. Priors for random effects were specified as weakly informative inverse-Wishart distributions (V = 1,ν = 0.002). Posterior distributions were summarized to obtain the posterior mean, 95% credible intervals, and the MCMC-derivedp-value (pMCMC) for fixed effects. Significance was inferred when the 95% credible interval did not include zero and/or whenpMCMC< 0.05. Model convergence was assessed by visually inspecting trace plots for the fixed parameters (Fig. S5) and by calculating potential scale reduction factors (PSRF) via thecodapackage57. All PSRF values were below 1.1, indicating satisfactory convergence. To evaluate the relative contribution of plant organ and phylogenetic structure, we compared a set of models with and without the fixed effects using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) indicating in TableS3.
