Drawing upon the Social Cure theoretical framework, this study explores the intricate relationship between social inclusion, meaning in life, and resilience among Generation Z during the Israel‐Hamas war. Notably, this cohort encounters heightened challenges in fostering close social relationships, resulting in a diminished sense of social inclusion. The study comprised 317 Israeli Generation Z adults who completed a structured online questionnaire. Results revealed a positive association between social inclusion and resilience, mediated by the presence of meaning in life. These findings underscore the importance of social inclusion in times of crisis in predominantly individualist contemporary Western societies.

Resilience reflects the process of adapting well despite trauma, adversity, tragedy, threats, or other significant sources of stress (American Psychological Association,2014). Numerous studies have shown that resilience is positively correlated with beneficial mental health indicators, including life satisfaction, subjective well‐being, and positive emotions, and negatively correlated with indicators of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and negative emotions (Denckla et al.2020; Hartmann et al.2022; Moret‐Tatay and Murphy2022). According to Zeidner and Kampler (2020), resilience is paramount in times of uncertainty and adversity, as it allows individuals and societies to withstand the immense psychological, social, and economic strains imposed by such challenges, facilitating recovery mechanisms. Therefore, examining factors that contribute to resilience during crises such as wartime is of great importance.

Previous studies have identified that resilience is cultivated by mental, social, and spiritual factors (i.e., Denckla et al.2020; Zeidner and Kampler2020). Based on the Social Cure theoretical framework (Häusser et al.2020), rooted in social identity and self‐categorization (Jetten et al.2017) theories which underscore the importance of social connections for mental well‐being and adaptive psychological functioning, this study seeks to expand the understanding of the intricate relationship between perceived social inclusion, meaning in life, and psychological resilience in times of national crisis characterised by threat and uncertainty among Generation Z. This generation is recognised in the research literature as more challenged in forming close social relationships than previous generations (Dolot2018).

Generation Z, encompassing those born between 1995 and 2012, were raised in a society that transitioned from collectivist to predominantly individualist values of the Western world, amid the rapid technological advancements of the late 20th and early 21st centuries (Takács et al.2021). Their formative years unfolded against the backdrop of the internet, smartphones, and a wealth of digital media. This constant exposure to information significantly shaped their cognitive processes (Ang et al.2022). However, despite their adeptness at using technology, studies indicate that Generation Z individuals exhibit lower engagement in face‐to‐face communication compared to previous generations (Takács et al.2021). Their reliance on digital communication has led to a deficit in essential interpersonal skills. According to Dolot (2018), their social connections, while expansive due to technological advancements, often lack depth, and they encounter challenges in decision‐making and assuming responsibility, particularly in complex and uncertain situations. The COVID‐19 pandemic, which emphasised the significance of adaptability and resilience, illuminated the challenges faced by Generation Z in navigating global uncertainty, particularly intensified by limitations in their interpersonal communication (Ang et al.2022).

Social inclusion refers to one's sense of belonging through social interactions and opportunities to participate, act, and influence within the community (Ahrnberg et al.2022). Cordier et al. (2017) postulate that social inclusion comprises three interconnected dimensions: participation; social connectedness and sense of belonging; and citizenship and rights, incorporating the notions of agency and responsibility within these frameworks. Studies have consistently demonstrated the importance of social inclusion, particularly during periods of crisis. Feeling integrated into one's environment and having the ability to influence it fosters a sense of empowerment and competence and strengthens the overall meaning of one's life (Leemann et al.2022).

Meaning in life embodies the profound conviction that one's existence holds significance and purpose (Kagan et al.2023; Aviad‐Wilchek and Ne'eman‐Haviv2018). Frankl (1984) and theorists who followed him (Steger et al.2006) underscored the pursuit of meaning as a fundamental aspect of human resilience for confronting difficulties and stress. Indeed, extensive research has consistently revealed that individuals who perceive their lives as meaningful tend to experience higher levels of subjective well‐being, quality of life, and optimism (Minkkinen et al.2020; Yıldırım et al.2022). Additionally, they demonstrate greater self‐efficacy (DeWitz et al.2009) and employ more adaptive coping strategies (Edwards and Holden2001). These indicators contribute to strengthening an individual's resilience and to enhancing their capacity to navigate situations of threat and uncertainty (Korte et al.2012).

In light of the relationship evident in the research literature between social inclusion and meaning in life and between meaning in life and resilience, wehypothesisedthat the presence of meaning in life would mediate the positive association between social inclusion and resilience, such that social inclusion would be positively associated with the presence of meaning in life, which in turn would be positively associated with resilience among the Generation Z cohort.

The study comprised 317 Hebrew‐speaking young adults, 35.6% men and 64.4% women, with a mean age of 23.27 (SD = 2.31). The inclusion criterion was belonging to Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2006, i.e., aged 18–27 at the time of the study. Data collection took place from December 2023 to February 2024, during the armed conflict following the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel. Ethical approval was obtained from the university's ethics committee for non‐clinical research involving human subjects. The invitation to participate was disseminated electronically across various online platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp groups. These encompassed student and academic groups, various recreational forums, and community networks. The invitation to participate included a detailed explanation of the study, a link to the research questionnaire, and an informed consent form that participants were requested to sign before accessing the questionnaire. To ensure that only individuals from Generation Z were included, the invitation explicitly stated the relevant age range for the study. Additionally, a filtering question regarding age was incorporated into the questionnaire to exclude those who do not meet the inclusion criteria.

Social inclusionwas assessed using the ten‐item Experiences of Social Inclusion Scale (ESIS; Leemann et al.2022). Participants rated their agreement with each statement on a Likert‐type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (completely agree). The final score was calculated as the sum of responses to all items, yielding scores ranging from 10 to 50, with higher scores indicating higher levels of self‐assessed social inclusion. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale in this study was 0.836.

Presence of meaning in lifewas assessed using a five‐item subscale from the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (revised) (Steger et al.2006). Participants rated each item on a 7‐point Likert‐type scale ranging from 1 (absolutely untrue) to 7 (absolutely true). The final score was calculated as the sum of responses to all items, yielding scores ranging from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating greater presence of meaning in life. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale in this study was 0.876.

Self‐reported resiliencewas assessed by the ten‐item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale‐10 (CD‐RISC‐10; Connor and Davidson2003). Participants rated each item on a 5‐point Likert‐type scale ranging from 0 (not true) to 4 (true nearly all of the time). The final score was calculated as the sum of responses to all items, yielding scores ranging from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating a greater level of resilience. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale in this study was 0.839. Participants' gender and age were also collected as background information.

Descriptive statistics were computed, deriving means and standard deviations for the research variables. No multicollinearity was detected among the independent variables, with the maximum variance inflation factor reaching 1.51. Model 4 PROCESS v4.0 macro for SPSS was utilised (Hayes2022), with social inclusion as the independent variable (X), presence of meaning in life (M1) as the mediator, and resilience as the dependent variable (Y). The analysis involved 10,000 bootstrap samples with a 95% confidence interval (Figure1).

The research hypothesis was fully confirmed. Social inclusion showed a positive association with resilience (β= 0.337,t= 5.37,p< 0.001). Presence of meaning in life mediated the relationship between these two variables. Specifically, social inclusion was positively associated with presence of meaning in life (β= 0.602,t= 13.39,p< 0.001), which in turn was positively associated with resilience (β= 0.167,t= 2.66,p= 008).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the unique interplay between social inclusion, meaning in life, and resilience within the context of war, particularly focusing on Generation Z. The findings of this study support the premises of the Social Cure approach, which posits that social integration, identity, and sense of belonging play a crucial role in enhancing individual well‐being by imbuing life with meaning and fostering resilience (Häusser et al.2020; Wakefield et al.2019).

The results reveal a significant association between social inclusion and psychological resilience, mediated by the presence of meaning in life. This underscores the importance of fostering social connections, particularly during times of actual and potential threat and uncertainty. Despite the challenges faced by Generation Z in forming deep social relationships in everyday life (Takács et al.2021), their resilience in times of crisis appears to be associated with the presence of meaning in life.

These findings demonstrate the importance of social inclusion, which is attained by fostering lasting personal connections despite the predominance of online and impersonal interactions in the present technological era. This is especially crucial in an individualist society that sanctifies the needs of the individual and diminishes the value of the collective. The observed correlation between perceived social inclusion and meaning in life emphasises the significance of cultivating strong social ties in everyday routines, which serve as vital resources for navigating crises and fostering positive adaptation.

Despite the innovative findings, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The use of a convenience sample limits the generalisability of the findings. Moreover, additional significant factors not explored in the current study may also contribute to wartime resilience. Future research should address variables such as intolerance of uncertainty and coping strategies, while comparing between generations, which may help characterise the strengths and challenges of the different generations. Additionally, it is important to emphasise that the mediation model does not ascertain any directionality or establish causation; thus, the possibility of alternative relationships should be considered. It is also advised to conduct a longitudinal study to explore the temporal dynamics of the relationship between social inclusion, meaning in life, and psychological resilience. Such efforts would provide deeper insights into the role of these variables in promoting resilience over time, thereby enriching the scientific knowledge of effective strategies for coping with adversity.
