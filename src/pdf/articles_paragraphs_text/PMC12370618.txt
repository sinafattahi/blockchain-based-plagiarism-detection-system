Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes that modulates gene expression by generating transcript variants. The development of young panicles in rice is a critical stage that determines grain number and weight. However, the regulatory mechanisms and inheritance patterns of APA during this process remain poorly understood. In this study, full-length isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) and metabolome were employed to investigate APA dynamics in the young panicle of hybrid rice variety Wufengyou T025 and in parent lines, Wufeng B and Changhui T025. This analysis revealed that approximately 80% of genes possessed two or more polyadenylation (pA) sites. These APA genes were predominantly enriched in the pathways associated with rice spikelet development, including response to external photoperiod changes, energy production and transportation, protein signal exchange, and amino acid metabolism. Notably, transcripts with a shortened 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) exhibited elevated expression levels of their corresponding genes, suggesting that APA plays an important role in modulating gene expression. Furthermore, the variable 3’UTR of the 25% differentially expressed APA genes contained numerous miRNA binding sites, includingosa-miR1848andosa-miR5075, which are known to influence spikelet development. In the offspring, the expression levels of core APA factors during young panicle development were generally downregulated compared to the parental lines. Additionally, metabolomic analysis identified 209 and 164 differentially abundant metabolites in the offspring relative to Wufeng B and Changhui T025, respectively. Intriguingly, some of the enriched metabolic pathways overlapped with those of differentially expressed APA genes, implying that APA may influence small-molecule metabolites in pathways related to spike development. Collectively, these findings are valuable for understanding the regulation of APA and its genetic basis in young panicle development, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this critical development stage.

Rice (Oryza sativaL.) is one of the most important cereal crops and a staple food for a significant portion of the global population. Panicle differentiation is a critical stage in rice growth and development, encompassing intricate physiological and biochemical processes including apical meristem differentiation, axillary meristem development, and inflorescence structure formation. The development of young panicles is critical as it plays a pivotal role in determining rice yield.

The development of young panicles is a complex biological process regulated by numerous genes, each contributing to specific aspects of spikelet and floral organ development. Key genes involved in this process includeFZP, which influences grain size and sterile lemma fate in rice (Ren et al.2018). The interaction between OsPTB1/2 and CU-rich elements in theFZP3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) mediates the transition from branching to spikelet primordia (Chen et al.2022). This highlights the important role of alternative polyadenylation (APA)-mediated 3’UTR length variation in young panicle development. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms provides valuable insights for breeding high-yielding rice varieties.

APA is a form of alternative splicing that involves the alternative addition of polyA (pA) tails to the 3’UTR of genes, resulting in transcripts with different lengths or proteins with distinct properties (Di Giammartino et al.2011; Chen et al.2017; Alfonso-Gonzalez et al.2023). This process safeguards mature mRNA from unregulated degradation and ensures proper recognition during cytoplasmic export and translation (Passmore et al.2022). By selecting different pA sites, APA significantly influences critical processes such as mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and protein localization (Mitschka et al.2022).

FCA is a nuclear-localized protein containing both a WW domain and RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). This protein can functionally influence flowering time regulation through APA (Quesada et al.2003). The core pA factors CstF77 and CstF64, together with the RNA-binding protein FPA, regulate the APA of antisense transcripts encoded by the key flowering time regulator geneFLC. These antisense transcripts subsequently modulate the expression ofFLCsense transcripts through epigenetic modifications (Simpson et al.2003; Liu et al.2010). The bifunctional LKR/SDH locus in plants encodes a highly active monofunctional lysine-ketoglutarate reductase via an intronic polyadenylation signal, thereby regulating plant developmental processes (Tang et al.2002). APA plays a crucial role in eukaryotic organisms and represents a ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the transcriptome (Hafez et al.2013). As an example in plants,EDM3in Arabidopsis thaliana modulates pA site selection by theRPP7target gene, which confers resistance to downy mildew (Lai et al.2019). APA has been found to be widely involved in plant growth, development, and pathological processes, as revealed by 3'-end sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analyses (Fu et al.2016,2019; Liu et al.2024). APA participates in auxin-mediated plant growth and development, as auxin treatment induces significant changes in APA-related genes (Hong et al.2018). For example, more than half of the genes inMagnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast, exhibit APA phenomena, with a preference for shorter transcripts (Rodríguez-Romero et al.2019). Differential usage of APA in certain genes may also be associated with important agronomic traits inindicaandjaponicarice varieties (Zhou et al.2019). This highlights the importance of APA in rice development, however, the underlying genetic mechanisms governing young panicle development remain poorly understood.

Metabolomics is a powerful technique for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of all metabolites within a specific biological sample under defined conditions (Fiehn et al.2000). By enabling changes in metabolites during plant growth and development to be examined, metabolomics reveals metabolic pathways and mechanisms, providing critical insights for plant breeding, stress resistance research, and related fields (Zhang et al.2016). Despite its potential, the role of APA in the development of young panicles in hybrid rice is not well characterized. Additionally, whether APA influences the metabolites associated with young panicle development remains unclear. Since the genome of hybrid rice is derived from two parents, hybrid rice has a certain heterosis compared with conventional rice, with its yield and resistance generally being higher. Studying the APA and metabolome of hybrid rice would provide insight into the reasons underpinning the formation of heterosis in hybrid rice.

In this study, the key genes and metabolites relating to APA during the development of young panicles of hybrid rice, and that promote the development of young panicles in hybrid rice, were identified through Iso-seq and metabolomics. This study aimed to reveal the molecular rules underlying young panicle development in rice by investigating changes in APA and metabolites during the development of young panicles in parental and hybrid offspring. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for the breeding of high-yielding hybrid rice varieties.

To investigate the regulatory role of APA in the development of young panicles in Jiangxi double-cropping rice and its parental lines, Iso-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced for nine samples, including Wufengyou T025 (Hybrid, F1), its female parent Wufeng B (Maternity, M), and its male parent Changhui T025 (Paternity, P), with three biological replicates for each sample. The obtained samples were subjected to Iso-seq sequencing and metabolome analysis (Fig.1A and Fig. S1). From each of the nine libraries, 19.42–38.82 million clean reads were obtained. Clustering analysis revealed consistent expression patterns among the three biological replicates of each sample, indicating high reproducibility (Fig.1B and C). In the alignment results (Table S1), the mapping rate for all datasets exceeded 70%, confirming the reliability of the data. These findings validated the robustness of the dataset and supported the feasibility of subsequent analyses.

As illustrated in Fig.1B and C, replicate samples consistently clustered together within tissue samples, with hybrid and paternity showing closer clustering relationships. The principal component analysis (PCA) plot revealed differences between different varieties. In summary, the data demonstrated good repeatability and revealed distinct varietal differences, which were subsequently analyzed.

The polyA clusters (PACs) within genes were analyzed (Fig.2A). Nearly 80% of genes contained two or more PAC loci, indicating widespread APA events in Hybrid, Paternity, and Maternity during young panicle development. To determine the primary genomic regions where APA occurs and to study its distribution, the distribution of pA loci was analyzed (Fig.2B). The results demonstrated that most pA loci were in the 3’UTR, with some also found in 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) and introns, coding sequences (CDSs) and other regions.

Changes in 3’UTR length have been reported to regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level, and may also influence mRNA stability and translation efficiency at the post-transcriptional level (Lima et al.2017). To investigate the relationship between 3’UTR length variation and gene expression levels, the association between 3’UTR changes and corresponding changes in gene expression was analyzed (Fig.2F and I). The results revealed that the relative expression of genes significantly increased when 3’UTR length was significantly shortened in both parental and offspring lines. This suggests that changes in 3’UTR length during spike development can influence gene expression levels.

Additionally, most eukaryotic mRNA contains a non-templated pA tail downstream of the 3’UTR, which plays a critical role in mRNA stabilization and intracytoplasmic transport (Jia et al.2022). To explore the relationship between pA tail length and gene expression, pA tail length was measured across samples, revealing that pA tail length in Wufengyou T025 was longer than in its parental lines (Fig.2C). Furthermore, the median pA tail length was correlated with gene expression levels to generate trend analysis plots (Fig.2D, E, G, H). The analysis showed that as pA tail length increased, transcript expression levels decreased. This was possibly because overlong pA tails may promote mRNA degradation, leading to reduced transcript expression levels.

To investigate the functional implications of differential APA genes, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed (Fig.3A and B). This revealed distinct biological processes associated with the offspring compared to the parental lines. Compared to Maternity, Hybrid exhibited significant enrichment in several biological processes, including riboflavin biosynthesis, cell differentiation, and protein ubiquitination. In contrast, when compared to Paternity, Hybrid APA genes were predominantly enriched in processes such as mitotic cell cycle, auxin-activated signaling pathway, and cortical cytoskeleton organization. These findings suggested that differential APA genes play important roles in diverse biological pathways, potentially contributing to the developmental regulation of young panicles in rice.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was also employed to annotate and functionally enrich the differentially expressed APA genes (Fig.3C, D). These genes were predominantly enriched in metabolic processes, genetic information processing, cellular processes, and physiological systems. Compared to Maternity, the differentially expressed APA genes in Hybrid were significantly enriched in pathways such as circadian regulation in plants, vitamin B6 metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and nucleotide sugar biosynthesis. In contrast, compared to Paternity, the differentially expressed APA genes were primarily enriched in fatty acid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways. These pathways collectively influence the development of young panicles by providing energy, synthesizing hormones, and regulating cellular metabolism.

A significant number of paternal and maternal APA genes were shared with offspring. As genes exhibiting lengthening or shortening may be inherited by the offspring from the parent during this process, Venn analysis was performed on the lengthening and shortening genes separately. The analysis revealed 641 identical genes in the lengthening group and 1369 identical genes in the shortening group (Fig.4A, B). This suggests that these genes may be relatively stable during genetic transmission and could play an important roles.

Next, the functions of these common genes were analyzed (Fig.4C, D). GO terms associated with both lengthening and shortening were related to enzyme and energy metabolism. This indicated that these GO terms are crucial for ensuring the stability of related reactions and energy supply during rice panicle development. Among the shared lengthening genes, functions included enzyme regulatory activity, protein binding, and responses to external stimuli. In the shared shortening genes, functions included signal receptor binding and enzyme regulatory activity.

Additionally, GO functional analysis was performed on the unique APA genes (Fig. S2). The unique lengthening maternal APA genes were primarily enriched in biological processes such as structural molecular activity, signal receptor binding, while the unique shortening maternal APA genes were primarily enriched in chromosome binding, protein binding. For Paternity, the unique lengthening APA genes were enriched in biological functions related to DNA binding and ribosomes, while the unique shortening genes were associated with structural molecular activity, ribonucleic acid binding.

Previous studies have indicated that the expression levels of pA core factors play a crucial role in regulating gene APA. Consequently, the expression patterns of pA factors during young panicle development in rice were analyzed (Fig.4E, F). The results revealed a significantly higher number of downregulated compared to upregulated pA factor genes in offspring relative to the parental generation. To validate these findings, reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to validate the relative expression of nine pA core factors (Fig.4G). The results demonstrated marked downregulation of the expression levels ofCfim-25,CPSF30,CPSF160,CstF50,PAP,PAP1,PAP2,PAP4,Fip[v],CstF77,CstF64, andCPSF73in offspring during young panicle development compared to the parental generation. OnlyPAP2,Clpl, andPabp2were upregulated. In Hybrid, transcript elongation during young panicle development may have correlated with the downregulation of APA core factor expression. Notably,CstF50andCPSF30exhibited significant downregulation in Hybrid compared to Maternity, whileCfim-25andPAPdisplayed marked downregulation compared to Paternity. Conversely,Clp1andPabp2expression levels were significantly higher in the offspring than in the parental lines. The changes in the expression levels of these factors indicated the occurrence of APA phenomena in genes related to the development of young panicles in rice.

APA alters the length of 3’UTRs during gene processing. These dynamic changes can lead to the gain or loss of miRNA binding sites, thereby modulating the expression levels of target genes and potentially influencing young panicle development in rice. To investigate whether APA events during young panicle development affect miRNA binding, miRNA binding sites within the variable 3’UTR of APA genes were predicted, and the proportion of differentially expressed APA genes containing varying numbers of miRNA binding sites was quantified (Fig.4H). Notably, nearly 25% of these APA genes were predicted to contain miRNA binding sites within their variable 3’UTR. Further analysis of miRNA site utilization (Fig.4I) revealed thatosa-miR5075—previously implicated in drought resistance and stomatal regulation in rice (Raza et al.2023)—exhibited the highest binding frequency in both Maternity and Paternity. Additionally,osa-miR1848—predicted to bind within the variable 3’UTR and linked to cell proliferation and differentiation in rice (Xia et al.2015)—was also prominently identified. These findings suggest that APA-mediated changes in 3’UTR length may dynamically regulate miRNA binding, thereby fine-tuning gene expression and contributing to the development of young panicles in rice.

In this study, two criteria (p < 0.05 and VIP > 1) were used to screen for differentially expressed metabolites. The direction of regulation was evaluated by Log2FC (upregulated on the positive value table and downregulated on the negative value table). The results identified 209 differentially expressed metabolites in Hybrid compared with Maternity, of which 164 were downregulated and 45 were upregulated (Fig.5A). A total of 164 differential metabolites were identified in Hybrid compared with Paternity, of which 108 were downregulated and 56 were upregulated (Fig.5B). The cluster heatmap revealed significant upregulation of most metabolites in Hybrid (Fig. S3).

Venn analysis revealed 90 common differentially expressed metabolites between the parents and the offspring (Fig.5C), mainly organic acids and their derivatives. These metabolites were significantly enriched in three major pathways, including amino acid anabolism (valine/leucine/isoleucine biosynthesis), energy transport hub (TCA cycle and carbon metabolism), to provide energy support for young spike growth, and quality regulation pathways (starch and sucrose metabolism), which would improve carbohydrate accumulation and rice quality (Fig.5D, Fig. S4).

Functional annotation showed that amino acid biosynthesis accounted for the largest proportion of the metabolic pathways and was directly involved in the formation of young spikelets and growth regulation (Fig.5E, F). K-means clustering revealed that Class 3 clusters (with similar paternity) were enriched in tryptophan, proline, and other amino acids. Of these, proline promotes rice growth (Suekawa et al.2019) and tryptophan enhances innate immunity (Kang et al.2007) (Fig. S5).

Metabolite differences between Hybrid and both parents primarily related to amino acid synthesis and energy metabolism pathways, with the TCA cycle and carbon metabolism stabilizing energy supply and starch/sucrose metabolism optimizing quality. These metabolic reprogramming phenomena provide a molecular basis for hybrid rice phenotypic differentiation, such as yield and resistance enhancement.

To explore whether APA influences small molecule metabolites in pathways critical to young panicle development in rice, the pathways enriched in APA genes were compared with pathways enriched in metabolites (Fig. S6). The analysis revealed substantial overlaps between the pathways associated with differential APA genes and those linked to differentially expressed metabolites. These shared pathways included amino acid metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and TCA cycle (Fig. S7). This finding suggests that APA genes modulate the levels of small-molecule metabolites within these metabolic pathways during young panicle development. Such regulation likely contributes to the observed phenotypic differences in growth and development between the offspring and parental lines, highlighting the interplay between post-transcriptional regulation and metabolic dynamics in shaping rice panicle architecture.

APA regulates the development of young panicles by changing the pA sites of gene transcripts related to spike development. This produces mRNA variants with different 3’UTR lengths, which affects their stability and translation efficiency. A comparison of the usage of pA sites in transcripts between Hybrid, Maternity and Paternity revealed that nearly 80% of genes contained two or more pA sites, indicating widespread APA during young panicle development in rice. This aligned with previous studies showing that the usage of multiple pA sites is common across species, for example, over 70% of genes in mammals and yeast (Cao et al.2019; Zeng et al.2019), 70% of genes inArabidopsis thaliana(Wu et al.2011), and 50% of rice genes during rice development (Dong et al.2007). Genes with two pA sites in Hybrid exhibited a tendency toward transcript elongation. A comparative analysis of pA site usage and 3’UTR length changes revealed that offspring preferentially utilized distal pA sites, leading to longer 3’UTRs. This mirrored findings in early rice development, where distal pA site usage dominates in germinating seeds compared to dry seeds (Fu et al.2016).

APA genes were enriched in photoperiod response, energy production and transport, protein signaling, and amino acid metabolism during young panicle development. Disrupted circadian rhythm increases spikelet sterility, while alanine and aspartic acid imbalances impair growth (Wang et al.2019a,b; Desai et al.2021). Interestingly, a comparison of the KEGG enrichment pathways for Paternity and Maternity revealed that both were enriched in pathways related to amino acid metabolism, such as alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. The geneHd1,which induces short-day responses in rice, was also identified within the KEGG pathway for circadian rhythm in plants (Hu et al.2022), as well as the geneOsMADS17,which regulates grain weight in rice, within the nucleotide metabolism pathway (Li et al.2023). Additionally, enrichment in proteasomes and ubiquitination-related pathways was observed, with studies indicating that ubiquitination plays a critical role in regulating rice growth and development (Lourenco et al.2015). Enriched pathways were also closely associated with the synthesis of the plant hormone auxin, with a previous study showing auxin to be a key regulator during young panicle development (Zhang et al.2023). For example, auxin regulates the fate of spikelet meristems and inflorescence structure (Deveshwar and Prusty2020). Carbon and nitrogen metabolism–related pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway, pyruvate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism, provide carbon and nitrogen skeletons and energy for the growth of young panicles (Qu et al.2021). Photosynthesis-related pathways—such as photosynthesis-antenna protein and carbon fixation in photosynthesis—supply energy and organic matter for the development of young panicles, providing the basis for their differentiation and growth (Ouyang et al.2022). Fatty acid metabolism provides the material basis for plant cell membrane synthesis and cell signaling, which may be important for cell division and elongation in young panicles (Yang et al.2024a,b). In conclusion, APA affects young panicle development by regulating genes in multiple pathways such as energy, hormones, and cellular metabolism.

It was also found that APA may regulate gene expression by affecting miRNA binding sites, thereby playing a role in the development of young panicles in rice. Genes with shortened 3’UTRs tended to be upregulated. Additionally, 25% of APA genes with variable 3’UTRs were predicted to contain miRNA binding sites, including some previously reported small RNA molecules such asosa-miR1848andosa-miR5075, which are known to influence the development of young panicles in rice (Xia et al.2015; Raza et al.2023). These findings underscore APA as an important regulatory mechanism in young panicle development.

Analysis of APA core factors revealed widespread downregulation in offspring compared to parents. Notably,Clp1overexpression in offspring correlated with transcript elongation, consistent with its reported role in promoting longer 3’UTRs when active (Li et al.2015). Conversely, reduced expression ofCstF50andcfim-25in Hybrid versus Maternity and Paternity, respectively, likely contributes to 3’UTR shortening. Studies linkCPSF30to pA signal selection inArabidopsis, with mutations in this gene causing widespread APA alterations in downstream genes (Thomas et al.2012; Chakrabarti and Hunt.2015), while PAP-Fip(III) interactions extend pA tails (Forbes et al.2006). Structural mutations inCstF50also favor shorter 3’UTRs (Yu et al.2019). A cellular system study found thatcfim-25knockout resulted in numerous genes using proximal pA sites (Li et al.2015). All of these findings suggest that the significant downregulation of factors such asCstF50andcfim-25in Hybrid played an important role in shortening the relevant genes, and highlight the conserved role of pA core factors in regulating transcript length and developmental processes.

The inheritance of APA was found to predominantly derive from the maternal parent. The number of differential APA events between Hybrid and Maternity was fewer than those between Hybrid and Paternity. The inheritance patterns of differentially expressed metabolites were similar to those of differentially expressed APA genes. PCA clustering and comparative analyses indicated that Hybrid shared closer APA similarities with Maternity than Paternity. Global APA site usage rates and overlapping differentially expressed APA genes further supported maternal inheritance. This was very similar to the findings of a previous study, in which the hybrid and maternal transcriptome profiles were similar (Cheng et al.2023). There were fewer differentially expressed APA genes in Maternity than in Paternity, in relation to Hybrid. The pronounced maternal dominance in APA patterns may be linked to unique mechanisms in plant gametophyte development. For example, a distinct APA regulatory network has been observed in mature pollen (Fu et al.2016). The egg cell may influence the initial regulatory program of the zygotic genome by selectively retaining maternal mRNA. Leveraging this characteristic, future breeding strategies could involve screening maternal lines possessing superior APA patterns (e.g., long 3'UTR haplotypes of key panicle development genes) to design more efficient hybrid breeding programs.

Metabolomic analysis revealed that organic acids and organic oxygen compounds constituted a significant proportion of the metabolite composition. Compared to the two parental lines, more small-molecule metabolites were upregulated in the offspring. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites suggested that small-molecule metabolites, particularly organic acids, play a critical role in the development of young panicles in hybrid rice. Amino acids provide the primary nitrogen source for rice development, significantly impacting crop growth and yield. Studies have demonstrated that agricultural soils contain substantial amounts of soluble organic nitrogen, with amino acids representing the largest dissolved nitrogen pool (Weigelt et al.2005). Comparative analysis of KEGG-enriched pathways from metabolomic and differential APA data revealed significant overlaps, including pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle, and arginine and proline metabolism. Previous studies have shown that small-molecule metabolites like citric acid can regulate rice growth (Yang et al.2024a,b), while the TCA cycle indirectly influences plant growth through energy metabolism (Berkowitz et al.2016). Additionally, increased proline content has been shown to be beneficial to rice growth (Suekawa et al.2019). These results collectively indicated that APA may modulate the levels of small-molecule metabolites in pathways critical to the growth and development of young panicles in hybrid rice, thereby contributing to panicle development.

The differential expression of APA core factors, such as Clp1 and cfim-25, in Hybrid revealed a dosage reshuffling model for heterosis—3'UTR lengthening factors (Clp1) and shortening factors (cfim-25) exhibited divergent expression. This disrupted the inherent APA homeostasis of the parents and created novel transcript diversity. This differential expression may influence phenotypes through two pathways. One is the escape regulation of key genes. Shortened 3'UTRs enable certain genes (e.g., auxin biosynthesis–related genes) to escape miRNA suppression (e.g., byosa-miR1848), leading to their upregulated expression and directly promoting cell division in young panicles. The other is enhanced pathway coordination. APA variation in metabolic pathway genes (e.g., pyruvate kinase) can synchronize carbon/nitrogen metabolic flux, providing flexible carbon skeletons and energy supply for young panicle development. This model offers a new perspective for deciphering the genetic basis of complex agronomic traits.

This study provides novel insights into the variation patterns and genetic mechanisms of genes involved in young panicle development in hybrid rice and its parents, integrating APA and metabolomics perspectives. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying APA gene regulation during young panicle development in hybrid rice remain to be fully elucidated. Furthermore, the specific roles of APA core factors in mediating APA changes in related genes during this biological process require further investigation.

The experimental materials—paternity (Changhui T025, indica conventional rice), maternity (Wufeng B, indica conventional rice), and hybrid rice (Wufengyou T025, the indica three line hybrid rice) were planted in the same rice field in the experimental field of Jiangxi Agricultural University. Wufengyou T025 was cultivated by Haohua He 's research group from the College of Agriculture, Jiangxi Agricultural University. The panicle phenotypes of the hybrid lines and their parent lines in supplement (Fig. S8) or refer to the published study of our research group (Chen et al.2018). Ten plants per row were planted in five rows. Before rice heading, the rice plants were cut, and the young panicles were peeled from leaf sheath, then stored separately according to their development stages. These stages included the branch primordium and spikelet differentiation stage to the stamen formation stage (about stage 3 of panicle differentiation), with spikelets varying from none to approximately 1 cm in length during this period. Each stage was mixed well, and three biological replicates were taken from each, with each biological replicate being a mixed sample containing 30 spikelets. These were put into liquid nitrogen and then stored in an ultra-low temperature freezer at –80 °C for later use.

Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method (Meng and Feldman.2010). mRNA libraries were constructed using ONT’s library preparation kits (Ip et al.2015). The libraries were sequenced using high-throughput Oxford Nanopore Technology (Stancu et al.2017; Alonge et al.2020).

Libraries for Oxford Nanopore sequencing were constructed using high-quality high molecular weight (HMW) RNA (Wang et al.2021). RNA was sheared to ~ 20 kb and purified using a 1 × AMPure XP bead cleanup. Next, RNA size selection was performed using the Short Read Eliminator kit. Library preparation was performed with 1.5 μg of size-selected HMW RNA, using the Ligation Sequencing Kit SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Libraries were loaded on PromethION flow cells and sequenced according to standard protocols. Runs were basecalled with Guppy v2.1 (Samarakoon et al.2023). Basecalling was performed using the PromethION r9.4.1 model using the recommended settings for the SQK-LSK109 kit and FLO-PRO001.

An Agilent 7890 gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer was used with a DB-5MS capillary column. A sample (1 μL) was injected in the split-free mode. The carrier gas was helium with a pre-inlet purge flow rate of 3 mL min–1and an intra-column gas flow rate of 1 mL min–1. The initial temperature was maintained at 50 ℃ for 1 min, then increased to 310 ℃ at a rate of 10 ℃·min–1, and then held at 310 ℃ for 8 min. The injection temperature was 280 ℃, the transfer line temperature was 280 ℃, and the ion source temperature was 250 ℃. In electronic shock mode, the energy was –70 eV. Raw mass spectrometry data were obtained in full-scan mode at a rate of 12.5 spectra per second from 50–500 m/z after a solvent delay of 6.4 min. Raw data analysis, including peak extraction, baseline adjustment, deconvolution, alignment, and integration, was performed using Chroma TOF (V 4.3x, LECO), and metabolite identification was performed by matching mass spectrometry and retention indexes using the LECO-Fiehn Rtx5 database. Finally, metabolite peaks detected in less than half of the QC samples or with RSD > 30% in the QC samples were removed.

Iso-seq is a sequencing technology based on the Nanopore platform (Al'Khafaji et al.2024). It can accurately quantify the pA tail length of transcripts, analyze alternative splicing, fusion genes, identify new isoforms, accurately quantify transcript expression levels, and deeply analyze the role of pA tails in gene expression regulation. Minimap2 (Li et al.2018) was used to align the reads to the indica rice cultivar R498 genome (Du et al.2017) and retrieve the reads from the BAM file. Quantify poly (A) (Ye et al.2021) was used to identify, cluster, and annotate pA sites. TaPas (Arefeen et al.2018) was used to analyze APA genes. Padj and ΔPSI (PolyA Site Usage Index difference) were used to determine whether the APA gene was present. Padj < 0.05 and ΔPSI ≥|20%| were used to identify differentially expressed APA genes, with ΔPSI < –20% and ΔPSI > 20% identifying shortening and lengthening genes, respectively.

The reads count data after alignment for each sample were used to normalize the expression data of the transcripts, following which DESeq2 (v1.26.0) (Love et al.2014) was used for differential expression analysis. The repetition was integrated by taking the mean, and the log2FC and pasj values were combined to determine whether there was differential expression. The gene differential expression screening threshold was padj < 0.05 and |log2FoldChange|> 1.

Venn and Upset Polt tools in Tbtools (Chen et al.2023) were used to compute Wien scores for differentially expressed pA genes. By entering the differentially expressed pA genes from different samples, Venn diagrams of the differentially expressed genes and each category were generated.

The protein sequence of R498 (Du et al.2017) was submitted to eggNOG-mapper (Cantalapiedra et al.2021) for functional annotation of all its genes. The results were imported into TBtools using GO Enrichment and KEGG Enrichment. The analyse function was used to enrich and annotate the functions of differentially expressed pA genes, with an enrichment result threshold of p < 0.05.

The pA gene coordinates were obtained by aligning to R498 genomic information (Du et al.2017). Then, the proximal and distal 3’UTRs were extracted by Tbtools Sequences between pA sites, reusing the psRNATarget (Dai et al.2018) prediction of miRNA binding sites for the 3’UTR sequence of the differentially expressed APA genes.

Metabolites were extracted using mixtures of methanol, water, and L-2-chlorophenylalanine configurations, and all samples were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (Kusano et al.2015). Replicates were integrated by taking the mean value and combining the p-values and logFC values to determine whether a metabolite was differentially expressed.
