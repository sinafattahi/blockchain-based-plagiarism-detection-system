Despite the promising results of CAR-T cell therapy, still a significant proportion of patients experience treatment failure due to absence of response, progression or treatment-related toxicities. Our research aims to investigate how the CAR-T cell product characteristics and particularly the percentage of CAR-negative cells present in the infusion product affects its efficacy and safety.

CAR-positive (CAR-pos) and CAR-negative (CAR-neg) cells were analyzed during in vitro expansion with IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15. FACS-sorted populations were assessed for cytotoxic effect and secretion of cytokines. Transcriptomic analyses were conducted for CAR-pos and CAR-neg populations.

A significant reduction in the percentage of transduced (CAR-pos) T cells was observed throughout the in vitro cell culture, where CAR-neg T cells displayed greater expansion along the procedure compared to CAR-pos T cells, using either IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15. CAR-pos T cells exhibited increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. Comparative analyses of CAR-pos and CAR-neg showed an increased cytotoxic effect in purified samples with 100% CAR-pos T cells compared to non-purified product. Quantification of cytokine levels revealed a significant decrease in IL-6 in purified compared to non-purified products. RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant differential gene expression profile between CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells, the prior exhibiting an upregulation of genes associated with immune checkpoint regulation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and Th1/Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation pathways.

CAR-neg T cells exhibit a significantly greater expansion compared to CAR-pos T cells alongside CAR-T cell production. The percentage of CAR-neg cells influences the specific cytotoxicity of the product and on the cytokine pattern, which might influence both efficacy and toxicity and, therefore, the number of CAR-neg T cells within the infusion product must be considered in the clinical setting. Purification of CAR-pos T cells could potentially optimize product characteristics.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, achieving remarkable remission rates in relapsed/refractory (R/R) hematological malignancies. The 2017 FDA approval of the first two commercial CAR-T products has enabled treatment of over 34,000 patients to date. Since then, four additional CAR-T therapies have gained FDA approval [1–3]. Complete responses (CR) in R/R B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have reached 71–81% in multicenter trials [4,5] and overall response rates (ORRs) of 73–98% have been reported in R/R multiple myeloma (MM) [6–10]. Consequently, CAR-T therapy has become a cornerstone in treating hematologic malignancies, with indications expanding to earlier lines of therapy [2,3,6,11].

Nonetheless, long-term relapses remain common, and treatment-related toxicities are a major concern. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are the most frequent adverse events. Although their pathophysiology is not fully understood, current evidence suggests that cytokines secreted by T-cells activate myeloid cells, triggering further cytokine release and establishing a positive feedback loop known as cytokine storm [12–15].

Factors such as tumor burden, CAR-T design, and cell dose have been linked to CRS and ICANS [16–21]. While higher CAR-T doses often correlate with more severe toxicities, a consistent dose–response relationship is not always observed [22]. Rotte et al. proposed an optimal CAR-T dose that maximizes efficacy without increasing toxicity, suggesting that beyond this point, dose escalation adds risk without clinical benefit [22,23]. Current autologous CAR-T manufacturing quantifies dosage based solely on CAR-pos T-cells, overlooking the CAR-neg fraction. This results in substantial variability in total infused T-cell numbers across and within studies, complicating the establishment of a standardized optimal dose [24,25].

To address these issues, our study aimed to improve CAR-T safety by analyzing our academic second-generation anti-BCMA CAR (CARTemis-1). We conducted immunophenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiling of both CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells to evaluate the impact of CAR-neg populations on the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy.

Human CD3 + cells were isolated, activated with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Gibco, 11131D) and transduced with an anti-BCMA CAR-T lentiviral vector co-expressing EGFRt as a safety/detection marker (CARTemis-1). Transduced cells were expanded with 50 IU/mL IL-2 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-097-743) or 10 ng/mL IL-7 and IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-095-367, 130–095-765) in RPMI (Gibco, 61870036) with 1% Pennicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 10270-106). Media was exchanged on alternate days and cytokines were added for 21 days.

Data from 31 Tisagenlecleucel products generated for patients with B-ALL or lymphoma were obtained after written informed consent. Percentage of CAR-pos cells, total cells/mL, volume and cell viability of the infused product were obtained from the Certificate of Analysis (CoA). CAR-pos/CAR-neg ratio was calculated by dividing the number of CAR-pos cells by the number of CAR-neg cells present in each product and correlated with CRS and ICANS data.

Cells were stained according to the antibodies and reagents described in Supplementary Table 1. CAR transduction was monitored by anti-EGFR staining (Biolegend, 352906) and immunophenotype characterization was performed according to Supplementary Table 1. Cell viability was analyzed by 7AAD- staining (BD Bioscience: 559925). Stained samples were acquired using a BD FACS Canto II and analyzed using FlowJo™ v10.7 Software (BD Life Sciences) and Infinicyt 2.0 (Cytognos) software.

Different transduction enhancers were used, and transduction efficiency and cell proliferation were analyzed for 13 days of in vitro culture (n = 6). Polybrene 5 ug/mL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-134220), LentiBoost 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL (SIRION Biotech: SB-P-LV-101–01) and Vectofusin-1 10, 40, and 80 ug/mL (Miltenyi Biotec, 130–111-163) were added prior lentivirus and spinoculation following manufacturer’s instructions. Cell numbers and percentage of live CAR + cells were monitored for 13 days. Correlation between transduction and cell proliferation was assessed using Spearman’s Rho correlation.

CAR-pos and CAR-neg were purified by FACS from CARTemis-1 final product (n = 3). Total CARTemis-1 product was also sorted by CD3 + as control (non-purified product). Gating strategy is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 5. Cytotoxic activity from both purified populations and mixed CAR-pos/CAR-neg populations (n = 3) was analyzed in a bioluminescence-based assay using firefly luciferase (ffluc)-transduced target-cells at 5:1 effector-to-target-cell (E: T) ratio. IL-6, IFN-γ and GM-CSF secretion were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Biolegend) (n = 3) in supernatants obtained after a 24-h co-culture of T-cells (effector, E) with autologous PBMCs and target cells (E: PBMCs: target ratio of 5:5:1, respectively).

RNA from CAR-pos and CAR-neg FACS cells from three independent donors (n = 3) was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 741049). cDNA library construction and Illumina sequencing were performed by NovoGene (Cambridge). The DEGs between the two samples were identified if they had a log2 (fold change) <  − 0.5 or > 0.5 and q (adjusted p value) < 0.05. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to analyze the gene enrichment of the DEGs, and those with corrected p < 0,05 were considered as significantly enriched Gene ontology terms and pathways respectively.

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software v6.07 (GraphPad, San Diego, California). Unpaired and paired t-tests were used to analyze data from in vitro experiments. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The measurements per group were described by mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). When the qq plots showed no normally distributed data and due to the small sample size, non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used as significance test for comparing the measurements between groups.

CARTemis-1 is an academic anti-BCMA CAR-T containing 4-1BB costimulatory domain and the truncated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt) [26] (Supplementary Fig. 1). The percentage of CAR-pos T-cells was significantly reduced throughout the ex vivo expansion both in CD4 and CD8 compartments and with both IL-2 and IL-7/IL-15 (n = 9) (e.g. CD4 + CAR-pos cells on day 8 was 37.83% vs 15.49% on day 15 with IL-7/IL-15, p < 0.0001) (Fig.1A). Cell count of both populations confirms that CAR-neg cells expand significantly more rapidly with both cytokine cocktails (e.g. cell count of CD4 + CAR-pos cells on day 15 was 2.08 e6vs 3.45e6CD4 + CAR-neg cells with IL-7/IL-15, p = 0.001) (Fig.1B). Cell viability was monitored along the manufacturing and no significant differences were observed (Supplementary Fig. 2).

This was confirmed during CARTemis-1 production on the CliniMACS Prodigy under GMP standards. Percentage of CAR-pos cells significantly decreased, and this correlated with a greater expansion of CAR-neg cells (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Lentiviral enhancers were tested to improve T-cell transduction and to assess their correlation with cell expansion (n = 6). Polybrene and LentiBoost significantly enhance lentiviral transduction compared to lentivirus alone in a dose-dependent manner (e.g. transduction with LentiBoost 1 mg/mL was 53.78% vs 36.32% with lentivirus alone, p = 0.0003) (Fig.1C). However, Vectofusin-1 significantly reduced lentiviral transduction (e.g. transduction percentage with Vectofusin-1 at 80 ug/mL was 20.50% vs 36.32% with lentivirus alone, p = 0.002) (Fig.1C). Confirming our previous results, we observed a significant inverse correlation between transduction and cell expansion during ex vivo cell culture (e.g. Spearman’s rho = -0.8594, p < 0.0001) (Fig.1D). Therefore, as the proportion of CAR-pos cells increases in the culture, the overall fold expansion decreases due to their intrinsically lower proliferative capacity compared to CAR-neg cells.

In conclusion, during CAR-T production, CAR-neg T-cells expand to a greater extent which translates into the dilution of CAR-pos T-cells and the reduction of the percentage of CAR-pos in the final product. These data suggest that expansion time is another variable to consider in the production process, validating in each case the optimal expansion time for each CAR product.

Immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry throughout the manufacturing procedure ex vivo. T-cell subpopulations were analyzed according to the following parameters: naïve (CCR7 + /CD45RA + /CD45RO-), central memory (CM) (CCR7 + /CD45RA-/CD45RO +), effector memory (EM) (CCR7-/CD45RA-/CD45RO +) and effector (EMRA) (CCR7-/CD45RA + /CD45RO-) (n = 5). No significant differences were observed between CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells in T-cell subpopulations at day 10 post-expansion with either IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15 (Fig.2). Similarly, no differences were observed at different time points post-activation (Supplementary Fig. 4).

T-cell activation and exhaustion markers were also assessed by flow cytometry throughout the manufacturing procedure (n = 5). The percentage of CD25 + CD69 + was significantly increased in CAR-pos T-cells both with IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15 in the CD4 compartment (e.g. percentage of CD25 + CD69 + in CD4 CAR-pos was 15.88% vs 10.14% CAR-neg at day 21 with IL-2, p = 0.0083) (Fig.3A). Similarly, CD8 + CAR-pos T-cells showed significantly upregulated CD25 + CD69 + markers upon expansion with either IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15 (e.g. percentage of CD25 + CD69 + in CD8 CAR-pos was 10.51% vs 4.05% in CAR-neg at day 21, p = 0.0213) (Fig.3B). Co-inhibitory markers PD-1 and LAG-3 were significantly upregulated in CAR-pos at late time points post-activation with IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15 (e.g. percentage of PD-1 + /LAG-3 + in CD4 CAR-pos was 3.86% vs 2.01% in CAR-neg at day 21 with IL-2, p = 0.0082) (Fig.3). Of note, levels of PD-1 + /LAG-3 + were under 10% in both populations CAR-pos and CAR-neg.

In conclusion, no differences were observed between CAR-pos and CAR-neg T-cells in the distribution of T-cell subpopulations (Naïve, CM, EM, EMRA) at any time-point through the manufacturing procedure. However, increased levels of T-cell activation and T-cell exhaustion were noted in CAR-pos T-cells along the ex vivo expansion both with IL-2 and IL-7/IL-15.

CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells from three independent healthy donors were purified by FACS sorting to assess their function. Purified CAR-pos, purified CAR-neg or non-purified product (mixed CAR-pos/CAR-neg populations) were compared using cytotoxicity assays. Besides, to analyze the possible impact of CAR-neg T-cells in the efficacy of the final CAR-T cell product, mixed samples with different CAR-pos/CAR-neg T-cell ratios were included in the study. Purity of final sorted populations is depicted in Fig.4A. CAR-pos cells showed significantly higher cytotoxicity against two different myeloma cell lines compared to non-purified products (e.g. OPM-2 lysis with CAR-pos cells was 54.65% vs 33.98% with non-purified products, p = 0.0011) (Fig.4B,4C). Importantly, co-cultures used equal total T-cell numbers, highlighting that purified CAR-pos cells are more effective than non-purified products. No significant cytotoxicity was observed against control cell line K562 (Fig.4B,4C). Purified CAR-neg cells alone did not show significant cytotoxicity against MM cell lines or controls (Fig.4B,4C ). As additional controls, we included untransduced T-cells from the same healthy donors, both non-activated and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-7/IL-15, mimicking the CAR-T cell manufacturing protocol. Neither population showed significant cytotoxicity against MM cell lines or non-specific targets (Fig.4B,4C ). However, significant increased anti-myeloma efficacy was observed against both myeloma cell lines for the same number of CAR-pos cells when CAR-neg cells were added (e.g. MM.1S lysis with 10%CAR-pos cells alone was 8.87% vs 43.48% with 10%CAR-pos plus 90% CAR-neg cells, p < 0.0001) (Fig.4C). It should be noted that different total T-cell numbers were used in these co-cultures. At a fixed number of CAR-pos (10,000), adding CAR-neg (90,000) increased cytotoxicity compared to 10,000 CAR-pos cells alone. This effect was not observed against the control cell line K562 (e.g. K562 lysis with 10%CAR-pos cells was 2.59% vs 0.96% with 10%CAR-pos + 90%CAR-neg cells, p = 0.5239).

In conclusion, 100% CAR-pos purified product shows increased specific lysis of myeloma cells compared to non-purified product. However, at the same number of CAR-pos cells, adding CAR-neg cells increases the anti-myeloma efficacy against both MM.1S and OPM-2 without increasing the cytotoxicity against K562.

To assess potential toxicity of purified CAR-pos, CAR-neg, and non-purified products, secretion of CRS-related cytokines was measured by ELISA. Figure5A outlines the experimental design. CAR-pos and CAR-neg T-cells from three healthy donors (each tested in triplicate) were FACS-sorted on day 10 post-activation. Effectors (CAR-pos, CAR-neg, or non-purified), MM.1S target cells, and autologous CD3-depleted PBMCs were co-cultured. After 24 h, supernatants were collected for ELISA. As a control, 30,000 purified CAR-pos cells (matching the CAR-pos content in non-purified products) were tested without CAR-neg cells (Fig.5A). IL-6 levels were significantly higher with non-purified products (mixed CAR-pos/CAR-neg) compared to purified CAR-pos cells (p = 0.0002) (Fig.5B). At the same time, the non-purified product also displayed significantly higher levels of IL-6 as compared to equal number (30,000) CAR-pos cells alone (p < 0.0001) (Fig.5B). Other CRS-related cytokines such as IFN-γ and GM-CSF were also quantified showing significantly higher levels in non-purified products compared to the same number of CAR-pos cells alone (Fig.5C,5D, p= 0.0094 and p = 0.0033, respectively).

To assess whether a lower CAR-pos/CAR-neg ratio in infusion products correlates with increased toxicity, data from 31 Tisagenlecleucel products were analyzed using logistic regression against CRS and ICANS. Patient characteristics, including disease, age, sex, infused dose, and toxicity incidence, are shown in Table1. More detailed clinical data, including treatment-related variables and toxicity profiles relevant to the analysis, is shown in Table2. CAR-pos/CAR-neg ratio was compared between patients with severe toxicity (CRS or ICANS grades 2–3) and those with no toxicity or only mild symptoms (CRS or ICANS grades 0–1). No significant differences were observed considering CRS; however, those patients experiencing ICANS grades 2–3 tended to a reduced CAR-pos frequency (p = 0.08) (Fig.5E). To mitigate the potential biases introduced by toxicity treatments, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, we analyzed the time from CAR-T cell infusion to the onset of symptoms. We observed a significant correlation between an increased CAR-pos frequency in the infusion product and a delay in the onset of CRS (Spearman’s ρ = 0.3827, p = 0.04) (Fig.5F). ICANS onset correlation could not be assessed due to low case numbers.

In conclusion, non-purified CAR-T products showed higher secretion of CRS-related cytokines in vitro, and clinical data suggested that lower CAR-pos frequency in infusion products may be associated with earlier CRS onset and a trend toward higher ICANS severity.

CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells from three independent healthy donors were sorted from the final product and total RNA was sequenced. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that samples clustered primarily by donor rather than by CAR expression (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Differential gene expression (DEG) and clustering was compared between CAR-pos and CAR-neg populations. The Venn diagram indicated that 12,740 genes were commonly expressed in both populations, while 467 genes were unique to CAR-pos, and 406 genes were unique to CAR-neg cells (Fig.6A). Performing DEG analysis, we found 70 upregulated and 271 downregulated genes in CAR-pos compared to the CAR-neg. As expected, EGFR was the most significantly upregulated gene in CAR-pos T-cells (fold change = 5.43, p < 0.0001), reflecting its inclusion in the CAR construct (Supplementary Fig. 8). Excluding EGFR, genes upregulated in the CAR-neg population include granzyme B (GRZMB) (fold change = -1.50, p < 0.0001), perforin-1 (PRF1A) (fold change = -1.03, p < 0.0001), CD8A (fold change = -1.01, p < 0.0001), and killer cell lectin receptor D1 (KLRD1) (fold change = -1.56, p < 0.0001) (Fig.6B). Upregulated genes in CAR-pos cells include ribosomal protein pseudogene (RPL7AP6) (fold change = 1.23, p < 0.0001), membrane spanning 4-domains A1 (MS4A1) (fold change = 6.88, p < 0.0001), immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 3 (IGHG3) (fold change = 6.57, p < 0.0001), or cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 6 subunit (CHRNA6) (fold change = 1.67, p < 0.0001) (Fig.6B). All significant differentially expressed genes, fold expansion and p-value are included in Supplementary Table 2.

Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to analyze the biological and functional implications of the differentially expressed genes. We performed gene enrichment analysis according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. CAR-neg cells showed upregulation of the natural killer and cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway (KEGGID: hsa04650) (enrichment = 7.57, p < 0.0001), viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor pathway (KEGGID: hsa04061) (enrichment = 9.72, p < 0.0001), chemokine signaling pathway (KEGGID: hsa04062) (enrichment = 7.4, p < 0.0001), antigen processing and presentation (KEGGID: hsa04612, p < 0.0001), or graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (KEGGID: hsa05332) (enrichment = 11.43, p < 0.0001) (Fig.6C). On the other side, CAR-pos T-cells showed upregulation of PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint (KEGGID: hsa05235) (enrichment = 12.19, p < 0.0001), Th17 cell differentiation (KEGGID: hsa0465) (enrichment = 9.59, p < 0.0001), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (KEGGID: hsa04060) (enrichment = 5.45, p < 0.0001), or Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation (KEGGID: hsa04658) (enrichment = 9.05, p < 0.0001) (Fig.6D). Data from the KEGG analysis of downregulated and upregulated pathways in CAR-pos cells are depicted in Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4, respectively.

In summary, RNA-sequencing of CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells showed a significantly different gene expression pattern (Fig.6).

Despite the remarkable efficacy of CAR-T therapy, a significant proportion of patients fail to respond or eventually relapse. In addition, significant side-effects have been reported [2,27]. Several studies highlight the prognostic value of product characteristics. In this context, significant inter-trial variability, particularly in transduction rates, has been reported in the infusion product, with mean efficiencies ranging from 20% [28] to 70% [29]. Even within the same trial, transduction efficiency varies widely among patients [28,30,31]. In our study, infusion products showed a mean transduction efficiency of 15%, ranging from 3.3 to 27.5%. Moreover, some commercial CAR-T products do not report CAR-pos percentage. Since CAR-T dosing is based on viable CAR-pos cells, this high variability affects the total T-cell dose infused. Additionally, characterization of CAR-neg T-cells is scarce. Such variability complicates the identification of predictive biomarkers. Therefore, we conducted a phenotypic and functional characterization of CAR-pos and CAR-neg T-cells from our academic anti-BCMA CAR-T product throughout the manufacturing process to better understand their respective contributions to efficacy and toxicity.

A significant decrease in the percentage of CAR-pos cells was noted in vitro throughout culture at both preclinical and clinical scales, while CAR-neg cell counts significantly increased. This suggests that CAR-neg cells proliferate more than CAR-pos cells, regardless of cytokines used (IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15) diluting CAR-pos population in the final product. Besides, using different lentiviral enhancers we found a strong inverse correlation between transduction efficiency and the total T-cell expansion ex vivo, suggesting that transduced CAR-pos cells may proliferate less efficiently than CAR-neg cells. Besides, while Polybrene and LentiBoost enhanced transduction in a dose-dependent manner, Vectofusin-1 unexpectedly reduced CAR expression in our cultures. This is consistent with previous studies reporting that the effect of Vectofusin-1 depends on the vector pseudotype. Specifically, while it enhances transduction of receptor-targeted lentiviruses, it can impair that of VSV-G pseudotyped vectors, likely due to differences in viral entry routes, plasma membrane fusion (pH-independent) versus endosomal fusion under low pH [32,33]. Therefore, we confirmed that increased CAR-T cell transduction results in lower T-cell counts ex vivo, which might be explained by the reduced proliferation capacity of CAR-pos T-cells compared to CAR-neg cells. Consequently, after a certain point of expansion, the proportion of CAR-pos cells diminishes relative to the total cell population. Thus, defining an optimal expansion window is essential to favor CAR-pos growth and limit CAR-neg overgrowth.

Additionally, immunophenotyping revealed higher activation and exhaustion marker expression in CAR-pos cells. Reduced proliferation is a hallmark of T-cell exhaustion [34], and co-inhibitory receptors like PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 are known to limit T-cell expansion [34–37].Antigen-independent CAR signaling also contributes to tonic activation and exhaustion [38,39]. Previous studies described that CAR-T cells with high CAR expression (CARHigh) show increased exhaustion levels, tonic signaling, and reduced expansion in vitro [40]. In this context, strong promoters like EF1α may drive excessive CAR expression, impairing proliferation. Notably, although PD-1 + /LAG-3 + levels were increased in CAR-pos cells at later stages of the culture, particularly under IL-2 and in CD8 + compartment, expression levels remained below 10%.

Regarding in vitro efficacy, purified CAR-pos product was significantly more effective against myeloma cell lines than non-purified CAR T-cells at equal number of total T-cells, due to higher CAR-pos cell proportion (100% vs. ~ 30%). However, unexpectedly, products with 10% (10,000) CAR-pos cells and 90% (90,000) CAR-neg cells exhibited significantly enhanced cytotoxicity compared to the purified product containing 10,000 CAR-pos T-cells only, suggesting a bystander effect. This was absent upon stimulation with the control cell line K562 (BCMA-negative). Kaminski et al., described expansion of CD8 + CAR-neg cells in non-human primates (NHP) in parallel to CAR-pos cells. CAR-neg cells were sorted at peak expansion in NHP, and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed increased expression of canonical NK genes and CD8 + effector markers related to TCR-independent cytotoxic alternative pathways. IL-2 and IL-15 gamma cytokines were identified as the major drivers of this differentiation of CD8 + bystander activated phenotype. Besides, CD8 + CAR-neg bystander T-cells showed in vitro anti-tumoral activity against leukemic cells after IL-15 stimulation [41]. A previous study also reported a bystander activation in the context of CAR T-cell therapy where a substantial number of CAR-neg T-cells in the tumor microenvironment showed activation markers such as Ki67, IFN-γ or granzyme-B 5 days post-treatment [42]. In this regard, CAR-neg cells from our IL-7 and IL-15 expanded anti-BCMA CAR T-cell product exhibited a bystander T-cell activation in the presence of CAR-pos cells and myeloma cells. This activation significantly enhanced the anti-tumoral effect of CAR-pos T-cells alone.

Concerning cytokine release, non-purified product (~ 30% CAR-pos) showed a significant increase of IL-6 compared to purified 100% CAR-pos product. This aligns with previous studies identifying non-CAR immune cells in the tumor microenvironment as the main source of IL-6 [42]. Secretion of IFN-γ and GM-CSF also tended to be higher in non-purified products. Kaminski et al., also described an increase of effector and cytolytic cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2) secreted by CD8 + CAR-neg cells [41]. Moreover, patients receiving products with higher CAR-pos/CAR-neg ratio experienced lower grades of ICANS and showed a delay in the onset of CRS. Lee et al. reported that mice infused with the lowest-purity CAR-T product showed the greatest in vivo CAR-T expansion and were the only ones to exhibit significant weight loss [43]. In Deng et al., a significant lower percentage of CAR-pos cells was observed in the infusion products of patients experiencing ICANS grades 3–4 compared to patients suffering grades 0–2 ICANS.

RNA-sequencing revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between CAR-pos and CAR-neg T cells. Key upregulated genes in CAR-neg cells included GRZB, PRF1A, CD8A, KLRD1, KLRC1, CCL5 (Supplementary Table 2). Flow cytometry of GMP-manufactured CARTemis-1 products showed an increased proportion of CD4 + cells in CAR-pos cells, consistent with RNA-seq data where CD8A/CD8B were upregulated in CAR-neg and CD4 in CAR-pos cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). This matches previous studies reporting an increased expansion of CD8 cells within the CAR-neg fraction in vivo and in the tumor microenvironment [41,42]. Kaminski et al., identified a CD8 + CAR-neg population within an anti-CD20 CAR T-cell product expressing NK cell markers and cytolytic cytokines such as granzyme B and perforin-1. In Louie et al., this CD8 + CAR-neg population was also identified post-infusion in B-ALL and lymphoma patients [44]. The phenotypic profile described in both studies (CD8A + , CD160 + , KLRK1 + (NKG2D +), KLRD1 + (CD94 +), CCL5 +) closely resembles our CAR-neg T-cells. Notably, NK cytotoxicity pathway (hsa04650) was the most upregulated in CAR-neg cells, including genes such as GRZMB, PRF1A, KLRD1, KLRC1, and KLRK1. In this context, this population may be relevant for ongoing clinical trials that include IL-15 in the manufacturing process and that may incorporate this bystander CD8 + CAR-neg signature within the final product. Another upregulated pathway in CAR-neg T-cells is the GvHD pathway (has05332), with increased expression of genes like GZMB, PRF1, KLRD1, KLRC1, KIR2DS4, and KIR3DX1, potentially contributing to the bystander effect and amplifying the cytokine storm feedback loop.

Conversely, CAR-pos T-cells showed upregulation of immune checkpoint-related pathways, notably the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway (hsa05235), consistent with higher PD-1 and LAG-3 expression observed by flow cytometry. Enrichment of Th17 (hsa04659) and Th1/Th2 (hsa04658) differentiation pathways also suggested modulation of helper T-cell responses, key for antitumor immunity. Th17 cells display potent antitumor effects and can enhance the persistence of adoptively transferred T-cells [45]. Overall, CAR-pos and CAR-neg T-cells displayed distinct transcriptional profiles, with CAR-neg cells showing features resembling the bystander CD8 + activation signature.

Through this study, we provide new insights into the largely understudied CAR-neg population found in CAR-T cell products and infused into patients. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into its role and potential impact on therapeutic outcomes. In the clinical setting, limited access to CAR-pos and CAR-neg frequencies in commercial products, as well as the small patient cohort, limited deeper correlative analyses. Future studies should validate these findings in other CAR-T cell products and in larger patient cohorts to strengthen clinical relevance and reproducibility. This approach aligns with the growing emphasis on precision medicine and personalized therapeutics in oncology and could offer a promising avenue for optimizing CAR-T therapy and enhancing patient outcomes.

In conclusion, the role of CAR-neg cells in CAR-T-cell infusion products remains poorly understood, with limited data on their impact on safety and efficacy. Here, we characterized this population during the manufacturing of our academic anti-BCMA CAR-T product, CARTemis-1 (26). CAR-neg T-cells expand significantly more than CAR-pos cells, reducing the proportion of CAR-pos cells in the final product. This underscores the need to define an optimal expansion period that favors CAR-pos proliferation while limiting CAR-neg overgrowth. Although CAR-neg cells lack specific cytotoxic activity, a bystander effect is observed in the presence of CAR-pos cells. Notably, purified CAR-pos cells secrete significantly less IL-6, a key cytokine implicated in CRS and ICANS. We suggest that selecting CAR-pos cells prior to infusion could reduce total T-cell numbers, limit interpatient variability, and potentially lower the incidence and severity of adverse events.
