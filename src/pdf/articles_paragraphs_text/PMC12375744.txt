This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for fault detection and control in DC microgrids (DCMGs) integrating diverse energy sources. A resistance-based fault detection scheme is proposed to address intermittent DC link faults, enabling efficient operation without complete system shutdown. Perturb and Observe (P&O) techniques are employed for PV and wind power tracking, while proportional-integral (PI) controllers manage fuel cell (FC) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) demonstrate superior performance over traditional PI controllers in mitigating voltage and current (V-I) fluctuations. To optimize DC-link V-I levels, a genetic algorithm-tuned PI controller (GA-PIC) and evolution-inspired PI controller are utilized. The proposed method is validated using Opal-RT simulations under various scenarios, demonstrating improved performance over un-optimized configurations. The key achievement of this research is a validated, optimized control and protection scheme that significantly enhances the stability and reliability of DCMGs under fault conditions. Specifically, the work develops a distributed fault detection and control method to improve protection and address stability and power quality in DCMGs. It also presents a GA-based PI-optimized controller for DCMGs with FC and battery storage, and an optimized controller integrating FLCs and GA-tuned PI-Cs to reduce V-I fluctuations. Furthermore, an integrated DC protection scheme is implemented, demonstrating enhanced fault detection speed and accuracy compared to individual schemes. The effectiveness of the proposed GA-PI-C is validated through Opal RT real-time simulations, confirming the efficacy of FLCs in dynamic system responses and contributing to more robust and reliable DCMG operation.

DC microgrids (DCMGs) are increasingly utilized due to their reliability, stability, and efficiency benefits within modern energy world1. However, ensuring consistent electrification from sources to loads in DCMGs presents challenges due to intermittency2. The DCMG represents a future power system integrating distributed generation (DG) sources (i.e., PV, wind energy (WE), fuel cell (FC), utility grid (UG)), loads (i.e.,,,,and), and two different battery energy storage systems (BESS)3. The integration of energy sources with storage systems is crucial for ensuring a reliable energy supply. Renewable energy sources are unpredictable and intermittent. At the same time, the demand for clean energy is rising to meet growing power needs. Installing PV and WE in DCMGs is relatively straightforward, and they operate without fuel consumption4. Similarly, fuel cells can provide stable power, addressing energy storage/supply challenges, and dynamically adjust their output voltage as needed3,5. So battery and fuel cells are used as backup units. The progress in the power converter’s controller has made a good choice for energy storage solutions and the growth of power resources in DCMG1. Although there are many advantages, it also provides challenges such as protection, stability, control, and power quality.

The DCMG is considered healthy through various protection schemes when the voltage and current (V-I) are at the source and loads terminal. DCMG distribution lines/cables may experience persistent issues with interruptions and power balancing, despite careful design and operational methods6. Following faults in the system, the voltage and current fluctuations on the DC link increase sharply (or spike), causing the entire system to de-energize7,8. Therefore, in practical terms, a strong protection scheme is essential to maintain V-I within safe limits at the DC link. This ensures the continuous and reliable operation of DCMGs6,8. Similarly, the system’s safety measures, accurate stability design and effective energy control methods are required9. Therefore, relays () and circuit breakers can be installed to quickly detach faulty sections. These defects are marked by relays and circuit breakers (CB). The fault is resolved quickly based on the transmitted fault information within a short period of operation2,7. The statement regarding the distance (80 m to 100 m) between relay protection lines was incorrectly marked and has been revised for clarity10,11. Identifying faults in microgrids presents a significant challenge. This is due to the presence of many sources and the deliberate blocking of the fault currents () by DC-DC converters12–17. The DCMG system has short-circuit (SC) defects including line-to-line (LL), line-to-ground (LG) defects and arc. The current-based methods are used in DC systems, but voltage sag-based methods can cause CB tripping with incorrect localization10. This scheme detects and mitigates low and high impedance faults (LIF/HIF) in DC grids without requiring a full shutdown. The SC faults in DCMG systems highlight the need for an efficient protection relay algorithm for reliability. Although current approaches address these concerns, they still have limitations. So, the main objective is to design a reliable algorithm for fault detection11. The biggest challenge in DCMG control is managing complex interactions between non-linearities and variable power output from distributed sources. The fault conditions further complicate system stability and reliability18. From a practical standpoint, improving fault detection and control in DCMGs is crucial. It ensure the safety and longevity of the system components. It prevents costly downtime, and maintain a stable power supply to critical loads.

The fault detection scheme uses conditional algorithms induced by abnormal events. It must be carefully selected for each DC line to ensure accurate fault detection. In2, a high-speed fault detection and localization scheme is proposed, offering superior speed and accuracy over traditional methods. It effectively addresses the critical need for rapid and precise fault clearing. In7, the multi-terminal DC improves localization in microgrids using local measurements. It provides fault information, which is essential for accurately identifying and isolating the target fault. In8, a real-time resistance-based technique was developed, enabling rapid and reliable fault detection in zonal low-voltage DC Microgrids. This approach significantly enhances protection for these specific configurations. These studies emphasize the importance of fault identification schemes designed for different DC Microgrid topologies. In12,16, medium-voltage DC Microgrids investigated deficiencies by coordinating supply power converters and bus contactors for improved protection. This highlights the necessity of comprehensive control and protection strategies for enhanced reliability. In13, analyzing fault characteristics across various converter topologies offers valuable insights for robust protection design. It highlights the significant impact of converter technology on abnormal system behavior. In6, the impedance-based relaying scheme for hybrid AC/DC microgrids introduces complexities in protecting these advanced systems. In15, proposes high-speed differential protection, while11studies inter-connection protection. The fault detection scheme’s performance is assessed through incorrect identity evaluation and protection rate analysis. A comparative study with existing technologies is necessary to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. Rather than identifying a fault, effective control strategies are required.

In17, the proportional load has developed distribution control for sharing and voltage control, improving energy management and stability1. In the focus on controlling PV-WE-based microgrids with hybrid power storage. In4, the converter-lace solar PV control strategy. Optimization techniques are crucial to improve both incorrect identification and control performance. In18, the proposal of vague-oriented power-sharing methods for microgrids shows better performance compared to conventional drop control. In19, the PI-Cascade Controller has been studied for parameter optimization in linear servo mechanisms. It demonstrates the impact of different optimization algorithms on system performance. In20, optimization-based PI controller tuning is implemented for non-deal differential boost inverters, improving the dynamic response and stability of the system. In21, Self-adaptive virtual inertial control using fuzzy logic was implemented to improve frequency stability in microgrids with high renewable penetration. It effectively addresses challenges arising from fluctuating renewable energy generation. In22, natural genetics adopted control for autonomous WE-battery-based microgrids, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing system performance and stability. In23, a support vector machine integrated with a genetic algorithm was utilized for fault diagnosis in high-voltage circuit breakers. This approach highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predictive maintenance. These control strategies, including optimized and intelligent control methods, contribute to efficiency and stability.

The new protective relay algorithm, implemented in MATLAB, is used (or was implemented) to improve the real-time monitoring of power distribution systems. The algorithm consolidates protective measures such as over-voltage, under-voltage and over-current protection, which improves system reliability24. The response to DC defects and the magnitude of the affected fault current are influenced by resistance considerations. Proper assessment of resistance is crucial for accurate fault analysis and mitigation. This is due to the maintenance of distribution buses interconnected by power converters. The reference current for maximum power extraction and air in PV is produced according to the P&O maximum power point tracking method. The current prevailing control procedures for BESS and FC have PI control19. This reference value is maintained by controlling the boost converter input current. The study focuses on the V-I interruption that responds by optimizing PI control associated with FC and BESS to reduce DC link V-I fluctuations20. The dimming suspicion system is proposed for the use of the system compatible and effective. The proposed research aims to fill this space by consolidating Adaptive FL-C based on automatic shift and sequence compensation methods18. The use of different control topologies and converters reduces the efficiency of the parallel operation. Improvements in coordinating Distributed Energy Sources (DES), BESS, and loads are needed for proper power supply control at the DCMG link. These adjustments affect the stability of the PI controller in DCMG25–32. It can be resolved through a single control loop that effectively solves the energy part. The membership function of MPPT resolves V-I variations using the FLC trial-and-error tracking method. It effectively enhances system performance by addressing resistance-based shortcomings. Thus FLC effectively maintains V-I levels due to its non-linear and dynamic behavior.

The consolidation of AI-based control methods, including ANFIS, AO, EO, SA, and Fuzzy, enhances system efficiency. Among these, FLC demonstrates superior performance in improving energy quality and stability in systems. The PI-C and FLC-based controller implementation work together to reduce voltage and current distortions. The GA-based tuned PI controller method is implemented due to the consistent expected performance level. This remains unchanged even when using different PI and FL controller types. This comprehensive approach aims to improve reliability and resiliency by reducing deviations. The ultimate goal is to develop an integrated fault detection and control strategy for DCMG. The proposed DCMG protection system uses GA to optimize PI-C parameters by providing an efficient control design19,20. This approach allows for precise adjustment of the PI controller’s settings, leading to the best possible overall performance of the system22. This approach builds on successful solutions from previous attempts, leading to continual improvement. This approach also minimizes the chance of getting stuck on a solution that isn’t quite the absolute best ( “global optimum”). This leads to more reliable and effective results33. It maintains V-I control for both stable and changing conditions. This method refines the controller’s settings to achieve the best possible performance within set limitations. Efficient collective search also provides parallelization, resilience, and computational efficiency23. It provides a valuable approach to obtaining optimal parameters for PI-C in DCMG34,35. This research introduces a design methodology for parameter optimization of PI-C using GA. Finally, the proposed protection system demonstrates improved effectiveness in enhancing microgrid performance during fault conditions. The methodology is assessed using MATLAB simulations and validated with the OPAL-RT real-time simulator. It analyzes transient and steady-state responses to short-circuit faults effectively. The proposed method’s practicality and accuracy are demonstrated by comparing un-optimized and optimized configurations. Simulink and OPAL-RT simulations validate performance improvements with FLCs in dynamic system responses.

This approach introduces a distributed fault detection and control method. It aims to improve protection in DCMGs while addressing stability and power quality issues.

A DCMG consists of distributed energy sources (i.e. PV, WE, FC, and UG), four resistive loads, and two different types of EV batteries2,14. The structure of the DCMG model with different terminal types is shown in Fig.1and specification parameters are given in Table1. In Fig.1, solar PV and WE are connected to DCMG through DC-DC converters operating in P&O-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control mode6. Since the output generated by the WE system is AC in nature, a diode bridge rectifier (DBR) operating in constant power control mode is used to interface with the DCMG. The utility grid is connected to the DCMG through a DBR and the fuel cell is connected to the DC-DC boost converter.

Schematic diagram of DCMG consists of different sources, loads, converters, and CBs (-).

Theandare connected to the DCMG as a bi-directional converter voltage regulator via DC-DC converters. Generally, converters connected to the DC bus require capacitors to connect to the output. In this configuration, all types of energy sources, loads, and energy storage systems are connected to converters through DC wires across a distance of 82 to 100 m16. A DCMG system typically incorporates several DC-and relays (-). These components are strategically positioned along the DC line to detect and isolate fault segments promptly by issuing trip signals at various branches. This architecture allows the DCMG to operate in different modes, typically used in residential applications with EV stations. FL controllers are recommended to manage V-I fluctuations in DCMG links. It performs better than PI controllers in DES and storage systems converters, ensuring stability and improved operational efficiency.

In DCMG, DC-Link receives stable support from sources and BESS via a boost converter (BC). Additionally, the bi-directional buck-boost converter (Bi-Di) ensures voltage stability during source and load changes, as shown in Fig.1. The DC link power balance of DCMG is defined by Eq. (1)4.

Reduces pressure on the converter’s rated voltage and demand on the supply side.

The solar energy module can be further expanded with a boost converter in series to produce DC power. The SP allows real-time energy exchange during load changes and DC-Link capacitor charging. The MPPT controller is crucial for optimizing solar power extraction. Figure2shows the Solar controller with MPPT, and BC for voltage boosting. The SP output power,, is calculated using Eq. (2). Furthermore, the performance improvement achieved by using the fuzzy system is analyzed. In this way, the power with a fuzzy system is calculated using Eq. (3)36.

With the rise of renewable energy sources like hydrogen, there’s growing interest in its potential as a clean energy carrier for the future. FCs emerge as a particularly attractive option due to their efficiency. High-temperature FCs offer a distinct advantage: the ability to directly handle fuels like natural gas internally. It simplifies the power generation process and contributes to the reliability of FCs for stationary applications. However, a drawback of high-temperature FCs is the difficulty in quickly stopping them, limiting their use to stationary power generation. An additional benefit of FC systems is the ability to recapture excess water vapour and utilize it in steam turbines for further electricity generation, boosting overall system efficiency. Within the FC itself, oxygen is supplied to the cathode while hydrogen enters the anode. This separation leads to reduction occurring at the cathode and oxidation at the anode. Overall, fuel cell technology presents a promising path forward for direct power generation and applications in microgrids. As a highly efficient converter of chemical energy into electricity, FCs offer a reliable and clean solution for the future of power generation.

DC microgrids often utilize voltage source converters (VSCs) to connect loads and distributed generators to the DC bus via a common point of connection (PCC) as in Fig.6. Traditional fault detection methods designed for grid-connected systems may not be suitable for evaluating the performance of short-circuit (SC) fault protection in this configuration8,12,14,39. As illustrated in Fig.1, a fault near a specific load (e.g., load) can trigger existing protection schemes to isolate the entire section (i.e., all loads), disconnecting all loads connected through that PCC. This over-isolation is inefficient. Implementing these methods individually for each load branch increases both cost and system complexity. This work aims to develop a method for fault detection, location, and isolation within individual load branches, thereby minimizing protection system cost and complexity. Figure1depicts a DC microgrid powered by a fuel cell, wind turbine, and battery, each connected via DC-DC converters. Loads are grouped into zones based on proximity, effectively making each zone a local load for its respective converter. These converters dynamically adjust power delivery to meet fluctuating load demands. Converter-I (PV-side boost converter) typically operates in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode, while Converter-II (battery-side bidirectional converter) regulates the DC bus voltage. A fault drastically alters converter operating points. Failure to detect these changes can lead to bus voltage collapse and system-wide shutdown, potentially causing damage or even fire depending on the fault’s nature.

Equivalent circuit of the DCMG an L-L fault in the load zone.

This study assumes negligible cable inductance contribution to equivalent impedance, as the inductive component is dominant (i.e.). The cable resistances between loads and points of common coupling (PCC) A and B are=-, while the resistance between converters is. The Distributed Converter Microgrid (DCMG) fault analysis uses an equivalent circuit with four loads (-) connected to the DC grid via cable resistances (-). Loads,,, andcorrespond to capacitors C₄ and C₅, respectively.represents the resistance line between source and load converters. A line-to-line (L2L) fault with resistanceis introduced near load(zone 1). During the fault, bus voltagesanddrop rapidly, de-energizing the system. Simultaneously, capacitors (to) discharge quickly, primarily feeding the fault. Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Bidirectional (BI-DI) converters are active sources connected to the converter output.

The capacitor discharge behaviour is key to fault detection. KCL is applied at nodes A and B to determine each source’s contribution, as defined in equations (18). The relationship between the resistance seen by the capacitorand its average current is generalized in Eq. (19). A 120 V initial voltage across a 473.4692µF capacitor, storing 0.7 J of energy, is examined under varying equivalent resistances () to cover both high and low values. The capacitor’s discharge rate is influenced by the fault resistance (), with lowerleading to faster discharge. As the fault is assumed to be in the load zone, the load’s contribution tois disregarded. The equivalent circuit representing this simplified system is depicted in Fig.7. This model facilitates analysis of the capacitor’s behaviour during fault conditions, are shown in Fig. 11(a-c).

,,,,andAre the output currents of the different converters.consists of various resistances like,and.

In a DC microgrid, a DC-link fault triggers a rapid response from filter capacitors (FCs). Utilizing this dynamic behaviour, fault detection is achieved by observing the sudden spike in capacitor current directed towards the fault. The energy stored in a capacitor is given by. For a constant voltage of 115 V across the capacitor, power calculations are similar. Despite the RC circuit, power is dissipated through a resistive path associated with the capacitor. The peak discharge current is dependent on. Expressed as, the discharge current represents the equivalent resistance of parallel loads, cables, and fault resistances. Therefore, the peak discharge current serves as an indicator of the fault type. Comparing current patterns under dynamic conditions is crucial for accurate fault detection.(k) and(k) are considered in this analysis.

Figure8shows the proposed fault detection algorithm. Following setup, relays (Rs) collect capacitor currents (ij=1 to 6). The algorithm samples, averages, and calculates error indices, as described below.

Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) sample currents at instants (k) and (k-1). Equations (20) and (21) define present and previous average current patterns for theithcapacitor. The sampling time difference is​ and. Error equations for load zone 1 use capacitor currentand average sample currentsand​(k− 1) for capacitor, as shown in Fig.6.

It can be noticed here that,At the time of the fault.

In this DCMG setup, six FCs necessitate six relays to monitor their currents. The fault detection process begins by assigning states to relays (= 1 for “on,”= 0 for “off”), as shown in Fig.5. Relay states are determined through sampling and communicated to circuit breakers (CBs). Sampled capacitor currents () undergo averaging, yielding present and past current models:(k) and(k − 1). An error index (δ) is then calculated using Eq. (22). The RC circuit’s time constant is inversely proportional to fault resistance and maximum discharge current. Consequently, complete capacitor discharge time is shorter for low-impedance faults (LIFs), exhibiting a higher peak magnitude compared to high-impedance faults (HIFs). Post-fault, ijdecays exponentially. Upon reaching steady state, fault isolation becomes challenging. A detection threshold (δ) is implemented for thecapacitor, enabling HIF isolation. Lower () and upper () characterization thresholds are defined, dependent on, which itself relies on.> 1Ω signifies HIF, while 0<<1Ω indicates LIF8,39.

In a 100 W/50V DCMG, the maximum discharge current of capacitorsandwas analyzed using (19) for fault resistance= 0.1 to 10 Ω. The resulting currents ranged from approximately 80 A to 5 A for C2and 5 A to 1.5 A for C3. Immediately post-fault, the calculated δexceeded the 0.4 A threshold (δ). A fault is identified when δij values surpass δ. Analysis suggests a minimum fault characterization threshold (δ) of 5 A for effective fault/disturbance differentiation. However, using 3 A and 40 A for the lower () and upper () thresholds, respectively, led to mischaracterization. A “no-fault” condition is registered below. Exceedingindicates a low-impedance fault (LF), while high-impedance faults (HF) are identified when δfalls between these thresholds. Equation (15) provides the misclassification index.

This flowchart outlines a fault detection method designed to enhance the performance of a DC microgrid by rapidly identifying and classifying faults. The process begins with initializing a line status flag (Sj) to 1, indicating a healthy state. It then proceeds to measure voltage and current at sources and loads, alongside acquiring and averaging capacitor current samples. By comparing the measured current () against predefined thresholds (,), the system preliminarily identifies potential fault conditions. A crucial step involves calculating the difference in the fault index (), derived from consecutive averaged current values, to ascertain the rate of current change. This change is then compared against other lines () to isolate the fault location40. Based on the current magnitude and the rate of change, the system distinguishes between low and high-impedance faults, enabling tailored protection responses41,42. Throughout the process, if no fault is detected or the condition resolves, the line status flag is reset to 1. This approach facilitates quick fault detection, differentiation between fault types, and precise localization, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and stable DC microgrid operation.

Imagine a scenario where an LG fault occurs in a DC microgrid. The current on the affected line will quickly rise. The sensors detect this change and send the data to the processing unit. The system calculates the fault index difference () and compares it with the predefined thresholds and values from other lines. If the rate of change is high and the current exceeds the high threshold, the system identifies a low-impedance fault. It then sends a trip signal to the circuit breakers protecting that line, isolating the faulty section from the rest of the microgrid. This rapid response prevents further damage and ensures the stability of the microgrid, are shown in Fig.8.

The PV and WE systems employ the MPPT technique, while the FC and BESS systems utilize PI control. Similarly, the DCMG is linked with the utility grid to supply additional power. The control of adaptive PV and WE converters by the MPPT algorithm is shown in Fig.2(a) and Fig.3(a). The PI controller control of adaptive FC and BESS converters is shown in Fig.4(a) and Fig.5(a). When the BESS reaches maximum capacity, the local DC link voltage exceeds the reference value allowing the WE and PV to operate off-MPP. The impact of the DCMG fault causes changes in other sources and loads. Controlling the PI considering the sources and loads involved with converters is essential to ensure stable DC link voltage levels and safety. The PI controller is controlled to demonstrate how well FLC-based techniques can regulate the DC link voltage and current in the DCMG. Therefore, the focus is on control strategies for improving the voltage, and current of the converters through the optimization method. Thus, applying different controller techniques did not change the results as much as expected, So the GA-PI tuning technique was adopted. The hierarchical control system is recommended to ensure voltage stability during faults in DCMG.

The boost converters effectively control the DC-link voltage by managing the current flow of PV and WE, enabling the MPPT28. The MPPT algorithm is a software-based flowchart that uses electrical devices to optimize power generation, as shown in Fig.9, where p(k) > p(k-1) represents the MPPT implementation. It is used in controlled DCMG connected to PV and WE through converters30.

The symbol∆Drepresents small incremental changes in the DC-link voltage. The control algorithm is illustrated in Fig.8where the effect of L,andWe examine the converters for voltage conversion from source to load. A duty ratio-based MPPT technique with perturbation and observation (P&O) is used for PV and WE. MPPT is used to achieve zero derivatives of voltage for input control in current and voltage. The MPPT controller generates the reference voltage for DC-link operation.

Fuzzy control ensures energy sources (PV, WE, FC) adapt to real-time loads by dynamically tracking MPP in converters. Because it is robust, it improves the accuracy of complex rules and is easy to design18,36. Similarly, resize model knowledge of PV, FC, WE, and Bess is not required. Fuzzy logic control is made up of three essential components: fuzzification module, fuzzy inference engine, and defuzzification module, as shown in Fig.10.

In the process of fuzzification, numerical values from the input are transformed into linguistic terms using a membership function, are shown in Fig.11(a-c). For this MPPT system, the voltage and current of the photovoltaic (PV) module are measured continuously. Power is then calculated as the product of voltage and current (P = V * I). The control strategy is determined based on two key input control variables: error (E) and change in error (CE). Error (E) signifies the slope of the P-V characteristic curve at a specific sampling instance (k). Change in error (CE) represents the variation in error between consecutive sampling intervals37.

(a) Membership function for error signal. (b) Membership function for change error signal. (c) Membership function for the duty Cycle (D).

In this context, P(k) represents the power output, and V(k) signifies the voltage. The controller regulates the output voltage in a DC-DC converter by adjusting the duty cycle (D). This adjustment is based on the error signal, E(k), representing the difference between the desired and actual voltage. The controller manipulates the duty cycle to drive the error signal towards zero, effectively guiding the converter towards the optimal operating point. In the fuzzy controller, the input values (E and CE) are transformed into variables like positive high (PH), positive medium (PM), positive small (PS), zero error (ZE), negative small (NS), negative medium (NM), and negative high (NH). These terms are defined using basic fuzzy sets. The membership functions for these fuzzy sets, for both the input and output variables, are shown in Fig.11(a-c).

The fuzzy controller relies on fuzzification to convert crisp input values (E and CE) into fuzzy terms the system can understand. This is necessary before applying the rules in the inference engine, as shown in Fig.12. Table2showcases the controller’s rule table. This table defines the fuzzy output (D) by combining fuzzy inputs (E and CE)37. The fuzzy controller utilizes a rule table (Table2) containing 49 rules. These rules govern the DC-DC converter’s operation to achieve MPP tracking for the PV, WE, FC, and BESS modules. The core principle behind these rules is to adjust the DC-DC converter’s duty ratio based on the deviation of the operating point from its MPP. The controller aims to drive towards its MPP by increasing or decreasing the duty ratio.

PI-Cs improve the frequency results of distributed systems, thereby increasing regulation efficiency. Figure12shows the PI-C architecture.serves as an input to the PI differential controller, which produces an outputbased on the transfer function. As a result, the PI-C efficiently tunes the proposed controller43,44. This block diagram illustrates the use of a weighted combination of ITAE as an objective function to derive PI parameters by a GA.

Figure13shows a simple block diagram of a PI-C, incorporating both proportional and integral elements. Optimize the PI gain to minimize the difference between the desired output (r) and the actual output (y) to achieve better performance. The central role is played by the control rule (u), e = r-y, and the important parametersand. Using integrated time absolute error (ITAE) as the error criterion optimizes PI setting values, as shown in Fig.13. The control strategy aims to minimize the error between the set value and the actual value, thereby improving the system’s overall performance19. GA is a stochastic search technique that handles nonlinear systems and solves complex problems. It uses probabilistic transformation rules to manage potential solutions called individuals or chromosomes. Each generation evaluates individual performance using an objective function, assigning appropriate values ​​to each iteration. Using a survival of the fittest strategy based on chromosome fitness, the algorithm evolves iteratively, guided by the error value to evaluate fitness.

Structure of PI controller tuned based on optimization.

The GA starts with a small randomly generated population for fast optimization. The PI parameters,and, are encoded as binary strings (chromosomes) and converted to real-valued PI parameters to calculate the goodness of fit. These values ​​are evaluated in the PI controller, which determines the system response through cost functions such as the integration time absolute error (ITAE) as in Tables3and4. Figure14shows the best and average fitness characteristics of GA. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated several times until optimal coverage is achieved. GA targets overall PI values ​​(and) with minimal coverage across the entire operating range. Table3presents the main GA simulation parameters. The evolution and comparison of design parameter values of the GA as in Table5. Figure15shows the comparative analysis of different PI parameters, highlighting GA’s superior performance over other techniques. The final selection of GA demonstrates its optimal parameter tuning, ensuring enhanced system efficiency and stability.

Step 1:Initialization: GA parameters (crossover/mutation rates, population size, generations) are defined. A population of potential PI values is randomly generated as binary strings, each representing a solution.

Step 2:Fitness Evaluation: The Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) serves as the fitness function, aiming for minimization. Each individual’s fitness is calculated: Lower ITAE indicates better fitness.

Step 3:Selection: Parent solutions are selected using a rank-based approach. Individuals with superior fitness (lower ITAE) are more likely to be chosen for reproduction.

Step 4:Crossover: Single-point crossover combines genetic material from selected parent pairs. A random crossover point is chosen, and genetic information is exchanged up to that point, creating offspring.

Step 5:Mutation: Random bit flips are introduced into offspring binary strings, preventing premature convergence.

Step 6:Iteration: The fitness of the updated population is evaluated. If the minimum ITAE criterion is met, the algorithm terminates, returning optimized PI values. Otherwise, steps 3–6 are repeated.

A DCMG is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink with DES, a BESS, and load as shown in Fig.1. The DESs are connected to boost converters, and the BESS are connected to buck-boost converters. All the power tracking controller techniques are also connected to converters. This study uses BESS as a backup system for the UG, WE, PV, and FC connections in DCMG. System implementation, efficiency, quality of required power, and energy management for the proposed system are managed by MATLAB Simulink of DCMG as shown in Fig.1. To ensure the proposed algorithm’s stability, various situations, including fault and non-faulty transients, are addressed. It is expected that the proposed method will correctly respond to these interruptions by isolating the fault via tripping of the relevant breakers. DC cable faults (LG, LL, internal/external, arcing/static) are simulated to assess fault detection methods. For targeted performance evaluation, relays with the algorithm are labelled by their DC link connection, as shown in Figs.8,16.

Experimental setup of the proposed system in opal-RT.

The proposed algorithm’s findings for relays,, andinstalled on cables are explored further below. In Fig.1, the faults,, andare simulated at= 1.0s, 1.4s, and 1.8s in the line connecting the UG,,, and DC connections. Figure1shows the voltage responses with relays,, andlinked at both ends. The current will be high if the L2G fault has a low impedance. For a high-impedance fault, the current will be low. The impact of,, andcircuit breaker operation on,, andrelay performance evaluates the algorithm’s ability to deal with external disturbances. Figures17,18and19shows the response of the relay,, andto variations in the rated value of voltage, current, and fault. Figure17presents a comparative analysis of voltage and current behavior in various distributed generation (DG) sources within a DCMG under fault conditions. Four distinct DG units solar PV, WE, FC, and a UG system-were examined. Each system was analyzed using PI, fuzzy, and GA based control methods. Three distinct remote faults (,, and), each with a maximum severity of 0.05 ms, were introduced to assess system resilience. Figure17(a) illustrates the voltage and current variations in the solar PV system. The introduced faults disrupt the terminal voltage and current, leading to fluctuations in the power balance at the PV terminal. Similarly, Fig.17(b) depicts the impact of the same faults on the WE system. Here, the faults induce fluctuations not only in power balance but also in current intensity at the wind turbine terminal. Figure17(c) shows the voltage and current variations in the Fuel Cell system. The faults again disrupt the terminal voltage and current, resulting in fluctuations in both power balance and the current level. Finally, Fig.17(d) presents the results for the UG system. The faults cause fluctuations in power balance and a significant current level increase at the UG terminal. Notably, these faults, especially those occurring at the UG terminal, propagate through the DCMG, impacting the current levels and subsequently disrupting the operation of other connected source, load, and storage systems. This highlights the importance of robust control strategies for mitigating the impact of faults on the overall DCMG stability. Figure18illustrates the impact of faults on various load terminals within the DCMG. Four distinct loads (,,and) were analyzed under fault conditions, with voltage and current measurements taken at each terminal. PI, fuzzy, and GA-based control methods were employed for analysis. Three remote faults (,, and), each with a severity of up to 0.05 ms, were introduced. Figure18(a) shows the voltage and current behavior at. All three faults disrupt the terminal voltage and current, leading to power balance fluctuations. Specifically,causes a significant increase in current and a corresponding decrease in voltage, potentially affecting other DCMG components. Figure18(b) shows the response of. Here, the faults generally reduce both current and voltage levels, also impacting power balance. Figure18(c) presents the results for. Again, the faults cause power balance fluctuations due to voltage and current disruptions., in particular, induces correlated fluctuations in both voltage and current levels, with a voltage decrease associated with the current change. Finally, Fig.18(d) shows the impact on. The faults disrupt the terminal voltage and current, leading to a decrease in power balance at this load. These results demonstrate the varying impact of faults on different load terminals within the DCMG, highlighting the need for effective fault management strategies. Figure19examines the impact of faults on two battery energy storage systems (and) within the DCMG. Voltage and current measurements were taken at each BESS terminal, and analysis was performed using PI, fuzzy, and GA-based control methods. Faults,, andeach with a severity of up to 0.05 ms, were introduced. Figure19(a) shows the impact on. The faults disrupt both voltage and current, leading to a decrease in power balance. Furthermore, faults at other grid terminals also reduce theterminal voltage, causing significant current variations.

Figure19(b) presents the results for. Similar to, the introduced faults disrupt voltage and current, reducing power balance. Again, faults at other grid locations decrease theterminal voltage, resulting in extreme current variations. A PI control strategy was employed to mitigate fault effects. PI controller parameters were optimized using manual tuning, fuzzy logic, and a GA. The FLCs demonstrated superior V-I regulation during fault events, achieving a 20% reduction in voltage overshoot and a 15% decrease in settling time compared to PI controllers. Opal-RT simulations validated FLC’s enhanced dynamic response, resulting in a 10% improvement in fault detection accuracy and a 5% reduction in steady-state error. Specifically, FLC-based systems minimized operational disruptions by reducing fault clearance time by 8%. The non-linear behavior of FLCs proved advantageous in handling rapid dynamic changes during faults, offering better robustness and stability compared to linear PI controllers. This highlights FLC’s effectiveness in enhancing DCMG resilience under fault conditions. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizes PI controllers, surpassing both unoptimized PI and FLC methods in DCMG control. GA-tuned PI achieved a 12% reduction in V-I fluctuations and a 10% stability improvement over standard PI. Compared to FLC, GA-PI provided a 7% enhancement in dynamic response due to precise parameter optimization. GA’s global search avoids local optima, ensuring optimal controller settings. Opal-RT validation confirmed GA-PI’s robustness under varying loads, showing superior performance consistency. GA’s efficient parameter tuning minimizes steady-state error and improves fault clearance time, demonstrating its advantage in complex DCMG control. GA-based optimization significantly outperformed other methods, demonstrating its suitability for DCMG performance enhancement.

The suggested control is robust against short-circuit faults in DCMG. Short circuit fault responses are summarized as shown in Fig.7. The DC bus is considered to have undervoltage, overvoltage, and overcurrent protection. In this situation, the variance in V-I after fault occurrence is minimized. By connecting the short-circuit fault line is triggered at= 1.0 s, 1.4s, 1.8s, and the fault is cleared at= 1.05s,=1.45s, and=1.85s. The power level of the DC link fluctuates due to a fault in the DCMGs, and the backup supply prevents it from falling. Figure2shows the impact of MPPT on PV current and power. Power from PV and FC are connected to ensure system stability. A PMSG wind system uses a set of equations (Eqs.5–8) to create an optimal control approach that maximizes power output, as seen in Fig.3. A consistent wind speed and a power coefficient (Cp) of 0.48 suggest functioning at the MPP. This maintains a constant 120 V DC connection voltage at the source. The battery is versatile, allowing for multi-directional charging and discharging while maintaining a constant 98 V DC connection voltage. To address potential load fluctuations, the voltage and current loops within the battery converter are managed by a typical Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. However, research indicates that an FLC strategy provides higher performance. FLC has faster settling times and less overrun during operation, making it a promising control option for this system. Even with continuous nonlinear constant changes, the FLC-based control approach has good reference tracking ability. Another major goal of controls is to sustain different load fluctuations. The GA-based tuned PI is used due to the low charging and discharging current at the BESS’s DC link with the FL controller. GA-based tuned PI controllers track steady state faster and perform better in PI controller response. Figure13shows the performance of a traditional PI controller using objective functions such as IAE, ITSE, and ISE. The impact of over/under load and significant voltage drop in a DCMG on the performance of the proposed GA-PIC algorithm is investigated. A DCMG with different DES and loads is modelled in the OPAL-RT 5600 simulator. The OPAL-RT 5600 generates DCMG output voltage and current, sent into the dSPACE DL350 as shown in Fig.16. The proposed GA-PI control method is implemented on the dSPACE DL350. The obtained voltage and current outputs (Figs.20,21and22) are compared against results from the OPAL-RT simulation. An Opal-RT system validated the simulation results, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Figure20presents a comparative analysis of voltage and current in various distributed generation (DG) sources, focusing on results obtained using the GA method. Three remote faults (,, and), each with a severity of up to 0.05 ms, were applied to each DG system. Figure20(a) illustrates the impact on the solar PV and WE systems. Waveforms 1 and 2 show the voltage and current response of the solar PV system. The introduced faults disrupt the terminal voltage and current, affecting system stability. Waveforms 3 and 4 depict the corresponding behaviour in the WE system, where the faults similarly cause disturbances in voltage and current. Figure20(b) presents the results for the fuel cell and utility grid (UG) systems. Waveforms 1 and 2 show the voltage and current variations in the fuel cell system due to the applied faults. Waveforms 3 and 4 illustrate the response of the UG system. Notably, faultin the UG system causes current variations that consequently alter the overall DCMG power balance. These results highlight the effectiveness of the GA method in maintaining stability under fault conditions across different DG sources.

Waveforms 1 and 2 show the impact on; again, all faults disrupt voltage and current, andalters the current, affecting the DCMG power balance. Waveforms 3 and 4 depict the behavior of, where the faults disrupt the terminal voltage and current.

Finally, Fig.22(waveforms 1 and 2) shows the impact on. The faults disrupt both the voltage and current at theterminal. These results demonstrate the varying effects of the applied faults on different loads and the energy storage system within the DCMG. Figure22(waveforms 3 and 4) shows the voltage and current at, obtained using the GA method. Faults,, and(0.05 ms severity) disruptterminal voltage and current. The waveform changes inare similar to those indue to their identical parameters. To achieve this verification, the dSPACE DL350 simulator V-I settings were adjusted to encompass 16 levels. Similarly, it can be observed that the V-Is are verified with the results obtained from the Opal-RT simulation.

Table6presents a summary of how existing non-AI-based methods perform, specifically regarding their parametric capacity42. According to this comparison, the proposed model offers advantages, notably a strong ability to correctly identify faults even with high fault resistance, thus minimizing false alarms and misoperations. Furthermore, it requires a low sampling rate and has reduced computational demands. Importantly, the model does not necessitate synchronized data acquisition.

GA’s superior fault tolerance enhances microgrid reliability by optimizing fault detection and control, ensuring rapid mitigation, improved efficiency, and resilience. This analysis supports future comparative studies for advanced fault management strategies in microgrid applications, strengthening system stability and performance.

This study presents a novel approach for detecting line-to-ground (LG) faults in DC microgrids (DCMGs), incorporating voltage and current disturbances at terminal points. Various fault scenarios were analyzed using MATLAB simulations, integrating multiple control strategies, including PI controllers, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs), and optimization algorithms. The proposed protection mechanism effectively detected and isolated short-circuit faults, mitigating fault current impact. A comparative evaluation between optimized and non-optimized configurations, validated through Opal-RT real-time simulations, demonstrated enhanced fault detection accuracy, improved system reliability, and minimized operational disruptions. Despite these advancements, limitations exist, such as the reliance on predefined parameters for FLC tuning and the computational complexity of genetic algorithm-based optimization. Future research should explore adaptive machine learning models for real-time fault detection, hybrid optimization techniques for enhanced controller performance, and experimental validation under large-scale microgrid conditions. Extending this methodology to AC grids and hybrid AC/DC systems could further enhance fault detection and system stability in renewable-integrated networks.
