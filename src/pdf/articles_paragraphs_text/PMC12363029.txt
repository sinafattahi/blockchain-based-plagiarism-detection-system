Xinjiang, China, is arid, and its ecological environment is fragile.Tulipa iliensisis mainly distributed in the Xinjiang region of China, with an altitude of around 800–2100 m. As an important part of desert vegetation, it plays a very important role in the stability of regional ecosystems. To understand howTulipa iliensisadapts to changes in altitude in arid areas and uncover its ecological adaptation strategy, the study focused on the rhizosphere soil from seven natural distribution areas (1386~2073 m) ofTulipa iliensisin Xinjiang. The growth indicators (plant height, leaf length, fresh weight and dry weight of each organ), physical and chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil (total nitrogen, organic matter, organic carbon, total phosphorus, total potassium, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, pH, moisture content) and rhizosphere soil enzyme activities (phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, urease, sucrase, catalase) ofTulipa iliensisin each distribution area were determined, revealing the response of the ecological adaptation ofTulipa iliensisto altitude change. The results revealed that (1) at altitudes ranging from 1386 ~ 2073 m, the variation coefficient of the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisranged from 7.64 to 48.62%; among them, the variation degree of the leaf fresh weight was the highest, the variation coefficient was 48.62%, the variation degree of the root dry weight was the smallest, and the variation coefficient was 7.64%. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that altitude was significantly positively correlated with the plant height and leaf length ofTulipa iliensis, which was the main factor affecting its growth indicators. (2) The coefficients of variation for the physical and chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil of associated withTulipa iliensisexhibited a range from 2.47 to 53.43%; Notably, total potassium, available phosphorus, organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen displayed coefficients of variation exceeding 40%; In constrast, the variation in pH was minimal, with pH values ranging from 7.52 to 8.07, which suggests that the soil is weakly alkaline in nature. (3) As altitude increases, the coefficient of variation for the rhizosphere soil enzyme activity ofTulipa iliensisexhibited a range from 10.87 to 34.29%, the enzyme with the highest variation was soil sucrase, while the enzyme demonstrating the least variation was rhizosphere soil polyphenol oxidase. (4) Redundancy analysis indicated that the total nitrogen, total phosphorus and sucrase activities in the rhizosphere soil ofTulipa iliensiswere the key factors influencing its adaptation to various ecological environments. The findings of this research offer significant theoretical insights for the sustainable management ofTulipa iliensisvegetation in arid regions, as well as for the restoration and rehabilitation of desert ecosystems.

The climate in Xinjiang, China, is a typical temperate continental arid climate, with low precipitation, high evaporation, a dry climate, and a fragile ecosystem [1,2]. Despite the harsh conditions, the main distribution area for ephemeral flora in early spring remains this region, and it is also a significant part of desert flora and Central Asian flora [2]. Plants have been known to adapt to survive harsh conditions by going through multiple morphological, physiological, and genetic changes [3]. In arid areas of northwest China, vegetation has been shown to play an ecological barrier role, as shown by relevant studies [4]. Grassland degradation is a common occurrence because of long-term overgrazing and urban development, the restoration and sustainable development of the ecological environment in Xinjiang, China, is being affected by the extreme degradation or destruction of certain areas [5].

Tulipa iliensisis a perennial early spring ephemeral plant belonging to the genusTulipaof the family Liliaceae [6]. It is one of the main components of the short-lived plant layer in the desert grasslands during the early spring [7]. In China,Tulipa iliensisis widely distributed, and the suitable habitats are mainly plain deserts, dry slopes, and gravelly grasslands [8]. Owing to the special geographical environment of Xinjiang, China, it has strong resistance (low temperature, drought, heat) under long-term natural selection, which plays a vital role in the stability of regional ecosystems [9]. Notably, the growth indicator characteristics ofTulipa iliensisare significantly different at different altitudes [10]. Therefore, it is helpful to understand the ecological adaptation mechanism ofTulipa iliensisin different environments by exploring the differences in growth indicators at different altitudes.

Plant functional traits can serve as a representation of plant ecological strategies’ morphological, physiological, and phenological characteristics, and can influence how plants respond to environmental factors and impact ecosystem attributes [11]. Altitude is an important factor in the process of environmental change, the environment’s abiotic and biotic factors, such as temperature, humidity, light, and soil properties, will fluctuate depending on altitude, this will have an impact on the growth and physiological processes of plants [12]. Plant photosynthesis and respiration will be facilitated by a certain degree of temperature increase, as the temperature decreases with altitude, this has an impact on the plant’s distribution, growth, and morphological changes [13]. Water and light will change with altitude, seedlings can improve photosynthesis and absorption of nutrients and grow better under adequate water and light conditions [14].

In addition, altitude also has an impact on soil properties. The volcanic region of Vesuvius, Italy, was examined to determine how elevation, slope aspect, and vegetation cover affect soil abiotic characteristics and soil microbial community, it was found that soil characteristics were highly influenced by elevation, and soil organic carbon was more abundant at low elevation, on the south slope, and under pine cover [15]. The study examined the altitude gradient that led to significant changes in the soil’s physical, chemical, and ecological biological characteristics of rhododendron in the Himalayan region, the physical and chemical properties of soil were found to be greatly influenced by the altitude gradient, altitude had a significant correlation with soil physical and chemical parameters, leading to an increase in soil infiltration capacity [16]. The Tsegede highlands of northern Ethiopia’s highlands have been studied to examine the effects of altitude and land use types on the physical and chemical properties of acidic soil, the findings revealed that soil bulk density, organic matter, and total nitrogen had a significant correlation with altitude, and low-altitude areas had a lower level of soil organic matter than high-altitude areas [17].

Plant functional traits are impacted by significant changes in abiotic factors (temperature, precipitation, soil properties, etc.) due to altitude changes. Research has proven that rhizosphere β-glucosidase and urease activities have a positive correlation with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content, promoting stem diameter and lignin synthesis, and enhancing lodging resistance [18]. Organic matter decomposition and nutrient mineralization are directly affected by soil enzymes like phosphatase, urease, and dehydrogenase, which in turn affect plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and biomass accumulation [19]. The synergistic effect of soil physical and chemical properties and enzyme activity was optimized by organic amendments, leading to a significant increase in maize yield [20].

The study area has a temperate continental and alpine climate, with cool temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south. It is situated in the upper reaches of the Ili River in northwest Xinjiang, China, in the hinterland of the Tianshan Mountains, mountains encircle the area on three sides. The range is 40°14′16"N to 49°10′45"N and 80°09′42"E ~ 91°01′45"E. The average yearly temperature is between 2.9 °C and 9.2 °C, with significant temperature variations between northern and southern China as well as between humid and mild climates (Fig.1).

Tulipa iliensiswas selected from altitudes of 1386–1390, 1401–1409, 1698–1699, 1728–1740, 1881–1883, 1933–1976 and 2039–2073 m (Table1). The species identifcation was undertaken by Xiuting Ju and Tingliang Xu (Qinghai University, Xining, China). Three sampling points were chosen as replicates, and one plot measuring 50 m by 50 m was selected at each altitude. The three replicates were systematically arranged in an S-shaped pattern configuration. Each replicate was responsible for collecting soil samples from the vicinity of healthyTulipa iliensisroots. Initially, the upper layers of soil were excavated incrementally using a soil knife to reveal the roots ofTulipa iliensis, the soil adhering to the fine roots was gently shaken off, and the soil in close proximity to the roots was delicately brushed with a sterile soft brush to obtain the rhizosphere soil. Following the removal of visible roots and other debris from the freshly collected soil samples, each sampling point was further subdivided into two subsamples. These samples were subsequently dried and sieved through a 2 mm mesh to facilitate the assessment of soil physical and chemical properties, as well as soil enzyme activity.

Simultaneously, a healthy plant with undamaged leaves, free from insect bites and exhibiting good growth was collected from each sample for the assessment of growth indicators, the date of sampling, along with details about the location, altitude, longitude, and latitude, was also documented. Voucher specimens were stored in the Key Laboratory of Qinghai Province for Landscape Plants Research of Qinghai University in Xining, China (Xiu-Ting, JU, juxiuting@163.com), under the voucher number JXT-2023-YJX429.

The soil total nitrogen (TN) content was determined via the Kjeldahl method. The soil moisture content (MC) was determined via the drying method [21]. The pH was determined through a potentiometric approach. The total phosphorus (TP) content of the soil was determined through acid dissolution and subsequent molybdenum-antimony anticolorimetric methods. The available phosphorus (AP) content was measured via the hydrochloric acid-ammonium fluoride method, the total potassium (TK) content was measured through sodium hydroxide alkali melting followed by flame photometry, and the available potassium (AK) content was assessed via ammonium acetate extraction coupled with flame photometry. The soil organic matter (SOM) and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents were determined via external heating with potassium dichromate oxidation and volumetric analysis [22]. The contents of soil nitrate-nitrogen (NO3−-N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) were measured by indophenol blue and phenol disulfuric acid colorimetry, respectively [23].

The activity of soil urease (Ure) was determined via phenol sodium-sodium hypochlorite colorimetry. Soil catalase (CAT) activity was determined via potassium permanganate titration [24]. The soil sucrase (SUC) activity was determined via the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid colorimetric method [25]. The activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were determined via pyrogallol colorimetry. The activity of phosphatase (ACP) was determined via the disodium phenyl phosphate colorimetric method [26,27].

The height of each plant and the length of its leaves were assessed using a Vernier caliper, which has a precision of 0.01 mm. The fresh weights of the roots, bulbs, leaves, and flowers were individually recorded using an electronic balance with a precision of 0.001 g. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to drying in a constant-temperature oven set at 80 ℃ until a constant weight was achieved, the dry weights of the roots, bulbs, leaves and flowers were then measured separately, each of this measurements was conducted in triplicate, and the results were averaged.

We compared the differences in the growth indicators, rhizosphere soil physicochemical properties and enzyme activity ofTulipa iliensisat seven different altitudes via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS (28.0) software (p< 0.05), and multiple significant comparisons were carried out via the least difference significant (LSD) method. Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to determine the relationships among the growth indicators, rhizosphere soil enzyme activities and soil physicochemical properties ofTulipa iliensis.

As altitude increases, the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisexhibits significant variation across different distribution areas (Table2). The coefficient of variation for those growth indicators ranges from 7.64 to 48.62%. Among these indicators, the DWR demonstrates the highest stability across varying altitudes, with a coefficient of variation of 7.64%, in contrast, FWL, LL and pH levels show considerable variability, with coefficients of variation of 48.62%, 46% and 41%, respectively. At altitudes between 1401 and 1409 m, the parameters PH, LL, FWB, DWB, FWF and FWD were significantly higher than those observed in other distribution, however, FWR does not exhibit significant difference across the various altitude gradients.

Based on the coefficient of variation, this study indicates that the growth indicators primarily influenced by genetic factors include FWR, DWR, which exhibit a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than or equal to 10%. In contrast, the traits that are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors encompass FWF, DWB, and DWL (10%< CV ≤ 30%); and the main traits regulated by environmental factors are FWL, LL, and PH (CV > 30%).

The regression analysis conducted on the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisacross varying altitudes indicated that both the fresh and dry weights of the roots exhibited minimal variation with increasing altitude (p> 0.05), the R2values for the fresh and dry weights of the roots were determined to be 0.016 and 0.011, respectively. The data presented suggest that the roots were not significantly affected by altitude (Fig.2a). Conversely, the fresh and dry weights of bulbs (Fig.2b), leaves (Fig.2c), and flowers (Fig.2d) exhibited a significant decline with increasing altitude, the peak values for these growth indicators were recorded at altitudes ranging from 1401 to 1409 m, however, However, the statistical significance level (p> 0.05) indicates that altitude alone does not account for the observed trends, suggesting that the bulbs, leaves, and flowers ofTulipa iliensisare also not significantly influenced by altitude.

The analysis of plant height (Fig.2e) and leaf length (Fig.2f) revealed a decreasing trend with increasing altitude, exhibiting R2values of 0.645 (p< 0.05) and 0.705 (p< 0.05), respectively. These results suggest significant negative correlations both plant height and leaf length with altitude, with altitude accounting for 64.46% and 70.47% of the variance in plant height and leaf length, respectively. These findings imply that the various morphological traits ofTulipa iliensisare differentially influenced by altitude, indicating that altitude has a notable impact on both leaf length and plant height in this species.

The physical and chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil associated withTulipa iliensisexhibited variations across different altitudinal gradients (Table3). The coefficient of variation for these properties ranged from 2.47 to 53.43%. Among the the soil factors assessed, pH demonstrated the least variability, with a coefficient of variation of 2.47%, while NH4+-N exhibited the highest variability, with a coefficient of variation of 53.43%.

The TN content exhibited a range from 1.84 to 7.97 g.kg− 1with the peak concentration observed at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, where it reached 7.97 g.kg− 1, this concentration is not statistically different from that found in the distribution area at altitudes of 1933 to 1976 m, however, it is significantly higher than the levels recorded in the other distribution areas. Conversely, the lowest TN content was identified at altitudes ranging from 1401 to 1409 m, measuring 1.84 g.kg− 1. Additionally, the NH4+-N content varied from 1.58 to 5.90 mg.kg− 1, with the maximum concentration of 5.90 mg.kg− 1occurring an altitude of 1698 to 1699 m, which the minimum concentration of 1.58 mg.kg− 1was noted at an altitude of 1933 to 1976 m. The concentration of NO3−-N reaches its peak at an altitude ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, measuring 76.36 mg.kg− 1, which is considerably greater than the levels observed in other regions, conversely, the lowest concentration is recorded at an altitude of 1401 to 1409 m, with a value of 14.01 mg.kg− 1, which is markedly lower than that found in other areas.

The variation of TK content ranges from 19.13 to 21.86 g.kg− 1. The maximum concentration is observed at an altitude of 1698 to 1699 m, which is considerably higher than that found in other areas of distribution. Conversely, the minimum TK content is recorded at altitudes ranging from 1401 to 1409 m, which is significantly lower than that in the other regions. Additionally, At altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, the highest AK content measured 603.00 mg.kg− 1, this value does not differ from that observed in the distribution area from 1933 to 1976 m, yet it is significantly greater than that the levels found in in the other distribution areas. The lowest AK content, recorded at altitudes of 1401 to 1409 m, was 287.00 mg.kg− 1.

The SOC content exhibited a range from 17.97 to 84.04 g.kg− 1, with the minimum concentration occurring at altitudes from 1401 to 1409 m, and maximum concentration observed at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m. Similarly, the SOM content varied from 30.98 to 144.89 g.kg− 1, with the lowest levels also recorded at altitudes of 1401 to 1409 m, while the highest level were found at altitudes of 2039 to 2073 m. Furthermore, the MC content peaked at altitudes of 2039 to 2073 m, reaching 34.79%, which is considerably higher than that observed those in other elevation ranges. Conversely, the lowest MC value was noted at an altitude of 1728 to 1740 m, measuring 12.77%.

The coefficient of variation for enzyme activity in rhizosphere soil exhibited a range from 10.87 to 34.29%. Among the enzymes analyzed, soil PPO activity demonstrated the least variability, with a coefficient variation of 10.87%. Conversely, soil soil SUC activity exhibited the greatest variability, with a coefficient variation of 34.29% (Table4).

The minimum soil Ure activity recorded 5.23 mg. d− 1. g− 1at altitudes ranging from 1401 to 1409 m, this value does not exhibit a significant difference when compared to the soil Ure activity within the distribution area of 1728 to 1740 m, however, it is considerably lower than soil the Ure activity in other distribution areas, where the maximum recorded soil Ure activity was 12.65 mg. d− 1. g− 1at altitudes of 2039 to 2073 m. In terms of soil SUC activity, the values ranged from 55.59 to 228.71 mg. d− 1. g− 1, the lowest soil activity, measured at 55.59 mg. d− 1. g− 1, was also found at altitudes of 1401 to 1409 m, which is significantly lower than the activities recorded in other distribution areas, conversely, the highest soil SUC activity of 228.71 mg. d− 1. g− 1was observed at altitudes of 2039 to 2073 m, a value that does not significantly differ from that in the distribution area of 1933 to 1976 m, yet is significantly higher than those in other distribution areas.

A correlation was observed between the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisacross various in different distribution areas and the physicochemical characteristics of the rhizosphere soil, as well as the activity of soil enzymes (Fig.3). Altitude exhibited a significant negative correlation with both leaf length and plant height. TN content demonstrated a significant negative correlation with leaf length, plant height, bulb fresh weight and dry weight, as well as flower fresh weight and dry weight. Additionally, NO3−-N was significantly negatively correlated with leaf length, plant height, and flower fresh weight. TP and TK exhibited a significant negative correlation with root fresh weight. SOC and SOM demonstrated significant negative correlations with leaf length, plant height, bulb fresh weight and dry weight, and flower fresh weight and dry weight. Conversely, pH showed a significant positive correlation with plant height, flower fresh weight, and bulb dry weight. These results indicate that concentrations of TN, SOC, SOM, TP, TK, NO3−-N, and pH in the rhizosphere soil influence the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensis.

A notable negative correlation was observed between the activity of soil ACP activity in the rhizosphere soil ofTulipa iliensisand both flower fresh weight and bulb dry weight. Ure activity exhibits a significant negative correlation with the bulb dry/fresh weight, as well as the flower fresh weight. Additionally, soil SUC activity demonstrates a strong negative correlation with plant height, bulb dry weight, flower fresh/dry weight, it also shows a significant negative correlation with leaf length, root fresh weight, and bulb fresh weight.

Furthermore, soil CAT activity exhibited a significant negative correlation with bulb dry/fresh weight, as well as the flower fresh/dry weight. These results suggest that the activities of various soil enzyme within the rhizosphere ofTulipa iliensisexert differential effects on distinct plant, with a predominant influence observed on the bulbs and flower organs ofTulipa iliensis.

A redundancy analysis was performed to examine the relationships between the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisin the root zone and the physicochemical properties of the soil (Fig.4a), as well as the activity of soil enzymes (Fig.4b). The analysis demonstrated that RDA1 and RDA2 accounted for 97.44% and 2.30% of the variation in the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensis, espectively. Collectively, the physicochemical properties of the rhizosphere soil and soil enzyme activity explained 99.74% of the total variation in the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisindicating that the reliability of the results. Notably, TN, TP, and soil SUC activity were found to significantly influence the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisacross different altitudes (p< 0.05), with explanatory rates of 65.1%, 9.4%, and 76.5%, respectively (Table5). These findings suggest that TN, TP, and SUC are key environmental factors that impacting the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensis.

Soil fertility serves as a multifaceted indicator of numerous soil characteristics that influence the overall growth and developmental processes of plants. Several determinants of soil fertility encompass elevation, climatic conditions, the presence of organic matter within the soil, and soil pH levels [28,29]. Altitude is a comprehensive factor that influences light, water and thermal conditions, thereby exerting a direct effect on the ecological environment [30,31]. By modulating precipitation and temperature, altitude imparts specific characteristics to vegetation at varying elevation, which in turn alters the dynamics of litter decomposition and root exudation into the soil organic matter, this process leads to notable variations in soil nutrient composition [32]. Research has demonstrated the influence of soil depth and altitude on the soil texture and soil quality index [33], as well as the impact of vegetation type and altitude the storage of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen in the Yunnan mountainous area [34], these studies indicate that the SOC and SOM concentrations tend to be higher in soils located at elevated altitudes. Consistent with these findings, the present study identified the highest concentration of theTulipa iliensisat an elevation of 2039–2073 m, where it reached 144.89 g.kg− 1, a value that was significantly greater than those observed in other distribution areas.

Yining city, situated in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, China, occupies a central position within the Ili River Valley. The area experiences moderate climate characterized by an average annual precipitation of 279.1 mm and an average temperature of 9.2℃, categorizing it as a moderately semiarid region [35]. The predominant vegetation type in this locale is grassland, particularly notable for its thriving meadow grassland ecosystems. The accumulation of organic matter in this region is substantial, rendering it a primary contributor to soil organic carbon storage. During the survey and sampling activities, it was observed that certain habitats of theTulipa iliensiswere located within grazing areas. Local inhabitants enhance soil organic matter through the excretory activities of livestock during grazing, which in turn boosts soil microbial productivity and enzyme activity, thereby facilitating nitrogen mineralization and increasing nitrogen availability [36,37]. Furthermore, as elevation rises and the temperature declines, lower temperatures impede the activities of soil microbial decomposition activities, the decomposition cycle of organic matter is extended, leading to an increased retention of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil in the form of undecomposed or semi-decomposed organic matter,resulting in nutrient accumulation. Concurrently, the plant growth cycle in high-altitude regions is limited due to low temperatures, resulting in a reduced demand for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compared to low-altitude flora. This disparity exacerbates the imbalance of nutrient input and output in the soil. Furthermore, the intensity of anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture and livestock grazing, is relatively low in high-altitude areas, allowing the natural nutrient accumulation process to proceed undisturbed. Consequently, this phenomenon is observed at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, where the concentrations of TN, NO3−-N, TP, AP, AK, SOC, and SOM are significantly higher than in other regions.

Research has demonstrated that regions characterized by elevated soil moisture levels typically exhibit lower pH values, in contrast to regions with diminished soil moisture, which are associated with higher pH values [38]. The present study corroborated these findings. The spatial variability of soil pH is shaped by a multitude of factors, encompassing both natural and anthropogenic influences. Among these, altitude emerges as a significant determinant, as pH generally declines with an increase in altitude [39]. In the present study, the pH values were recorded within a range of 7.52 to 8.07. The minimum pH value of 7.52 was identified in the distribution area located at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, while the maximum pH value of 8.07 was observed in the distribution area at altitudes ranging from 1401 to 1409 m. This variation can be explained by the relationship between altitude and soil moisture content, as altitude increases, soil moisture content tends to rise, resulting in a corresponding decrease in soil pH. The predominant soil types found in the temperate grasslands of Xinjiang are characterized as chestnut calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium and magnesium ions [40]. Consequently, these soils exhibit alkaline properties, with the pH values of the sampled soil ranging from 7.52 to 8.07 in the sampled areas. The optimal pH range for soil health is identified as between 6.5 and 7.5, within the elevation range of 2039 to 2073 m, the rhizosphere soil ofTulipa iliensisexhibits the lowest pH value of 7.5, which enhances nutrient availability and facilitates promotes the accumulation of organic matter and organic carbon [41]. This observation is consistent with the findings of the current study, which revealed that the elevation range of 2039 to 2073 m corresponds to the highest concentrations of SOC and SOM, this suggests a significant relationship between the physical and chemical characteristics of the rhizosphere soil associated withTulipa iliensis. Consequently, taking into account multiple influencing factors, the soil within the distribution area at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m exhibited elevated concentrations of TN, NO3−-N, TP, AP, AK, SOC, and SOM in comparison to the distribution area at altitudes ranging from 1386 to 1976 m.

Variations in soil enzyme activity have been observed in the rhizosphere soil ofTulipa iliensiscultivated at varying altitudes and within different habitats. Soil enzymes are crucial for the cycling of materials within soil ecosystems, and their activity serves as a comprehensive indicator of alterations in soil environment, quality, and fertility [42,43]. A study investigating the soil ecological stoichiometry and enzyme activity of natural secondary Quercus soil in the Dabie Mountains revealed that the activities of SUC, Ure, ACP, and CAT in the soil exhibited an increase with rising altitude [44].

In this investigation, the distribution area situated at an altitude of 1401–1409 m exhibited markedly lower soil activities of ACP, Ure, SUC, and CAT compared to other distribution areas did. This phenomenon can be attributed to the specific habitat ofTulipa iliensisin this region, characterized by rocky grassland slopes with minimal soil development and a high capacity for water erosion, such conditions lead to soil quality, as evidenced by reduced SOC and SOM levels, which in turn result in diminished enzymatic activities of ACP, Ure, SUC and CAT, consequently, the natural distribution of wild plant species also plays a significant role in influencing the enzymatic activity within the rhizosphere soil. Conversely, at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, the soil activities of ACP, Ure, SUC, and CAT were found to be the highest. This can be primarily attributed to the fact thatTulipa iliensis, which thrives in these relatively elevated regions, is subjected to lower soil temperatures, slower nutrient cycling rates, and reduced availability of nutrients. This phenomenon enhances the metabolic activity of soil microorganisms, resulting in an increased secretion of soil enzymes that improve substrate efficacy and facilitate the cycling of essential elements such as N, K, and P within the soil [45,46]. As a result, ACP, Ure, SUC, and CAT in the rhizosphere soil are observed to be higher in regions of relatively elevated altitude compared to those at lower altitudes.

The activities of soil PPO and POD activities were observed to be at their lowest levels at altitudes ranging from 2039 to 2073 m, this finding contrasts with the activities of ACP, Ure, SUC, and CAT, indicating that the soil microorganisms responsible for PPO and POD exhibit a limited tolerance to cold temperatures [47]. Previous research has demonstrated that enzyme activity is primarily influenced by various factors, including temperature [48], partial pressure of oxygen [49], and ultraviolet UV-B radiation [50]. In this study, the soil activities of PPO and POD in the rhizosphere soil ofTulipa iliensisdiminished in high altitude regions, primarily due to the decrease in temperature associated with increasing altitude, which in turn reduces molecular thermal motion. Lower temperatures adversely affect the binding efficiency of PPO and POD with their substrates. Furthermore, PPO and POD are predominantly secreted by aerobic fungi. And the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in high-altitude environments negatively impacts the activity of oxidases that are reliant on aerobic microorganisms. Additionally, the elevated levels of ultraviolet radiation in these regions can adversely affect the structure of the enzymes, as aromatic amino acids, such as tyrosine, present in PPO and POD are particularly to UV exposure. Consequently, the activities of PPO and POD in the rhizosphere soil ofTulipa iliensisare influenced by a multitude of factors.

A reciprocal relationship exists between the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisand the activity of soil enzymes, as well as the physical properties of the soil. The nutrient composition of the soil exerts an indirect influence on soil enzyme activity by affecting the growth of both plants and microorganisms, thereby, establishing a link between soil enzyme activity and nutrients availability [51,52].

This research investigated the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisacross varying altitudinal gradients, alongside an examination of the physicochemical characteristics and enzymatic activities present in the rhizosphere soil. The findings revealed that the TN, TP, and SUC concentrations in the rhizosphere soil were significant environmental determinants influencing the growth ofTulipa iliensis. This species is characterized as a short-lived C3plant that flowers in early spring and necessitates effective carbon accumulation to successfully complete its aboveground life cycle within a limited timeframe [53], to accomplish this, plants must uptake a significant quantity of available water and nutrients. The accumulation of nutrients is largely contingent upon leaf photosynthesis, with the photosynthetic efficiency of C3plants being intricately linked to the relative and TN contents present in the leaves [54]. Furthermore, research examining the variations in stable carbon isotopic composition changes ofTulipa iliensisin the Junggar Basin, China, indicated that the TN content in the soil significantly affects the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) ofTulipa iliensis, corroborating the results of the current study [55].

In the soil ecosystem, soil SUC plays a significant role in the carbon cycling process [56]. Microorganisms release specific SUC to fulfill the nutritional needs ofTulipa iliensis. Consequently, in regions with an altitudes below 1600 m, where water and thermal conditions are adequate, the soil exhibits elevated TN and TP levels, as well as heightened SUC activity, these conditions are typically found in meadow plains or slopes, which provide a more favorable environment the growth ofTulipa iliensisand facilitate to the accumulation both underground and aboveground biomass.

In mountainous ecosystems, altitude is frequently utilized as a natural delineation of habitat gradients, which reflects the cumulative influences of various factors, including temperature, light, humidity, and soil composition. It is widely accepted that an increase in altitude correlates with a reduction in both the number of individual plants and the overall biomass [57,58]. Research examining the adaptive characteristics of leaf traits in high-altitude flora, such as prickly ash [59],Quercus aquifolioidesandSorbus rehderianaon the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau [60], as well asLeontopodium nanumon the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau [61], has demonstrated that both plant height and leaf size tend to diminish with rising altitude, which is consistent the findings of this study.

As altitude increases, notable variations in the leaf length and plant height ofTulipa iliensisare observed. Specifically, the maximum leaf length and the plant height occur at altitudes ranging from 1401 to 1409 m. Furthermore, the fresh weight and dry matter accumulation of various organs ofTulipa iliensisare also highest at this altitude, suggesting that environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, soil quality and altitude in this region are conducive to the growth of theTulipa iliensis. Consequently, an analysis of the growth indicators ofTulipa iliensisacross different altitudes indicates that strategically lowering the altitude for its growth may enhance the effective utilization ofTulipa iliensisvegetation in arid region.

Tulipa iliensis, when observed at altitudes ranging from 2039 m to 2073 m, exhibited significantly reduced leaf length, plant height, fresh weight, and dry matter accumulation in comparison to populations at other altitudes. This phenomenon can be primarily attributed to the adverse effects of high altitude, including strong winds and lower temperatures, which negatively influence the growth ofTulipa iliensis. In response to the cold environment and the abbreviated growing season characteristic of high-altitude regions,Tulipa iliensistends to allocate a greater proportion of its biomass to subterranean structures, leading to a decrease in aboveground biomass and the manifestation of dwarfism [62]. These variations in growth indicators represent adaptive strategies employed by the species to enhance survival and reproductive success across diverse climatic and habitat conditions.

Tulipa iliensis, represents a distinctive element of desert flora in Xinjiang, China. This research elucidated the effects of varying altitudes on the growth indicators, rhizosphere soil physical and chemical properties of rhizosphere soil, and soil enzyme activities associated withTulipa iliensiswithin the mountain ecosystems of arid regions in Xinjiang. The investigation revealed that total nitrogen, total phosphorus and sucrase activity in the rhizosphere soil are critical factors influencing the species’ adaptation to diverse ecological conditions. Additionally, morphological variations ofTulipa iliensiswere observed with increasing altitude (Fig.5). The results of this study offer significant theoretical insights for the sustainable utilization ofTulipa iliensisin arid landscapes, vegetation restoration, and the ecological system reconstruction in desert environments.
