This study investigates the predictive capacity of LACC1 regarding the response to upadacitinib (UPA) in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The study involved sixty adult patients with active RA who either did not respond well to or could not tolerate methotrexate. The regimen involved UPA monotherapy at 15 mg/day, while maintaining a fixed dose of glucocorticoids was acceptable. Follow-up was planned for 24 weeks. Treatment response was assessed using Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count, and Health Assessment Questionnaire. Moreover, parameters associated with treatment response to UPA were measured.

Serum LACC1 levels may be protective in predicting response to UPA therapy. Age, prolonged disease duration, increased use of csDMARDs, low neutrophil counts, and higher inflammatory markers were strongly associated with non-good response. Prolonged disease duration, increased TJC/68, low neutrophil count, and high GM-CSF levels were all independent unfavorable predictors of good response to UPA treatment, while higher serum LACC1 levels were more helpful in predicting good response. Patients with an extended disease course, high TJC/68, and significantly increased inflammatory cytokines should be advised of the potential for poor early outcomes.

Higher serum LACC1 levels are associated with better efficacy of UPA, with implications for optimizing clinical individualized dosing strategies.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a widespread and intricate autoimmune disorder affecting 0.5% to 1% of the global population, marked by synovial inflammation and joint destruction [1]. Its pathogenesis involves multiple inflammatory and immune pathways, including the interaction of T cells, B cells, monocytes-macrophages, and a variety of inflammatory cytokines, which not only lead to joint pain and dysfunction, but also cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and other systemic injuries [2–4]. In the last few decades, a diverse array of small molecules and biologics has been applied in clinical settings, with the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway receiving much attention for its vital role in the regulation of inflammatory responses [5,6]. Upadacitinib (UPA), a second-generation selective JAK inhibitor [7], reduces synovial inflammation and prevents structural damage to the joints by inhibiting JAK1-mediated cytokine signaling, such as interleukin (IL)−6, IL-17, and IL-21 [8,9]. Randomized controlled trials and studies have demonstrated that UPA improves clinical symptoms, reduces joint swelling and pain, and enhances the quality of life for RA patients who not respond well to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or other biologic agents [10–12]. Nonetheless, a significant number of patients continue to have inadequate efficacy with UPA or show widely differing response patterns [13]. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict patient responses before and early in the treatment process to refine personalized treatment approaches has become a significant focus in clinical care.

Research has increasingly focused on the Laccase domain-containing protein 1 (LACC1) gene, which encodes a protein featuring a laccase-like domain, believed to be related to different immune cell functions and inflammation [14,15]. The genetic susceptibility of LACC1 to autoimmune conditions like Crohn's disease [16] and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [17] suggests its significant role in the control of innate and acquired immune responses. LACC1 protein or its mutants may affect the activation of macrophages and monocytes [18], thereby regulating the response to pathogens or self-antigens, and affecting the expression and release of downstream inflammatory factors by interfering with signaling pathways such as NF-κB or MAPK [19]. In the field of RA, scholars have reported the relationship between LACC1 gene polymorphisms and RA susceptibility [20], and hypothesized that it has a role in the pathological activation of synovial macrophages and fibroblasts. However, evidence is still scarce regarding whether changes in serum LACC1 levels correlate with a patient's disease activity or the efficacy of specific therapies. Some early studies imply that elevated expression or intact LACC1 function may defend against arthritis, potentially by inhibiting excessive inflammatory signaling [14]. It is predicted that LACC1 could serve as a novel marker for regulating inflammation, yet extensive prospective research is needed to establish its causal relationship with JAK inhibitor therapy response.

Based on the above background, the following hypothesis was proposed in this study: In RA patients, serum LACC1 levels are significant indicators of early clinical response to UPA treatment, with elevated levels potentially offering protection or promoting a positive response. To test this hypothesis, we designed and conducted a prospective observational cohort study that enrolled RA patients with high baseline disease activity who met the indications for UPA, and systematically collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, and imaging data from patients before and 24 weeks after treatment (W24). This study aims to clarify the biological mechanism and predictive significance of LACC1 in response to UPA treatment, setting the stage for future large-scale precision medicine research related to LACC1.

This study was a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate the predictive value of serum LACC1 levels for the efficacy of UPA in patients with RA. From November 2023 to June 2024, 60 adult patients with active RA were recruited at Hainan General Hospital who had not responded well to methotrexate (MTX) at the highest tolerated dose for over three months (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate, DAS28-ESR ≥ 3.2). The patients met the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA. All enrolled patients were those who had insufficient response to biologic antirheumatic drugs or other JAK inhibitors and had never used UPA before. The treatment protocol allowed for UPA monotherapy at 15 mg/d, combined with a stable glucocorticoid dose (no more than 10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent) without any dose modification. Patients were excluded in the presence of active infections, neoplasms, or severe and unstable organ dysfunction. A total of 60 patients were enrolled in the study, and follow-up was planned for 24 weeks. All patients provided written informed consent, and any significant adverse reactions or instances of loss to follow-up were recorded, with missing data addressed statistically.

The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was utilized as the primary method for assessing disease activity at the end of week 24 (W24), mainly to prevent overestimating UPA's effect on the rapid decline in ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP). Patients were categorized into three groups based on efficacy: a CDAI of 10 or less was defined as a good response (with ≤ 2.8 being clinical remission and 2.8–10 indicating low disease activity), a CDAI from 10 to 22 was a moderate response, and a CDAI over 22 was a poor response. Secondary indicators included the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and adverse events.

At baseline (W0), demographic and clinical data of patients were collected, including age, gender, disease duration, previous use of disease-modifying drugs, glucocorticoid use, etc. DAS28-ESR, CDAI, SDAI, TJC, SJC, HAQ, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and serum ESR and CRP levels were recorded. After 24 weeks of treatment (W24), venous blood was drawn again to test serum LACC1 concentration and other routine laboratory indicators. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or other highly sensitive quantitative approaches, serum LACC1 levels were measured and calculated. For analysis, values under the lower quantification limit were recorded as half of that limit. Throughout the follow-up period, glucocorticoid dosage and other potential confounders should be continuously recorded for correction or subgroup analysis.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 software. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile spacing) after the normality test. The selection between an independent sample t-test and a Mann–Whitney U-test for group comparisons depended on the distribution of the data. Categorical variables were represented as case numbers (percentages) and analyzed using either the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. The cut-off values for serum LACC1 (< 5 pg/ml and < 10 pg/ml), used for creating categorical variables, were determined post-hoc using a data-driven approach rather than being pre-specified. To identify the optimal threshold for predicting “non-good response”, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was generated. The Youden’s index (Sensitivity + Specificity—1) was calculated for all possible cut-off points, and the value of 10 pg/mL was identified as an optimal threshold providing a good balance between sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, “LACC1 < 10 pg/mL” was used as the primary categorical variable in subsequent analyses. The additional cut-off of < 5 pg/mL, which approximates the lower quartile of the LACC1 distribution in our cohort, was explored to assess the impact of particularly low LACC1 levels on treatment response. To identify independent predictors of treatment response, a multivariate logistic regression model was built. The predictive value of parameters for treatment response was first assessed using univariate analysis. To avoid prematurely excluding potentially important predictors in the exploratory phase of this study, variables with aP-value < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were considered candidates for the multivariate logistic regression model. This approach helps to identify variables that may show significant effects after adjusting for confounders. For multiple comparisons, the Kruskal–Wallis H-test with Bonferroni correction was used. In the correlation analysis, Spearman's rank correlation test quantified the relationship between serum LACC1 and continuous variables including CDAI, ESR, and CRP. During the follow-up, instances of lost visits and missing data were noted, and relevant interpolation or intentional analysis techniques were implemented. All statistical tests were performed at a two-sidedP< 0.05 level of significance.

A total of 60 patients with RA were enrolled, and all of them showed severe disease activity at baseline. At W24, patients were divided into three categories based on the CDAI: 41 (68.3%) were good response, 9 (15.0%) were moderate response, and 10 (16.7%) were poor response. When further comparing the good response group with the non-good response group (moderate and poor response combined), we found that the non-good response group was older at enrollment, had a longer duration of the disease, and had used more csDMARDs previously. At the same time, the proportion of RF positivity was lower in the non-good response group, but neutrophil counts at baseline were lower, and ESR was significantly higher. In addition, the tender joint count (TJC/68), DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, CDAI, SDAI, and HAQ scores were significantly higher. In terms of cytokine levels, the non-good response group showed significantly higher serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β levels, whereas serum LACC1 levels (< 5 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL) was significantly lower (Table1). This significant difference in baseline metrics suggests that serum LACC1 levels may be protective in predicting response to UPA therapy, except for some inflammatory factors that showed relative elevation. In contrast, age, prolonged disease duration, increased use of csDMARDs, low neutrophil counts, and higher inflammatory metrics were strongly associated with non-good response.

After incorporating indicators that showed statistical differences in univariate analyses, we performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine whether patients had achieved a good response at W24, and the results are shown in Table2. The analysis showed that disease duration, TJC/68, neutrophil counts, and baseline GM-CSF > 5 pg/mL were all unfavorable predictors of a good response; i.e., prolonged disease duration, elevated TJC/68, smaller reduction in the proportion of neutrophils, and elevated GM-CSF significantly reduced the probability of patients achieving a good response at W24. Meanwhile, we further validated the importance of serum LACC1 levels in predicting response to UPA treatment: when “LACC1 < 10 pg/mL” was included in the model, the OR also suggested that lower levels of LACC1 significantly reduced the probability of a good response, suggesting that relatively high levels of LACC1 may be protective against the efficacy of UPA. In addition, after replacing “baseline GM-CSF > 5 pg/mL” with “baseline GM-CSF > 10 pg/mL”, the ORs of the other variables remained stable, suggesting that the present multifactorial model is robust.

We systematically assessed the predictive ability of baseline metrics by ROC curve (Fig.1). The results showed that in predicting “non-good response”, TJC/68 (AUC = 0.720, 95% CI: 0.640–0.801,P< 0.001) and disease duration (AUC = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.580–0.760,P= 0.001) were highly discriminatory, and baseline serum GM-CSF level (AUC = 0.625, 95%CI: 0.530–0.720,P= 0.012) and neutrophil count ratio (AUC = 0.605, 95%CI: 0.510–0.700,P= 0.038) also had predictive values. When predicting “poor response” alone, the discriminatory power of DAS28-ESR (AUC = 0.765, 95%CI 0.645–0.885,P< 0.001) and serum LACC1 levels (AUC = 0.725, 95%CI 0.560–0.850,P= 0.001) was more prominent than that of IL-17A (AUC = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.535–0.805,P= 0.015) and IL-1β (AUC = 0.655, 95%CI: 0.525–0.785,P= 0.025). Overall, TJC/68, DAS28-ESR and inflammatory factors (GM-CSF/IL-17A/IL-1β) were able to help identify patients who were less likely to benefit to some extent.

In this study, 60 patients with active RA were followed up with 24-week treatment with UPA \through a single-center, prospective, observational cohort design, focusing on the predictive value of serum LACC1 levels for treatment efficacy. The results showed that: (1) at W24, about 68.3% of the patients achieved a good response as defined by CDAI, suggesting that UPA still showed a high rate of early response in patients who had a poor response to MTX; (2) disease duration, TJC/68, baseline GM-CSF level, and neutrophil count ratio (W24/baseline) were closely related to whether good response was achieved. (3) Multiple logistic regression analyses and ROC curve analyses further confirmed the potential protective role of serum LACC1 level in predicting early outcome of patients; (4) Other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-17A and TNF-α, were also associated with adverse response to a certain extent, but their interaction with LACC1 needs to be further investigated. Overall, this study supported the hypothesis that the higher the serum LACC1 level, the better the efficacy of UPA, which is instructive for the optimization of clinical individualized dosing strategies.

Current studies on the treatment of RA with UPA have focused on the effects of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and traditional inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α), while the attention to LACC1 has been limited. The present study found that patients with lower serum LACC1 levels were more likely to have a poor response, suggesting that LACC1 may play a “protective” or “regulatory” role in the immune-inflammatory and therapeutic response of RA. LACC1 is associated with susceptibility and disease activity in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease [16]. We hypothesize that LACC1 modulates excessive inflammatory reactions to both external and self-antigens by impacting monocyte-macrophage lineages or associated immune pathways, thus affecting disease activity and drug efficacy. On this basis, our results provide new potential ideas for the use of LACC1 for early screening or stratified management of RA patients.

From a mechanistic point of view, the present study also found that elevated levels of GM-CSF and insufficient decrease in neutrophil ratio were positively correlated with poor response, and both of them may interact with the regulatory network of LACC1. GM-CSF promotes the proliferation and activation of neutrophils and macrophages, which exacerbates synovial inflammation [21]. When LACC1 is not functioning properly or its levels are reduced, the inflammatory pathway can become more active, causing clinical symptoms that are challenging to relieve [14]. On the other hand, traditional clinical indicators such as prolonged disease duration and increased TJC/68, which can be regarded as indicative of chronic disease progression or activity, were also associated with higher inflammatory load and poorer treatment outcomes. These results are consistent with the pattern of “the longer the disease duration, the worse the response” reported in the literature, which further emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and timely and rational use of drugs [22].

Although this study provides novel insights into the predictive value of LACC1, we must acknowledge several significant limitations. First and foremost, the primary limitation is the small sample size (n = 60) from a single center. This not only affects the external validity and generalizability of our findings but also poses a challenge for the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Including a large number of variables in a model with a limited number of subjects increases the risk of overfitting, where the model may perform well on the current data but poorly on new, independent datasets. Therefore, the results of our multivariate model should be interpreted with caution and viewed as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive.

Second, this study was designed to identify predictors of response within a cohort of patients treated with UPA, which is why a non-UPA control group was not included. However, the findings are specific to this treatment and cannot be extrapolated to other therapies without further research. Third, while we have identified a strong statistical association, a detailed molecular mechanism study is lacking to explain the specific regulatory role of LACC1 in the JAK-STAT pathway or UPA's mechanism of action.

Based on these preliminary findings, it can be foreseen that serum LACC1 levels may serve as a valuable adjunctive biomarker in future individualized RA treatment strategies. To further improve the quality of evidence, large-scale, multi-center prospective studies are essential. Such studies should incorporate more clinical outcome indicators (e.g., imaging progression), and combine molecular biology experiments to explore the interactions between LACC1 and the JAK-STAT pathway. If the predictive value of LACC1 can be verified in a wider population and assessed in conjunction with other potential biomarkers, it will undoubtedly promote the development of precision medicine in RA and bring substantial benefits to patients.
