The ethnobotanical landscape in Nigeria reflects a complex interplay of biodiversity, cultural traditions, and health practices deeply rooted in indigenous knowledge. However, the fragmented body of knowledge in the existing limited inventory poses a threat to the loss of these plants and the associated indigenous knowledge. This review examined the historical and cultural uses of plants, as well as their long-term utilisation patterns.

Using a systematic search, the Web of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions were explored to gather ethnobotanical literature on utilisation of plants in Nigeria from 1964 to 2024. In addition, bibliometric tools were applied to establish the research trends and patterns.

From the 79 eligible studies, we collated 963 plants across 144 families (dominated by Fabaceae with 127 plants) utilised in seven categories namely medicinal/healthcare, spiritual, cosmetics, biopesticides, poison, timber, and fuelwood. An estimated 11% (103) of the 963 plants were classified as popular, with mentions ranging from 11 to 42 times, and the three top cited plants wereCarica papaya(42),Vernonia amygdalina(42) andMangifera indica(41). Most of the identified notable plants (e.g.,Azadirachta indica,Carica papaya,Mangifera indica, andVernonia amygdalina) had significant geographic and cultural relevance. The spiritual, medicinal, and socio-economic roles of these plants were intricately influenced by ethnic identities, ecological zones, and religious beliefs. Cross-regional and cross-cultural analyses revealed that the Southwest and Northeast regions accounted for the highest (70.98%) and lowest (10.28%) prevalence of plant use in Nigeria. Generally, plant utilisation patterns varied across regions, with certain shared uses identified thereby highlighting inter-ethnic connections, while others revealed localised traditions. We identified 19 plants (e.g.,Azadirachtaindica,Mangifera indica,Vachellia niloticaandXimenia americana) that were common to the six regions in Nigeria. Bibliometric analysis revealed that the evolution of plant research in Nigeria, from traditional knowledge to more specialised molecular and applied research methodologies. We defined three distinct timelines associated with ethnobotany in Nigeria entailing the initial phase associated with the fundamental period (1964–1989), expansion and growth with shifting focus in research (1990–2009) which was followed by the modernisation and integration (2010–2024).

Ethnobotanical research in Nigeria remains active, reflecting the extensive uses of plants to meet the daily needs of local communities. Nonetheless, challenges persist, including insufficient documentation of indigenous practices, limited collaboration, instances of non-adherence to best practices in ethnobotanical surveys. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the sustainable management of the ethnobotanical heritage in Nigeria.

Nigeria boasts a rich pool of plants, each often intertwined with distinct applications, rituals, and cultural beliefs across the diverse ethnic communities [1]. The country is characterised by high biodiversity and cultural diversity [2,3], with numerous plants supporting the livelihoods of millions [4]. Recognising the value of traditional knowledge associated with these plants [5], and the contributions of local communities is essential for conserving the biodiversity and cultural heritage [6,7]. Particularly, these plants offer natural-based treatments for diseases such as malaria, diabetes, and cancer. Local communities are often instrumental in safeguarding and sharing this knowledge, facilitating its passage across generations [8]. The understanding of ethnobotanical practices enhances cultural traditions and medicinal customs, exemplified by notable plants such as bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina) within Igbo culture and kola nut (Cola acuminataandC.nitida) among the Yorubas [9]. For health purpose, plants such asMorinda lucida, Azadirachta indica,andPsidium guajavaare useful for treating malaria, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders [10–12]. Furthermore, local communities utiliseElaeis guineensis,Vitellaria paradoxa, andMoringa oleiferato meet diverse health needs [4,13]. Plants such asCarica papaya,Vernonia amygdalina,Ageratum conyzoides, andChromolaena odoratahave demonstrated their importance for the general well-being and survival of the inhabitants in some communities [14–18].

Cultural practices often intersect with traditional knowledge, offering valuable insights into the sustainable use of plant resources [4]. This, in turn, fosters human well-being and environmental sustainability [18]. In Nigeria, plants such asGuiera senegalensis,Parkia biglobosa, Adansonia digitata, Cola nitida, Cola acuminata, Elaeis guineensis,andChrysophyllum albidum,generally hold significant cultural value [19].Guiera senegalensisplays multiple roles in cultural practices, including burial rituals, and ensuring safe journeys, highlighting the strong connection between plants and cultural traditions [20]. Across communities in Nigeria,Adansonia digitatais revered for its sacred nature and is believed to hold spiritual powers [21]. The utilisation of palm fronds fromElaeis guineensisholds a crucial place in various religious and cultural ceremonies, including traditional marriage rites and chieftaincy coronations [22].

The profound comprehension of plant ecosystems allows for the formulation of judicious decisions that enhance sustainable resource management and the preservation of biodiversity [23]. Indigenous practices are essential for the protection of plants using traditional knowledge, which in turn supports the conservation of biodiversity and enhances the resilience of cultural communities [24]. It remains pertinent to enhance traditional knowledge by uncovering new uses and benefits of these plants while promoting sustainable resource use by developing eco-friendly cultivation methods [25]. However, challenges including the increasing demand for plants due to their therapeutic properties, rapid population growth in regions where these plants are endemic, and environmental degradation from unsustainable harvesting practices, pose significant threats to their conservation [26–28]. The potential extinction of valuable plants highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts. Thus, the need for research effort and action to implement sustainable harvesting practices, establishing protected areas, and engaging local communities in conservation initiatives to safeguard biodiversity and cultural heritage [29,30].

This review delves into ethnobotanical activities among the ethnic groups in Nigeria, with a focus on the link between their cultural beliefs and plant uses. Furthermore, using a bibliometric approach, the significance of ethnomedicine in the Nigerian healthcare system and trends in ethnobotanical studies from 1964 to 2024 were applied to identify the knowledge gaps, research themes, and underexplored areas. This study explored the historical and cultural applications of plants in Nigeria, as a means of understanding the current research status and trends from an ethnobotanical perspective.

The Web of Science, Scopus, and Dimension were selected as the data sources due to their extensive coverage of relevant scientific studies in the field of ethnobotany. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [31], a search of these electronic databases was done in June 2024 to retrieve relevant studies on the ethnobotanical uses of plants in Nigeria. Additionally, we assessed theses, dissertations, and books from the Library of the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN). Phrases related to “ethnobotany,” “ethnobotanical studies,” “plant conservation,” “plant species,” and “Nigeria” were used as search terms to find relevant papers in the databases. Furthermore, the bibliographies of the retrieved articles were searched and saved in the EndNote reference manager.

We applied bibliometric analysis which serves as a quantitative examination of research trends, publication patterns, and collaboration networks [32]. This was essential to establish publication trend analysis, co-authorship and institutional networks, keyword analysis, thematic analysis, and word analysis. These method assists in identifying areas where knowledge is insufficient, which may pivotal for funding and policy decisions in the field [32].

The retrieved articles were screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table1). The inclusion criteria consisted of studies conducted in Nigeria from January 1, 1964, to June 30, 2024; scientific articles published in English; and studies addressing ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry, and the conservation status of plant species in Nigeria, ensuring a comprehensive selection. The exclusion criteria included studies not written in English, review articles, studies conducted outside Nigeria, studies published before 1964, and studies that did not address ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry, or the conservation status of plant in Nigeria. The search for “ethnobotanical studies in Nigeria” was conducted within the three selected databases to ensure comprehensive coverage and retrieval of relevant literature. We gathered information about ethnobotanical uses, plant identification, preparation methods, and application routes from the eligible studies.

A bibliometrics data analysis spanning from 1st January 1964 to 30th June 2024 was conducted to identify the plant species and their ethnobotanical applications, as well as to establish the trends in research on uses of plant species in Nigeria. The study retrieved 3536 studies from various scientific databases, comprising 1697, 875 and 964 from Dimensions, Web of Science and Scopus, respectively. The titles were examined to eliminate duplicates, and abstracts were systematically evaluated for relevance. Ultimately, 79 articles were eligible with concise focus on ethnobotanical studies (Fig.1).

The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. As outlined by Long, French [33], 10 questions were used to evaluate the methodological quality of qualitative studies. After assessing the content in the articles, the questions were answered as Yes, No, or Uncertain (Supplementary material1).

The review outputs from the current endeavour are presented from two core perspectives entailing the systematic (ethnobotany in Nigeria) and bibliometric (patterns and trends in ethnobotanical research in Nigeria) assessments.

Following the systematic search, the current research status on Nigerian ethnobotany was established. This aspect addressed the critical appraisal of the eligible ethnobotanical field surveys and their associated implications.

A total of 79 eligible literature documenting local knowledge of plants in Nigeria were recorded (Table2). As depicted in Fig.2A–C, there has been extensive ethnobotanical research conducted across the six regions in Nigeria, namely North-Central (NC), Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE), South-South (SS) and Southwest (SW). The eligible studies entailed invaluable traditional knowledge and practices related to the uses of plants in Nigeria. Each entry stands as a significant contribution to the understanding of conventional plant knowledge in Nigeria, particularly in the realms of healthcare, indigenous and cultural practices. We recorded a wide range of documented plant species, with some studies reporting up to 208 plants across 68 plant families (Table2), thereby underscoring the remarkable biodiversity in Nigeria.

The 79 eligible ethnobotanical studies included in this review clearly stated their study objectives, had well-defined qualitative findings deemed significant, and collected data relevant to the research topic (Supplementary material1). Thirty-four studies (43.03%) included ethical considerations in their design, while 70 studies (88.61%) revealed the relationship between the researcher and subjects (participants). Data analysis was rigorous in 48 studies (60.76%), inadequate in 25 studies (31.65%), and inconclusive in six studies (7.60%). Regarding the recruiting strategy, 75 studies (94.93%) applied a suitable approach aligned with their objectives, while four studies (8.33%) had an ambiguous assessment of this issue.

The ethnobotanical studies collected demographic information from participants, offering insights into their age, gender, educational background, occupation, and years of experience(Table2). The study revealed that most participants, aged between 41 and 60 years, an indication of the prevalence of older, experienced participants in these communities. Over 85% of traditional healers in Nigeria identified as male, indicating a male-dominated occupation [11,34]. However, there was a notable presence of women in herb trading [35].

Most participants had either no formal education or only a primary-level education, which underscores the reliance on oral transmission for sharing ethnobotanical knowledge. As a result of this limited formal education, there has been inadequate documentation and a loss indigenous knowledge associated the plants in local communities [36]. The ratio of individuals without formal education compared to those who completed secondary education was 18.7–52.3%, while those with a primary education status were 26% of the participants [34,35,37,38].

The participants consisted mainly of traditional healers (55%), herb vendors (20%), traditional birth attendants (10%), and healthcare professionals (5%) [14,35]. It is crucial to understand the demographic data collected from these studies to gain further insight into the experiences and perspectives of traditional healers and herb vendors in Nigeria.

Selection of study areas:Researchers intentionally selected ethnobotanically diverse regions, focusing on both rural and urban areas (Table2). Abo, Fred-Jaiyesimi [39] surveyed southwestern states of Nigeria including Ogun, Oyo, Osun, and Lagos. On the other hand, Abubakar, Ukwuani-Kwaja [38] focused on identifying plants used for cancer treatment in the rural areas of Kebbi State, northern Nigeria, Adedeji, Kayode [40] selected the Egun indigenous tribal group in Lagos State with interest on their prominent plants and the preparation techniques. Ajibesin, Bala [41] targeted the indigenous people of River State to record how they use medicinal plants to treat different health conditions.

Participants sampling:Various sampling techniques, including random and purposive sampling, were used to gather data from a diverse group of participants (Table2). Some of these include traditional healers, herbalists, community elders, rural residents, and herb vendors, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding of Indigenous practices. For instance, Abdallah, Mustafa [11] surveyed 97 traditional healers in Yobe State to tap into their extensive knowledge. In SW Nigeria, Adebisi and Bello [42] engaged with herbal contraceptive practitioners to explore their specialised expertise.

Data collection tools:Different data collection tools were meticulously chosen to ensure the quality and scope of the information gathered from the studies. The qualitative research methods chosen were thoughtfully aligned with the context and aims of the studies. Structured interviews provided a systematic approach to data collection, ensuring consistency and facilitating effective comparison of responses [43]. Semi-structured interviews provided the needed flexibility to delve deeper into the perspectives of the participants while aligning with the predefined themes [44]. Unstructured interviews were utilised to gather authentic narratives and insights that might not have been foreseen before the interviews [45]. Generally, focus groups offered valuable qualitative insights that enriched the quantitative data, leading to an in-depth viewpoints of the participants [43]. Field observations were explored to collect direct information regarding behaviours and practices within the community and offer important contextual insights into the underlying issues being investigated [43]. This multifaceted approach enhanced the validity of the findings and ensured a well-rounded view of the complexities involved in the ethnobotanical research.

Use of local language: Ethnobotanical surveys were used to collate local uses of plants, identify practices associated with traditional knowledge, and understand the cultural significance of botanical resources [46]. These surveys provided a valuable platform for engaging with the community members, fostering meaningful dialogue, and enabling them to share their insights and experiences. To promote effective communication and build trust within the community, most participants were interviewed in their native languages [35]. Conducting interviews in the native languages of the participants enabled them to express themselves freely, minimized the chances of misunderstandings, and improved the reliability and accuracy of the data collected. This is consistent with the assertion by Cámara-Leret and Bascompte [47] that knowledge about medicinal plant usage is specific to each language, underscoring the intimate link between language and traditional knowledge. Moreover, applying a variety of data collection tools facilitated a thorough and detailed comprehension of the research topic, thereby capturing the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the experiences and perspectives of the participants.

Plant identification:Given the importance of ensuring the verification of plant identities [48], researchers have applied rigorous protocols for plant identification to ensure the scientific accuracy of their investigations. This often entails the collection of voucher specimens and using herbaria for taxonomic confirmation, and cross-referencing with reliable botanical databases, including the Kew Plant of the World (https://powo.science.kew.org/), for the verification of the scientific names. Based on the eligible study, the Forest Herbarium in Ibadan, Bayero University in Kano, and the University of Lagos Herbarium, were frequently mentioned herbaria for the storage of voucher specimens (Table2). Voucher specimens play a crucial role in research by providing a permanent record, enabling verification, and ensuring reproducibility, which is essential for biodiversity assessments, accurate species identification, and effective conservation efforts [49]. This practice validates the findings through cross-referencing with physical specimens and enhances the credibility of the conducted research by ensuring transparency and traceability.

The method applied in ethnobotanical field surveys integrates both qualitative and quantitative techniques to understand the significance, usage trends, and conservation requirements of various plants. This assists researchers in identifying crucial plants that require conservation efforts, conducting cross-cultural and regional comparisons of plant utilisation, and advocating for the integration of ethnobotanical knowledge into conservation and healthcare systems [50]. One of the common presentation entails descriptive statistics such as frequency distributions, percentages, bar charts, and trend analyses, which assist in organising data and identifying patterns in plant uses [51].

Ethnobotanical indices such as Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC), Use Value (UV), and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) have been applied to establish the popularity of plants and degree of agreements among the participants [50,52]. These indices facilitate standardised data collection and enhance the reliability of research findings [52,53]. However, these indices often oversimplify the cultural and pharmacological significance of plants, leading to potentially misleading conclusions [53].

Thematic analysis, content analysis, case studies, and ethnographic methodologies in qualitative data analysis provide in-depth cultural insights into conventional knowledge systems [54]. Thematic analysis classify data, whereas content analysis investigates oral histories and traditional knowledge [55].

Analysing ethnobotanical data has multiple implications, such as aiding in the identification of crucial plant species for conservation, facilitating comparisons of plant usage among different cultures, and uncovering knowledge gaps in underrepresented regions [53]. It promotes policy recommendations that integrate ethnobotanical knowledge into conservation and healthcare frameworks, protects indigenous knowledge, and bridges traditional and modern medicine for comprehensive healthcare approaches [56].

In this review, plants and their ethnobotanical uses were recorded in 32 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Oyo (14.03%), Ogun (13.45%), and Lagos (6.43%) had the highest representation, while Kogi, Yobe, Adamawa, Zamfara, and Benue had the lowest proportion (0.58%) of studies (Fig.2C). These variations in documentation efforts highlight the diverse levels of research and awareness in ethnobotany across the different states. Conducting further studies in underrepresented states is crucial for establishing valuable insights into the uses and sustainable practices associated with local plants. Expanding the investigation to cover less-represented states such as Kogi, Benue, Jigawa, Zamfara, and Yobe is crucial for expanding our understanding of the floras and their traditional uses in these underrepresented regions. This understanding is crucial for developing conservation policies that consider the unique ethnobotanical perspectives of local communities. Importantly, it is vital to achieve a harmonious balance between conservation initiatives and sustainable practices to protect rich biodiversity in Nigeria for the well-being of the current and future generations.

In SW Nigeria, the ethnobotanical studies have mainly focused on malaria, diabetes, cancer, wound healing, and cosmetic applications. Lawal, Rafiu [15] conducted ethnobotanical surveys in five communities (Alimosho, Badagry, Eti-Osa, Epe, and Ikorodu) in Lagos State, recording 183 plant species from 61 families. Furthermore, Oladunmoye and Kehinde [57] surveyed local communities in Ekiti, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo states and generated 208 plant species used for viral infections. Oladeji and Agbelusi [58] identified 78 plants used by the communities around the old Oyo National Park. Furthermore, existing evidence provide valuable information on how medicinal plants are used in the area, which adds to the overall body of ethnobotanical knowledge in SW Nigeria [14,39,42]. Ethnobotanical surveys in SE and SS regions of Nigeria revealed the use of plants for treating malaria, managing fractures, and addressing skin-related ailments. An in-depth study by Iyamah and Idu [59] documented 156 plant species used for malaria treatment in Southern Nigeria, covering SE, SS, and SW regions. This extensive inventory highlights the rich diversity of plants in these areas and their importance in traditional medicine. In Bayelsa Central Senatorial District of Nigeria [60], 39 plants from 30 families were utilised for traditional orthopaedic care.

In NW region, researchers have extensively documented the use of plants for maternal health, arthritis, and paediatric ailments. Kankara, Ibrahim [61] documented 111 plants used for maternal healthcare in Katsina State, highlighting the contributions of traditional midwives and herbalists. Additionally, Abubakar, Yusuf [35] and Etuk, Ugwah [62] conducted studies in Kano and Sokoto states, which revealed that NW region has rich indigenous knowledge on the use of medicinal plants. Research findings from NE region identified plants for managing cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, and malaria. Mahmoud, Labaran [63] recorded 21 plants locally used for managing malaria in Mubi town, Adamawa State. Furthermore, Ngulde, Sandabe [64] conducted a comprehensive study that identified 65 plants recognised for their potential anticancer effects in Askira/Uba local government area of Borno State, thereby highlighting the rich ethnobotanical knowledge prevalent in NE Nigeria.

Nigeria is home to over 371 ethnic groups, broadly classified as majority and minority populations [65]. The Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo collectively constitute 57.8% of the population [66], yet the ethnolinguistic diversity of Nigeria spans six geopolitical zones consisting of NC, NE, NW, SE, SS, and SW (Fig.2A). These regions are shaped by unique cultural histories, ecological zones, and plant uses [67,68].

Northwest region is dominated by Hausa-Fulani communities rooted in Islamic traditions and emirate governance structures [69,70], while NE hosts the Kanuri and other ethnic minorities such as the Tangale and Bura, reflecting a cultural heritage linked to the Kanem-Bornu Empire [70,71]. North-central zone includes a highly diverse population, such as the Tiv, Nupe, Gwari, and Idoma, known for vibrant dance, music, and festivals [70,72,73]. South-South region is associated with the Ijaw, Efik, Urhobo, Itsekiri, and Ibibio, whose traditions feature rich maritime cultures and ceremonial regattas [70,74]. In SW, Yoruba communities inhabit Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, and Ondo states, marked by complex political institutions and a strong intellectual and spiritual heritage [70,73,75]. They are recognised for their distinctive traditions and significant historical contributions [76]. Southeast is predominantly Igbo, noted for entrepreneurial traditions, decentralised governance, and strong ritual and ceremonial plant use [73]. They are known for their inventive attitude, traditional governance, and substantial commerce activity [66,76]. These cultural distinctions are often interwoven with regional patterns of plant usage and ecological variation.

Ecologically, Nigeria spans a north–south gradient from humid tropical forests to arid savannahs (Fig.2B), influencing the floristic composition and cultural knowledge systems. The ethnobotanical inventory analysed across the six regions reveals 963 distinct plants, with the SW region exhibiting the highest diversity (70.98% of plants), followed by SS (32.19%), NC (29.18%), NW (28.45%), SE (20.77%), and NE (10.28%) (Supplementary material2). The Southern zones (SW, SE, SS) form a coherent forest ethnobotanical bloc (Fig.3A), characterised by frequent use of taxa, such asAlstonia boonei,Newbouldia laevis, andGarcinia kola. The intersection between SW and SS regions is robust, suggesting a historical interconnectedness and cultural exchange between these areas. In contrast, the northern zones (NE, NW) depend heavily on drought-resistant plants such asAdansonia digitataandBalanites aegyptiaca[77]. The utilisation of plants within these regions is significantly influenced by the specific cultural beliefs, traditions, and practices of the local communities. The overlap observed between NE and NW regions indicates a strong exchange of ethnobotanical knowledge within the savannah zone, further illustrating the dynamics of knowledge sharing in these environments [78]. North-Central region displays a mixed composition, highlighting its role as an ecological and cultural transition zone.

Each region retains unique plants as highlighted for SW (308 plants, 45.2%), NW (86 plants, 31.5%), SS (64 plants, 20.8%), SE (36 plants, 18.1%), NC (39 plants, 13.9%), and NE (13 plants, 13.3%). The prominence of ferns in SE, notablyAdiantumspp., suggests a ritual and therapeutic tradition within Igbo culture [79]. Conversely, the unique taxa in NW and NE reflect adaptation to arid ecosystems and transmission of Islamic phytomedical knowledge. The significance of cultural selection processes operating within established ecological boundaries is underscored by such specific regional usage patterns [80].

Despite this diversity, 19 plants (~ 8.3%) were recorded across all six regions, includingAbelmoschus esculentus,Carica papaya,Azadirachta indica, andVernonia amygdalina(Supplementary material2). These form a shared ethnobotanical core, likely sustained by interregional trade, colonial agricultural dissemination, and post-independence integration [18,79]. The Jaccard similarity heatmap and hierarchical clustering analyses underscore ecological and cultural clustering (Fig.3C). The SE–SS pairing exhibits the highest similarity (0.42), followed by SW–SS (0.31), reflecting shared rainforest ecology and cultural overlap. NE and NW form a savannah-based cluster with modest internal similarity but minimal overlap with southern zones. The NC demonstrates intermediate similarity with all regions (SW = 0.28; NW = 0.29), confirming its bridging role. The dendrogram clustering reinforces these findings (Fig.3D), delineating two main ethnobotanical zones: a southern forest belt (SW, SE, SS) and a northern savannah zone (NW, NE), with NC positioned as a transitional cluster.

Garcinia kola(bitter kola): is important in the rituals, ceremonies, and spiritual cleansing practices of the Yoruba and Igbo cultures, similar to kola nuts [95]. It is used for respiratory conditions [95,96], immune support [97], and as an aphrodisiac [98], and it functions as an essential commodity in local and international markets [99].

Carica papaya(paw paw):is a vital fruit in many Nigerian households which may be linked to its rich pool of vitamins and antioxidants that boosts immune function [100]. In traditional medicine, its latex is applied for spiritual cleansing rituals and to treat malaria, digestive disorders, and infections [17,101,102].

Combretum altum:also known as ‘geza’ in Hausa and ‘ogan-ibule’ in Yoruba. It is used in northern Nigeria to treat diarrhoea and abdominal pain in nursing women [91], diabetes [103], and mental disorders [104]. People in SW useCombretum altumto treat rheumatism and cough [82,105].

Ocimum gratissimumandVernonia amygdalina:both plants play significant roles in diets and medicines, indicating a convergence of culinary and medicinal ethnobotany in certain regions [106–108].Vernonia amygdalinaholds great cultural importance in SW and SE Nigeria [109] where it is used in purification rituals and traditional ceremonies for healing and cleansing purposes [82,110]. It is also known for its antidiabetic, antimalarial, and immune-boosting properties [85,111]. In SE region, the Igbo people useOcimum gratissimumat traditional weddings to bless the couple [112]. The southwestern area recognisesOcimum gratissimumfor its antidiabetic properties [39], while the northern region uses it to treat gastrointestinal disorders [10].

Although there was instance with similarities in uses of plants among different cultures, there are distinctions in their applications and associated rituals. Particularly, Yoruba and Igbo cultures place emphasis on spiritual elements rather than solely on physical element of medicinal uses. The aspect of spirituality/religious affiliation is important as it influences the uses of plants Among surveyed communities, 65% of participants practising traditional African religions often integrate plants into spiritual rituals. There were also instances where Christian and Islamic practitioners emphasise medicinal uses and religious healing, e.g., Quranic inscriptions withNewbouldia laevisin the northern part of Nigeria [113].

The 79 eligible studies generated an inventory of 963 plant species across 144 families utilised in Nigeria for diverse ethnobotanical applications (Appendix 1). From this comprehensive inventory, we extracted the top-cited 103 plants referenced 11 times and above, detailing their associated plant part(s) used, their applications, and preparation methods across multiple states in Nigeria(Table3). The database highlights noteworthy biodiversity and vast indigenous knowledge in Nigeria. This review categorised ethnobotanical applications of plants into seven categories, namely medicinal (for humans, crops and livestock), cosmetics, spiritual, biopesticides, poison, timber, and fuelwood. Based on the eligible studies, the emphasis has been on prevalent diseases such as malaria, cancer, diabetes, gastrointestinal issues, and mental health in ethnobotanical surveys, which is crucial for addressing health concerns affecting a significant portion of the population. Some studies have explored the cultural significance and applications of plants in cosmetics which highlights the intersection of traditional knowledge and modern cosmetic practices. Additionally, the potential of locally sourced plants as biopesticides in agriculture has been explored in Plateau State [114]. Some of the recorded plants were used to manage livestock health [115], an indication of the versatility of locally sourced plants for improving human and agricultural (crop and animal) health. Overall, medicinal applications emerge as the most prominent category due to their widespread utilisation in addressing various health concerns.

Based on the generated plant inventory, some of the notable ones wereAbrus precatoriusL.,Vachellia nilotica(L.) P.J.H. Hurter & Mabb. Syn.,Acacia nilotica(L.) Willd. ex Delile,Adansonia digitataL., andAframomum meleguetaK. Schum.Balanites aegyptiaca(L.) Delile, Carica papayaL., Vernonia amygdalinaDelile, Boswellia dalzieliiHutch., andBambusa vulgarisSchrad., offering unique contributions to traditional medicine in Nigeria. These noteworthy plants address a range of conditions, including respiratory issues (cough, asthma), metabolic disorders (diabetes), skin ailments, inflammatory conditions (arthritis, rheumatism), infectious diseases (malaria), and cardiovascular concerns (hypertension).

The medicinal applications underscore the critical role of traditional knowledge in addressing health challenges in communities and its capacity to inform innovative treatment strategies. The 20 most utilised plants in Nigeria, identified by their high frequency of use (25 or more mentions) comprised ofCarica papayaL.,Vernonia amygdalinaDelile,Mangifera indicaL., andAframomum meleguetaK. Schum.Azadirachta indicaA. Juss.,Jatropha curcasL., andGarcinia kolaHeckel,Psidium guajavaL.,Allium sativumL.,Cymbopogon citratus(DC.) Stapf,Citrus×aurantiifolia(Christm.) Swingle,Elaeis guineensisJacq.,Nauclea latifoliaSm.,Zingiber officinaleRoscoe,Vitellaria paradoxaC.F Gaertn,Morinda lucidaBenth.,Xylopia aethiopica(Dunal) A.Rich.,Momordica charantiaL.,Ocimum gratissimumL., andSpondias mombinL. are commonly utilised in traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory infections, malaria, and a range of other health issues. These plants play vital roles in African traditional medicine [116–118]. They address gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory tract infections, malaria, venereal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, wounds, and viral diseases.

In terms of the families for the 963 collated plant species, Fabaceae was the most dominant comprising 127 plants, followed by Malvaceae (52 plants) and Asteraceae (43 plants). Euphorbiaceae had 38 plants, while Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae comprised 36 plants each. About 33% (47 families) of 144 recorded families were represented by 1 plant each (Appendix 1). Fabaceae had twice the number of plant species compared to the Malvaceae, which was the next dominant family with a notable plant count. Generally, plants belonging to the Fabaceae are esteemed for their versatile applications in medicine, nutrition, and livestock health care, underscoring their importance from an ethnobotanical perspective [119].

From a cross regionally analysis, Fabaceae was the most represented family across all the six regions, with SW reporting the highest plant count (Fig.4A). The ecological adaptability of Fabaceae and ethnobotanical versatility, including its use in traditional medicine, reaffirm its central role in African ethnobotany [119–121]. Recent hypotheses by Mongalo and Raletsena [121] offer evidence supporting the prominence of Fabaceae as a plant family recognised for its medicinal properties. African traditional medicine values plants in the Fabaceae due to their accessibility, prevalence, and remarkable adaptability to diverse environments [120]. Southwest region exhibited a preeminent presence of plants across numerous families, particularly within Malvaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae, and Lamiaceae. This prevalence may be attributed to several factors, including the diverse rainforest ecology of the region, which fosters a richer assemblage of plant species and inevitably usages among local communities [122]. The observed trend highlighted the ecological richness characteristic of forested zones and signifies heightened ethnobotanical engagement and activity in these areas [123].

Northwest and NE regions, which are characterised as savanna zones, exhibited a moderate representation of Fabaceae and Combretaceae (Fig.4A). Both families are well-adapted to arid environments, which accounts for their prominent presence in these areas. Fabaceae is known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, enhancing soil fertility and providing crucial resources for various herbivores. In contrast, Combretaceae is typically associated with woody vegetation that can withstand dry conditions. The savanna regions show a comparatively low species richness in families (e.g., Annonaceae and Moraceae) related to rainforest ecosystems. The scarcity of these families highlights the stark differences in biodiversity and ecological dynamics between the savanna and rainforest habitats.

In NC which can be regarded as a transitional profile emerges, there were a mix of plant species that straddles the characteristics of arid savannas and rainforest environments [124]. This region contributes intermediate values across most families, indicating a gradual shift in vegetation and potentially offering a unique blend of plants from both ecosystems. The transitional nature of NC enriches its biodiversity and serves as an important ecological corridor, facilitating plant species movement and genetic exchange between the contrasting zones of NW and NE.

Malvaceae is renowned for its diverse array of mucilaginous and medicinal plants, including genera such asAbelmoschusandAdansonia. This family exhibits a particularly prominent distribution in the SW and NW regions, where it has been integral to local ethnobotanical practices and traditional medicine. The mucilage properties of these plants are often harnessed for their therapeutic benefits, which underscores their significance in both cultural and contemporary pharmacology [79,125]. In contrast, Asteraceae holds considerable global importance due to the presence of various species recognised for their medicinal properties [126]. Key genera such asVernoniaandAspiliaare particularly noteworthy, displaying a strong presence in SW and SS regions (Fig.4A). This distribution aligns with areas historically associated with rich traditions of herbal medicine, where these plants are utilised extensively in local healthcare practices [126]. The prominence of these families in specific geographic regions revealed the intricate relationships between biodiversity, cultural practices, and the utilisation of natural resources for medicinal purposes.

Northeastern regions exhibit the lowest plant counts across the various botanical families (Fig.4A). This observation may indicate several factors, including a climate characterised by aridity that may restrict overall biodiversity or possibly reflect a lack of comprehensive documentation pertaining to ethnobotanical knowledge within this area [78]. It is crucial to consider that the underrepresentation of plants could also stem from socio-cultural dynamics that influence the recording of traditional ecological knowledge.

Nonetheless, the observed utilisation of drought-resistant plants, particularly those belonging to the Combretaceae and Fabaceae families is noteworthy. This practice aligns with the ecological constraints imposed by the climatic conditions of the region and highlights an adaptive strategy among local populations [127]. The selective use of these resilient species underscores a deeper understanding of sustainable practices in the face of environmental challenges, illustrating the relationship between ecological adaptation and traditional knowledge systems. Further research is warranted to investigate the extent of ethnobotanical diversity and its implications for conservation strategies in these drier climates.

This review identified 78 distinct health conditions, categorised into several groups: infectious diseases (35.93%), oral/gastrointestinal ailments (16.03%), respiratory tract issues (13.15%), cancers and neoplasms (11.08%), reproductive and childbirth-related conditions (6.7%) (Fig.4B). These classifications are based on the Health Research Classification System (HRCS). Environmental and socio-economic factors, such as the tropical climate, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and industrial activities, significantly contribute to the high prevalence of these ailments in various tropical regions [37,128,129]. The utilisation of plants such asAbrus precatoriusL.,Ageratum conyzoidesL.,Aloe vera(L) Burm.f.,Anacardium occidentaleL., andAnnona muricataL. in managing various ailments, including infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis, and chronic conditions including diabetes and hypertension, highlight their therapeutic potential. Plants such asAlstonia booneiDe Wild.,Azadirachta indicaA. Juss.,Carica papayaL.,Citrus×aurantiumL.,Mangifera indicaL. are used to treat various ailments including malaria, tuberculosis, viral infections, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, burns, wounds, eczema, female infertility, postpartum issues, wound healing, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and depression have all documented [111,130–133].

The most common preparation method for medicinal plant applications was decoction (Fig.4C). This method effectively extracts beneficial properties from resilient plant materials, including roots and bark [134]. Following decoction, infusion, powdering, and maceration were also popular methods. The widespread use of these methods aims to maximise the extraction of bioactive compounds specific to various plant parts and their applications [134,135]. The straightforward nature of decoction and infusion methods likely account for their prevalent applications in local communities. Decoction involves the heating or boiling of plant material in water, while infusion consists of immersing the plant material in cold or pre-warmed water [136]. Highlighting the importance of oral administration, it signifies a crucial role in addressing internal health conditions through herbal remedies. Topical applications play a crucial role in treating a range of external conditions such as wounds, skin diseases, and burns, showcasing the diverse applications of herbal therapies. This highlights the adaptability of herbal therapies, showing their effectiveness in treating both internal and external health concerns.

Furthermore, the preparation methods for the plants varied across regions. Decoction was most common in SW and SS for internal ailments, including malaria and diabetes, while poultices and infusions were prevalent in northern Nigeria and SE for skin and respiratory ailments, respectively. For instance, in SW Nigeria,Corchorus olitorius(Ewedu) is used for diabetes in a decoction form [46] while in SS, the root is infused for cancer treatment [103]. Similarly, people in the SS region of Nigeria useLaportea aestuansas a paste for skin diseases [48], while it is used to prevent bedwetting in the SW [115]. Some plants serve different functions depending on the region. In SW, people useAloe veraas a topical infusion to treat acne and burns [19], and they also consume it as a juice to treat diabetes [134].

Traditional medicine serves as the primary healthcare for many communities in Nigeria [137]. Documentation of information helps to protect cultural heritage and helps to make healthcare more accessible to people in rural and underserved areas [138]. In Nigeria, ethnobotanical surveys have systematically documented the use of medicinal plants in addressing primary healthcare needs [139]. These ethnobotanical surveys remain a pivotal mechanism for preserving traditional knowledge, which is indispensable for the sustainable use of natural resources in contemporary medicinal practices [46].

These findings from the 79 eligible studies underscored the vital role that Indigenous knowledge plays in informing and enhancing healthcare strategies and thereby facilitating a more integrative approach to healthcare that recognises the value of both traditional remedies and modern medical interventions [140]. The integration of ethnobotanical knowledge into mainstream healthcare could potentially lead to holistic treatment strategies that are tailored to the specific needs and contexts of diverse communities across Nigeria [141].

A study conducted in Lagos State recorded 183 plants used to manage various health conditions [15], highlighting the significant dependence on traditional medicine in the selected areas. These studies serve as essential repositories of cultural heritage, documenting and safeguarding the knowledge of local healers and practitioners amid globalisation and modernisation. Ethnobotanical research has led to the identification of numerous plants with therapeutic potential. A study conducted in Ilorin (NC Nigeria) revealed 47 plants from 28 families used to treat female sexual dysfunction and infertility [84]. The study highlighted a vast biodiversity of the region and how local communities use it to meet their healthcare needs. These plants includedVitellaria paradoxa,Anogeissus leiocarpa, andPeperomia pellucida, which were used to treat female sexual dysfunction and infertility [84].

The medicinal plants recorded from the 79 eligible studies are essential for primary healthcare, offering accessible and cost-effective treatment options for local communities. In Lagos State, researchers created a comprehensive checklist of medicinal plants used in primary healthcare, drawing on ethnobotanical surveys conducted in herbal markets [142]. This detailed catalogue illustrated the dependence of the communities on these natural resources for self-medication and treatment, especially in areas where formal healthcare services might be scarce [139]. In Delta State, the incorporation of valuable medicinal plants into local healthcare practices demonstrates how traditional medicine enhances the existing Western health systems [143].

The insights obtained from ethnobotanical studies provide an essential basis for pharmacological research and exploring the development of new drugs. A notable example isVernonia amygdalina, commonly known as a bitter leaf in Nigerian traditional medicine and recognised for its diverse medicinal properties, including antimalarial and antidiabetic effects [101,111]. This plant has attracted the attention of researchers who are investigating its active compounds for possible therapeutic uses [144]. Furthermore, well-known Nigerian pharmacologists have researched traditional medical practices and how they might be used in modern medicine [145]. This work paves the way for the development of new drugs that are driven by traditional knowledge. Ethnobotanical studies are essential to establish the value of local floras and generally promote the importance of biodiversity conservation. Studies in locations such as the Old Oyo National Park have documented a range of medicinal plants [58] endemic to these ecosystems, highlighting their importance for health and maintaining ecological equilibrium. These studies highlight the importance of conservation, motivating local communities and policymakers to focus on protecting their plants.

The findings from the 79 eligible studies underscored a range of conventional diagnostic methods used by traditional healers and herbalists (Tables2and3), which reflect a unique interplay between cultural practices and healthcare.

Diagnosis based on observational signs: traditional healers apply a symptomatology approach that highlights sharp observational skills to recognise illnesses such as diabetes and malaria. For example, diabetes is frequently identified by noticeable symptoms including polyuria (frequent urination) and unexplained weight loss, which are acknowledged markers within the community [39,111]. Practitioners and patients recognise a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, and fatigue, as indicators of malaria [59,146].

Integration of spiritual and herbal elements: The combination of spiritual and herbal elements in healing practices embodies a comprehensive approach that recognises the interrelationship between physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being [147]. Traditional healers hold the view that health problems stem from physical factors, spiritual influences, cultural beliefs, and individual experiences [148]. Numerous practitioners use divination methods to reveal the root causes of health issues [147]. The combination of these insights with herbal treatments grounded in traditional knowledge effectively tackles both the symptoms and underlying causes of ailments, which are frequently associated with emotional or spiritual distress [149]. This synthesis embodies a comprehensive perspective on health that goes beyond the common Western medicine, advocating for a worldview that appreciates spirituality and the natural world [148]. Integrative practices can improve well-being and empower individuals by promoting balance and harmony.

Symptom-focused treatment approaches: Community often adopts a model of healthcare that is predominantly symptom-focused, addressing various ailments, ranging from diarrhoeal diseases to dermatological infections, through a reliance on observable symptoms coupled with collective folklore and understanding of these health conditions [10,150]. This practice underscores the experiential knowledge of the community, which is often rooted in shared cultural narratives.

Take together, it is imperative to advocate for the integration of traditional diagnostic methodologies into contemporary community health programs. Such integration acknowledges the value of indigenous knowledge systems and fosters a more inclusive approach to health care. Furthermore, rigorous research is essential to substantiate the effectiveness and reliability of these conventional diagnostic techniques, thereby enhancing their credibility and acceptance within the broader healthcare system.

Ethnobotanical research in Nigeria has experienced notable transformations in the last 60 years (1964–2024), influenced by an increasing acknowledgement of the importance of indigenous knowledge, medicinal plants, and biodiversity conservation. This analysis examined the key trends, thematic focuses, collaborative dynamics, and research outputs during this period (Fig.5). The bibliometric analysis from 1 st January 1964 to 30th June 2024 revealed the patterns and expansion of ethnobotanical research in Nigeria.

From 1964 to 1989, ethnobotanical research in Nigeria was predominantly investigative, concentrating on the documentation of indigenous knowledge regarding medicinal plants [142]. Researchers initiated the aggregation of data concerning medicinal flora, underscoring the significance of indigenous wisdom in healthcare [151]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, ethnobotany experienced a surge in scholarly engagement, with an increasing number of researchers, including botanists and anthropologists, collaborating to document plant species, their applications, and cultural significance [152,153]. This period witnessed the establishment of Botanical gardens and research institutions in Nigeria, serving as central hubs for ethnobotanical research [154]. Some challenges impede the growth of ethnobotanical research during this era, including insufficient funding, restricted pharmacological research, and surveys highlighting local flora and their roles in traditional healthcare.

The 1990s experienced a notable rise in ethnobotanical studies, driven by thematic expansion, advancements in phytochemistry, investigations into antimicrobial activity, and the exploration of plant-based treatments for diseases, such as malaria and diabetes. In this phase, researchers were primarily concentrating on the preservation of ethnobotanical knowledge through documentation, collaborating with environmental organisations, and using technological tools to investigate plant genetics and biodiversity.

The past decade witnessed the most dynamic changes in Nigerian ethnobotanical research, characterised by interdisciplinary approaches and advanced methodologies. The research ranges from molecular studies that use genomics and proteomics to identify plant metabolites, antioxidant research that concentrates on oxidative stress-related diseases, and toxicology studies that examine the safety profiles of ethnobotanical formulations. The key themes were the focus on preserving indigenous medicine, addressing climate change, and rigorously testing ethnomedicinal claims to ensure their preservation and validity.

Institutions such as the University of Ibadan, Ahmadu Bello University, and others in Nigeria have emerged as main research centres (Fig.5A), establishing facilities focused on biodiversity and pharmacognosy. The chart depict how the Nigerian institutions involved in ethnobotanical research collaborate. The nodes show the amount of research being done, and the edges show the connections between the institutions. The closer the institutions are, the stronger the connections. The University of Ibadan holds the largest and most central node in Nigeria’s network, signifying its leading role in ethnobotanical research in Nigeria. It collaborates extensively with other institutions, demonstrating its influence in the field. Ahmadu Bello University and the University of Lagos also occupy central positions, making major contributions to ethnobotany and related disciplines.

The chart identifies distinct groups of institutions. For example, the University of Ibadan works with the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria [155], and the University of Ilorin focuses on studying biodiversity, traditional medicine, and phytochemicals. Within the University of Nigeria cluster, institutions such as the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture and the Federal University of Technology (Owerri) collaborate specifically on agricultural ethnobotany. The Ahmadu Bello University Cluster includes institutions such as the National Research Institute for Chemical Technology, indicating a focus on applied sciences and ethnopharmacology. Prominent institutions, such as the University of Ibadan and the University of Nigeria, which are characterised by large nodes and numerous connections, play a pivotal role in spearheading multi-institutional projects and fostering knowledge exchange. Conversely, smaller institutions, with fewer connections, specialise in niche ethnobotany. Strong partnerships between well-known institutions show strong support from funding bodies or national research priorities, while weaker partnerships between institutions in the periphery show fewer connections.

The University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University dominate publications, fostering networks with other universities. Figure5B depicts the publication patterns and trends of ethnobotanical journals over the past six decades. The graph illustrates the frequency of ethnobotanical research publications in five prominent journals from 1990 to 2024. These are the African Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, the African Journal of Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Medicines, the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, the Journal of Medicinal Plant Research, and the Tropical Journal of Pharmaceutical Research. The Journal of Medicinal Plants Research has undergone considerable expansion from 2007 to 2015. The Journal of Ethnopharmacology has consistently grown, but after 2010, the Journal of Medicinal Plants Research overtook it. The Tropical Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and the African Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology exhibit moderate growth. Before 2000, ethnobotanical research in Nigeria was scanty in the journals. Between 2000 and 2010, there was a significant rise in publication frequency, driven by global interest in traditional medicine, biodiversity, and the quest for bioactive chemicals [156].

From 2010 to 2024, pharmacology and medicinal plants made a lot of progress. This shows that more and more researchers are interested in ethnobotany and how it affects pharmacology. The popularity of Journal of Medicinal Plants Research shows how much it values plant-based research, while the consistent contributions of the Journal of Ethnopharmacology signify its dedication to the pharmacological substantiation of traditional wisdom. The slow growth of other journals likely suggests the compartmentalisation of research themes. The growing importance of African-based journals in studying biodiversity in Nigeria underscores the importance of local initiatives in documenting and analysing the ecosystems of the country. International journals such as the Journal of Ethnopharmacology underscore the global significance of ethnobotanical research. Future initiatives include expanding journals focused on African biodiversity and conservation, integrating ethnobotany with biotechnology, genetics, and pharmacology, and influencing policy formulations for the conservation and sustainable utilisation of plant resources.

The thematic evolution chart shows the progression of research themes for Nigerian plants from 1990–2014 to 2015–2024(Fig.5C). The chart illustrates the relationship between older and newer research words. This Sankey-style visualisation elucidates the evolution of research objectives and the emergence of themes over time. The persistent emphasis on"medicinal plants"and"phytochemicals"indicates their importance in the study of Nigerian plants. These themes connect the earlier (1990–2014) and later (2015–2024) periods, demonstrating their fundamental importance in ethnobotany and phytochemistry research. Interest in"antimicrobial activity"has persisted for decades, showing a continued emphasis on developing plant-based remedies to prevent microbial illnesses.

Between 1990 and 2014, research focused on indigenous knowledge, ethnomedicine, and toxicity, specifically addressing health issues, such as diarrhoea and anaemia. Research on malaria and antiplasmodial activity was prominent, highlighting the continued importance of traditional remedies in addressing public health challenges. Between 2015 and 2024, there was a huge increase in research on oxidative stress, epilepsy, phytoconstituents, and diabetes mellitus. Phytochemistry and phytochemical analysis study the molecular and chemical makeup of plants. The ongoing investigation into antibacterial and antimalarial activities suggests a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic applications.

Similarly, the evolution of plant research in Nigeria, from traditional knowledge to more specialised molecular and applied research methodologies (Fig.5C). This development underscores the implementation of contemporary scientific approaches and the variety of themes involved. Nonetheless, the lack of conservation-related terminology highlights a deficiency in tackling the sustainability of plant resources. The investigation underscores the significance of research on Nigerian flora in tackling health challenges that are pertinent both locally and globally. The thematic evolution chart underscores the necessity to broaden investigations into conservation themes, enhance partnerships between local communities and scholars, and prioritise emerging health issues, including chronic diseases, all while continuing to address infectious diseases.

Evidence from this review illustrated a rising interest in ethnobotany and medicinal plants in Nigeria, especially after 2010 (Fig.5D). The subjects of “ethnopharmacology” and “indigenous knowledge” correspond with the synthesis of traditional applications and scientific inquiry. Terms such as “phytochemical screening” and “flavonoids,” which refer to research into bioactive compounds, show that phytochemical studies have gained popularity. Health applications encompass antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial properties for therapeutic purposes. The growing interest in anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity indicates potential neurological benefits. Conservation and biodiversity are under examination, with the term “biodiversity” reaching a plateau, indicating a stable level of species diversity that may have implications for conservation efforts. Advancing conservation in conjunction with therapeutic discoveries is essential for the sustainable preservation and use of plant resources in Nigeria. For example, the conservation of specific medicinal plant species alongside the development of effective therapies can ensure long-term availability and benefit for future generations.

The word cloud visualisation presents a graphical depiction of keywords and themes associated with Nigerian plant research (Fig.6). The size of each term correlates with its frequency or prominence in the studied literature or data. The predominant keyword in the word cloud signifies a substantial emphasis on medicinal plants within Nigerian studies. This underscores their cultural, traditional, and commercial significance as a source of natural cures and pharmaceutical precursors. Terminology such as “phytochemicals,” “phytochemistry,” and “phytochemical screening” underscores the examination of chemical substances in flora. According to this, the study of bioactive chemicals that have medical effects includes flavonoids, which are antioxidants, alkaloids, which relieve pain, and terpenoids, which reduce inflammation. The terms “toxicity” and “cytotoxicity” underscore the emphasis on evaluating safety profiles and potential therapeutic dosages for plant extracts.

The significance of “ethnopharmacology” illustrates the incorporation of traditional remedies within the realm of pharmacological inquiry. The use of words such as “antimicrobial,” “antioxidant,” “anti-inflammatory,” “antimalarial,” and “cytotoxicity” shows that people are trying to find treatments for infections, cancer, oxidative stress, malaria, and inflammation that come from plants. The word cloud illustrates the extensive range of applications for Nigerian flora, encompassing the treatment of infectious diseases (e.g., “antimicrobial activity”) as well as the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cancer.

The overall value of this review with respective to its impact on Nigerian ethnobotany cannot be overemphasised but some limitations were unavoidable. These constraints may have affected the comprehensiveness, applicability, and generalisability of the findings to certain extend. We highlight the limitations below.

The review covered the period 1964 to 2024, and the restricted time frame means the exclusion of literature outside this period. The use of plants was long existing prior to 1964 and the implications of this time limit was not addressed in this review.

We focused on articles published in English and excluded materials in Nigerian local languages of multi-lingual nature of the country. Particularly, it could have been practically impossible and financially strenuous to hire several translators required to ensure the reliability of such information. This implies that existing data written in local languages were omitted in our generated inventory of plants, thereby affecting the completeness of Nigerian ethnobotany as recorded in this review.

The number and choice of the databases used for this systematic review may have conferred some restriction on the total number of eligible articles that were generated. Searching databases can be laborious and time-consuming, which influence the restricted number of selected databases for sourcing the eligible articles.

This review was primarily confined to an ethnobotanical perspective, with minimal integration of insights from related disciplines, such as ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and conservation biology. This lack of interdisciplinary engagement may affect the overall elucidation on the implications of Nigerian ethnobotany.

While we acknowledge these limitations, the findings from this review remain a vital reference materials for Nigerian ethnobotany as the integrity, reliability and validity of data reported cannot be disputed.

This review meticulously examined the ethnobotanical applications of various plant species in Nigeria, emphasising the intricate connections between Indigenous communities and their ecosystems. We revealed the dynamic evolution of ethnobotanical research and Indigenous knowledge related to plant use in Nigeria, which has been driven by rich biodiversity. Application of systematic approach yielded 79 eligible studies spanning six decades, which generated 963 plant species across 144 families with diverse ethnobotanical applications. Medicinal applications emerged as the predominant category, highlighting the continued relevance of plant-based remedies in addressing public health challenges in Nigeria. The findings illustrated the extensive connections between traditional knowledge, ecological diversity, and healthcare practices across the six geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Notable plants such asCarica papaya,Vernonia amygdalina,Cola acuminata, andGarcinia kolaexemplified the cultural, medicinal, and economic significance of botanicals among the various ethnic groups. Fabaceae was the most represented and distributed plant family across the six regions in Nigeria. Decoction, infusion, and maceration were the most common preparation methods, emphasising the practicality and accessibility of plants for traditional healing practices.

Despite the increasing body of ethnobotanical research, significant challenges persist, including inadequate documentation of indigenous knowledge, limited interdisciplinary collaboration, and the underrepresentation of specific geographic regions. Additionally, variations in data collection methodologies remain a major hindrance to the standardisation and generalisation of the existing findings. Moving forward, bridging the gap between traditional and modern medicine through policy integration, collaborative research, and conservation initiatives is crucial. Particularly, strengthening interdisciplinary partnerships among ethnobotanists, medical practitioners, and policymakers will enhance the generation of scientific evidence on the efficacy and sustainable utilisation of medicinal plants. Furthermore, expanding research coverage to underrepresented regions will ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the ethnobotanical landscape in Nigeria. By addressing these research gaps, the potential for integrating traditional medicine into the primary healthcare system in Nigeria can be maximised, preserving invaluable Indigenous knowledge for future generations while promoting public healthcare and biodiversity conservation.
