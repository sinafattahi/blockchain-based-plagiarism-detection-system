Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) is a reversible lesion in the early clinical stage, but often induces a high mortality rate in the late stage, and its specific mechanism is unknown. Thus, in-depth exploration of the biological progression mechanism of SIC plays a crucial role.

Through co-immunoprecipitation and molecular biological experiments, the functional interaction relationship between DDIT4 and TXNIP was clarified, and the effect of DDIT4/TXNIP on the progression of SIC was investigated both in vitro/vivo. Additionally, the mechanism of SIC cell death mediated by DDIT4/TXNIP was determined through PCR chip technology, Western blot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and in-vivo SIC model experiments. Finally, leveraging the upstream transcription factor ATF4 as a target for the DDIT4/TXNIP pathway, a novel application and translational study of its small-molecule inhibitor ISRIB in SIC was developed.

Firstly, in-vitro/vivo experiments demonstrated that DDIT4 exacerbates inflammatory infiltration and cardiac dysfunction in SIC via the TXNIP pathway. Mechanistically, the DDIT4/TXNIP axis promotes SIC progression through ferroptosis mechanisms. Furthermore, our study identified ATF4, an upstream transcription factor of DDIT4/TXNIP, as a key regulatory switch for this biological mechanism. Finally, this study confirmed that ISRIB, a small-molecule inhibitor of ATF4, significantly suppresses inflammation and ferroptosis mediated by DDIT4/TXNIP, thereby markedly improving cardiac function and prognosis in SIC mice.

This study revealed that the DDIT4/TXNIP-mediated ferroptosis mechanism exacerbates the inflammatory release and cardiac function decline in SIC. It also clarified that this biological effect is regulated by ATF4. Moreover, it was proposed that the inhibitor ISRIB, which targets ATF4, can significantly attenuate ferroptosis in SIC, while concurrently protecting cardiac function. This finding provides a brand-new therapeutic target and intervention agent for the clinical treatment of SIC.

Sepsis [1] is defined by systemic inflammation and progressive organ dysfunction caused by severe infection. It has a high incidence and mortality rate [2] and is a leading cause of death in intensive care units [3,4]. While immune suppression predominates in later stages, early sepsis mortality is also significantly driven by the “cytokine storm” and septic shock due to cardiac dysfunction [5,6]. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), a reversible biventricular dysfunction affecting both systole and diastole, arises from myocardial inhibitory molecules released during septic distributive shock [7]. Its pathogenesis involves cardiac preload insufficiency, cardiopulmonary interactions during ventilation, and right ventricle-pulmonary artery coupling during vasopressor use. A retrospective cohort study found SIC in approximately 13.8% of sepsis patients, serving as an important prognostic indicator [8]. Mortality with concurrent SIC is 70–90%, compared to 20% without. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying SIC and identifying potential targeted therapies are crucial for improving sepsis prognosis and survival.

To identify potential molecular therapeutic targets for SIC, we established a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model [9]. Transcriptomic sequencing of cardiac tissues revealed significant enrichment of genes associated with hypoxia response and oxidative stress pathways in the SIC group, consistent with prior reports linking these pathways to sepsis-induced tissue injury. Analysis of clustering heatmaps, literature review, and protein interaction network predictions progressively focused attention on DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) and Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), identifying them as highly probable mediators of key SIC pathways. DDIT4 (also known as RTP801, REDD1, Dig2), a member of the DDIT family, critically regulates oxidative stress, DNA damage repair, apoptosis, and autophagy [10], and is involved in metabolism and immunity. Recent studies show DDIT4 upregulation following LPS administration [11], implicating it in the LPS-induced inflammatory response. Literature suggests TXNIP facilitates DDIT4-mediated inhibition of mTORC1, thereby impeding osteosarcoma progression through interaction with DDIT4 [12]. While DDIT4-TXNIP interactions have been preliminarily identified in tumorigenesis, their association in inflammatory diseases like sepsis remains unexplored.

Interestingly, after initial biomolecular experiments on DDIT4 and TXNIP, further analysis using PCR arrays implicated ferroptosis as the mechanism mediating their effects on SIC. Ferroptosis [13], an iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent form of regulated cell death first described in 2012 [14–16], involves iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation leading to membrane damage. During ferroptosis, Fe2+drives the Fenton reaction on membranes, generating ROS. Glutathione (GSH) depletion contributes to ROS accumulation by causing NADPH-mediated lipid peroxidation and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inactivation [17,18]. Key mitochondrial changes in ferroptosis-reduced volume, increased membrane density, and diminished or absent cristae-were observed in SIC mouse myocardial tissue [19,20]. While LPS induces apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and necrosis [21–23], inhibiting these pathways only partially mitigates LPS-induced cardiomyocyte damage, suggesting additional death mechanisms contribute to septic cardiac injury. Supporting this, resveratrol alleviates SIC by inhibiting ferroptosis via upregulation of the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway [24]. These findings highlight ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for improving SIC prognosis.

To promote clinical translation of the novel DDIT4/TXNIP-ferroptosis pathway in SIC, this study further investigated the role of upstream transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and evaluated the efficacy of its inhibitor ISRIB in mitigating SIC. ATF4, ubiquitously expressed, plays crucial roles in protein synthesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and inflammation [25]. It enhances inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and IL-6, and its suppression attenuates intestinal inflammation [26]. In murine sepsis models, ATF4 deficiency reduces serum TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-17A levels and diminishes monocyte/macrophage pro-inflammatory activity compared to wild-type mice [27], highlighting its importance in LPS-induced inflammation. ATF4-mediated pyroptosis can also exacerbate immune dysregulation in splenic dendritic cells and macrophages [28]. However, its involvement in SIC progression remains unexplored. ISRIB, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR) [29,30], stabilizes protein synthesis by modulating eIF2B. It mitigates cognitive deficits in murine models [31] and attenuates atherosclerosis by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation [32]. Crucially, ISRIB inhibits the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway, reducing ATF4 expression and subsequent downregulation of inflammatory genes including IL-6, TNF, TXNIP, and IL-1β [33]. Nevertheless, the role of ISRIB in SIC pathogenesis and progression is unknown.

In this study, we constructed LPS-induced cellular and animal models of sepsis and demonstrated that ATF4 transcriptionally regulates the DDIT4/TXNIP interaction to drive ferroptosis in LPS-stimulated SIC. The ATF4 inhibitor ISRIB ameliorated LPS-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis by suppressing ATF4 expression, thereby improving cardiac function. These findings identify novel therapeutic targets and suggest ISRIB as a potential drug candidate for improving the clinical management of SIC.

All the experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the European Ethical Committee (EEC) (2010/63/EU) and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) for the care and use of laboratory animals. Six-week-old (6w) c57 mice were used in this study and were obtained from Slaik Co., Ltd. (Changsha, Hunan Province, China). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University.

The 6w c57 mice were intraperitoneally injected with a freshly prepared LPS solution or saline solution at a dose of 16 mg/kg body weight. The experimental specimens were collected 12 h after administration. The mice were anesthetized by injecting 3% volume of pentobarbital into their abdominal cavities, followed by rapid collection of blood from the eyeball and storage in an EP tube. The blood was allowed to stand for approximately 2–3 h before centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant, which was stored at − 80 °C for subsequent use. After blood collection, mice were euthanized by CO2, cardiac perfusion was performed with physiological saline by incising the chest cavity and inserting an infusion needle into the left ventricle of each mouse. When the color of the mouse lungs and liver transitioned to a pale red hue, resembling white, perfusion ceased and the heart was extracted and placed within an EP tube.

ISRIB (HY-12495A) was acquired from MedChemExpress, USA, and was administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. LPS was purchased from Solarbio (Beijing, China).

H9C2 and HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, China. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, USA).

Mouse serum was collected, and the levels of CK-MB, c-TnT, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Jingkang Biotechnology Company, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and Fe2+in cell supernatant were quantified using a lipid peroxidation MDA and Fe2+assay kit (Shanghai, China).

After shaving the chest hair of anesthetized mice, transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a cardiac ultrasound instrument (Vevo, 2100). The size and wall thickness of the left ventricle (LV) adjacent to the sternum were estimated using the short-axis MMI. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular internal dimension in diastole (LVIDd), and left ventricular internal dimension in systole (LVIDs) were calculated.

The tissue slices were placed in a 70 ℃ in situ hybridization oven and incubated for 30 min. Subsequently, the baked slices were transferred to xylene for gradient hydration, followed by successive immersions in 100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% ethanol solutions for 5 min each, followed by immersion in distilled water for another 5 min. Excess water was removed, hematoxylin staining solution was applied, and the sections were incubated for 5 min. The hematoxylin staining solution was rinsed off with running water and the degree of staining was examined under a microscope. One drop of 0.5% eosin staining solution was added and incubated for 10–15 s. After rinsing with distilled water, results of HE staining were observed under a microscope.

After dewaxing the paraffin sections in water, antigen retrieval was performed using a citrate buffer (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. Subsequently, the sections were blocked with goat serum for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C. The following day, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies and stained with DAB (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Following counterstaining with hematoxylin and dehydration, the slides were examined under a microscope and images were captured for subsequent analysis.

Cells in the co-focused dish were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, permeabilization was performed using 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA. The cells were gently washed twice with PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (diluted in 3% BSA to maintain moisture). The next day, a fluorescent secondary antibody was applied and incubated for 1 h (diluted at a ratio of 1:100–1:200). After staining with DAPI for five min, the cells were washed three times with PBS prior to observation and photography using a laser confocal microscope.

The cells were collected, frozen, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min each. The samples were permeabilized by treatment with 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The TdT enzyme reaction solution was prepared immediately before use to ensure protection from light exposure. The surrounding area of the sample was dried using absorbent paper and 50 μL of TdT enzyme reaction solution was carefully added onto each sample. The samples were placed in a light-protected humid chamber and incubated at a temperature of 37 ℃ for 60 min. Next, 50 μL of Streptavidin-TRITC labeling solution was added onto each sample and incubated in a dark humid chamber at 37 ℃ for 30 min. After thorough washing with PBS, the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI staining solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China) at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Finally, stained cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope.

The cells were digested and centrifuged in tubes to remove the supernatant. DHE (Bioscience, Shang hai, China) or DCFH-DA (Uelandy, Suzhou, China) probes were diluted in serum- and antibiotic-free DEME according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were resuspended with diluted dyes and incubated at 37 ℃ for 25 min in an incubator. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with serum- and antibiotic-free medium, the fluorescence intensity was measured using flow cytometry, and the results were analyzed using FlowJo software. For the adherent cardiac myocytes, after probe incubation and washing with serum-free DMEM, ROS expression was directly visualized using a confocal microscope.

For adherent cells, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed once with PBS. Subsequently, 1 mL of cell culture medium was added, followed by 1 mL of JC-1 staining working solution (Bioss, Beijing, China), and thoroughly mixed. The cells were incubated at 37 ℃ in a cell incubator for 20 min. After incubation, the supernatant was carefully discarded, and cells were washed twice using the JC-1 staining buffer. Finally, the cells were visualized under a laser confocal microscope after supplementation with the cell culture medium. For digested cell suspensions, fluorescence spectrophotometry or flow cytometry was also employed.

Cells were inoculated into culture dishes or wells and incubated overnight in a CO2incubator. The culture medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with fresh medium. The supernatant was discarded, and the prepared working solution was added, followed by an incubation period of 30 min in a CO2incubator. The working solution was removed, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and fluorescence intensity was evaluated using a confocal microscope.

Mouse cardiac tissue was subjected to LPS and saline treatments for whole-genome gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol and stored at − 80 °C. Shanghai PersonalBio Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (www.personalbio.com) performed the RNA separation and sequencing. Initially, the raw sequencing data were filtered, resulting in high-quality sequences (clean data) that were aligned to the reference genome of the species. The expression of each gene was calculated based on the alignment results. Subsequently, additional analyses including differential expression, enrichment, and clustering analyses were conducted on the samples.

After extracting the cellular RNA, cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Transgon, China). The primers were obtained from Shenggong Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Subsequently, the cDNA was amplified using PCR mix (Transgon, China), the relevant primer sequences are shown in Tables1.

Total protein was extracted from the cells or heart tissue and quantified using a BCA assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, SDS-PAGE was performed at 80 V for 30 min, followed by 120 V for 1 h. The gel was then transferred to membranes for 90 min at a constant current of 300 mA. Blocking of membranes was carried out using skim milk powder and incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C (antibodies used: ATF4 (Proteintech, China), DDIT4 (Thermo Fisher, USA), TXNIP (CST,USA), ACSL4 (Abcam, the UK), FTH1 (Zenbio, China), PTGS2 (Abcam, the UK), BAX (Proteintech, China), BCL-2 (Proteintech, China), IL-1β (Zenbio, China), TNF-α (Zenbio, China), β-actin (Proteintech, China), GAPDH (Proteintech, China). The following day, the membrane was washed three times with TBST (10 min each time), followed by incubation with a secondary antibody (Transgon, China) at room temperature for 1 h. Bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Biosharp).

After treatment, the cells were harvested and centrifuged using EDTA-free trypsin. Subsequently, two washes were performed with pre-chilled PBS and the cells were resuspended in 100 μL of pre-chilled Binding Buffer. The cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI dyes using a flow cytometry apoptosis kit (Vazyme, China) at room temperature in the dark for up to 1 h prior to analysis.

Mouse heart tissue samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and refrigerated at 4 ℃ for a minimum of 4 h to ensure proper fixation. Semi-thin sections were prepared, dehydrated, and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate for quantitative analysis. After a brief rinse with deionized water, excess moisture was removed using a filter paper before placing the samples in a drying oven. Finally, cells were observed and photographed using by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachs-450).

For cross-linking, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cross-linking was terminated by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M, followed by mixing, and allowing the mixture to sit at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, sonication was performed for 10 cycles to fragment the chromatin, remove debris, before antibody incubation. Finally, immunocomplex precipitation and washing steps were performed before recovering the DNA samples for Q-PCR analysis.

Cell lysis was performed in a pre-cooled RIPA buffer. Cells were detached from the culture dish using a cell scraper and transferred to EP tubes. After sonication, the supernatant was centrifuged to remove the debris. Antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 ℃ with rotation. Magnetic beads were then introduced and rotated for 5 min/3 times in the immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, followed by separation using a magnetic column. The washed magnetic beads were incubated with 100 μL immunoprecipitation lysis buffer on a rotating shaker for 5 h to ensure thorough mixing of antibodies and beads. Subsequently, the magnetic beads were immobilized at the bottom using a magnetic column and the supernatant was discarded. The beads underwent three washes with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (shaking at 4 ℃ for 5 min each time), followed by addition of loading buffer and boiling at 100 °C for 10 min. Further steps were performed according to a western blotting protocol.

Gene screening was performed using a PCR array (WC-MRNA0358-M; WoGene, Shanghai, China). Initially, the RNA samples were reverse-transcribed into cDNA as templates for PCR amplification. Subsequently, these templates were added to the reaction system containing Real-TimeTM SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. Equal volumes of the PCR mixture were dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate with prefixed gene-specific primers for subsequent PCR amplification. The cycle threshold (Ct) value for each gene in the PCR chip was determined using the instrument-provided software. Finally, changes in expression levels of the same gene between corresponding samples were compared using the ΔΔCt method. Normalization was determined by analyzing the consistency of the Ct values for housekeeping genes.

Protein structures were retrieved from the PDB database, PyMOL software was utilized to eliminate water molecules and receptor proteins and was saved in PDB format. We employed the Start GRAMM docking program for molecular docking and obtained the top 10 docked results with the lowest binding energies. The best-docked results were exported using PyMOL software. The binding energy of the optimal docking outcome was evaluated using the Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies (PDBePISA). Protein–protein interactions predicted binding sites, and surface electrostatic binding forces were analyzed by importing the docking results into PyMOL.

Data analysis and graphing were performed using GraphPad Prism software and SPSS v.20. The Student’s t-test was used to assess differences between two groups, whereas the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05.

We established a murine model of septic cardiomyopathy using an intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Histological examination using HE and immunohistochemical staining revealed significant infiltration of inflammatory cells in the cardiac tissues of the LPS group, accompanied by upregulation of macrophage marker F4/80 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (Fig.1A). ELISA confirmed elevated levels of serum IL-1β, IL-6, as well as myocardial injury marker CK-MB in the LPS group (Fig.1B). To investigate the genes associated with the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis on both the LPS-induced model group and the physiological saline-treated control group, and found a significant positive correlation between the gene sets associated with the hypoxia response (GO:0001666) and oxidative stress (GO:0006979) upon LPS stimulation. GSEA indicated that the mechanistic axis from the hypoxic response to oxidative stress might play a pivotal role in the occurrence of LPS-induced SIC (Fig.1C, F). Further generation of heatmaps for upregulated gene expression within both GO categories (Fig.1D, G), followed by prediction through their protein–protein interaction network String (Fig.1I), revealed that the targeted association between the hypoxia-related gene DDIT4 and the functional protein TXNIP involved in oxidative stress was highly likely to be critical in SIC. Thus, we conducted GSEA to further investigate the functional enrichment of DDIT4 and TXNIP. DDIT4 was positively implicated in the cell cycle, positive regulation of the apoptotic process, regulation of cell population proliferation, response to hydrogen peroxide, and response to oxidative stress (Fig.1E), whereas TXNIP also exhibited a positive involvement in the apoptotic process, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, negative oxygen species metabolic process, ROS metabolic process, and response to hypoxia (Fig.1H). The volcano plot revealed that the protein expressions of DDIT4 and TXNIP in the LPS group were significantly upregulated (Fig.S1). Consistent with these findings, our previous single-cell sequencing data also demonstrated that the expressions of DDIT4 and TXNIP in cardiomyocytes were markedly increased in the experimental group compared to the control group (Figs.S2andS3). These findings suggest that DDIT4/TXNIP participates in specific biological mechanisms during SIC-associated inflammatory responses. To validate the transcriptome sequencing data, we performed WB experiments using proteins extracted from mouse heart tissue. The results demonstrated significant upregulation of DDIT4 and TXNIP in the LPS group (Fig.1J). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining confirmed the pronounced expression of DDIT4 and TXNIP in LPS-treated heart tissue (Fig.1K).

To further investigate the specific regulatory relationship between DDIT4 and TXNIP, we used a concentration gradient of LPS stimulation in H9C2 and HL1 cardiac cell lines. Our findings revealed a concentration-dependent upregulation of both DDIT4 and TXNIP, accompanied by a gradual increase in the protein levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α (Fig.2A and B). Subsequently, we selected an LPS induction concentration of 5 μg/mL and collected protein samples from cardiac cells at various time points. Notably, both DDIT4 and TXNIP exhibited peak expression at 24 h, indicating a synchronized up-regulation trend for these two proteins (Fig.2C and D). To further elucidate the relationship between DDIT4 and TXNIP, we performed molecular docking analysis, revealing a high degree of complementarity in their binding pockets indicative of strong binding activity (Fig.2E), with a calculated binding energy of -12.3 kcal/mol. Notably, the interaction between DDIT4 and TXNIP involved the formation of 17 hydrogen bonds (Fig.2F). Additionally, electrostatic potential and van der Waals forces facilitated non-bonding interactions between these proteins (Fig.2G). Subsequently, the interaction between DDIT4 and TXNIP in cardiac myocyte cell lines was validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.2H). Furthermore, these two proteins exhibited distinct co-localization patterns, as observed via confocal microscopy (Fig.2I).

To investigate the effects of DDIT4 and TXNIP on LPS-induced cardiac cell function, we generated stable knockdown cell lines for DDIT4 (sh1 and sh2) and TXNIP (sh6, sh7, and sh8). The efficiency of protein knockdown was validated via western blotting and quantitative PCR (Fig.3A and B). Subsequently, RNA was extracted from LPS-stimulated cardiac cells, and Q-PCR was employed to quantify the transcription levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and NLRP3. Knockdown of DDIT4 (Fig.3C–F) and TXNIP (Fig.3G–J) significantly downregulated the expression of these inflammatory factors. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the knockdown of DDIT4 resulted in a reduction in cellular protein levels of TXNIP, accompanied by a decrease in the pro-apoptotic protein bax and cleaved caspase-3, an increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Fig.3K). Similarly, knockdown of TXNIP resulted in a significant decrease in Bax protein levels in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes, whereas Bcl-2 protein was upregulated (Fig.3L), indicating that silencing DDIT4 or TXNIP can inhibit LPS-induced cardiomyocyte death. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that TXNIP overexpression enhanced the protective effects against LPS-induced cardiomyocyte death following DDIT4 knockdown (Fig.3M). Overall, the findings suggest that both DDIT4 and TXNIP contribute to inflammation in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes, with DDIT4 promoting LPS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by upregulating expression of TXNIP.

To investigate the underlying mechanism by which DDIT4 influences SIC, we isolated RNA from control and DDIT4 knockdown cells following LPS treatment. Subsequently, a death-screening PCR array kit was used to assess the expression of relevant genes in both cell groups (Fig.4A). The volcano plot revealed that the sh-DDIT4 group exhibited the most significant downregulation of the ferroptosis-related proteins prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and the apoptosis protein Bax (Fig.4B). Furthermore, PCR experiments confirmed statistically significant differences in the levels of downregulation of these proteins (Fig.4C), suggesting that DDIT4 may influence the occurrence and progression of SIC by modulating the ferroptosis process. To validate the PCR array data, we evaluated the effects of DDIT4 on LPS-stimulated cardiomyocyte ferroptosis. Western blotting experiments confirmed the expected downregulation of PTGS2 and ACSL4 as well as the upregulation of ferritin Heavy Chain 1 (FTH1) expression upon knockdown of DDIT4. Specifically, PTGS2 and ACSL4 protein levels were significantly reduced in the sh-DDIT4 group, whereas FTH1 protein levels were markedly increased (Fig.4D). Through the analysis of the MIMIC-IV database, it was found that serum ferritin levels significantly impact the prognosis of critically ill patients with sepsis. Specifically, elevated serum ferritin is associated with increased in-hospital mortality rates. High serum ferritin levels are correlated with higher 28-day and 90-day mortality rates, as well as an increased risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) (Fig.S4). These findings provide robust evidence supporting the role of serum ferritin in predicting mortality and prognosis risks in sepsis patients. This evidence may facilitate the clinical application of serum ferritin as a biomarker for diagnosing and prognosticating sepsis, and suggests that ferritin could be a critical factor influencing the progression of sepsis. Considering that lipid peroxidation, iron overload, and the intracellular accumulation of ROS are pivotal characteristics of ferroptosis, we investigated the levels of MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation, and Fe2+in these cell lines. Compared with the control group, the LPS-induced sh-DDIT4 group exhibited a significant decrease in MDA (Fig.4E) and Fe2+levels (Fig.3F). Additionally, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in overall levels of ROS in sh-DDIT4 cells induced by LPS (Fig.4G), which was further validated by immunofluorescence staining (Fig.4I). Erastin induces ferroptosis, which in turn triggers cell death. Western blotting results showed that the knockdown of DDIT4 inhibited the protein levels of ferroptosis markers induced by LPS, whereas erastin exacerbated the inhibitory effect of sh-DDIT4 on ferroptosis, leading to increased cellular ferroptosis (Fig.4H). These findings suggested that DDIT4 knockdown plays a protective role by suppressing LPS-induced ferroptosis. To validate the impact of TXNIP on LPS-induced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis, western blotting experiments were performed to confirm that knockdown of TXNIP was associated with decreased enrichment of the ferroptosis-related proteins PTGS2 and ACSL4, while upregulating FTH1 expression (Fig.4J). JC-1, a widely utilized fluorescent probe, was used to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential. When the mitochondrial membrane potential was high, JC-1 aggregated within the mitochondrial matrix to form J-aggregates, resulting in red fluorescence emission. Conversely, when the mitochondrial membrane potential was low, JC-1 remained a monomer and could not aggregate within the matrix, leading to green fluorescence emission. The relative proportions of these fluorescent signals were used to quantify the extent of mitochondrial depolarization. We observed a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes using the JC-1 probe, whereas the knockdown of TXNIP resulted in the upregulation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.4K). Moreover, western blotting analysis demonstrated that silencing of TXNIP expression suppressed the protein levels of ferroptosis markers induced by LPS, and erastin exacerbated the inhibitory effect on ferroptosis after sh-TXNIP treatment, leading to enhanced cellular ferroptosis (Fig.4L), which indicated that downregulation of TXNIP exerts a protective role by inhibiting LPS-induced ferroptosis. To further elucidate the impact of the DDIT4-TXNIP axis on ferroptosis in myocardial cells, we transfected plasmids overexpressing TXNIP into stable cell lines with DDIT4 knockdown. Western blotting analysis revealed the upregulation of ferroptosis-related proteins following LPS induction, downregulation of these proteins after DDIT4 knockdown, and exacerbation of ferroptosis markers in the LPS + sh-DDIT4 group when TXNIP was overexpressed, compared with that in the knockdown group. These findings indicate that overexpression of TXNIP aggravates the inhibitory effects of DDIT4 knockdown on ferroptosis (Fig.4M), thereby demonstrating that DDIT4 modulates ferroptosis in myocardial cells by regulating TXNIP expression.

To investigate the inhibitory effects of intracellular DDIT4 knockdown on LPS-induced cardiac toxicity, the adenovirus-associated vectors AAV-sh and AAV-shDDIT4 were administered to mice via tail vein injection. Following one month of growth, a systemic inflammatory response was induced by administering LPS at a dose of 15 mg/kg per mouse (Fig.5A). Subsequently, heart tissue protein and RNA were extracted for western blotting analysis (Fig.5B) and Q-PCR analysis (Fig.4C), respectively. Compared with the control group, knockdown of DDIT4 significantly improved the survival rate of LPS-treated mice (Fig.5H). Echocardiographic assessment (Fig.5D) revealed a significant deterioration in cardiac function among SIC mice compared with that in the control group. However, knockdown of DDIT4 partially ameliorated cardiac function in the knockdown DDIT4 group, as evidenced by augmentation of the LVEF and FS (Figs.6E and F). These findings suggested that DDIT4 downregulation exerts protective effects against LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction. The effects of DDIT4 knockdown on LPS-induced myocardial injury was assessed by analyzing changes in inflammatory factors and biomarkers of myocardial damage after centrifugation to obtain clear serum from ocular blood. Biochemical analysis revealed that knockdown of DDIT4 significantly attenuated the elevation of IL-1β, IL-6, CK-MB, and cTn-T serum levels induced by LPS (Fig.5J). TEM images revealed a well-organized arrangement of mouse myocardial fibers in the AAV9-shNC and AAV9-shDDIT4 groups, with mitochondria exhibiting normal morphology and tightly packed intact double membranes devoid of damage, dissolution, or vacuoles. Conversely, in the AAV-shNC + LPS group, fractured myocardial fibers with disordered sarcomeres were observed along with mitochondrial swelling and disrupted cristae structure, indicating an abnormal morphology. However, partial repair of fractured myocardial fibers was evident in mice in the AAV9-shDDIT4 + LPS group, accompanied by mild mitochondrial swelling and reduced occurrence of dissolution or vacuoles (Fig.5G). DHE probe analysis also demonstrated a reduction in ROS fluorescence intensity within the cardiac tissues of mice with SIC following DDIT4 knockdown (Fig.5I). Furthermore, alterations in DDIT4, ACSL4, PTGS2, FTH1, and IL-6 protein levels were observed across different groups. Specifically, ATF4, ACSL4, PTGS2, and IL-6 levels were downregulated, whereas FTH1 protein was upregulated in the DDIT4 + LPS group compared to those in the LPS group. These findings suggest that the suppression of DDIT4 can effectively inhibit inflammation and ferroptosis in cardiac tissues (Fig.5L). Consistent results were obtained through HE staining and immunohistochemistry studies, corroborating the results of the western blotting analysis (Fig.5K). Overall, our data demonstrate that the downregulation of DDIT4 enhances the survival rate of SIC mice and ameliorates LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction and ferroptosis.

Upon investigating the upstream regulatory proteins targeting DDIT4 and their integration with the differential gene expression observed in the transcriptome sequencing results, we discovered significant upregulation in ATF4 expression in the LPS group. Drawing from previous research, ATF4 may exert transcriptional control over DDIT4, thereby influencing the onset and progression of SIC. We initially validated the transcriptional regulation of DDIT4 by ATF4 in a cardiomyocyte cell line using ChIP experiments (Fig.6A–C). Moreover, concentration-dependent upregulation of ATF4 expression was observed upon LPS stimulation in the cardiomyocyte cell line, as confirmed via western blotting analysis (Fig.6D and E). Additionally, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated an enhanced fluorescence intensity of ATF4 in the LPS group compared with that in the control group (Fig.6F). To establish stable knockdown of ATF4 in cardiac myocytes, we performed western blotting to confirm knockdown efficiency. Subsequently, DDIT4 expression was observed to be downregulated upon ATF4 knockdown (Fig.6G). To investigate the impact of ATF4 on LPS-induced cardiac cell function and its underlying mechanism, we assessed the transcription levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in LPS-induced cardiac cells after ATF4 knockdown using Q-PCR. Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in transcription levels (Fig.6H–J), suggesting that ATF4 knockdown can effectively inhibit inflammation in cardiac cells. Subsequent western blotting experiments confirmed that ATF4 knockdown led to a reduction in the enrichment of PTGS2 and ACSL4 proteins, while upregulating the expression of FTH1 (Fig.6K). Additionally, fluorescence microscopy revealed a significant decrease in Fe2+fluorescence intensity in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes following ATF4 knockdown compared to that observed in the control group (Fig.6L), suggesting that suppression of ATF4 can inhibit LPS-induced ferroptosis. To further elucidate the effects of ATF4 on ferroptosis in myocardial cells by regulating DDIT4 expression, we transfected stable cell lines with ATF4 knockdown using a plasmid overexpressing DDIT4. Flow cytometry analysis (Fig.6N) was employed to assess mitochondrial membrane potential levels, revealing that ATF4 knockdown reduced the proportion of monomers during the LPS-induced decrease in cell membrane potential (upregulation of monomers). However, upon overexpression of DDIT4, the proportion of monomers increased in the LPS + sh-ATF4 group compared with that in the group with ATF4 knockdown alone. Similarly, the results obtained from confocal microscopy were consistent with those obtained from flow cytometry (Fig.6M), indicating that the inhibition of ferroptosis was exacerbated by DDIT4 overexpression following sh-ATF4 treatment. This demonstrates that ATF4 regulates DDIT4 expression, thereby influencing myocardial cell ferroptosis.

To facilitate the therapeutic translation of ATF4 as a therapeutic target, we evaluated whether the upstream inhibitor of ATF4, ISRIB, could enhance cardiac function and mitigate the progression of inflammation in SIC. Subsequently, relevant in vitro experiments were performed. Molecular docking analysis revealed strong binding activity between ATF4 protein and small molecule ISRIB within the binding pocket (Fig.7A), demonstrating a high degree of fit with a binding energy of − 7.2 kcal/mol (Fig.7D). Additionally, small molecules formed two hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues ARG-296 and ARG-240 in the ATF4 protein (Fig.7B). Simultaneously, non-bonded interactions between ATF4 and ISRIB occurred through electrostatic potential and van der Waals forces (Fig.7C). In summary, ATF4 and ISRIB may form additional interactions. The Q-PCR results demonstrated that ISRIB suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced myocardial cells (Fig.7E–G). Further, western blotting results demonstrated that increasing ISRIB levels more strongly reduced the enrichment of PTGS2 and ACSL2. In contrast, FTH1 expression was upregulated (Fig.7H). Moreover, erastin exacerbated the inhibitory effect of ISRIB on ferroptosis post-treatment, leading to the augmentation of cellular ferroptosis (Fig.7I). Confocal microscopy revealed that ISRIB expression effectively suppressed the intracellular Fe2+levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.7J). The Lipid Peroxidation Probe-BDP 581/591 C11 is a fluorescent probe capable of detecting lipid peroxide formation. This fluorescent probe emits red fluorescence under normal conditions; however, during lipid peroxidation, the fluorescence shifts from red to green. In myocardial cells treated with LPS, C11 exhibited green fluorescence, indicating promotion of intracellular lipid peroxidation by LPS. Treatment with ISRIB weakened the green fluorescence and effectively inhibited cellular lipid peroxidation (Fig.7K). Furthermore, the TUNEL assay confirmed that LPS-induced myocardial cell death was exacerbated, whereas ISRIB treatment significantly attenuated the rate of cell death. Moreover, under erastin induction, the mortality rate of myocardial cells increased, further exacerbating the inhibitory effects of ISRIB treatment on myocardial cell death (Fig.7L), indicating that ISRIB exerts a protective role by suppressing ferroptosis induced by LPS.

To investigate the role of ISRIB in LPS-induced cardiac toxicity, we initially administered dissolved ISRIB via intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg per mouse for one week prior to establishing the LPS-induced SIC model (15 mg/kg per mouse) (Fig.8A). Subsequently, we evaluated the survival rate of these mice and observed that, compared with the LPS group, treatment with ISRIB significantly enhanced the survival rate (Fig.8B). Echocardiographic evaluation (Fig.8E) revealed a significant decline in cardiac function in SIC mice compared to the control group. However, treatment with ISRIB resulted in a partial recovery of cardiac function when compared with the LPS group, as indicated by an increase in the LVEF and FS parameters (Fig.8C and D). These findings suggest that ISRIB protects against LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction. The biochemical analysis demonstrated that ISRIB effectively suppressed the upregulation of serum inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, CK-MB, and c-TnT induced by LPS (Fig.8G). TEM revealed that in the control and ISRIB groups, myocardial fibers exhibited an organized arrangement with normal mitochondrial morphology. In contrast, the LPS group displayed fractured myocardial fibers with disordered sarcomeres and an abnormal morphology. However, in SIC mice treated with ISRIB, partial restoration of fractured myocardial fibers was observed, along with mild swelling of the mitochondria (Fig.8F). TUNEL staining of heart tissue slices revealed a significantly lower cell death rate in the heart tissues of SIC mice treated with ISRIB than in those treated with LPS (Fig.8H), indicating an inhibitory effect of ISRIB on myocardial cell death in SIC mice. Furthermore, alterations in ATF4, ACSL4, PTGS2, TFH1, and IL-6 protein levels were observed among the groups. Notably, in the ISRIB + LPS group, downregulation of ATF4, ACSL4, PTGS2, and IL-6 was evident compared with that in the LPS group, whereas FTH1 protein expression was upregulated (Fig.8I), suggesting that ISRIB exerts anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits ferroptosis in cardiac tissue. The multi-color immunofluorescence experiment also yielded results consistent with the western blotting findings (Fig.8J). In summary, our data demonstrated that ISRIB enhanced the survival rate of SIC mice and mitigated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction and ferroptosis.

Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms, which leads to the release of numerous inflammatory mediators that disrupt immune homeostasis and subsequently affect multiple organs. The heart is one of the most critically affected organs. Septic cardiomyopathy, a severe complication of sepsis, can result in varying degrees of myocardial dysfunction characterized by reduced myocardial contractility, peripheral vasodilation, decreased LVEF, and reversible biventricular dilation [34,35]. The occurrence of SIC is not attributed to a single mechanism but to the synergistic actions of multiple factors. Notably, aberrant mitochondrial structure and function as well as the influence of inflammatory factors are the predominant contributors. However, additional mechanisms need to be elucidated and validated. Consequently, an in-depth investigation of the precise mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of SIC, along with the development of novel targeted therapies, can offer new insights for clinicians in the prevention and treatment of SIC, thereby holding significant clinical translational value.

Ferroptosis [36], a unique form of cell death that has been identified in recent years, plays a role in both physiological and pathological processes. Morphologically, ferroptosis is characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial volume, increased density of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, and the disappearance or reduction of mitochondrial cristae, whereas the cell membrane remains intact and the nuclear size remains unchanged. PTGS2, also known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), serves as a recognized biomarker for ferroptosis, with elevated expression levels indicating the onset of ferroptosis. As the primary rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of arachidonic acid in mammals, PTGS2 has been extensively studied and is widely acknowledged for its close association with inflammatory responses [37,38]. FTH1 is a crucial component of the iron storage protein ferritin. It reduces intracellular free iron levels by sequestering iron, and can also interact with nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) to facilitate the degradation of ferritin via ferroptosis, leading to the release of significant amounts of iron. This increase in intracellular Fe2+further activates the expression of mitochondrial transmembrane proteins, promoting the transport of Fe2+into the mitochondria, which results in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cell death [39]. LPS upregulates the expression of p53 and ferritin and downregulates the levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11. Conversely, transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) exerts an opposing effect by preventing SIC by inhibiting ferroptosis [40]. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis, ameliorates myocardial dysfunction through the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway [41]. Our study, confirmed both in vivo and in vitro that LPS could promote the release of free Fe ions into the myocardium, leading to ferroptosis. Furthermore, LPS stimulation significantly upregulated the expression of PTGS2 and markedly downregulated the expression of FTH1 in mouse myocardial tissues and cardiomyocyte lines, confirming the involvement of ferroptosis in SIC.

To investigate the genes closely associated with the pathogenesis of SIC, we conducted transcriptome sequencing, which revealed that the oxidative stress-related genes DDIT4 and TXNIP exhibited a consistent trend of upregulation. Additionally, we performed GSEA for the functional enrichment of these two genes, demonstrating that in LPS-stimulated SIC, both DDIT4 and TXNIP were involved in the oxidative stress response. DDIT4, located on chromosome 10q22.1, is a protein consisting of 232 amino acids that is transcriptionally upregulated in response to DNA damage across various cell types [42,43]. DDIT4 plays critical roles in multiple biological and cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, inflammation, autophagy, and energy homeostasis [44–47]. Extensive studies have explored the involvement of DDIT4 in cardiac pathophysiology [48–50], revealing that the inhibition of DDIT4 can protect cardiomyocytes from ischemia–reperfusion injury [51] and methamphetamine-induced cardiac hypertrophy [52]. These findings suggest a potential link between DDIT4 and cardiac remodeling as well as heart failure. However, there is a paucity of studies on the role of DDIT4 in SIC. In our study, in vivo experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of DDIT4 in mice with septic cardiomyopathy resulted in increased survival rates, partial recovery of cardiac function, downregulation of inflammatory factors, and a more orderly arrangement of cardiac tissue fibers compared with the LPS-treated controls. Additionally, mitochondrial vacuolization and dissolution were markedly reduced. DHE probe analysis revealed a significant decrease in ROS levels in the cardiac tissue following DDIT4 knockdown, accompanied by a significant reduction in ferroptosis marker proteins. These findings indicated that DDIT4 knockdown effectively alleviated LPS-induced myocardial injury and mitochondria-related ferroptosis. Similar results were obtained from in vitro validation of in vivo findings. Notably, TXNIP, which was previously predicted to interact with DDIT4, was found to exert a pro-inflammatory effect on LPS-induced cardiomyocytes. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TXNIP knockdown significantly inhibited inflammation and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Rescue experiments further confirmed that DDIT4 regulated ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes by modulating its expression. On investigation of upstream regulatory proteins targeting DDIT4, we determined that the transcription factor ATF4 transcriptionally regulated the expression of DDIT4 in cardiomyocytes. In vitro experiments confirmed that ATF4 knockdown inhibited both inflammation and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, rescue experiments revealed that overexpression of DDIT4 exacerbated the ferroptosis-inhibiting effect of sh-ATF4, demonstrating that ATF4 influences ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes by regulating the expression of DDIT4.

Currently, the therapeutic efficacy of conventional drugs for SIC is suboptimal, and no fully effective drugs for SIC treatment have been identified in clinical practice. Recently, a growing body of preclinical evidence suggests that certain phytochemicals or bioactive compounds exhibit potent therapeutic effects against SIC. Phytochemicals primarily consist of polyphenolic compounds, terpenoids, saponins, and alkaloids that can prevent and treat SIC by mitigating inflammatory responses, attenuating oxidative stress, and enhancing metabolic function. Bioactive compounds include hormones, cytokines, vitamins, and biological pigments that can downregulate the expression of inflammatory factors or inhibit cell death by targeting specific anti-inflammatory pathways, thereby ameliorating SIC. Additionally, other medications such as antihistamines, anti-angiogenic agents, and analgesics have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential and offer promising avenues for further research on SIC treatment. Previous studies have confirmed [53,54] that different drugs such as metformin and ulinastatin can alleviate sepsis-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting oxidative stress or inflammatory responses. However, the identification of more effective drugs and the elucidation of their specific mechanisms of action remain clinically significant challenges. In this study, we used in vitro myocardial cell models treated with LPS and in vivo mouse models of sepsis induced by intraperitoneal administration of LPS to investigate the effects of ISRIB, a small-molecule inhibitor of ATF4, on LPS-induced sepsis. ISRIB activates eIF2B by inducing an allosteric conformational change, restores the regeneration of eIF2-GTP, and alleviates the translational inhibition resulting from eIF2α phosphorylation. By doing so, it indirectly suppresses the upstream open reading frame (uORF)-mediated translation of ATF4, thereby preventing excessive activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) [55,56].This study aimed to explore the relationship between the protective effects of ISRIB against sepsis-induced myocardial injury and ferroptosis signaling pathways. ISRIB treatment significantly increased the survival rate of mice, improved cardiac function, and led to a statistically significant downregulation of ferroptosis marker proteins. These findings clarify the biological targets of ISRIB, provide a novel direction and theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of sepsis-induced myocardial injury, and offer valuable insights into the development and utilization of ISRIB as a therapeutic agent.

Overall, this was the first study to elucidate the mechanism by which ISRIB protects against sepsis-induced myocardial injury by targeting ATF4/DDIT4/TXNIP axis-dependent ferroptosis (Fig.9), thereby offering novel therapeutic insights into SIC.

In summary, this study for the first time reveals that the DDIT4/TXNIP-mediated ferroptosis mechanism exacerbates the inflammatory release and cardiac function decline in SIC. It also clarified that this biological effect is regulated by ATF4, an upstream transcription factor of DDIT4. Moreover, it was proposed that the inhibitor ISRIB, which targets ATF4, can significantly attenuate the inflammatory response and ferroptosis in SIC, while concurrently protecting cardiac function. This finding provides a brand-new therapeutic target and intervention agent for the clinical treatment of SIC.
