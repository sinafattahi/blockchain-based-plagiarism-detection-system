Introduction: Infective endocarditis is a rare complication of untreated Whipple’s disease. We present a case of infective endocarditis caused byTropheryma whippleiin an aortic bioprosthesis.

Case presentation: A 77-year-old man with a bioprosthetic aortic valve and pacemaker presented with two months of fever. He had a history of HLA-B27-negative ankylosing spondylitis treated with adalimumab. Examination revealed a systolic aortic murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetation on the aortic bioprosthetis. Serologies and cultures were negative. He underwent valve replacement, endocavitary pacemaker system removal, and epicardial pacemaker implantation. Valve tissue PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were positive forT. whipplei. Empiric ceftriaxone was given for two weeks, followed by doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for 12 months, then lifelong doxycycline monotherapy.

Conclusion: Whipple’s endocarditis is difficult to diagnose due to its atypical presentation and frequent failure to meet Duke criteria. Tissue PCR plays a crucial role when standard microbiologic testing is inconclusive.

Whipple’s disease (WD) is a rare, chronic, multisystem infection caused byT. whipplei, a ubiquitous, Gram-positive bacterium in the actinomycetes group [1].T. whippleicannot be cultured using standard laboratory methods, which complicates diagnosis. The global incidence of WD is estimated at 1 to 3 new cases per 1 million people annually. WD predominantly affects Caucasian men over 40 years of age, with a male-to-female ratio of 4:1. Transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route, and the disease is more prevalent among sewage workers and individuals in unsanitary environments [2].

WD exhibits a broad clinical spectrum. While many individuals are asymptomatic carriers, the classic triad includes gastrointestinal symptoms (72%–81%), intermittent arthralgia (73%–80%), and weight loss (79%–93%). Invasive forms may affect the central nervous system, lungs, or cardiovascular system [2,3]. Due to its rarity and clinical variability, diagnosis is often delayed. Key diagnostic tools include histopathology and PCR or 16S rRNA sequencing of tissue, saliva, feces, or cerebrospinal fluid [2].

Cardiac involvement is reported in 17% to 55% of WD cases and may present as pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure, or infective endocarditis (IE) [4]. Even with more common etiologies, IE poses significant diagnostic and treatment challenges due to its heterogeneous presentation and high-risk profile. The POET II trial highlighted the complexity of IE management, especially when choosing the best timing and method for antibiotic therapy, even in well-defined bacterial cases [5]. These difficulties are magnified in blood culture-negative infective endocarditis (BCNIE), whereT. whippleiis a rare but important causative agent [6].

T. whippleiinfective endocarditis (TWIE) is a rare and often underdiagnosed form of BCNIE. TWIE lacks standardized treatment protocols, carries a high mortality rate of approximately 24%, and frequently eludes early detection [7]. We present a case of TWIE involving an aortic bioprosthesis to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with this rare manifestation.

A 77-year-old Caucasian man was admitted with a two-month history of fever and general deterioration. He reported no gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms. On physical examination, he was febrile at 39°C, with normal hemodynamic parameters. A systolic aortic murmur was noted. Abdominal, neurological, and lymph node examinations were unremarkable.

His medical history included a pacemaker implanted five years earlier and a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement four years earlier. He also had hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and stable monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Two years prior, he was diagnosed with HLA-B27-negative ankylosing spondylitis and was treated with adalimumab. His chronic medications included amiodarone, apixaban, bisoprolol, perindopril, atorvastatin, furosemide, levothyroxine, lansoprazole, and adalimumab (50 mg every two weeks). He had quit smoking 15 years ago, did not consume alcohol, did not have any pets, and had not traveled recently. He worked as a gas station attendant.

Initial laboratory investigations revealed evidence of systemic inflammation, acute kidney injury associated with sepsis, and hepatic cytolysis. Serologic testing for common viral and bacterial pathogens, including HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, came back negative. Blood and urine cultures remained sterile. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a 1.8 × 0.5 cm vegetation on the ventricular side of the aortic bioprosthesis, along with severe aortic stenosis (Fig. 1). These findings led to a diagnosis of IE of the prosthetic valve.

Transthoracic echocardiographic findings in our patient. (A) Thickening of the aortic valve with visible vegetation (yellow arrow). (B) Magnified view of image a, highlighting the vegetation on the aortic valve (yellow arrow). (C) Five-chamber e chocardiographic view showing vegetation on the aortic valve (yellow highlight). (D) Continuous-wave Doppler assessment of the aortic valve in the five-chamber view, demonstrating flow characteristics consistent with severe aortic stenosis. AO: Aorta; LA: Left atrium; LV: Left ventricle.

To assess the extent of embolic and systemic involvement, a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed, showing focal splenic ischemia. Brain CT and funduscopy were unremarkable. The presence of fever, systemic inflammation, endocardial vegetation, and organ dysfunction pointed toward BCNIE.

Empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous amoxicillin and cefazolin was initiated, and adalimumab was discontinued. The patient underwent successful replacement of the infected aortic bioprosthetic valve, removal of the endocavitary pacemaker system, and implantation of an epicardial pacemaker. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed proper function of the new aortic prosthesis with no regurgitation or pericardial effusion. The left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced at 30%.

Valve tissueT. whippleiPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were positive. A diagnosis of TWIE was established. Empiric antibiotic therapy was adjusted to intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for two weeks, followed by oral doxycycline 200 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 600 mg/day for 12 months. Doxycycline monotherapy was continued thereafter as lifelong suppressive treatment. The patient became afebrile, inflammatory markers normalized and renal and liver function improved significantly. Therapeutic blood levels of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine were confirmed over the 12-month course. Follow-up echocardiography at 3 months showed a normally functioning aortic prosthesis with no significant regurgitation. Ophthalmologic monitoring during hydroxychloroquine therapy remained unremarkable.

WD is a rare systemic infection caused byT. whipplei, historically considered an infrequent cause of BCNIE. However, the increasing use of molecular diagnostic tools has led to improved detection rates, suggesting that TWIE may be underdiagnosed [3]. The first reported case of TWIE dates back to 1997, and while still uncommon, TWIE is now recognized in 2.6% to 6.3% of patients with BCNIE [8]. The majority of cases involve native valves, with aortic and mitral valves most frequently affected. Prosthetic valve involvement, as in our case, remains exceptionally rare [7,8].

Diagnosing TWIE remains particularly challenging. It may present without the classic features of WD and frequently does not meet the modified Duke criteria for IE. Fever may be absent, and blood cultures are often negative, which complicates early identification [2,4]. In cases of BCNIE, it is crucial to exclude other potential causes, such asCoxiella burnetii, Bartonella species, Brucella, Legionella, andMycoplasma pneumoniae, by performing serologic testing. TWIE is ultimately diagnosed using molecular biology techniques, such as valve tissue PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing, which are more sensitive and specific than blood-based diagnostics [4,6]. In our case, diagnosis was only established after surgical removal of the infected aortic valve, highlighting the importance of tissue-based diagnostics.

Our patient had a history of seronegative arthritis treated with adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor. This brings two relevant issues into focus. First, retrospective interpretation suggests that his joint symptoms could have been early extra-cardiac manifestations of WD, as migratory arthralgia often precedes systemic symptoms by years and can mimic inflammatory spondyloarthritis [7,9]. Second,T. whippleiis an intracellular bacterium that is controlled by cell-mediated immunity, particularly by TNF-α-dependent pathways. TNF-α inhibitors such as adalimumab may contribute to uncontrolled bacterial replication by dampening host immunity, potentially triggering the invasive cardiac manifestation observed in this case [9]. Therefore, in patients with unexplained arthralgia, weight loss and multisystem symptoms, the possibility of WD should be considered before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.

Surgical management involved replacement of the infected aortic bioprosthesis and complete removal of the intracavitary pacing system, which was substituted with an epicardial pacing system featuring a new right ventricular lead. Current guidelines recommend a conservative approach—such as device retention with close monitoring or use of leadless pacing—in the absence of infection signs [10]. However, in our patient, despite the absence of lead vegetations, removal was performed prophylactically to eliminate potential subclinical infection, considering the high recurrence risk associated with device retention. Microbiological cultures of the explanted lead were ultimately negative.

There is currently no standardized treatment protocol for TWIE, and most therapeutic strategies mirror those used for classic WD. The regimen of doxycycline (200 mg/day) plus hydroxychloroquine (600 mg/day) for 12 to 18 months, followed by lifelong doxycycline, has been associated with reduced relapse rates and is considered the most effective to date [2,4,6]. In our patient, this regimen resulted in rapid clinical improvement, normalization of inflammatory markers, and preserved valve function at follow-up. Monitoring drug levels and ophthalmologic assessment are essential during long-term therapy, especially when using hydroxychloroquine.

This case underlines several key clinical considerations. TWIE should be included in the differential diagnosis of BCNIE, especially in patients with unexplained joint symptoms or immunosuppressive therapy. Tissue PCR remains crucial for diagnosis when standard microbiologic testing is inconclusive. Surgical decisions, particularly involving cardiac devices, must be carefully tailored, and ideally supported by multidisciplinary consensus and evolving evidence.

Diagnosing TWIE remains challenging because it often does not fulfill the modified Duke criteria. In the presence of unexplained joint symptoms, TWIE should be considered, particularly before initiating immunosuppressive therapy. Tissue PCR is a crucial diagnostic tool when standard microbiological tests are inconclusive. Furthermore, emerging techniques such as nMGS show promise for improving the detection of invasive forms of WD. As with other etiologies of IE, the management of TWIE necessitates a multidisciplinary approach.
