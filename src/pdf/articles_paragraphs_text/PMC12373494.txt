Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, relapsing, autoimmune multisystemic disease involving single or multiple organs, such as skin, joints, kidneys, central and peripheral nervous systems, eyes, lungs, heart, and blood cells [1]. SLE can affect men and women; it is significantly more common in women due to the presence of estrogen, particularly during their childbearing years [2]. Approximately one-third of patients with SLE experience ocular manifestations, which often serve as indicators of overall systemic disease activity and morbidity [3]. SLE can involve any part of the eye. The most common ocular manifestation is keratoconjunctivitis sicca affecting 25% to 33% of individuals with SLE, typically resulting from secondary Sjögren’s syndrome. Retinal vasculitis affects 3% to 29% of cases as the second most common ocular manifestation associated with SLE. It can range from mild, nonspecific symptoms to severe visual impairment, potentially leading to organ-threatening complications [4]. Severe lupus retinopathy with multiorgan involvement with active disease usually correlates with poor prognosis in SLE [5].

A 37-year-old previously healthy man from Bangladesh presented with sudden, rapidly worsening bilateral vision loss for one week, which was progressive, painless, without redness, dryness, or photophobia. He was limited to counting fingers at two feet on his right eye, while the left eye measured 6/18. Color vision was also impaired bilaterally; however, visual fields remained intact. He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg and a regular pulse rate of 82 beats per minute. The systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score was 12 points and was driven by visual disturbance, low complement levels, and high deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding, categorizing the disease activity as moderate. Skin biopsy from skin lesion located on the upper back showed features of subacute cutaneous lupus.

On examination, pigmentation over the right side of the pinna was seen (Figure1). Fundoscopic examination showed bilateral cotton wool spots, more prominent in the right eye, along with arteriolar narrowing, vascular sheathing, subretinal hemorrhagic exudates, and scattered dot, blot, and flame-shaped hemorrhages (Figure2).

A woman of 33 years of age presented with sudden onset, progressive, painless dimness of vision for two weeks, more diminished on the left side, with vision reduced to counting fingers and not associated with any redness or any trauma. She also complained of a skin rash in different parts of the body for two years. The rash was insidious in onset, initially erythematous, elevated without any itching or pain, not associated with photosensitivity, and appeared during her pregnancy. Fifteen days before presentation, she experienced two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, each lasting two to three minutes, followed by unconsciousness, tongue biting, spontaneous urination, and 30 minutes of postictal confusion.

Eye examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/36 in the right eye and counting fingers on the left eye. Fundoscopic examination revealed bilateral cotton wool spots (Figure6).

ANA testing was positive at a high titer, displaying a dense fine speckled pattern on Hep-2 cells. The patient met the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE, with a total score of 23 points.

A 19-year-old female from Bangladesh was admitted to Bangladesh Medical University (BMU) with a two-month history of progressive, painless dimness of vision in both eyes, without redness, dryness, photophobia, headache, or double vision. She also reported intermittent low-grade fever for six months, accompanied by erythematous, painless, non-itchy rashes on the malar area and both ear pinnae, joint pain in small joints of hands and feet, and oral ulcers. Based on these symptoms and a positive ANA test, she was diagnosed with SLE by a dermatologist and started on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily and prednisolone 20 mg daily. But for the last two months, she developed eye symptoms. Later symptoms became worse with features of relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) seen on the left eye, and visual field was impaired on the left eye.

She was prescribed prednisolone 60 mg oral. But as her condition didn’t improve, she was referred to the rheumatology department. On examination, pigmented patches were noted over the malar area and ears without erythema. No clubbing or peripheral signs of infective endocarditis were present, and no active joint inflammation or deformities were observed. Her vital signs, including BP-110/70 mm Hg, were normal and had a SLEDAI-2K score of eight points, driven by visual disturbance, and categorized the disease activity as mild to moderate flare.

Eye examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/60 in the right eye and counting fingers at one foot on the left eye. Fundoscopic examination revealed active vasculitis with bilateral multiple cotton wool spots or soft exudates, and hemorrhage; profuse vitreal and pre-retinal hemorrhage on the left eye (Figure9).

The patient met the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE, scoring 14 points. In addition, SLEDAI-2K score was 8, primarily driven by visual disturbances. This score indicated mild to moderate disease activity.

Blood and urine cultures were negative in cases one and three. In case two, however, the urine culture revealed Escherichia coli growth. A comprehensive diagnostic workup included screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and tuberculosis. Rheumatologic evaluation ruled out Behçet’s disease, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and Sjögren’s syndrome in all three cases. Rheumatoid factor (RF) was notably positive at a high titer in case two. Initial investigations for each case are shown in Table1, and rheumatological investigation profiles are shown in Table2.

All patients were started on pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g per day) for three days, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) with a tapering regimen, and were simultaneously treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and i/v cyclophosphamide at the discretion of the rheumatology and ophthalmology teams. Both cases one and two were treated with IV methylprednisolone and IV cyclophosphamide and intravitreal Bevacizumab injection. Follow-up findings after one month for each of the cases are shown in Table3.

SLEDAI-2K: systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000.

Among the ocular manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most frequently observed are keratoconjunctivitis sicca, episcleritis, scleritis, and lupus retinopathy [6-7]. Among these, lupus retinopathy is notable for having the highest correlation with disease activity, as reflected by the SLEDAI [8]. However, despite its clinical significance, the current EULAR/ACR classification criteria do not include ocular manifestations as a distinct domain. Lupus retinopathy, reported in 3-29% of patients with SLE, is a well-established negative prognostic factor for overall survival [5]. In one of our patients, bilateral retinal vasculitis was the initial presenting manifestation of SLE-a rare and severe presentation. The spectrum of lupus retinopathy ranges from mild findings to more severe complications. Mild cases often exhibit cotton-wool spots, perivascular hard exudates, retinal hemorrhages, and increased vascular tortuosity. In moderate cases, additional findings such as focal or generalized arteriolar narrowing and dilated, tortuous veins may be seen. The most severe form of lupus retinopathy-vaso-occlusive retinopathy, which is characterized by occlusion of the retinal arterioles, resulting in retinal infarction or retinal vasculitis [7,9].

SLE-related retinopathy occurs through two primary pathophysiologic mechanisms. The first involves antiphospholipid antibodies inducing thrombosis in the retinal vasculature, potentially resulting in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The second pathogenic mechanism is classic lupus retinopathy, characterized by an immune complex-mediated vasculitis by releases inflammatory mediators, which initiate phagocytosis that exacerbate vascular damage [9]. Interestingly, all of our patients had normal antiphospholipid antibody levels. It has been reported by Montehermoso et al. [10] that up to 77% of SLE patients with lupus retinopathy or optic neuropathy have negative antiphospholipid serologies. This finding supports the notion that immunologic mechanisms independent of antiphospholipid antibodies can contribute to lupus-associated retinopathy. Clinically, patients with mild retinopathy may be asymptomatic, while those with severe disease often experience visual deterioration, distortion, and field defects [3]. Uniquely, vision loss was the sole presenting feature of SLE in one of our patients (case one), an atypical presentation.

Although vision loss as an initial symptom has been reported in several case studies [11-16]. Notably, most reported patients were female; only one prior case involved a male patient. In a study assessing ocular complications in SLE, 72% of eyes with lupus retinopathy demonstrated retinal neovascularization, with subsequent complications including vitreous hemorrhage in 63% of cases and retinal detachment in 27% [3]. One of our patients (case three) had vitreous haemorrhage in the left eye. The following case reports have shown the initial presentation of Retinal vasculitis in Table4.

The most common retinal manifestation of SLE is retinal microangiopathy, which typically presents with small intraretinal hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots [17]. In these cases, visual function improved following systemic corticosteroid therapy and adjunctive intraocular Bevacizumab injections. Lupus retinopathy is associated with a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and autoimmune hemolytic anemia [18,19]. One of our patients (case two) had neuropsychiatric manifestations before developing eye symptoms. Retinal vasculitis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) necessitates treatment directed at the underlying systemic disease. Given the severity of disease activity in our patient, high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, followed by oral glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Notably, the current EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE do not include lupus retinopathy, although the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 recognizes its contribution to overall disease activity.

Ocular disease can be the initial manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and may lead to various ocular complications. Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt management are crucial to prevent these complications. Treatment typically involves a combination of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs to control ocular manifestations. The primary goal of therapy is to achieve disease remission. Additionally, long-term follow-up is essential to monitor disease activity and manage any ongoing or emerging issues.
