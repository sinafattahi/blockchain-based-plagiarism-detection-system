Coal miners are exposed to a significant risk of anxiety and depression due to challenging work environment. However, there is a lack of studies comprehensively examining the associated factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among coal miners. Our study aimed to identify these associated factors among Chinese coal miners in Shanxi Province.

In August and September 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a cluster sampling method to enroll all workers from the L coal mines in Linfen City, China. Data were collected using a self-designed and administered online questionnaire, which included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 10-item (CESD-10) to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms, along with questions on sociodemographics, work-related factors, health status, and lifestyle factors. Logistic regression was used to identify associated factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using linear regression.

A total of 1,027 participants were included in the analysis. Among them, 278 (27.07%) exhibited anxiety symptoms, and 238 (23.17%) showed depressive symptoms. In the multivariable logistic regression, associated factors identified for both anxiety and depressive symptoms included having direct or indirect safety accident experience (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for anxiety: 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 ~ 2.40; aOR for depression: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.25 ~ 2.38), presence of occupational diseases (aOR for anxiety: 4.00, 95% CI: 1.51 ~ 11.10; aOR for depression: 3.36, 95% CI: 1.25 ~ 9.23), self-reported non-optimal health status (aOR for anxiety: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.19 ~ 2.37; aOR for depression: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.41 ~ 2.85), current alcohol consumption (aOR for anxiety: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.27 ~ 2.66; aOR for depression: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.12 ~ 2.41), and sleep duration of less than 7 hours (aOR for anxiety: 1.84, 1.36 ~ 2.50; aOR for depression: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.25 ~ 2.36). In addition, working in a management position (aOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.02 ~ 3.96) was positively associated with anxiety symptoms.

Our study identified key factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among Chinese coal miners. Management was more likely to experience anxiety symptoms. These findings underscore the need for targeted mental health interventions within the coal mining industry to improve their well-being.

Mental health has emerged as a significant public health challenge [1]. Recent estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that approximately one billion people worldwide suffer from a range of mental disorders, with anxiety and depression being the most common [2]. Despite this growing awareness, certain occupational groups remain at heightened risk for these two common mental health disorders due to their unique occupational attributes [3,4], highlighting the need for targeted research to understand and mitigate these risks effectively. Among such groups, coal miners are particularly vulnerable, with an increased risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to the general population [5–7]. In the United States, a 2021 study on former coal miners reported that the prevalence of both anxiety and depressive symptoms was approximately 38% [5], notably higher than the 18.2% for anxiety and 21.4% for depression observed in the general population [8]. Similarly, a Chinese study found that 51.1% and 60.5% of coal miners experienced anxiety and depressive symptoms [9], significantly exceeding the 12.89% and 24.82% observed in the general population [10].

Coal miners face severe mental health challenges due to the unique and hazardous nature of their occupation, characterized by a harsh working environment, extreme job stress, and social isolation [7]. A previous literature review identified three main categories of factors highly associated with mental health outcomes and potentially modifiable: personal factors, work and organizational factors, and health-related factors [7]. Personal factors include sociodemographic characteristics such as male workers, limited educational attainment, and lower incomes. Work and organizational factors include the hazardous working conditions of coal mining, such as prolonged exposure to coal dust, extreme temperatures, and high noise levels, as well as psychosocial stressors like excessive job demands, irregular shifts, and prolonged separation from family and community. Health-related factors include a high risk of respiratory diseases, widespread smoking and alcohol consumption, and limited access to psychological support services. Therefore, identifying and addressing these coal mining-specific factors is crucial to improving the mental health of coal miners.

China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of coal [11]. However, the Chinese market has been shifting toward cheaper wind and solar power generation in recent years, which makes mines scheduled for closure, and coal miners face a high risk of losing their jobs [12]. Studies suggest that individuals who remain employed and hold higher expectations of job loss have an increased risk of depressive symptoms due to the impact of job insecurity [13,14]. The mental health of coal miners not only affects individual well-being but also impacts workplace productivity, occupational safety, and family stability [15–17]. In such contexts, it is necessary to focus on the mental health of Chinese coal miners and identify adjustable factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that sociodemographic, work-related, health status, and lifestyle factors are significantly associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among coal miners. This study aimed to explore these associations among coal miners in Linfen City, Shanxi Province, where coal mining serves as the main industry in China.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in one of the largest coal mines (abbreviated as L) in Linfen City, Shanxi Province, from August to September 2022, given the accessibility and availability of data. A cluster sampling method was employed and all workers in the selected L coal mine were invited for participation. In this study, the inclusion criteria were: [1] age≥18; [2] having at least one year of work experience in coal mines. A self-designed and administered online questionnaire (see Supplementary File 1) was used to collect data through Wen Juan Xing (a widely utilized professional online survey platform in China:http://www.wjx.cn)(18). To ensure the accuracy, relevance, and clarity of the questionnaire, consultations were conducted with experts in public health during the design stage. Before the official investigation, interviews with five coal miners were conducted to evaluate the understanding and applicability of the questionnaire content. Furthermore, the online questionnaire was tested to validate its suitability for online use. The workforce at the L coal mine comprises a total of 1,300 workers, and our study eventually received 1,027 valid completed questionnaires, achieving a valid completion rate of 91.61%. The flow chart of the study participant selection is shown in Fig.1.

The Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) was utilized to assess anxiety symptoms. The instrument has demonstrated strong reliability and validity across the Chinese population [19]. The scale consists of seven items, each rated on a four-point Likert scale based on the frequency of symptoms or feelings experienced over the past two weeks. The scoring options are assigned as follows: 0 for “not at all”, 1 for “several days”, 2 for “more than half the days”, and 3 for “nearly every day”. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms [20]. In this study, a cut-off point of ≥ 6 was used to indicate the presence of anxiety symptoms, based on findings from a clinical validation study conducted in China, which demonstrated that this threshold achieved optimal sensitivity (91%) and specificity (71%) for distinguishing anxiety symptoms between the general population and psychological outpatients [19]. In our study, the Cronbach’s α was 0.93, indicating excellent internal consistency [21].

The Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 10-item (CESD-10) was used to assess depressive symptoms The assessment tool has exhibited robust reliability and validity within the Chinese population [22]. The scale consists of ten items, each rated on a four-point Likert scale assessing the frequency of the respondent’s feelings over the last week. Scoring on the CESD-10 assigns 0 for “Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)”, 1 for “Some or a little of the time (1 ~ 2 days)”, 2 for “Occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3 ~ 4 days)”, 3 for “Most or all of the time (5 ~ 7 days)”. Reverse scoring is applied to items 5 (“I felt hopeful about the future”) and 8 (“I was happy”) [23]. The total score ranges from 0 to 30 points, with a cut-off score of 10, which indicates depressive symptoms and is widely used and validated in various studies [23,24]. In our study, the Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.82, indicating excellent internal consistency [21].

Sociodemographic factors in the study included sex (men, women), age, household registration (urban, rural), marital status (married, unmarried), education (middle school or below, vocational school, high school, college/university or above), and average family monthly income in 2022. The income levels were grouped into five categories: < 3,000 RMB (equivalent to less than $441.83 in 2022), 3,000–5,000 RMB ($441.83-$736.67), 5,000–8,000 RMB ($736.67-$1,178.20), 8,000–10,000 RMB ($1,178.20-$1,472.75), ≥ 10,000 RMB (≥$1,472.75).

Work-related factors included the type of work (underground front-line workers, underground support workers, ground workers, management, or others), the number of years worked, and direct or indirect safety accident experience (yes or no). Specifically, within the type of work, underground front-line workers mainly include digger workers, tunneling workers, and drilling workers, who are directly engaged in the extraction of the coal mine. Underground support workers primarily consist of mechanical and electrical workers, transportation workers, water detection workers, mining preparation workers, and safety workers, who support the front-line workers through various specialized services. Ground workers typically handle tasks on the mining site’s surface, such as material transportation, equipment maintenance, and administrative duties. Management encompasses roles such as mine managers, supervisors, and other administrative personnel responsible for decision-making and organizational management. Others include a diverse range of occupations not captured by the previous groups and may include consultants, technical experts, or others. About safety accident experience, direct safety accident experience is personal safety accident experience and indirect safety accident experience is learning that family members or friends experienced safety accidents.

Health status factors included self-reported professionally diagnosed occupational diseases and chronic diseases (yes or no), self-reported health status (good, or non-optimal), and body mass index (BMI) group. BMI group was calculated as self-reported weight in kg divided by the square of self-reported height in meters, and it was further categorized into three levels (underweight: <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight: 18.5 ~ 23.9 kg/m2, overweight and obesity: ≥24 kg/m2) [25].

Lifestyle factors included smoking status (never smoking, current smoking, or ever smoking), alcohol consumption (never alcohol consumption, current alcohol consumption, or ever alcohol consumption), and sleep duration (< 7 hours, or ≥ 7 hours).

All continuous variables complied with skewed distribution and were reported as median with interquartile ranges (IQRs). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables, while Pearson’s Chi-squared (χ²) test or Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate differences in categorical variables.

Univariable logistic regression analyses were initially used to assess the associations of individual factors with symptoms of anxiety or depression. Then, multivariable logistic regression was employed to assess the associations of sociodemographics, work-related factors, health status, and lifestyle factors with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in the logistic regression analyses.

A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine whether changes in the distributional assumptions of the outcomes affected the observed associations [26–28], thereby ascertaining the reliability and robustness of the main results. In this analysis, anxiety and depressive symptoms were treated as continuous outcome variables, and univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were employed. Standardized Coefficient Beta () with 95% CIs were estimated to assess the associations.

Stata MP 16.0 and R 4.3.2 were used to analyze the data. Allp-values in this study were two-tailed, withp< 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Ethicals approval for the study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health, Zhejiang University Number ZGL202206-3. Informed consent was presented on the first page of the online questionnaire, and participants were required to read it and voluntarily participate before beginning the survey.

A total of 1,027 participants completed the questionnaire, and their basic characteristics are shown in Table1. Among all participants, 278 (27.07%) exhibited anxiety symptoms, while 749 (72.93%) did not. Significant differences were observed between the groups with and without anxiety symptoms across several factors, including household registration, education, type of work, number of years worked, direct or indirect safety accident experience, occupational diseases, self-reported health, alcohol consumption, and sleep duration (allp< 0.01).

Regarding depressive symptoms, 238 (23.17%) of participants had depression, while 789 (76.83%) of participants had no depressive symptoms. The groups with and without depressive symptoms showed significant differences in the same factors as those with anxiety. Additionally, the presence of chronic diseases differed significantly between those with and without depressive symptoms (Table1).

Supplementary Table1(sTable 1) presents the results of the univariable logistic regression analysis investigating factors associated with anxiety symptoms. Negative associations were found with being from rural areas and having a lower educational level. Working in management, longer years worked, having direct or indirect safety accident experience, presence of occupational diseases, self-reported non-optimal health status, current alcohol consumption, and sleep duration of less than 7 hours had higher ORs of anxiety symptoms.

The results from multivariable logistic regression analysis for anxiety symptoms are shown in Table2. After adjusting for potential confounders, significant positively associated factors with anxiety were working in management (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.02 ~ 3.96), having direct or indirect safety accidents experience (aOR: 1.76, 1.29 ~ 2.40), presence of occupational diseases (aOR: 4.00, 1.51 ~ 11.10), self-reported non-optimal health status (aOR: 1.68, 1.19 ~ 2.37), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 1.83, 1.27 ~ 2.66), and sleep duration of less than 7 hours (aOR: 1.84, 1.36 ~ 2.50).

The sensitivity analysis for univariable linear regression regarding anxiety symptoms is shown in sTable 2. The results are similar to our main results. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that age (: −0.04, −0.07 ~ 0.00) was negatively associated with anxiety symptoms (Table3), an association not observed in the primary results.

The univariable logistic regression analysis showed that most factors associated with depressive symptoms, both negatively and positively, were similar to those associated with anxiety symptoms. However, the presence of chronic diseases was found to be positively associated with depressive symptoms (sTable1).

Table2displays the results from multivariable logistic regression analysis for depressive symptoms After adjusting for potential confounders, significant positively associated factors with depressive symptoms were having direct or indirect safety accidents experience (aOR: 1.72, 1.25 ~ 2.38), presence of occupational diseases (aOR: 3.36, 1.25 ~ 9.23), self-reported non-optimal health status (aOR: 2.01, 1.41 ~ 2.85), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 1.64, 1.12 ~ 2.41), and sleep duration of less than 7 hours (aOR: 1.71, 1.25 ~ 2.36).

The results of sensitivity analysis are generally consistent with our primary findings, although some differences were observed in the multivariable linear regression (Table3). Negative associations were found with age (: −0.05, −0.09~−0.01). Having an average family monthly income between 3,000 and 5,000 RMB (: 0.86, 0.19 ~ 1.50), larger than 8000 RMB (: 1.20, 0.19 ~ 2.10) and the presence of chronic diseases (: 2.60, 0.78 ~ 4.30) were identified as factors positively associated with depressive symptoms.

Our study comprehensively investigated the factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression among Chinese coal miners, including sociodemographic, work-related, health status, and lifestyle factors. In our study, 27.07% of participants exhibited anxiety symptoms, while 23.17% of participants showed depressive symptoms. Having direct or indirect safety accident experience, presence of occupational diseases, self-reported non-optimal health status, current alcohol consumption, and sleep duration of less than 7 hours were factors positively associated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms in the adjusted model. Additionally, working in management was positively associated with anxiety symptoms.

In our study, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among coal miners was higher than in the general population [10]. However, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among coal miners in our study was lower than that reported in previous studies. For instance, a large survey on the mental health of coal miners in the United States reported a prevalence of 38.9% for anxiety symptoms and 37.4% for major depressive disorder [5]. Differences in survey timing, diagnostic screening tools, and study populations may be the main reasons for the inconsistencies in the rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms across studies. Particularly, our survey was conducted from August to September, a period of low demand in the coal market, leading to lighter mining tasks and reduced work pressure on coal miners. Previous studies have shown that increased work pressure can have a negative impact on workers’ mental health [29]. During the period of our study, the relatively lower work pressure on coal miners may have been one of the main reasons for the lower prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms observed in our findings.

Our study found no significant associations between sociodemographic factors and symptoms of anxiety and depression in our main analysis. Regarding the age variable, while our logistic regression analysis showed no significant association between age and symptoms of anxiety and depression, a negative association was observed in sensitive analysis using linear regression. This finding is consistent with previous studies in coal miners that have used similar analysis methods [9]. As for the sex and marital status variables, we did not find the expected differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms. This finding aligns with another study that investigated factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among coal miners in China. A potential reason for the lack of observed differences might be that the sample was drawn solely from one coal mine and included only a very small number of female and unmarried individuals. The significant disparity in the distribution of the small sample may prevent the findings from being extrapolated [30]. Notably, we observed that higher income levels were positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, which contrasts with some previous studies [7]. Underground miners and managers in the Chinese coal mining industry typically earn higher incomes. However, their jobs also involve higher risks and more stress, which may increase their risk of experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms. In conclusion, these findings’ inconsistencies could be attributed to cultural, racial, and ethnic differences across populations, variations in measurement tools and diagnostic criteria, as well as differences in study design and statistical methodology [31,32]. Therefore, future research with a broader and more nationally representative sample is warranted to better understand these relationships.

One work-related factor, having direct or indirect safety accident experience, was significantly positively associated with both symptoms of anxiety and depression. Previous studies found that individuals who had work-related accident experiences are more likely to suffer from mental disorders [33–35]. Such accidents often lead to occupational injuries, which may cause disability [36], difficulty returning to work [34], and financial burdens [37]. These consequences can disrupt workers’ financial well-being and increase their concerns about the future, potentially leading to a higher risk of mental disorders [34]. Furthermore, mining-related accidents are potentially traumatic events that can profoundly influence an individual’s stress response mechanisms [38], cognitive integrity, and emotional regulation [35]. The psychological impact of such incidents can result in both short-term and long-term effects on mental health [35]. Based on these findings, we suggest implementing comprehensive safety training programs, providing psychological support services, and conducting regular mental health screenings to enhance coal miners’ safety awareness and facilitate the early detection and management of mental health issues, which can help reduce the long-term psychological impact of work-related accidents.

In addition, we found that working in a management position was positively associated with anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. Owing to the occupational characteristics specific to the field, previous studies have predominantly focused on the mental health of underground coal miners, with less attention given to the mental health of managers. A study in Australia found managers in the coal mining industry were more likely to report higher levels of psychological distress [39]. This may be attributed to the high levels of accountability and the possibility that managers do not always receive necessary work support [39].

Regarding health status factors, we observed that coal miners with occupational diseases were more likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety and depression. This observation is consistent with previous research that connects common occupational diseases, such as pneumoconiosis [40] and musculoskeletal disorders [41], with a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Additionally, a study from China found that coal miners exposed to occupational hazards experienced nearly 1.4 times the level of job stress and were nearly 1.5 times more likely to suffer from psychological health issues compared to those without such exposure [42]. This highlights the critical importance of preventing occupational diseases in the coal mining industry, given their profound implications for both physical and mental health. Therefore, it is essential to implement regular health check-ups to detect early signs of occupational diseases, enhance workplace safety standards to reduce exposure to hazardous conditions, and provide targeted mental health support for those affected by occupational illnesses.

Besides, we observed that individuals who reported non-optimal health status were more likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with a good self-reported health status. Self-reported health status represents individuals’ perceptions of their physical health. Prior studies have found that physical health can have both direct and indirect effects on mental health through underlying factors such as life style, biological factors, socioeconomic status, and social capital [43,44]. The observed association between self-reported health status and symptoms of anxiety and depression underscores the need for regular health assessments in the coal mining population.

As for life style factors, our results indicated that current drinking status was positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, consistent with prior findings [7,45]. The causality between alcohol consumption and mental health is complex; it is uncertain whether alcohol use leads to deteriorated health status and increased psychological distress, or whether individuals with heightened distress drink alcohol as a coping mechanism. Notably, the coal mining industry is characterized by high levels of alcohol consumption, despite workplace policies aimed at restricting it [46,47]. For instance, an Australian study found that alcohol use among miners significantly exceeds the national average [48]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop targeted health promotion programs tailored specifically for the coal mining industry to address this issue effectively [48]. Furthermore, despite the high prevalence of smoking observed, no association between smoking status and symptoms of anxiety and depression was supported, as reported in previous studies [7,45]. A potential explanation may be that smoking is a normalized health risk behavior in the coal mining population [49], as opposed to the general population, potentially obscuring its impact on mental health symptoms in this specific group.

Sleep duration is also a lifestyle factor linked to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Shift work schedules in the coal mining industry typically result in coal miners having irregular sleep patterns, short sleep durations, and poor sleep quality. Our study showed that coal miners who sleep less than 7 hours are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depressive symptoms. Prior research found a positive association between self-reported short sleep duration and the prevalence of ongoing psychological disorders [50]. Shorter sleep duration may contribute to increased inflammation, which is a factor associated with various mental disorders [51,52].

This study has some strengths. Our study comprehensively examined a range of factors, including sociodemographic, work-related, health status, and lifestyle factors, associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among Chinese coal miners. Additionally, the study has been updated with the latest evidence on factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among coal miners.

There are also several limitations. Firstly, the cross-sectional study design makes it difficult to determine the causal relationships between factors and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Additionally, the lack of a validity and reliability study for the online questionnaire used in this study may limit the accuracy and consistency of the data collected, potentially affecting the strength of the observed associations. Next, given that our study population was drawn exclusively from a single coal mine, primarily due to practical considerations, the scope of our study may be restricted, and the generalizability of our findings to the broader coal miner population may be limited. The presence of contradictory results suggests that further research with a larger sample size is necessary to clarify these associations. Moreover, the use of self-reported variables potentially affects the observed associations. Additionally, the cut-off points used to screen for anxiety and depressive symptoms in coal miners were based on studies conducted in the general population, which may reduce the accuracy of symptom identification in our study. Furthermore, we did not conduct a robustness analysis with different cut-off points due to the small sample size. As a result, this could influence our findings related to associated factors, suggesting the need for further research specifically targeting the coal miners.

Our study revealed the key associated factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Chinese coal miners. These factors include having safety accident experience, presence of occupational diseases, self-reported non-optimal health status, current alcohol consumption, and sleep duration of less than 7 hours, all of which were positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Coal workers in management were found to be more likely to exhibit anxiety symptoms. Our study highlights the need for targeted mental health interventions in the coal mining industry to improve worker well-being for future research and practices.
