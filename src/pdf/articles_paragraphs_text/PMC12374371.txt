Motor competence (MC) plays a fundamental role in physical development and the acquisition of complex motor skills during early childhood. Moreover, the type of instructional method can significantly influence both the trajectory and the quality of this learning process. Accordingly, the present study aimed to examine the role of MC in learning the futsal shooting skill under three different instructional approaches, Linear Pedagogy (LP), Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP), and Differential Learning (DL), in preschool children.

Ninety-six healthy children (mean age = 6.06 ± 0.20 years) were assessed for MC using the BOT-2SF and subsequently categorized into high and low competence groups. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of six instructional groups. The study design included a pre-test, ten training sessions, a post-test, a retention test, and a transfer test. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA and LSD post hoc tests.

The results revealed that both instructional method and MC level had a significant impact on learning, retention, and transfer of the futsal shooting skill (p< 0.001). The NLP outperformed the other methods in all test phases. Additionally, children with higher MC consistently achieved better performance across all instructional methods. Ultimately, the combination of high MC and NLP produced the most effective learning outcomes, indicating an optimal alignment between individual capability and instructional strategy.

Based on these findings, it can be concluded that MC not only facilitates the learning process but also influences how children respond to different teaching methods. These results can support the design of more targeted instructional and training programs in physical education, rehabilitation, and youth sports. Furthermore, future research is encouraged to explore the long-term effects and broader applicability of these methods across various ages, cultural contexts, and motor skills.

Motor competence (MC), which includes stability, locomotion, and object control skills, forms the foundation for more complex motor behaviors [1]. According to Stodden et al. (2008), it is strongly associated with physical activity levels, overall health, and quality of life, particularly in childhood [2]. These observations align with developmental models that emphasize the progressive nature of motor development, most notably Seefeldt’s (1980) framework, which posits that early mastery of fundamental motor skills like running and jumping is essential for advancing to more refined and specialized movements [3]. Within this context, the Proficiency Barrier theory provides a critical extension. It suggests that children who do not reach an adequate level of MC during early development may face a barrier that prevents them from progressing to higher-level motor skills. This barrier underscores the importance of early motor development as a gateway to later skill acquisition, supporting the view that interventions in early childhood are crucial not only for physical outcomes but also for long-term personal, social, and athletic development [4].

Individuals with higher MC may have better control over their movements, allowing them to learn new patterns more quickly and apply them in different situations. Supporting this claim, the studies, demonstrated that a minimum level of fundamental motor skills is essential for successfully learning and executing advanced skills such as ball control and shooting [5,6]. Brian et al., (2020) argue that this process occurs due to neural reorganization and the creation of more efficient pathways in the motor system, which help store new skills more stably in motor memory and apply them in various contexts [7]. These findings highlight the crucial role of MC in children’s motor learning, as delays in developing these skills can make acquiring more advanced abilities challenging. However, despite studies confirming this relationship, there is still a limited amount of experimental research in this area.

There have been limited studies on the impact of MC on skill acquisition. One such study was conducted by Maxwell et al., (2017), examining the relationship between motor ability and learning new skills in children. In this study, 261 children aged 9 to 12 were assessed, and those in the highest and lowest quartiles of MC participated in learning the golf putting skill under two conditions: implicit learning (error-free) and explicit learning (with errors). The results indicated that children with higher MC performed better under explicit learning conditions, whereas those with lower motor skills were more successful in implicit learning [8]. A more recent study by Costa et al., (2021) investigated whether MC influences the acquisition of complex sports skills. They divided 38 children aged 9 to 10 into two groups—high and low MC, and examined their learning of the overhead serve in volleyball under two training methods: random and combined (random-blocked). The results showed that only children with higher MC were able to progress from the pre-test to the retention test stage [9].

Although these two studies provide valuable insights into the role of MC in skill acquisition, both used training approaches based on the cognitive perspective and a Linear Pedagogy (LP) [10]. The cognitive approach to motor learning conceptualizes skill acquisition as a structured, sequential process in which learners form internal representations of ideal movements through repetition, demonstration, and prescriptive feedback [11]. Within this framework, the LP has long been a dominant instructional model, characterized by predetermined drills, gradual progression, and emphasis on reproducing a model technique [10]. While this method can help stabilize motor patterns, it has been criticized by the ecological dynamics perspective for limiting learner autonomy, reducing variability, and over-relying on external guidance [12]. Ecological dynamics perspective rooted in systems theory and nonlinear science, it shifts the focus from internal processing to dynamic interaction between the learner, the task, and the environment [13]. Learning in this context involves exploration, adaptability, and self-organization rather than imitating fixed models [14]. From this perspective, two contemporary instructional methods have gained traction. Nonlinear pedagogy (NLP), which manipulates task constraints to guide skill emergence, and Differential Learning (DL), which promotes constant movement variation without repetition. Both approaches aim to foster flexible and functional movement patterns adapted to the context [15]. Empirical studies have shown that, compared to the LP, NLP and DL methods can improve motor creativity, contextual adaptability, and injury prevention, particularly for injuries such as ACL tears [16,17]. These findings support the idea that variability and self-directed learning are crucial in developing robust and transferable motor skills.

Although LP, NLP, and DL all represent core frameworks in motor learning interventions, they differ in several fundamental ways—each with distinct implications for how skills are acquired, retained, and transferred. These differences have been comprehensively documented in previous studies [16–18]. However, in general, in the LP, the learning goal is clearly defined and accompanied by an ideal movement model, which the learner is instructed to replicate. While this promotes quick skill stabilization, it may reduce adaptability and creative problem-solving. In contrast, the NLP also operates with a defined goal but omits prescriptive models. Instead, it emphasizes manipulating task constraints to promote exploration, which enhances learners’ ability to adapt their movements to varied environments. The DL may not always state the goal explicitly but emphasizes constant variation and self-organization, fostering movement resilience and broader transfer. Regarding repetition, in the LP, repetition is structured and pre-planned by the coach. This can reinforce consistency but may hinder adaptability in novel contexts. In the NLP, repetition is indirectly shaped by the learner’s interaction with constraints. The DL eliminates repetition altogether—each trial differs—which helps develop robust motor patterns through variability. In terms of variability, LP introduces it later in the training process through minor adjustments (e.g., distance). In contrast, NLP includes variability from the start through systematic constraint manipulation. DL, however, is built entirely on variability, using non-repetitive and constantly shifting task conditions. Additionally, feedback plays a central role in LP, where the coach provides ongoing corrections to refine performance. While this can accelerate early learning, it often fosters dependency. In NLP and DL, external feedback is minimized to encourage self-guided discovery and decision-making—key components of adaptive learning, as also detailed in previous studies [16–18].

To clarify a commonly misunderstood distinction, it should be noted that, while both NLP and DL emerge from the ecological dynamics framework and emphasize variability, they differ in their underlying strategies [15]. NLP introduces variability through the systematic manipulation of task, environmental, or individual constraints. For example, altering object size or playing surface to encourage exploration. It relies on representative learning designs that closely resemble real-world performance. In contrast, DL deliberately introduces random and non-repetitive variations in movement patterns, even including incorrect or exaggerated actions, to destabilize habitual responses and promote self-organization [18]. The key distinction is that NLP still preserves a structured goal-directed context, whereas DL removes repetition entirely and embraces unpredictability as a tool for deeper motor adaptability [15]. Given that even small differences in practice design can produce significant effects in motor learning, a detailed comparison of these three approaches is essential. Understanding their nuances can provide deeper insights into optimizing instructional strategies, especially in early childhood motor development.

The aim of this study is to examine the role of MC in learning futsal shooting skills under three instructional approaches: LP, NLP, and DL. The significance of this research can be explained from several scientific and practical perspectives. First, although previous studies have explored the influence of MC on skill acquisition, a comprehensive comparison of modern instructional approaches, such as NLP and DL, with the traditional LP has not yet been conducted. This research gap highlights the need to assess the effectiveness of these methods in learning motor skills like futsal shooting. Second, most past studies have focused on older children, while investigating this issue in younger children is crucial, as early identification of the impact of different teaching methods can enhance learning processes and lead to effective early interventions. Third, while comparisons of these instructional approaches have been made in areas such as motor creativity and ACL injury prevention, their role in acquiring a specific skill like futsal shooting still requires further empirical evidence. Furthermore, understanding how MC levels influence performance across different instructional methods could help in designing tailored training programs based on individual athlete characteristics. Finally, shooting is considered a fundamental motor skill that plays an essential role in the development of children’s MC and physical literacy. Its mastery enhances motor control, coordination, and movement confidence, which are key predictors of sustained engagement in physical activities. Conversely, deficits in this skill may undermine motivation and participation, highlighting the need to explore effective instructional approaches that support its acquisition from an early age [19,20]. Therefore, investigating different instructional methods for learning futsal shooting, particularly among children with varying levels of MC, could contribute to improved motor development and increased long-term sports participation.

Given that children with higher MC generally demonstrate more precise motor control, better coordination, and more efficient processing of motor information, they are expected to perform better in learning futsal shooting skills, regardless of the instructional method. Additionally, NLP are anticipated to be more effective than the LP, particularly for children with higher levels of MC. This prediction is based on the idea that NLP provide dynamic learning environments that support exploration, self-regulation, and adaptation, allowing learners to make use of their individual capabilities more fully. In such environments, children with advanced MC are more likely to benefit from the diversity of practice opportunities and exhibit greater improvements in performance. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the interaction between MC level and instructional method will significantly influence learning outcomes, with the highest gains expected in children with high MC trained through NLP. Moreover, the NLP may be particularly well-suited for children with varying levels of MC, as it enables individualized learning through task constraint manipulation rather than relying on fixed instructional models. This flexibility encourages adaptation, which can better accommodate differences in learners’ motor abilities and learning needs.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of MC in learning futsal shooting skills under three instructional approaches: LP, NLP, and DL. The study included six groups: (1) LP group-high MC (LP-HMC), (2) LP group-low MC (LP-LMC), (3) NLP group-high MC (NLP-HMC), (4) NLP group-low MC (NLP-LMC), (5) DL group-high MC (DL-HMC), and (6) DL group-low MC (DL-LMC). The study consisted of a pre-test, 10 intervention sessions, a post-test, a retention test, and a transfer test with increased distance.

The participants of this study were preschool children (six years old), both boys and girls. A priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power software version 3.1.9.2 to estimate the required sample size for a mixed-design ANOVA with 6 groups and 4 repeated measurements. The analysis assumed a medium effect size (EF = 0.25), an alpha level of 0.05, and statistical power of 0.95, which are standard parameters for behavioral research [21–23]. Accounting for a 20% dropout rate and to accommodate common dropout rates in behavior-related studies [24], resulting in a target sample size of 90 participants (15 per group), which was sufficient to maintain statistical power. However, since more children initially volunteered and met the inclusion criteria, a total of 96 children ultimately participated in the study (Fig.1). The demographic information of the participants is given in Table1. The inclusion criteria included: (1) physical and mental health based on the health and medical records available at the kindergarten, (2) no prior participation in football or futsal training, and (3) written informed consent from parents. The exclusion criteria included: (1) initial diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder based on the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test, (2) failure to participate in any stage of the study, and (3) parental withdrawal of consent to continue the intervention process.

This study was conducted in full accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Damghan University (Approval Code: IR.DU.REC.1404.003). Written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants. For participants under 18 years of age, written assent was obtained from the minors along with written informed consent from their parents or legal guardians. The research was carried out in Izmir, Turkey, with strict adherence to confidentiality and data protection protocols.

The futsal shooting assessment was conducted across all four test phases in accordance with previous studies [25]. As illustrated in Fig.2a, participants performed a total of 35 shots towards the goal from Positions 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, five stationary futsal balls were shot towards the goal following a short approach from Position 1. Another five shots were executed from Position 1 after 10 m of dribbling. From Position 2, participants dribbled for 5 m before taking five shots at the goal. Additionally, five shots were performed from Position 1 after receiving a pass from the right, and another five shots were taken after 5 m of dribbling from Position 3. Furthermore, five shots were executed from Position 1 following a pass from the left. Finally, 5 shots were attempted from Position 1 after clearing a 40-cm obstacle with a vertical jump.

The scoring of the test was conducted based on Fig.2b, where the lowest possible score for each shot was 1 and the highest score was 6. In accordance with Oftadeh et al., (2021) [25], the final performance score was calculated as the mean score across all 35 shots. In the Fig.2b, instead of numbers, there were animal shapes, and the children were told that if they hit the rabbit (for example), they would get 6 points. This task was exactly the same in all groups in terms of shape, size, and type of instructions. This tool and implementation method have been previously studied and used by colleagues. This tool and implementation method have been studied and used by Oftadeh et al., (2021). Previous studies have also used this method of futsal shot assessment, which shows its high validity and reliability [26].

Futsal shooting performance was evaluated using a reported scoring protocol that emphasized shot accuracy and target placement. Standardized visual markers were used to define the targets, ensuring consistent conditions across all participants. Two trained evaluators independently scored all attempts live based on predefined scoring criteria. The inter-rater reliability assessment using Cohen’s kappa showed a high agreement of 0.87, indicating high reliability. In cases of disagreement, the score provided by the more experienced evaluator was used. This procedure ensured objectivity and accuracy in assessing shooting performance. The assessment structure was adapted from previous studies involving futsal in preschool children [25].

To evaluate MC, the short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP-2SF) [27], developed for 4 to 21 year old participants, was used. The BOTMP-2 is a standardized and individually administered test battery to measure MC, consisting of 53 items in the full version or 14 items in the short form. Items are organized into four motor area composites: (a) fine manual control (fine motor precision and fine motor integration e.g. drawing lines through paths), (b) manual coordination (manual dexterity and upper-limb coordination, e.g. dribbling a ball), (c) body coordination (bilateral coordination and balance, e.g. standing heel-toe on a beam), and (d) strength and agility (running speed, agility, and strength, e.g. hopping on one leg). Its maximum Total Point Score (or raw score) is 88, and its range of standard score is 20–80. The participants were evaluated strictly according to the guidelines of the BOTMP-2SF manual [28]. The point scores of the four motor-area composite scores were combined in a total MC score and converted into an age and sex standardized MC score. These standardized overall score was submitted to the statistical analyses described below. The test has demonstrated validity and reliability, with a reliability coefficient of 90% for motor skills assessment. The retest reliability coefficients are 0.78 for the long form and 0.86 for the short form [27,28]. The short form assesses overall motor skills, with the total score reflecting a combination of gross and fine skills.

The test was completed in indoor facilities within the gym context. Before the actual test, and after length and weight had been measured, hand and foot preference was determined by means of a ball throwing and kicking task according to the BOTMP-2SF manual. After describing the purpose of each test, supplemented by additional verbal information or a demonstration if necessary, each participant was allowed one test trial for each test item. In addition, each test was video recorded from the anterior-posterior and media-lateral planes. After the test, a total score for each participant was obtained and reported. Two evaluator independently scored each participant in real life [29–32], and from the two data series, the inter-rater reliability assessment using Cohen’s kappa showed a high agreement of 0.87. However, if there was a difference in the scores of the first and second evaluator, the score of the first evaluator was used for further analysis due to the higher experience and expertise of the first researcher. A third evaluator calculated the point scores from the raw scores for each items, as well as the overall point score (range: 0–88 points). The second author converted the total point scores into standardized scores (range 20–80) according to the manual guidelines. According to the Broninek-Ozeretsky test, individual who scored a standard score above 50 (50th percentile rank) in MC were placed in the high MC group, while those who scored below 50 (between 34 and 50) were placed in the low MC group. According to this test, a standard score below the fifth percentile rank (20–33) is indicative of developmental coordination disorder. Therefore, participants in this study were selected based on having a percentile above the fifth percentile. The use of this test and its implementation method are similar to previous studies. Within the framework of the BOT-2SF, children who score below the 50th percentile are not considered clinically impaired, but may exhibit relative delays in motor development compared to their peers. While scores below the 5th percentile indicate a risk for developmental coordination disorder (DCD), those falling between the 5th and 49th percentiles are typically classified as having low but non-clinical MC [29–32].

To recruit participants, informational announcements were distributed widely across kindergartens throughout İzmir, and online groups related to kindergartens, without restriction to specific districts or socioeconomic areas. All kindergartens were invited to participate, and parents who saw the announcements and were interested in enrolling their children contacted the lead author. Participation was thus voluntary and based on parental response, not limited to selected schools. This approach allowed for broad outreach and reduced potential selection bias. Children who met the inclusion criteria were invited to an in-person screening session. MC was evaluated using the short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2). Participants scoring at or below the 5th percentile rank (i.e., a standard score of 33 or lower) were considered at risk for developmental coordination disorder. Therefore, only children who scored above the 5th percentile rank were included in this study. Children with high and low MC were randomly assigned to one of the three groups, LP, NLP, or DL.

Each group, LP, NLP, and DL, was trained by specialized coaches familiar with their respective instructional methods and experienced in working with children. Before the intervention, the coaches participated in separate training workshops led by the study authors to ensure that each instructional method was implemented according to its specific objectives. Additionally, during the training sessions, the lead author responsible for data collection randomly attended sessions to verify that the exercises aligned with the intended instructional approach [16,17]. The intervention consisted of 10 training sessions. Each session lasted one hour, including 15 min of general warm-up (running, muscle stretching) and cool-down, with the remaining 45 min dedicated to method-specific training [25,33,34]. The pre-test, post-test, retention test, and transfer test were conducted by two trained experts in futsal shooting assessment, following the standardized procedures outlined in Fig. S1, in the attachment file. To support engagement and focus among preschool participants, standardized visual targets (animal shapes such as a rabbit or lion) were printed and mounted on the goal surface in identical positions for all groups. These images served solely as visual markers to attract attention and were not involved in the scoring process. Scoring was based objectively on the location of ball impact, following a pre-defined and invisible grid behind the target wall. All assessments used futsal balls standardized for the children’s age, and the evaluators were blinded to group allocation, recording performance data based on coded identifiers.

To ensure that six-year-old participants could fully understand the training instructions in each group, we carefully adapted the verbal language and visual cues used during the sessions. Across all instructional approaches, animal-shaped targets (e.g., a rabbit) were attached to the goal area, and these were used consistently to provide a playful, familiar, and engaging reference point. However, the manner of instruction varied by group. In the LP, the coach said, “Look at me and see how I hit the rabbit with my ball—and now you do exactly the same.” This instruction was delivered in a demonstration-based and imitative format, accompanied by simple verbal language, short sentences, and repetition as needed. Children were also encouraged to ask for clarification if they did not understand. These adjustments were purposefully implemented to make the cognitive load manageable for young learners. In the NLP, the coach said, “Try to hit the rabbit with your ball,” without demonstrating a specific technique. This open-ended instruction encouraged exploration without requiring the child to process detailed or technical language. Similarly, in the DL, the instruction might be, “Hit the rabbit using the inside of your foot,” with each trial involving a playful variation. Across all conditions, the language was deliberately simplified, and the instructions were anchored in age-appropriate visual contexts.

Participants trained in a designated hall at different times with their respective coaches. However, the scheduling ensured that the time intervals between the pre-test and the first session, the last session and the post-test, the post-test and the retention test, and the retention test and the transfer test remained consistent across all groups. The pre-test was conducted 24 h before the first training session, the post-test 24 h after the final session, the retention test 24 h after the post-test, and the transfer test 24 h after the retention test, with an additional 50 cm increase in shooting distance at each position. After data collection, the lead author entered the data into Excel and forwarded it to the author responsible for statistical analysis. It is noteworthy that all participants received a sports T-shirt from the authors upon study completion.

In the LP, a cognitive approach to instruction was utilized [10]. Within this framework, the coach first explained the futsal shooting skill in detail. This explanation included information about the body parts involved, the correct kicking form, appropriate joint angles, foot positioning, and the proper technique for striking the ball. After this explanation, the coach demonstrated the correct shooting technique, and participants were asked to imitate it. Following the demonstration, participants began practicing, with the coach providing augmented feedback at each stage. This feedback could be either general for the group or individualized based on each participant’s performance. Each training session in this group included 45 min of focused skill practice. Each training session in this group included 45 min of focused skill practice. In this method, the coach would say, for example, to use the inside of your foot to hit the ball, and demonstrated the movement while explaining it. Following the demonstration, participants practiced the technique. The coach provided prescriptive and corrective feedback individually. For example, if a participant’s shot was weak, the coach might say, “Take a few steps back and strike the ball just as I showed you.” On average, each participant performed 30 to 35 shots per session. The emphasis was on replicating the demonstrated model with consistent conditions across repetitions [16–18].

In the NLP, training was conducted using the ecological dynamics framework and constraint manipulation [13,14,35]. The coach defined the goal—scoring in the goal—and asked participants to shoot without following a predetermined movement pattern. The coach observed the participants’ performances and modified constraints based on their errors. In this method, nor was prescriptive feedback provided; instead, only task-related instructions were given. For example, if a player used an incorrect part of the foot for shooting, the coach introduced a constraint that forced them to find a new solution, such as placing an obstacle to encourage using the correct part of the foot. Consequently, participants discovered more effective shooting strategies through exploration and experience [16–18]. Each session included 45 min of skill training. The coach began by stating the task goal, such as: “Try to get the ball into the goal.” Unlike the LP, no movement model was demonstrated. Instead, the coach manipulated constraints based on the learner’s behavior. For example, if a participant used their hand to direct the ball into the goal, the coach would not instruct them to use their foot, but might say: “You are allowed to use your hand.” This response created conditions that encouraged exploration and self-directed discovery [16–18]. Participants retained the same shot volume as in other groups (30 to 35 shots per session) but reached performance solutions through interaction with modified task conditions.

In the DL, players executed shots differently each time to maximize movement variability. To achieve this, the coach altered the shooting conditions in each repetition, such as using different parts of the foot (instep, inside foot, outside foot, heel), varying body positions (shooting while balanced, shooting while falling, shooting with one foot in the air), or modifying the environment (shooting with balls of different weights and sizes, shooting on uneven surfaces). Players could also practice under conditions such as facing a moving defender, being under time constraints, or receiving passes from unconventional angles. In this method, no repetition was identical to the previous one, and no ideal movement pattern was imposed. Instead, the goal was to enhance adaptability and strengthen the motor system by exposing participants to a broad range of shooting variations [16–18]. The DL group also received 45 min of training per session. Unlike the NLP group, no specific task goal was presented at the outset. Instead, the coach predefined and described how each trial should be executed using various, non-repetitive shot variations. For example, in one sequence, participants were instructed to shoot using: the tip of the right foot, then the tip of the left foot, then the inside of the left foot, followed by the inside of the right foot, and so on. This approach emphasized high variability without repetition, and each trial was deliberately different. Although execution instructions were clearly given, similar to the LP, no corrective feedback was provided. Moreover, no task goal was emphasized, in contrast to the NLP. Each participant completed 30 to 35 varied shots per session.

The analysis was carried out using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics, including mean and standard deviation, were computed for the studied variables. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to evaluate the normality of the data distribution. Changes in futsal shoot across groups were analyzed using a mixed repeated measures ANOVA, with LSD post hoc test applied for pairwise comparisons. Effect sizes (ES) were determined using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, and the magnitude of mean differences was interpreted based on standardized effect sizes. Cohen’s d thresholds were defined as: ≤0.20 for a “small” effect, 0.21–0.80 for a “medium” effect, and > 0.80 for a “large” effect. A significance level ofp< 0.05 was adopted for all statistical analyses. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

At the beginning of the study, no significant differences were observed between the groups in futsal shoot (P> 0.05) (Table2). Results from the Mixed repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Time (F(3, 249)= 546.09,p< 0.001, η² =0.473) as well as a significant Group × Time interaction (F(15, 249)= 28.77,p< 0.001, η² = 0.125). However, the Time × Gender (F(3, 249)= 0.222,p= 0.881, η² =0.001), and Time × Group ×Gender interaction was not significant (F(15, 249)= 1.50,p= 0.102, η² = 0.007).

The results of the LSD test for Group × Time interaction showed that there was no significant difference in the post-test between LP-LMC with DL-LMC (P= 0.06) (Table3), in the retention phase between NLP-LMC with DL-LMC (P= 0.09) (Table4), and in the transfer phase between LP-HMC with NLP-LMC (P= 0.494), LP-HMC with DL-LMC (P= 0.052), and NLP-LMC with DL-HMC (P= 0.097) (Table5). However, significant differences were observed in the other groups. See Tables2,3,4,5for more information.

Also, as shown in Fig.3, in the posttest phase, the NLP-HMC group had the highest score with a mean of 4.9776. The lowest score belonged to the LP-LMC group, with a mean of 2.2599 (NLP-HMC > DL-HMC > NLP-LMC > LP-HMC > DL-LMC > LP-LMC). In the retention phase, again the NLP-HMC group had the highest performance with a mean of 3.9505, while the LP-LMC group had the lowest mean score of 2.1424 (NLP-HMC > DL-HMC > LP-HMC > NLP-LMC > DL-LMC > LP-LMC). In the transfer phase, the NLP-HMC group once more showed the best performance with a mean of 3.8862, and the LP-LMC group had the lowest score of 1.7269 (NLP-HMC > DL-HMC > NLP-LMC > LP-HMC > DL-LMC > LP-LMC).

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of three instructional approaches, LP, NLP, and DL, on the acquisition of futsal shooting skills and to examine the role of MC in this process. The results showed that gender had no significant effect on learning outcomes, which was somewhat expected, as gender differences in motor development, performance, and skill acquisition are not yet pronounced at the age of six. Therefore, data from boys and girls were combined for analysis. The findings also revealed that the NLP was the most effective method for learning futsal shooting, while the LP had the least impact. Moreover, within all three instructional methods, children with higher MC consistently outperformed those with lower competence. Overall, the results suggest that NLP, by promoting exploration and flexibility during practice, and by manipulating tasks and environments based on individual characteristics, facilitates skill acquisition. In this context, MC appears to play a facilitating role, possibly because children with higher MC demonstrate better control and coordination of their movements, adapt more efficiently to changes in task demands, and engage more effectively with varied learning environments.

The findings of this study are consistent with previous research that has examined and confirmed the effects of MC and instructional method on skill acquisition. In this regards, Maxwell et al., (2017) [8], in a study on children learning golf putting, demonstrated that MC influenced how learners responded to different types of instruction—those with higher competence performed better under explicit learning, while children with lower competence benefited more from implicit learning. Costa et al., (2021) [9], focusing on volleyball serving, found that only children with high MC showed meaningful progress in skill retention. Although both studies emphasized the importance of underlying motor abilities, they were grounded in structured, cognitively-driven instructional contexts. Separately, research by [16–18], provided evidence for the advantages of NLP and DL in promoting motor creativity and reducing injury risk. However, these studies did not examine the acquisition of a specific technical skill. By integrating these two lines of inquiry, the current study offers a novel contribution: it simultaneously compares three contrasting instructional methods in the learning of a defined motor skill (futsal shooting), while also analyzing the moderating role of MC in young children. This multifaceted design represents the key innovation of the present research and expands our understanding of how individual capabilities interact with instructional conditions in early motor learning.

To interpret the findings of this study, it is essential to distinguish between two major theoretical perspectives in motor learning: the cognitive approach and the ecological dynamics framework. The cognitive approach views learning as the internal processing of information, formation of mental representations, and repetitive practice aimed at stabilizing an optimal movement pattern [10]. In contrast, ecological dynamics emphasizes the learner’s active engagement with the environment, discovering functional movement solutions, and adapting to changing constraints [14]. Instructional approaches such as NLP and DL stem from this ecological view and contrast with LP that rely on demonstration, imitation, and repetition of predetermined patterns [16]. The advantages of both NLP and DL over LP are grounded in their capacity to promote adaptive, exploratory learning rather than passive execution [15]. However, the NLP holds distinct advantages even over the DL. While DL emphasizes variability through constant movement variation, it often lacks a clear linkage to task goals or structure. In contrast, NLP manipulates constraints in a purposeful way—adjusting task space, speed, or equipment—to encourage exploration aligned with the intended performance outcome [16–18]. This targeted variability fosters functional flexibility and supports the emergence of effective and context-specific movement solutions. As such, the superior outcomes observed for the NLP in this study are consistent with its theoretical grounding and its ability to balance variability with goal-directed exploration.

One of the most innovative and notable findings of this study is the significant role of MC in the skill (futsal shot) acquisition process. The results revealed that, regardless of the instructional method, children with higher levels of MC consistently outperformed their peers with lower competence. This advantage likely stems from several interrelated factors. First, according to the model proposed by Stodden et al., (2008) [2], MC is not only an outcome of physical development but also a critical predictor of engagement in more complex motor tasks. In other words, foundational motor skills may serve as a platform that enhances the effectiveness of subsequent learning experiences. Second, children with higher MC generally exhibit more stable neuromuscular coordination, enabling quicker and more efficient adaptation to changing task and environmental demands [5,6,8]. Within the framework of ecological dynamics [14,36,37], such coordination supports self-organizing behavior—allowing individuals to dynamically adapt to the constraints of a task without external instruction. This capacity for spontaneous, functional adaptation facilitates the discovery of flexible and effective movement solutions. Consequently, children with higher competence are better equipped to interact with task constraints, generate meaningful variability in their actions, and engage in more robust learning processes. These interpretations align closely with the results of the present study, which demonstrated superior performance among high-competence children across all instructional methods.

Ultimately, the findings of this study revealed that children with high MC benefited more from the NLP in acquiring the futsal shooting skill compared to the other two methods. It appears that the NLP offers the greatest potential for leveraging children’s abilities. This method, which emphasizes the manipulation of constraints, fosters learning through self-organized and exploratory processes. For children with high MC, adapting to manipulated constraints is relatively easy, and they are able to take full advantage of task and environmental variations. In other words, these children are likely to discover more optimal movement solutions through their interaction with the environment. From this perspective, the NLP not only poses no difficulty for this group, but also provides a growth-enhancing platform that helps actualize their motor potential. Therefore, it can be argued that the synergy between individual characteristics and the type of instruction in this method significantly facilitates learning—an interaction less pronounced in other instructional approaches.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of the NLP for children with higher MC may also stem from the representative design principles inherent in ecological dynamics [14]. In NLP, practice tasks are designed to closely simulate real-world performance environments, enabling learners to attune to information-rich contexts and develop adaptable, functional behaviors. Children with higher MC are better equipped to exploit these representative environments, as they can perceive subtle task-relevant information and regulate their actions accordingly. Unlike DL, which focuses primarily on inducing variability through random perturbations, the NLP guides the learner within structured but dynamic environments that preserve the integrity of the performance context. This alignment between task design and perceptual-motor capacity may explain why higher-competence children thrive particularly well in nonlinear learning environments.

A notable strength of this study was the simultaneous investigation of MC alongside three distinct instructional approaches, an integration that has rarely been explored in previous research. This design enabled a deeper understanding of how individual differences interact with pedagogical methods in shaping motor skill acquisition. However, the study had several limitations. First, participants’ prior motor experience was not directly assessed. Although random assignment was used to balance this factor across groups, explicitly measuring previous motor exposure could have improved the precision of the findings. Second, the relatively short duration of the intervention may limit the interpretation of the results to the early stages of motor learning, as longer practice periods are generally needed for consolidation and transfer. Third, although the scoring method in the futsal shooting test was objective and standardized, we used animal-shaped visual targets to engage the young participants. While these visuals were identical across groups and not involved in scoring, we acknowledge that they may have introduced a minor attentional bias or altered the children’s focus during the task. Fourth, the intervention was conducted in a single educational facility, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other school contexts. Finally, while recruitment was open across the entire city of İzmir, and participants came from diverse kindergartens, the fact that all data were collected from a single city may reduce cultural or regional generalizability. Nevertheless, we attempted to mitigate this limitation by including children from a broad range of socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds.

The results of this study clearly demonstrated that both the type of instructional method and the level of children’s MC play a decisive role in learning the futsal shooting skill. These findings suggest that motor skill acquisition in childhood is not a uniform process, but rather a complex phenomenon influenced by the interaction between individual characteristics and the method of instruction. The results further indicate that a high level of MC is not merely a biological or developmental advantage, but a determining factor in the effective utilization of various instructional approaches. The significance of these findings lies in their emphasis on the critical role of MC in skill acquisition. In this regard, the applications of this research are numerous and multidimensional. In the field of physical education and primary instruction, the findings can assist teachers and coaches in adapting teaching methods to the motor readiness levels of students, thereby increasing the effectiveness of instruction. Additionally, in grassroots sports and talent identification, these results can inform the selection of educational strategies tailored to the individual characteristics of children and help optimize their developmental trajectory in sports.

Building on the present findings, future research should explore several key directions to deepen our understanding of motor skill acquisition in early childhood. First, since prior motor experience was not directly measured in this study, future investigations could incorporate standardized assessments or parent-reported histories of children’s previous physical activity and motor exposure. This would allow for more precise control of potential confounding variables. Second, longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the sustainability and transfer of learning achieved through different instructional approaches. Tracking how skills evolve over time and generalize to real-life sports settings would provide stronger evidence for the practical impact of these methods. Third, future research should be conducted across multiple educational or cultural contexts, and with a wider range of age groups and motor skills, to test the consistency and generalizability of the interaction between MC and instructional design. Including skills beyond object control—such as balance, rhythm, or whole-body coordination—could clarify whether the observed effects are skill-specific or more general. Fourth, the use of engaging visual targets (e.g., animal shapes) in this study was intended to increase attention and motivation in young children. Future studies could more systematically examine the cognitive and attentional impacts of such visual elements, potentially through methods such as eye-tracking or behavioral attention measures. Fifth, the application of modern motion analysis systems, neurophysiological tools (e.g., EEG, fNIRS), and brain imaging techniques may offer deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying motor learning in response to different instructional strategies. Such tools could reveal how children perceive, adapt to, and process task constraints at the neural level. Finally, examining these instructional approaches in special populations, such as children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), may support the design of targeted interventions to improve learning and participation in children with motor difficulties.
