Despite the wide variation in mosquito reproductive strategies and the present lack of behavioral and ecological information for the majority of described mosquito species, the predominant egg-laying behaviors observed in well-studied species have led to sweeping generalizations of oviposition patterns across entire mosquito genera. Mosquitoes in the genusCulex, which contains over 800 species across 28 subgenera, are commonly believed to exclusively lay egg masses (“rafts”) that float on the water surface. This oversimplification persists, though we currently know little regarding the reproduction of manyCulexspecies and subgenera. Using field observations, photography, and video recordings, we document the oviposition behavior of aCulexsubgenusMicraedesspecies,Culex antillummagnorum(Dyar), and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of aCulexspecies aerially and skip-ovipositing, rather than laying masses of coniform eggs. GravidCx. antillummagnorumfemales were observed and filmed in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico for several nights as they performed an elliptic flight pattern while launching single eggs into water-filled bracts ofHeliconia caribaea. These findings raise questions regarding the evolution and drivers of such an atypicalCulexbehavior and indicate that our understanding ofCulexecology and behavior remains incomplete.

Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are a remarkably diverse group of blood-feeding flies that possess distinct oviposition behaviors, host use patterns, and microhabitat associations that vary considerably among the 112 genera and 3,550 species currently recognized worldwide1–5. The continued study of these insects should be of great interest to researchers, not only due to the medical significance of some species (approximately 2.5% of all mosquito species are known vectors of medically important pathogens6but also for the fascinating adaptations and strategies that have enabled their widespread success7–9. Varied, often specialized oviposition behaviors among genera represent one such strategy that allows female mosquitoes to ensure larval survival and maximize subsequent offspring performance. Mosquitoes rely on numerous sensory cues, including chemotactile, visual, and olfactory signals, to evaluate the suitability of oviposition sites2,8. Once a gravid female locates a sufficient lentic body of water, the species-specific process of egg-laying typically involves one of several mechanisms. These include ovipositing a mass of eggs (“rafts”) on the water surface, depositing a single egg between different sites (directly on the water or above the waterline), attaching a cluster of eggs to submerged vegetation, launching single eggs into a water-filled container while in flight10,11, depositing eggs in clusters on wet ground or container surfaces where water is expected to collect, and even ovipositing the eggs onto the hindlegs12and carrying the eggs to an appropriate water source when ready to hatch2,8,13. The diversity of oviposition behaviors exhibited by mosquito species has allowed for successful larval development in a wide range of aquatic habitats across nearly every continent, except Antarctica4,14,15.

Despite the wide variation in oviposition strategies across the Culicidae, the predominant egg-laying behavior observed in well-studied species, particularly vectors of pathogens, has led to the generalization of these complex strategies across entire genera. A prime example is mosquitoes in the genusCulex, which contains > 800 species in 28 subgenera16. Several species ofCulexsubgenusCulexare the primary vectors of West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and other diseases. Within the genusCulex, these vector species (e.g.,Culex pipiens,Culex quinquefasciatus,Culex tarsalis) have remained the primary focus of research attention. Largely based on the oviposition habits of these medically important subgenusCulexspecies, it is commonly believed that all genusCulexspecies exclusively lay characteristic egg masses (“rafts”) that float on the water surface8,15,17–19. Even though oviposition of many subgeneraCulexspecies is poorly documented, this oversimplification persists8,15,17–22. Previous studies have found exceptions to theCulex“egg raft paradigm” and suggest that it must be contested and revised, while further concluding that an examination of understudiedCulexsubgenera (Anoedioporpa,Micraedes, andMicroculex, for example) will uncover a broader spectrum of oviposition behaviors in the genus18–20.

Throughout the 1970s, Mattingly19compiled anecdotal notes on mosquito eggs and documented examples that may contradict the conventionalCulexoviposition behavior. One particularly unusual case involvedCulex antillummagnorum(Dyar) (Fig.1), which is the most widely distributed mosquito species on the island of Puerto Rico23and has been documented on several other Caribbean islands24–26. This species is one of six in the subgenusMicraedes, a poorly studied group for which essentially no ecological or behavioral information is available14,19.Culex antillummagnorumlarvae can be found in both natural and man-made containers, where they filter feed on organic detritus and microorganisms, but they are most frequently collected from phytotelmata (plant-held aquatic microhabitats) such as bromeliad tanks, bamboo internodes, “malanga” (Colocasia esculenta) leaf axils, andHeliconia caribaeaflower bracts23,26,27. Until recently, the host associations ofCx.antillummagnorumwere unknown, but photographs from Reeves et al.28show adults feeding on two anole species,Anolis gundlachiandA.cristatellus, in Puerto Rico. From these observations, the species is now considered a candidate vector of the threePlasmodiumspecies known to circulate amongAnolislizard communities on the island.

(a) Adult femaleCulex antillummagnorum. The length of the long, slender palpi (0.35 of the proboscis) can be seen; this character is most often used to positively morphologically identify the species. (b)Cx. antillummagnorumlarvae collected from aHeliconia caribaeabract. The larvae possess coarse, stellate tufts of abdominal hairs, uniformly shaped antennae, and extremely long, thin siphons; the 4th instar larvae of the species are easily distinguished from other mosquito larvae found in Puerto Rico (Barrera). Both specimens collected in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico..

In his original note, Mattingly19was intrigued by the unusual egg morphology ofCx.antillummagnorum(Fig.4) and hypothesized that the species might display a mode of oviposition not previously documented inCulex: the emission of single eggs while hovering above a water-filled container. Skip-oviposition (a “bet hedging” oviposition strategy where female mosquitoes scatter eggs among various sites) has been observed inAnophelesspp.,Deinoceritesspp., and Aedini tribe species8. Oviposition in flight has only been reported inAnophelesspp8.,Toxorhynchitesspp11., andWyeomyiaspp1,29. and other species in the Sabethini tribe30. NoCulexspecies has been previously recorded ovipositing while in flight or is known to skip-oviposit8,11,14,19,29,30. Verifying this atypical mode of oviposition withinCulexwould raise compelling questions about the evolution and ecological drivers of such a behavior, as well as suggest that the understanding ofCulexegg-laying remains incomplete8,15,18,20.

The hydrophobicity of the eggs enables them to float horizontally on the water’s surface and move away in response to disturbance. (c) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image ofCx.antillummagnorumegg’s outer chorionic reticulum. Papilliform ornamentation is visible (damaged slightly from ethanol and transport); small projections cover the entire outer surface of the egg.

Preliminary sampling of natural containers, includingC. esculentaleaf axils,H. caribaeaflower bracts, epiphytic bromeliad tanks, and fallen palm spathes, throughout the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico showed higher numbers of larvalCx. antillummagnorumindividuals in the water-filled bracts ofH. caribaearacemes (Fig.6), suggesting a potential preference among gravid females for these oviposition sites in the LEF (data from natural container sampling were used to assess previous research and were not quantified). This finding aligned with research by Richardson et al.2and Yee23. GravidCx. antillummagnorumfemales were then observed and filmed for several nights as they deposited eggs withinH. caribaeabracts near El Verde Field Station in the LEF. With this study, we aimed to resolve the nearly 50-year-old question regarding the oviposition behavior ofCx. antillummagnorum, first raised by Mattingly19, and in doing so, learn more about this understudied species and candidate lizard malaria vector in Puerto Rico23,28. By conducting field observations and recording numerous videos of gravidCx. antillummagnorumin the LEF, we documented the first instance, to our knowledge, of aCulexmosquito aerially and skip-ovipositing.

As gravidCx. antillummagnorumapproached a bract of theH. caribaearaceme (typically between ca. 6:50 p.m. and 7:35 p.m.), they performed a sequence of rapid, elliptic flights directly above the bract (see Fig.2; Supplementary Video S1–S5). Once an adequate, water-filled bract was selected, the egg exited the gonotreme and was held on the tip of the ovipositing female’s abdomen, where it became visible. The egg would remain held in this position for several seconds throughout the execution of multiple flight loops. The female would then launch the egg from her abdomen onto the water surface, without ceasing the up-and-down flight motion. During each phase of the oviposition sequence, body orientation (including leg positions) resembled that of other flyingCulex.The fore-legs remained positioned upward, while the mid-legs and hindlegs were directed downward/outwards and towards the posterior, respectively (Fig.2a–c). As the egg was released, the female rapidly lifted her abdomen upwards and then propelled the apex towards her anterior to eject the egg forward (Fig.2c). This fixed action pattern of egg-laying occurred entirely whileCx. antillummagnorumwas in flight, with eggs being released throughout the aerial ellipses.

Diagrammatic representations of three steps in the aerial oviposition behavior ofCulex antillummagnorum(depicted without wings to reduce visual confusion and highlight body/leg positions) drawn directly from an HDR video recording at 30 frames per second. Egg-laying consists of the following: (a) an egg exiting the gonotreme upon the location of an adequate oviposition site; (b) initiation of egg-laying with a slight change in body orientation; (c) the female aerially launching an egg by thrusting the abdomen forward. Videos can be found as Supplementary Video S1–S5 online.

After an egg was oviposited, the female prepared to launch another egg only a few moments later. Females either repeated the behavior at the same bract or departed, presumably to search for another oviposition site. The execution of this flight pattern did not always necessitate oviposition, as females would hover over a dry or otherwise non-idealH. caribaeabract, complete several ellipses in flight without expelling an egg, and then proceed to another adjacent bract, where the sequence was completed again. The mechanism ofCx.antillummagnorumoviposition is illustrated in three video recordings, and corresponding sketches depict the elliptic flight pattern performed before and during egg-laying (Fig.2; Supplementary Video S1–S5 online).

Culex antillummagnorumfemales skip-oviposit (distributing the eggs among variousH. caribaeabracts) and lay eggs individually, one at a time. They do not glue their eggs into a floating raft. Field observations suggest that neither the presence of conspecific nor heterospecific larvae or eggs within a bract served as repellents for gravid females, and in one case, twoCx. antillummagnorumindividuals were recorded ovipositing simultaneously into the same bract (Fig.3; Supplementary Video S3–S4).

FemaleCulex antillummagnorumobserved ejecting eggs while resting above a body of water: (a) on the side of aHeliconia caribaeabract (b) within the bract. In both panels, eggs can be seen floating on the water surface (white arrows are pointing toward the eggs). Ovipositing mosquitoes are circled in red.

Culex antillummagnorumeggs are hydrophobic, white/cream colored, and oval-shaped (Fig.4a) with papilliform ornamentation (small projections on the outer chorionic reticulum) when laid (Fig.4c). The hydrophobic surface of the egg grants it negative thigmotaxis and freedom of movement when the water’s surface is disturbed. Within a few hours following oviposition, the endochorion melanizes, and the eggs appear dark brown (Fig.4b).

TwoCx. antillummagnorumfemales were recorded simultaneously ovipositing within the sameH. caribaeabract in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. An egg can be seen at the tip of each female’s abdomen (indicated by red arrows).Cx. antillummagnorumeggs are circled in white.

GravidCx. antillummagnorumwere also recorded, though less frequently, ejecting eggs while resting on the sides of and withinH. caribaeabracts (Fig.5; Supplementary Video S5 online). This “barrage oviposition” behavior did not always include the forward thrusting of the abdomen. When ovipositing from the side of a bract, twitching of the hindlegs was observed as the egg exited the gonotreme and was rapidly expelled downward from the abdomen and onto the water’s surface. The body position remained neutral for the duration of the egg-laying sequence.

The findings we report here challenge commonly held assumptions and expand our understanding of egg-laying behavior withinCulex. By conducting field observations and extensively filming the speciesCx. antillummagnorumin the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico, we provide evidence for a novel mode ofCulexoviposition (oviposition while in flight and skip-oviposition) and thereby disprove the notion thatCulexsolely lay masses of coniform eggs directly on the water surface8,15,21. Although the aerial oviposition ofCx. antillummagnorumis similar to that ofToxorhynchitesspp. andSabethesspp., there are several differences.Culex antillummagnorum’s flight pattern can be described as slightly erratic when compared to the counterclockwise oviposition flights ofToxorhynchitesspp. andSabethesspp11,30, asCx. antillummagnorumwill rapidly hover from side to side after completing several “bouncing” elliptical loops before egg-laying. The orientation of the body upon egg release likewise appeared less contorted, in terms of the ventral angle formed as the abdomen folded downward, than that of bothToxorhynchitesspp. andSabethesspp. when engaged in a similar behavior (Fig.2a–c)11,30. The description ofCx. antillummagnorum’s unique egg-laying indicates a greater diversity of oviposition behaviors within the genus than previously described. This demonstrates the need for future studies to elucidate the spectrum of reproductive strategies in understudiedCulexspecies and subgenera. The observation of aerial and skip-oviposition inCx. antillummagnorumnot only challenges the oversimplified view of reproductive traits across Culicidae genera but also raises questions about eco-evolutionary dynamics (including the potential for convergent evolution of these traits across mosquito taxa), plant-mosquito interactions, and the still poorly understood phylogenetic relationships in the tribe Culicini32–35.

Skip-oviposition is an ancestral trait of the Culicidae that allows gravid females to disperse their eggs across multiple oviposition sites8, increasing the chances of larval survival in heterogeneous habitats of high environmental variability33,36–38. Mosquito species that use phytotelmata tend to skip-oviposit, likely in response to the nutrient limitations of these sites39. Aerial oviposition, on the other hand, may be a strategy for exploiting ephemeral or inaccessible water sources31,40,41, including water-filled leaf axils, the carnivorous pitchers ofNepenthesandSarraceniaplants36,Heliconiabracts, and other small phytotelm systems23,27. The limited space and inaccessibility of these systems hinder raft-laying, making aerial oviposition a mechanically easier and safer solution40. It can be inferred that skip-oviposition and aerial oviposition inCx. antillummagnorumare adaptations that evolved as habitat specialization responses to ecological pressures. These behaviors could enableCx. antillummagnorumto maximize reproductive success by accessing otherwise unavailable larval development sites (e.g., with obstructed or small openings), reducing predation of ovipositing females, or avoiding larval competition for limited resources40–42. It has been proposed that looping flight behaviors in other mosquito taxa may additionally function as a way to assess volatiles from sites before egg-laying39. The egg morphology of this species most closely resembles that ofToxorhynchites spp19, and is drastically different from the characteristic eggs of mostCulex8,22. The morphological similarity betweenCx. antillummagnorumandToxorhynchitesspp. eggs suggests the convergent evolution of aerial oviposition (with both developing similarly aerodynamic, hydrophobic eggs to facilitate this behavior), driven by the exploitation of similar larval habitats27,39,41,43.

We presently know very little about the ecology and natural history of many species within the 28Culexsubgenera, so similar aerial or skip-oviposition behaviors may well exist in otherCulexthat utilize similar larval rearing sites, including the close relatives ofCx. antillummagnorum(i.e., otherMicraedesand the highly derived Melanoconion Group ofCulexsubgenera)38. Even though the egg-laying habits of a majority ofCx. antillummagnorum’s close relatives remain unknown, what is currently documented for the Melanoconion Group subgeneraCarrollia,Aedinus,Tinolestes,Microculex, andAnoedioporpashows that the larvae of some species also occur in various small, ephemeral phytotelmata such as bromeliad tanks, leaf axils, tree holes, and bamboo internodes44–47.

The current phylogeny of the genusCulexis not well resolved. However, phylogenetic information, primarily from the morphological analyses of Harbach et al.48,49, which has been partly corroborated by mitogenome phylogenies from da Silva et al.33, and the phylogenomic study of Soghigian et al.38, places the subgenusMicraedeswithin the Melanoconion Group along with other subgenera of Neotropical mosquitoes, includingCarrollia,Aedinus,Anoedioporpa,Belkinomyia,Melanoconion,Microculex, andTinolestes32.MicraedesandCarrolliaare monophyletic and closely related, withMicroculexrepresenting an earlier diverged sister clade ofCarrollia, according to the parsimony analyses of Harbach et al.48(based on morphological data). The most parsimonious available phylogenetic data indicate that the Melanoconion Group is the most derived among theCulexsubgenera38,48, confirming thatCx. antillummagnorumis definitively nested withinCulexand is not representative of another mosquito genus50. There remains insufficient information regarding the evolutionary history and phylogenetic relationships between the majority of mosquito species and higher taxa. Improving this knowledge gap, especially concerning the relationships ofCulex, will help us to clarify the evolutionary basis of mosquito reproductive strategies, make predictions about the biology of previously unidentified or understudied species, and identify evolutionary and co-evolutionary patterns48.

There are basic ecological questions that remain to be answered aboutCx. antillummagnorum: (i) What factors influence the choice of oviposition sites inCx. antillummagnorum? (ii) How does aerial/skip-oviposition affect the spatial distribution and abundance ofCx. antillummagnorumpopulations? (iii) Are there specific ecological drivers that explain the convergent evolution of aerial oviposition across mosquito taxa? Investigating the ecological and selective pressures potentially driving the evolution of skip-oviposition and/or aerial oviposition in mosquitoes such asCx. antillummagnorumcan improve our understanding of the adaptive significance of these behaviors and further resolve the broader eco-evolutionary dynamics shaping Culicidae diversification. Future research should aim to assess and quantify egg-laying in understudied species and subgenera, including those within the Melanoconion Group. This approach would resemble the work of Blosser and Burkett-Cadena20on the atypical oviposition patterns observed in someCulexsubgenusMelanoconionspecies. By applying similar methodologies across the genus, we can improve our understanding of the variability of reproductive strategies within the Culicidae and perhaps uncover other examples of behaviors that do not adhere to current mosquito genera paradigms. The results of this study also demonstrate that re-evaluating natural history notes on mosquito oviposition, such as those authored by Mattingly19, is a fruitful endeavor. There are likely more anomalous observations of these insects’ astonishing adaptability that have been lost to time.

Between 17 July and 24 July 2023, gravidCx. antillummagnorumwere closely observed and documented on camera ovipositing inside water-filled bracts ofH. caribaearacemes within the LEF located in Puerto Rico, USA (18°19’16” N, 65º49’12” W) (Fig.6). A consistent observational approach was conducted, as the same genet ofH. caribaeawas monitored each night that the recordings took place. The plant was adjacent to a partially buried concrete septic tank that served as a daytime resting habitat for hundreds ofCx. antillummagnorum(including many that were visibly gravid). The emergence of these mosquitoes from the resting area typically began shortly before sunset, ca. 6:45 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., after which female mosquitoes either flew into the surrounding forest or oviposited in the nearbyH. caribaeabracts. Most of the mosquitoes had flown from the resting place within approximately 20 min. Videos of the oviposition behavior were recorded between 6:50 p.m. and 7:35 p.m. using an iPhone 12 Pro Max HDR video camera with Dolby Vision, recording at 30 fps., and a headlamp and flashlight. In situ photographs of the eggs ofCx. antillummagnorumin wildH. caribaeabracts were taken in the LEF using a Canon EOS 5D Mk IV camera with a Laowa 100 mm CA-Dreamer Macro 2× lens and a KuangRen Macro Twin Lite KX-800 flash.

As females were ovipositing, they were captured in vials and later, while alive, morphologically identified under a dissecting microscope. The Key to the Mosquito Genera of Puerto Rico (Barrera, unpublished) was used for all morphological identification. The longer length of the palpi (roughly 0.35 of the proboscis in both sexes, compared to 0.25 for otherCulexin the area) is a distinguishing character that can be reliably used to identify both male and femaleCx. antillummagnorumindividuals (Fig.1). Eggs that were laid withinHeliconiabracts were also collected in vials and photographed. The larvae were then reared to the 4th instar in the same 20 mL, 58.5 mm × 26.5 mm scintillation vials. Larvae fed on organic material from theHeliconiabracts where they were collected, and vials were housed in ambient, outdoor conditions (Palmer, PR; ~ 24–28 ℃) for the duration of larval development. The 4th instar larvae were morphologically identified with a dissecting microscope for further validation (Barrera, unpublished). After these observations of egg-laying, we monitored the bracts of otherH. caribaeain the LEF on subsequent nights by following gravid females as they flew from the resting area into the forest. With this method, we observed numerous examples of the same oviposition behavior fromCx. antillummagnorum.
