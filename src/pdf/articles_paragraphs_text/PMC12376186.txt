Studying the physicochemical
properties of ice in astronomical
environments is crucial to understanding the chemical processes involved
in cosmic events such as comet and planet formation. The physical
characteristics and chemical evolution on the surfaces of cosmic objects
such as comets or interstellar grains offer key insights into these
processes. This study focuses on α-pinene, a carbon- and hydrogen-rich
molecule, which serves as a model for investigating radical-driven
synthesis of more complex molecules under space-like conditions. It
also provides a useful analogy for complex terrestrial organic molecules
and sheds light on how organic matter interacts with water and radiation
in extraterrestrial environments. In this work, we simulate the effects
of heavy-ion cosmic ray bombardment on chiral molecules in the interstellar
medium by analyzing the radiolysis of a C10H16/H2O (1:1) mixture irradiated with 61.3 MeV84Kr15+ions. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
is employed to monitor the chemical evolution of ice samples at 10
K, both before and after irradiation. We identify 12 CnHmand ten CnHmOkmolecules, including complex products such as naphthalene
(C10H8), glycolaldehyde (HCOCH2OH),
and methyl formate (HCOOCH3). The most abundant hydrogenated
product is acetylene (C2H2), followed by naphthalene
(C10H8), while the most abundant oxygenated
molecules are vinyl alcohol (CH2CHOH) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH). Notably, the formation of CO2is minimal in this experiment. The destruction cross-sections of
α-pinene and water in the (1:1) mixture are determined to be
3.5 and 6.4 × 10–13cm2, respectively.
The formation cross-sections for the products resulting from radiolysis
are on average 2 × 10–14cm2for
hydrocarbons and 0.6 × 10–14cm2for the oxygenated products.

In this context,
biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), such
as the chiral monoterpene α-pinene, serve as relevant molecular
analogs for astrochemical investigations. Naturally emitted by terrestrial
vegetation, α-pinene undergoes oxidation in earth’s atmosphere,
contributing to aerosol formation. Its structural complexity and chirality
make it an ideal candidate for studying the radiation-driven evolution
of organic matter under astrophysical conditions. Moreover, similar
terpenoid compounds may plausibly exist in planetary atmospheres,
cometary nuclei, or icy grains in the interstellar medium (ISM), where
they would be subjected to processing by ultraviolet photons and energetic
particles.

Importantly, extraterrestrial chiral compounds preserved
in comets
and meteorites have endured exposure to ionizing radiation stemming
from radionuclide decay and cosmic rays over billions of years.,These high-energy processes can lead to racemization, degradation,
or even the selective enrichment of one enantiomer. Therefore, investigating
ion irradiation of α-pinene contributes to the understanding
of the survivability and evolution of chiral molecules in space and
chemical evolution in cold, radiation-rich environments. Such insights
can be directly applied to prebiotic scenarios involving icy planetary
surfaces, cometary ices, and interstellar dust grains.

The chiral
bicyclic bridgehead of the α-pinene olefinic functional
group makes it a desirable option for use as a monomer in the production
of polymers. Numerous mechanistic approaches have been explored for
the polymerization and functionalization of α-pinene, including
free radical initiation, cationic polymerization, and metathesis catalysis.
For example, α-pinene readily undergoes radical polymerization
in the presence of thermal or photochemical initiators to form polyterpenes
with varying molecular weights. Cationic
polymerization, often using Lewis or Brønsted acids, has been
widely studied due to its capacity to generate regioselective and
stereospecific products. More recently,
α-pinene derivatives have also been used in metathesis reactions
catalyzed by ruthenium complexes to produce functionalized macromolecules
and oligomers.

Chirality is not
preserved when high-energy radiation interacts
with primitive chiral compounds.,Cosmic rays
acting on the surfaces of comets and meteorites are responsible for
most of the radiation processing on them; however, at a depth of 20
m, the cosmic rays are completely attenuated, and radionuclide decay
is the only local source of radiation.,Cataldo has confirmed that interactions between primitive
chiral substances and high-energy radiation do not sustain chirality.

Recently, de Barros et al. and Ramachandran
et al. have studied pure α-pinene
(C10H16) at 10 K irradiated with 61.3 MeV84Kr15+beams and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption,
respectively. In both experiments, the spectra of pure α-pinene
show similarities between the ice and the gas phases. In the present
study, we observed new species not detected in the pure α-pinene
case: most notably, small oxygenated molecules.

The krypton
ion was selected as the projectile in this study due
to its high atomic mass and charge state, which make it an effective
analog for galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with icy surfaces
in space. Krypton ions with MeV energies deposit their energy into
the target predominantly through electronic stopping (i.e., inelastic
interactions with target electrons), leading to dense energy tracks
similar to those caused by high-energy heavy ions in astrophysical
environments.

It is well-known that many complex organic molecules
(COMs) have
been observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), and their formation
has been investigated in laboratory experiments.−In astrophysical settings, chemical
analysis is complicated by the fact that many ice species are mixed.
Thus, anticipating the result of ice irradiation in space requires
a quantitative understanding of how different mixture constituents
affect the ice radiolysis chemistry.,,Due to its prominence and its known effects on the
ice-binding environment, this study focuses on the effect of H2O ice during heavy-ion irradiation with a C10H16/H2O (1:1) ice mixture. It is not expected that
this mixture matches exactly the multicomponent ice mixture found
in space. Instead, we are using it to study the basic properties of
ice astrochemistry.

The mixture of α-pinene with H2O affects
astrochemistry
in ways other than by simply increasing the level of OH radicals in
the ice. According to Collings et al., the binding energies in H2O-rich ices are generally different
from those in pure ices, which may have an impact on radical diffusion.
At low temperatures, radicals can also physically get trapped in water
ice, as is often seen with volatile compounds. Different radicals are likely to exhibit stronger or weaker
interactions with water, which could lead to unexpected changes in
the chemistry. We examine the relative significance of these possible
H2O impacts on the radiochemistry of CnHm.

For the first time, a
mixture of α-pinene and H2O (1:1) at 10 K was irradiated
with heavy ions, and mid-infrared
(MIR) spectroscopy (6500–450 cm–1region)
was used to detect the evolution of the reactants and radiolysis products
as a function of the irradiation fluence, to obtain their formation
and destruction cross-sections, and to quantify the band strengths.

The investigations were carried out using the
IGLIAS (French acronym
for “Irradiation of astrophysical ices”) setup at CIMAP-CIRIL
on the IRRadiation SUD beamline of the French National Heavy Ion Accelerator
(GANIL). The IRRSUD beamline routinely
provides heavy-ion beams such as84Kr15+with
precise control over the energy and fluence. It provides a well-characterized,
reproducible, and controlled method to simulate the chemical effects
of high-LET (linear energy transfer) cosmic rays, particularly those
from heavy nuclei like Fe, allowing laboratory simulations of space
radiation environments like organic matter embedded in ices. The energy
deposition at the microscopic level is similar for heavy ions such
as Fe, Ni, and Kr.,Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy was used in the transmission mode covering the 4000–600
cm–1range, with a spectral resolution of 1 cm–1and an average of 70 scans. All infrared spectra
were corrected using background subtraction. Prior to each deposition,
a background spectrum was recorded with the clean substrate under
the same vacuum and temperature conditions to maintain spectral consistency. The spectra in the mid-IR region were collected
to track the development of column densities as a function of the
beam fluence.

The mixture of α-pinene–water vapor
was deposited
onto a ZnSe optical flat crystal window in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber
(base pressure <2 × 10–10mbar). The substrate
was a 2 mm thick, 20 mm diameter optical-grade window with a polished
surface selected for its excellent transmission in the mid-infrared
range. Both components, α-pinene vapor (Sigma-Aldrich, purity
better than 98%) and Milli-Q water vapor (purified through multiple
freeze–pump–thaw cycles), were premixed in the gas ramp
and simultaneously admitted into the chamber via a deposition tube
placed 15 mm in front of the IR window at controlled partial pressures
to form a uniform ice film at 10 K. For more details, see Augé
et al. Homogeneity of the film was confirmed
by the reproducibility of infrared spectra in terms of band positions,
shapes, and integrated absorbances across repeated experiments, indicating
consistent mixing and uniform coverage of the substrate.

A commercially
available α-pinene sample (98.8% from Sigma-Aldrich)
was purified before using a series of freeze–pump–thaw
cycles to remove air and other volatile contaminants at the liquid
N2temperature. Ultrapure liquid water with a resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ cm was purged with liquid nitrogen, and α-pinene
vapors were then added to a prechamber that had been evacuated to
a pressure of 10–6mbar. This value was used to
verify the quality of the water and to ensure minimal contamination
during sample preparation, which is especially important for astrochemical
experiments where trace impurities could significantly alter radiolysis
outcomes. The α-pinene vapor was fed into the main chamber at
a pressure of 2 × 10–7mbar after the sample
holder had cooled. The remaining gas pressures for the IGLIAS setup
were within the ranges of 10–8and 10–10during ion irradiation.

The C10H16/H2O (1:1) ice film
was irradiated at normal incidence with 61.3 MeV84Kr15+projectiles. According to the SRIM code, the energy transfer rate per projectile through electronic
interaction was approximatelySe= 5.80
× 103keV μm–1which is sufficient
to initiate radiolytic reactions that form and destroy complex molecules.
The range of these projectiles was 10 μm, which is large enough
to completely traverse the 3.4 μm thick ice layer.

Here,N0represents
the initial column
density of the ice, whereN0(C10H16) = 8.98 andN0(H2O) = 11.1 × 1018molecules cm–2,Mis the total molecular mass, andNAis Avogadro’s constant. The density ρ used
for α-pinene was 0.858 g cm–3, and for water, it was 1.1 g cm–3.

The 4000 to 650 cm–1FTIR spectra of pure nonirradiated α-pinene and the water
mixture are shown inFigureand are presented in three subregions for clarity. The spectra
of pure α-pinene and those of the mixture with water show good
correlations with each other (Figure). Three water bands were observed around ∼760
cm–1as a νRlibration, ∼1650
cm–1as a ν2bend, and at ∼3280
cm–1as a ν3. Most of the α-pinene bands were observed in the mixture
spectra, and the shifts in the band positions are listed inTable.

The band position of water bands
(see Bouilloud et al.).

In the
region of C–H bending
and C–C stretching, several bands shift in the presence of
water. For example, 1450.5 cm–1and 1471.5 cm–1exhibit deformation modes that likely involve water-induced
perturbations of the α-pinene structure. Specifically, the band
near 1471 cm–1, typically associated with asymmetric
deformation of the methylene group (−CH2−)
and vinyl C–H bending modes, is sensitive to changes in the
molecular environment. The presence of water can influence the vibrational
coupling of these modes through dipole–dipole interactions
or by stabilizing conformers that are otherwise unfavorable in the
pure phase.

Certain bands in the bending region
of CH, such as those at 787.7 cm–1and 842.7 cm–1, show changes in intensity when mixed with water.
The increase in intensity of some bands, such as 787.7 cm–1, could be due to the direct interaction between water molecules
and the hydrophobic groups of α-pinene, modifying the distribution
of electron density and altering vibrational characteristics.

The broadening of peaks,
especially
in the C–H stretching region (e.g., 2921.3 cm–1and 2949.9 cm–1), indicates that water can cause
additional broadening due to interactions between α-pinene and
water molecules. The CH2asymmetric stretching mode at
2986.5 cm–1also exhibits some broadening, further
supporting the idea that water interacts with the α-pinene structure,
leading to more complex vibrational behavior.

Due to the presence of water in the mixture, the formation of oxygenated
products such as carbon monoxide (CO) and (13CO), carbon
dioxide (CO2), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ethanol
(CH3CH2OH), ethylene oxide (C2H4O), vinyl alcohol (CH2CHOH), glycolaldehyde (HCOCH2OH), methyl formate (CH3OCHO), and ethylene glycol
(HOCH2CH2OH) was also observed.

The evolution
of the spectra of irradiated C10H16/H2O (1:1) at 10 K as a function of fluence is
shown inFigure.
It is important to note that some important methanol bands, such as
1011 cm–1ν8(13C),
1041 cm–1ν8, 1157 cm–1ν7, 1188 cm–12ν12, 1428 cm–1ν6, and 1444 cm–1ν5were observed by Bennett et al. Such bands are close to the α-pinene bands
(seeTable); therefore,
for methanol, we use the band located at 1032.3 cm–1in the current analysis.

Forn-butane, two
bands located at 958.7 (ν16, C–H rocking or

1642.8 cm–1, an H–CC–H wag.
vibration mode at 994.5 cm–1, and a vibration mode
(CH2wag.) at 908.8 cm–1are
observed in this experiment. They were also observed by Kim et al.

Four bands of naphthalene are observed
at 1023.7 cm–1(C–H bending), 1596.3 cm–1(C–H
bending or C–H out-of-plane), 1732.8 cm–1(C–H bending), and 1960.3 cm–1(C–H
bending or ring deformation), as shown
inFigureb,c. Four
benzene bands are observed: two fundamental bands at 908.8 cm–1(ν18ring deformation or C–H
bend) and 1037.5 cm–1(ν18C–H
in-plane bending), one combination band at 1960.3 cm–1(ν17+ ν5C–H bend and
ring deformation),,and a C–H out-of-plane
at 752.4 cm–1. Details are presented inFigurea,c,f. Only one ethane
band is identified, a fundamental 2973.8 cm–1(ν10C–H stretching).,In the current
experiment, three bands are attributed to C4H4; the vinylacetylene that is thermodynamically less stable than the
vinylacetylene methylenecyclopene isomer is visible through the ν1C–H stretching, ν6+ ν7, and ν6at 3288.1, 2973.8, and 1596.3 cm–1, respectively.,Only one 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene
or isoprene molecule is identified: 954.2 cm–1as
CH2wagging/CH2twisting.

Several products are oxygenated molecules: carbon
dioxide (CO2), identified by three bands at 655.5 cm–1(ν2CO2bending), 2344.5
cm–1(ν3CO2stretching),
and 3609.2 cm–1(2ν2+ ν3CO2bending);,,,carbon monoxide, identified
by two bands
at 2137.2 cm–1(ν112CO str.),and 2091.6 cm–1(ν1stretching),,,corresponding to13CO. Two acetaldehydes, CH3CHO, 758.2 cm–1(ν14CH bending)
and ν4CO stretching at 1722.8 cm–1, and a methanol band at 1032.3 cm–1(ν6CO stretching),are also observed. A band of ethylene oxides was also observed at
ν5868.0 cm–1ring deformation, with a vinyl alcohol, CH2CHOH, at
1642.8 cm–1(ν5CC stretching). Bands attributed to complex molecules are observed
in the region of 1050–1080 cm–1related to
ethanol, CH3CH2OH, at 1093 cm–1; a band of HOCH2CH2OH, ethylene glycol, at 1090.1 cm–1, and a band at 1067.1 cm–1that
can be related to HCOCH2OH, glycolaldehyde, or HOCH2CH2OH, ethylene
glycol.

Bennett et al. performed laboratory
studies to elucidate synthetic pathways for the formation of three
C2H4O isomersacetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ethylene oxide (C2H4O), and vinyl alcohol
(CH2CHOH)and demonstrated the relevance of these
molecules for the astrochemical evolution of the interstellar medium.

Acetaldehyde and ethylene oxide have been proposed to play a significant
role in amino acid synthesis and early
metabolic pathways, respectively. Furthermore,
the existence of ethylene oxide indicates the potential presence of
a larger ring structure, furan (C4H4O), which
is closely related to the sugars ribose and deoxyribose; these molecules,
interconnected by phosphate(s), constitute the structural backbone
of RNA and DNA, respectively.

Figureshows a comprehensive comparison of all molecular species
formed during the irradiation of α-pinene and H2O
ices by heavy ions as a function of ion fluence. The column densities
of the identified products span several orders of magnitude, reflecting
the complexity of the radiation-induced chemical network. Most species
display a rapid increase in abundance at low fluences, followed by
a plateau or saturation trend, suggesting a fluence-dependent formation
limited by precursor depletion or destruction at higher doses.

Evolution
of the column densities of the detected molecular products
as a function of ion fluence during the irradiation of α-pinene/H2O ice. The data include hydrocarbons, oxygenated organics,
and small molecules such as CO and CO2. The figure highlights
the relative abundance and formation behavior of each species. Error
bars represent experimental uncertainties.

When a molecular sample
is exposed to an ion beam, the quantity of molecules in the initial
target (precursor) is altered primarily by two mechanisms: radiolysis
and sputtering. This means that modifications in the ice are caused
by (i) the desorption of molecules from the ice surface and (ii) the
formation of new molecules. The main information extracted from ion
irradiation as a function of projectile fluence using infrared spectroscopy
as an analytical technique is (i) the destruction cross-section (σd) of the precursor molecular species, (ii) the formation cross-section
(σf) of new molecular species (products), and (iii)
the desorption yield (Y).

During radiolysis,
the column density (N) of the
α-pinene molecules decreases. Since the ice samples used in
the current measurements are thin compared to the penetration depth
of Kr ions, the destruction cross-section is constant along the projectile
track, and the column density evolution can be described byeq.

whereN(0) is the precursor
initial column density,Y0is the initial
sputtering yield, without the influence of the radiolysis, and σdis the destruction cross-section of precursors.

The
evolution of the 788.4 cm–1band has been used for
the α-pinene destruction cross-section determination. For H2O, the column density was determined
from the evolution of the absorbance of the 1643.2 cm–1band. The cross-sections were determined from fittings usingeqshown inFigure. For pure α-pinene irradiated
with a 61.3 MeV84Kr15+ion beam, the radiolysis
cross-section obtained is σd= 5.4 × 10–13cm2. Adding
water to the mixture, the new cross-section is reduced to σd= 3.5 × 10–13cm2for α-pinene,
while σdfor water, it is 6.4 × 10–13cm2; the sputtering yields areY0= 3.7 × 106molecules per impact for α-pinene
andY0= 3.5 × 106molecules
per impact for water.

Column density (N(F))
evolution
as a function of ion beam fluence for (a) α-pinene and (b) H2O precursors. The fittings are performed usingeqto determine the destruction cross-sections.

The products are classified into
(i) fragments if they originate
from a single precursor and (ii) hybrids (in the current experiment,
hydrocarbons) if they are formed from two or more precursors. For
(i), the evolution of the column density as a function of the beam
fluence, observed for each fragment, follows the approximate expression
used previously in the case of α-pinene.

where σf,kis the apparent
formation cross-section, the relevant parameter in this analysis,
σdrefers to the destruction of its precursor, and
σd,krefers to the apparent destruction of the k
product. Since sputtering is negligible
for products at the beginning of the experiment, the apparent formation
cross-sections can be considered equivalent to the true (or standard)
formation cross-sections. The cross-sections of products are different
from each other and generate the small variations observed in theNk(F) evolutions. The column
densities of the hydrocarbons were determined using theA-values presented inTable. For hybrids, chemical reactions are involved, and cross-section
calculations are more difficult. Taking
advantage of the fact that for the current mixture the ratio is about
1:1,eqhas also been
employed. Cross-sections are expected to be correct within a factor
of 2.

The cross-sections were obtained
by fitting the product’s column density evolutions witheq, with the errors varying
between 5% and 15%. Absolute cross-sections of the oxygenated products
have larger errors.

The
column density evolutions of the observed hydrocarbons are
presented inFigure.Figureshows the
column densities of the oxygenated products formed from radiolysis
in a mixture of α-pinene and water molecules.Tablepresents theA-values, the formation cross-sections (σf,k), and
the effective destruction cross-sections (σd,k) of
various hydrocarbons (CnHm) and oxygen-bearing molecules (CnHmOk).

naphthalene (C10H8). It is important to note
that the destruction cross-section for the formed hydrocarbon species
was determined using only the α-pinene destruction cross-section
value of 3.5 × 10–13cm2.

curves in red are fittings performed usingeq. It is important to note that the destruction
cross-section for the formed oxygenated species was determined using
the H2O destruction cross-section value of 6.4 × 10–13cm2. Absolute cross-sections have large
errors because they depend on the mixture ratio of precursors.

densitiesNk(F) are
characterized by (i) a quasi-linear increase at low fluence with a
slope proportional to the formation cross-section, (ii) a maximum
aroundF≈ 1012molecules cm–2, and (iii) a decrease ofNkfor higher fluences. This evolution is due to the sum of the precursor
and product destruction cross-sections.Figureshows that the destruction cross-sections
for the precursor bands are about 10–13cm2, while the average value of the formation cross-sections (Table) for its produced
species (hydrocarbons and oxygenated molecules) is about 10–14cm2.

The dependence of the formation and destruction
cross-sections
on the molecular structure provides insight into the susceptibility
to radiolysis and the molecular stability of products, summarized
inFigurefor the
CnHmproducts.
We considered the two types of processed samples: pure α-pinene
(ref de Barros et al. (2024)) and the α-pinene mixture with water (data presented
inTable).

Dependence
of the formation (left) and destruction (right) cross-sections
on the number of carbon atoms (n) for the hydrocarbon
products CnHm. The irradiated samples are pure pinene (top) and the α-pinene–water
mixture (bottom). Note the σf,kincreasing and the
σd,kdecreasing dependence as a function of carbon
atoms (Cn).

The formation cross-section increases
as n increases for both the pure and mixture samples.

Concerning the CnH2products, just the first member (C2H2) is observable.

The presence of water does indeed
change significantly the evolution cross-sections of the CnH4series but not of the CnH6series.

The presence of water alters the
slope of the CnH8series. Specifically,
it increases considerably the formation cross-section of C3H8, reduces and flattens the C4H8, and enables the detection of C10H8.

C2H2(acetylene)
has the highest formation cross-section for the mixture with water
and for pure α-pinene.

Among the
hydrocarbons, C2H2(acetylene)
has the highest formation cross-section: 7.2 × 10–14cm2. The high σf,kvalue of acetylene
may be attributed to its relatively simple molecular structure, allowing
for straightforward formation pathways from smaller radicals and fragments
during hydrocarbon processing. In addition, acetylene is a fundamental
intermediate species in many chemical reactions, which contributes
to its significant formation rate. The molecular stability of the
CnH2series has recently been
discussed by Díaz Soto et al. For
the most stable isomers, they found that the C2H2, C4H2, C5H2, and C6H2series have a linear structure.

CH3radicals, a key precursor
to methane, can also lead to larger hydrocarbon formation rather than
methane itself. If these radicals encounter other hydrocarbon fragments,
they can form ethane (C2H6) or more complex
species instead of methane.

The destruction
cross-section generally
decreases asnincreases; this behavior is the same
for the pure and mixture samples.

The exception is the CnH4series for pure pinene, which presents
a maximum for CnH3and the
lowest value for CH4. Such CH4disappearance
in water solution is attributed to the reactions CH4+
H2O → CO + 3H2and CH4+ H2O → CO2+ H2that should occur
in the hot projectile track; indeed, CO and CO2are products
observed in the spectra of the irradiated sample with water.

The presence of water
generally
increases the cross-sections of CnHmseries. Then oxygen is available to produce
oxygenated molecules, which reduces the densities of hydrocarbons.

Formation and destruction
cross-sections
have the opposite trends with respect to the molecular size: while
the former increases, the latter decreases withn. Higher production followed by lower destruction means that synthesis
of large species is favored relative to small ones. The ability to
produce larger species during radiolysis is most likely due to the
carbon atom’s multiple linkage properties.

Roughly, the destruction cross-sections
are 1 order of magnitude lower than the formation ones. This guarantees
that the abundance of products increases at the beginning of irradiation.
After a certain fluence, the precursor’s densities decrease,
obliging the product’s production rate to diminish. Moreover,
since the products’ densities are still increasing, their destruction
rates also increase, forcing their leveling off. This general behavior
is seen inFiguresand .

The size
and structure of the molecules enhance the
resilience against radiation-induced destruction. Saturated hydrocarbons
tend to be more susceptible to destruction than unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Indeed, C2H2(acetylene, σd,k= 2.4 × 10–15cm2) is more prone
to radiolysis than C2H6(ethane, σd,k= 1.7 × 10–15cm2), likely
due to weaker single bonds in alkanes compared to stronger triple
bonds in alkynes.

Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene and naphthalene)
are more
resistant to radiolysis than smaller aliphatic hydrocarbons. Benzene
(C6H6) has σd,k= 2.9 ×
10–15cm2, whereas naphthalene (C10H8) has an even lower σd,k=
1.7 × 10–15cm2. This trend can
be attributed to the fact that larger molecules generally possess
more extensive delocalized electron systems and multiple bonding sites,
which enhance their structural stability and resistance to radiolytic
fragmentation compared to that of smaller, more saturated hydrocarbons.

For the oxygenated molecules, CH2CHOH (vinyl alcohol)
has the highest formation cross-section at σd,k=
2.8 × 10–13cm2, while CO2has one of the lowest at 0.2 × 10–14cm2. Vinyl alcohol is an unstable intermediate in some chemical
reactions and does not exist freely in nature for long periods. It
quickly tautomerizes (rearranges) into acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), which is more stable. The high formation cross-section of vinyl
alcohol may be attributed to its synthesis via multiple precursor
pathways, involving both hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species,
whereas CO2is typically formed by oxidation reactions
that may be less efficient under the experimental conditions.

Overall, the trend in formation cross-sections suggests that larger,
more complex molecules benefit from cumulative reaction pathways,
while smaller species form with lower efficiency due to either fewer
reaction intermediates or competitive destruction processes.

For instance, light hydrocarbons tend to exhibit larger destruction
cross-sections. CH4(methane) has a destruction cross-section
of σd,k= 1.4 × 10–14cm2, which is comparable to that of the heavier molecule C10H8(naphthalene), with σd,k=
1.7 × 10–14cm2. This result suggests
that in this case, molecular size and structure do not significantly
influence the resistance to radiation-induced destruction.

In
the case of oxygen-bearing molecules (CnHmOk), the
oxygenated species generally exhibit destruction cross-sections
higher than that of hydrocarbons of similar size, indicating their
greater susceptibility to radiation-induced breakdown. For example,
carbon dioxide (CO2) has some of the highest σd,kvalues, with 5.5 × 10–13cm2, and so does carbon monoxide (CO) ∼ 3.0 × 10–13cm2. This indicates that simple carbon–oxygen
bonds are more prone to dissociation. Larger organic molecules with
oxygen (e.g., CH3OH, CH3CHO) display moderate
destruction cross-sections, indicating that functional groups influence
stability. Methanol (CH3OH) has a σd,kof ∼ 3.9 × 10–13cm2, significantly
higher than that of ethanol (CH3CH2OH), for
which σd,k= 1.1 × 10–13cm2, suggesting that additional carbon in ethanol increases resilience.

In a comparison of hydrocarbons and oxygenated products, it can
be observed that oxygenated molecules generally have destruction cross-sections
that are higher than those of pure hydrocarbons, probably because
of weaker carbon–oxygen bonds. This is especially evident in
CO2, which has the highest values, σd,k, followed by acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and methyl formate
(CH3COOH). For hydrocarbons, increasing the molecular mass
generally reduces their stability σd,k, but for oxygen-containing
molecules, this trend is less pronounced, showing that functional
groups play an important role in stability.

Smaller hydrocarbons
exhibit a higher volatility σd,k, making them more
prone to destruction. Aromatic and larger hydrocarbons
are more stable than smaller aliphatic species. Oxygen-bearing molecules
have significantly higher destruction cross-sections than hydrocarbons,
highlighting their vulnerability to radiolysis. Carbon oxides (CO,
CO2) and alcohols (CH3OH) show the highest destruction
cross-sections, pointing out their instability under irradiation.
These findings are relevant for understanding molecular evolution
in astrophysical environments, where radiolysis plays a key role in
chemical transformations.

For the oxygenated molecules, those
that are formed from both precursors,
a similar behavior on the molecular size is observed (seeTable): small products
have relatively low and high formation and destruction cross-sections
(e.g., for CO, they are 0.65 and 29 × 10–14cm2, and even CO2has 0.02 and 55 × 10–14cm2, respectively), while for large products,
they are larger and lower, respectively (e.g., for CH2CHOH,
they are around 2.8 and 6.6 × 10–14cm2and for ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH),
they are 1.6 and 3.6 × 10–14cm2, respectively).

In our previous study (de Barros
et al., 2024), we irradiated pure α-pinene
ice with the same ion beam (84Kr15+) at 61.3
MeV, using an identical experimental setup. That work allowed us to
establish the primary fragmentation and rearrangement pathways of
α-pinene under heavy-ion bombardment in the absence of water.
Among the identified products in the pure α-pinene study were
unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethylene (C2H4), propene (C3H6), 1-butene (C4H8), benzene (C6H6), and naphthalene (C10H8), formed through ring opening, dehydrogenation,
and carbon–carbon bond rearrangements. In the present study,
we observed new species not detected in the pure α-pinene case,
most notably small oxygenated molecules such as vinyl alcohol (CH2CHOH), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), and other partially
oxidized hydrocarbons. The presence of water enables additional radiolytic
mechanisms, including hydroxylation and hydration reactions, that
are inaccessible in the absence of H2O. Therefore, we attribute
the appearance of these oxygen-bearing species to secondary reactions
between radiolysis products (e.g., radicals or unsaturated fragments)
and water-derived species such as OH and H. This comparison clearly
supports the conclusion that water ice plays an active chemical role
in the radiolysis of α-pinene, not merely as an inert matrix.
It alters the product distribution and reaction pathways, demonstrating
that part of the observed molecular complexity arises from interactions
between the hydrocarbon precursor and the radiolysis fragments of
H2O. These findings are consistent with earlier studies
of hydrocarbon–water mixtures under ionizing radiation (e.g.,
Moore & Hudson, 1998; Bennett et al.,
2005) and underscore the importance of
considering mixed ices when simulating astrochemical processes on
icy bodies.

While
α-pinene has not yet been directly detected on Titan,
it is a representative biogenic monoterpene with a chiral structure
and a reactive hydrocarbon backbone that mimics the behavior of complex
organic aerosols in Titan’s atmosphere. Titan’s upper
atmosphere is rich in hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane,
benzene, and various nitriles, many of which are formed through photochemistry
and cosmic ray interactions. The formation of aromatic and unsaturated
compounds observed in our experiment, such as benzene, acetylene,
and naphthalene, parallels Titan’s observed chemical inventory,
suggesting similar radiation-induced pathways could occur under Titan-like
conditions.

The present study investigated the radiolysis
of α-pinene
(C10H16) mixed with water ice (H2O) in a 1:1 ratio under cosmic ray-like conditions. The destruction
cross-section of α-pinene in the mixture was determined to be
∼3.5 × 10–13cm2, lower than
the value for pure α-pinene (∼5.4 × 10–13cm2), indicating a stabilizing effect of water. The sputtering
yields were also quantified: a yield of ∼3.7 × 106molecules per ion for α-pinene and 3.5 × 106molecules per ion for water.

The destruction cross-section
(σd,k) generally
decreases with increasing molecular mass, making larger hydrocarbons
more resistant to radiolysis. Aromatic compounds, such as benzene
and naphthalene, exhibit a lower stability σd,kthan
smaller aliphatic hydrocarbons, indicating greater stability. Oxygen-bearing
molecules tend to have higher destruction cross-sections than hydrocarbons,
with CO and CO2being the most radiation-sensitive. Functional
groups significantly influence the molecular resilience, as seen in
alcohols and aldehydes. These trends provide insights into molecular
stability in astrophysical environments affected by radiation.

Oxygenated molecules had higher destruction cross-sections than
hydrocarbons. CO, CO2, CH3OH, and CH3CH2OH exhibited significant degradation rates, indicating
that oxygen-bearing species are more sensitive to radiolysis. Comparison
with pure ice irradiation showed a higher stability of certain organic
products in the presence of water. The presence of CH3OH
and CH3CHO, which are crucial intermediates in the synthesis
of amino acids and sugars, clearly shows the potential of interstellar
ice chemistry to contribute to the inventory of prebiotic molecules
delivered to planetary systems.

The interaction of ionizing
radiation with the α-pinene and
water mixture leads to the formation of various complex organic molecules,
similar to processes in interstellar ice and icy moons. Aromatic compounds,
such as benzene and naphthalene, display higher stability than smaller
aliphatic hydrocarbons. Functional groups significantly influence
molecular resilience, with alcohols and aldehydes forming as key radiolysis
products. These findings provide valuable insights into molecular
transformations in astrophysical environments and their implications
for prebiotic chemistry.

In summary, this study provides critical
insights into the formation
and stability of complex organic molecules (COMs) under interstellar
conditions. The results show how water influences the radiolysis of
α-pinene, leading to the formation of oxygen-rich species. These
findings contribute to astrochemical models by improving predictions
of organic molecule evolution in icy cosmic environments.
