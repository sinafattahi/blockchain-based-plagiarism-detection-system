This real‐world study evaluated the clinical effectiveness of gilteritinib in 205 patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FLT3‐mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) enrolled in the Italian expanded access since January 2018.

Of the 205 patients, 124 (60.5%) received gilteritinib as a bridging therapy to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo‐SCT), achieving complete remission in 52.4% (n= 65). The median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 11.0 months, with estimated OS rates of 46.8% at 1 year and 28.5% at 3 years. Sixty patients (48% of those bridged) underwent allo‐SCT after a median of 3.7 months on gilteritinib, achieving posttransplant OS rates of 65.2% at 1 year and 56.1% at 3 years. The acquisition of FLT3 mutations at relapse and the presence of TP53 co‐mutations were significantly associated with inferior outcomes. Among 46 patients (22.4%) who relapsed after allo‐SCT, gilteritinib treatment yielded an overall response rate (ORR) of 54.3%, a median OS of 11.1 months, and 1‐ and 3‐year OS rates of 49.5% and 15.5%, respectively. Additionally, 35 patients (17.1%) previously treated with nonintensive chemotherapy received gilteritinib until disease progression or intolerance, achieving an ORR of 11.4%, a median OS of 5.9 months, and a 1‐year OS rate of 29.0%.

These real‐world data confirm that clinical outcomes achieved with gilteritinib in patients with R/R FLT3‐mutated AML are consistent with those observed in pivotal clinical trials. Notably, approximately half of the transplant‐eligible patients were successfully bridged to allo‐SCT and demonstrated encouraging long‐term survival.

This real‐world study evaluated 205 patients with relapsed or refractoryFLT3‐mutated acute myeloid leukemia treated with gilteritinib in the Italian Expanded Access Program. Outcomes were consistent with pivotal trials, with nearly half of transplant‐eligible patients successfully bridged to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and showing encouraging long‐term survival, whereas efficacy was limited in those previously treated with nonintensive chemotherapy.

Following a 21% complete remission (CR)/complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh) rate in interim analysis, gilteritinib received initial approval in September 2018 from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare for the treatment ofFLT3‐mutated R/R AML,9followed by regulatory approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration10and the European Medicines Agency in October 2019.11In compliance with regulatory guidelines, post‐marketing studies and expanded access programs (EAPs) were initiated globally to evaluate gilteritinib’s safety, tolerability, and effectiveness in real‐world settings.9,12,13,14,15,16,17In Italy, gilteritinib has been available through an EAP since January 2018. This retrospective and prospective observational study reports clinical outcomes from Italian centers participating in the national EAP.

The primary aim is to assess the real‐world clinical effectiveness of gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractoryFLT3‐mutated AML under routine clinical practice.

This multicenter, retro‐prospective, observational study (REL‐AML 002/2021) was conducted across 27 Italian hospitals involved in the gilteritinib EAP beginning in January 2018. Data acquisition was finalized, and the last follow‐up was completed in October 2024, marking the formal conclusion of the study. The study was conducted under the auspices of the Rete Ematologica Lombarda (REL) network. Gilteritinib was administered as monotherapy in accordance with the approved therapeutic indication. Each enrolled patient was followed from the initiation of gilteritinib treatment until death or last contact. For the prospective component, follow‐up continued for 12 months after the enrollment of the last patient.

Patients eligible for inclusion in the study were required to be over 18 years of age, have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML R/R) with anFLT3mutation confirmed on retesting, and have received gilteritinib monotherapy within the EAP. Before any data collection, all patients provided written informed consent. Ethical approval for the study was granted by CET3 Lombardia. The study was conducted in accordance with all relevant local regulations and the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Within the relapsed and refractory cohort, patients were further categorized into two groups: patients eligible for allogeneic transplantation and patients ineligible for transplantation. Additionally, we separately analyzed the subgroup of patients who experienced relapse following transplantation and, for patients with refractory disease, we investigated the potential impact of refractoriness after one versus multiple courses of intensive chemotherapy.

The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the initiation of gilteritinib to death from any cause. In the subgroup of patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo‐SCT), we analyzed the time from gilteritinib initiation to either transplantation or death, considering these as first events and treating them as competing risks.

Time‐to‐response was defined as the interval from gilteritinib initiation to the achievement of CR, CRh, or CRi. In responders, the duration of response was defined as the time from the achievement of CR or CRi to the loss of response (relapse or toxicity, considering transplant as a competing risk). For the SCT‐eligible group, we also analyzed posttransplant survival, defined as the time from allogeneic SCT to death from any cause.

The distribution of continuous variables was described by median, first and third quartiles, minimum, and maximum; categorical variables were reported as absolute and relative frequencies.

The overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier estimator. The curves were estimated on the overall sample and within each group (post‐SCT, SCT‐eligible, and SCT‐not‐eligible). Comparison of survival curves were performed using the log‐rank test and were made byFLT3mutation already present at diagnosis versus not present, presence versus absence of other mutations (NPM1,IDH1‐2,DNMT3A, andTP53), gilteritinib initiation after a single line of chemotherapy versus multiple lines of chemotherapy, and previous tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment versus no treatment.

Posttransplant survival was also estimated using the Kaplan–Meier estimator on patients who received SCT.

Only for the SCT‐eligible group, the crude cumulative incidences of death as first event or transplant (competing risks) were analyzed using the Aalen–Johansen estimator. To analyze the duration of response, a competing risk analysis was performed also on patients who reached CR or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery considering (progression)/relapse/toxicity and transplant as competing events.

A total of 205 patients were enrolled in the EAP of gilteritinib and included in this analysis.

Of the 205 patients included in the study, 163 (79.5%) received intensive chemotherapy as induction before initiating gilteritinib. The remaining 42 patients (20.5%) were initially treated with less‐intensive chemotherapy; among these, 35 were deemed ineligible for allo‐SCT.

Within the cohort of 163 patients treated with intensive induction, 39 relapsed after allo‐SCT, whereas the remaining 124 were transplant‐eligible patients who either relapsed following intensive chemotherapy (n= 82) or were primary refractory to it (n= 42).

Among these 124 transplant‐eligible patients, 99 (79.8%) had received standard “7 + 3” induction chemotherapy, with midostaurin administered in 64.5% (n= 80) of cases. The remaining 25 patients (20.2%) were treated with alternative induction regimens, including FLAI (fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin), ICE (idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide), or liposomal daunorubicin–cytarabine (CPX‐351).

Patients classified as primary refractory subsequently received second‐line intensive chemotherapy, most commonly FLAG‐Ida (fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin) or MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine). Additional salvage treatments included venetoclax combined with a hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine).

Among the 39 patients who relapsed after allo‐SCT, 30 had received the standard “7 + 3” induction chemotherapy combined with midostaurin. Overall, of the 163 patients treated with intensive regimens, 110 (67.5%) had prior exposure to a TKI before starting gilteritinib, whereas 53 (32.5%) had not.

A total of 148 patients (72.2%) received gilteritinib at the time of relapse, whereas 57 patients (27.8%) were treated for primary refractory disease. Based on relapse after allo‐SCT or transplant eligibility, patients were categorized into three groups.

The posttransplant relapse group included 46 patients who received gilteritinib following relapse after transplantation.

The non–transplant‐eligible group included 35 patients, with a median age of 75 years, who received less‐intensive chemotherapy and were deemed ineligible for HSCT. Before gilteritinib initiation, 17 patients had been treated with azacitidine and venetoclax (median 3 cycles; range, 2–11), 11 with decitabine alone (median 7 cycles; range, 1–28), and seven with azacitidine alone (median 10 cycles; range, 2–16). Among the 17 patients treated with azacitidine and venetoclax (VEN‐AZA), 14 of 17 (82%) were classified as ELN 2017 adverse risk, and 12 of 17 (70.5%) presented with hyperleukocytosis at the time of gilteritinib initiation and received hidroxyurea for citoreduction. Based on their response to prior therapy, 15 patients were categorized as having primary refractory disease, and 20 patients were categorized as having relapsed disease.

Gilteritinib was administered as monotherapy until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity. Notably, one patient in this cohort—initially considered ineligible for transplant—ultimately proceeded to transplantation.

The transplant‐eligible group comprised 124 patients, including 82 with relapsed disease and 42 with primary refractory disease, who received gilteritinib as a bridging therapy before transplantation.

Among those with primary refractory disease, 32 were refractory to a single course of intensive chemotherapy, whereas 10 were refractory to two or more courses.

The median age at diagnosis was 60 years and differed significantly among the three subgroups, as determined by the Kruskal–Wallis test (pvalue <.01). Patients in the transplant‐not‐eligible group were the oldest, with a median age of 75 years. Table1.

FLT3mutations were present in 175 of 205 patients (85.4%) at diagnosis, whereas 30 patients (14.6%) acquired the mutation at relapse.

At diagnosis,FLT3‐ITD was identified in 147 of 175 patients (84.0%), whereas 23 of 175 patients (13.1%) exhibited theFLT3‐TKD mutation; five patients (2.9%) had both FLT3‐ITD and FLT3‐TKD mutations.

Among the 175 patients who presented with anFLT3‐ITD/TKD mutation, 116 (66.3%) had co‐occurring mutations, either alone or in combination, includingNPM1(83 of 175 = 47.4%),DNMT3A(17 of 175 = 9.7%),IDH1/IDH2(12 of 175 = 6.9%), andTP53(four of 175 = 2.3%).

Among the 30 patients who acquiredFLT3mutations at relapse,NPM1was the most frequently co‐mutated gene, occurring either alone or in combination with other mutations in 12 of 30 patients (40.0%). Other co‐mutations includedIDH1/IDH2in five of 30 (16.7%) andTP53in two of 30 (6.7%) patients.

The most prevalent co‐mutations at diagnosis and relapse are summarized in Figure1, with a detailed overview of the genomic landscape at both time points available in TableS1.

Among the 46 patients who experienced relapse following allogeneic transplantation, treatment with gilteritinib resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 54.3% (25 of 46). A total of 45.7% (21 of 46) of patients achieved CR, whereas an additional 8.7% (four of 46) attained CR with CRi. The median time to response was 66 days (Table4). The median OS was 11.1 months, with an OS probability of 49.5% (95% CI, 36.6–67.0) at 1 year and 15.5% (95% CI, 7.15–33.6) at 3 years. The Kaplan–Meier survival curve in patients who received gilteritinib as salvage therapy following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (post‐SCT group) is presented in Figure2B.

This cohort included 35 patients. Among them, 8.6% (three of 35) achieved CR, and an additional 2.9% (one of 35) attained CR with CRi, resulting in an ORR of 11.4% (4/35). The median OS was 5.9 months, with a 1‐year OS probability of 29.0% (95% CI, 16.6–50.8). The Kaplan–Meier survival curve for OS in the SCT‐not‐eligible group is shown in Figure2C.

Furthermore, we observed a median survival of 7.5 months in the 17 patients who relapsed after or were refractory to venetoclax and azacitidine, compared with 5.3 months in the remaining 18 patients treated with other low‐intensity chemotherapy (p= .042) (FigureS1).

A total of 124 patients, deemed eligible for intensive treatment according to the GITMO (Gruppo Italiano Trapianto Midollo Osseo) criteria,20received gilteritinib as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation. The ORR in this cohort was 78 of 124 (62.9%), with a median time to response of 63 days (Table3). CR was achieved in 65 of 124 patients (52.4%), whereas an additional 13 patients attained CR with CRi (10.5%).

The Kaplan–Meier survival curve for OS in this cohort is depicted in Figure2D. The median OS was 11.0 months, with an estimated OS probability of 46.8% (95% CI, 38.4–57.0) at 1 year and 28.5% (95% CI, 21.0–38.7) at 3 years.

Sixty patients (48%) proceeded to transplantation after a median of 112 days (3.7 months), with a crude incidence of transplantation at 1 year of 47.1% (95% CI, 38.2–56.0) (FigureS2). Posttransplant survival was 65.2% (95% CI, 53.0–80.3) at 1 year and 56.1% (95% CI, 43.5–72.4) at 3 years (FigureS3).

The median OS for the 42 patients refractory to intensive chemotherapy was 11.0 months. The OS probability was 44.2% (95% CI, 31.1–63.0) at 1 year and 27.9% (95% CI, 16.7–46.6) at 3 years (Figure2E). The overall response rate was 61.9% (Table3). No significant difference was observed between the 10 single‐refractory patients and the 32 multi‐refractory patients (two or more lines of chemotherapy) in terms of either survival (p= .32) or response (p= .142) to gilteritinib (Figure2F).

Among the subgroup of 107 patients who achieved CR or CR with CRi, the probabilities of undergoing a transplant from the time of response were 46.1% (95% CI, 36.5–55.6) at 1 year and 47.1% (95% CI, 37.5–56.7) at 3 years. In contrast, the probability of relapse or death within 1 year was 29.8% (95% CI, 21.0–38.6), increasing to 40.7% (95% CI, 30.7–50.6) at 3 years following the achievement of response (Figure3).

Events were analyzed using a competing risks framework from the time of best response. Shaded areas represent 95% CIs. Number at risk: patients remaining in follow‐up without either event at each time point. CI indicates confidence interval; CR, complete remission; CRi, incomplete hematologic recovery.

Notably, patients with CR experienced a significantly better OS compared to those who achieved CR with CRi (FigureS4). The 1‐ and 3‐year survival probabilities in the CR group were 65.3% (95% CI, 55.6–76.6) and 39.6% (95% CI, 29.6–53.0), respectively, compared to 36.1% (95% CI, 19.2–68.1) and 12.0% (95% CI, 3.3–44.0) in the CRi group.

In the cohort of patients who received gilteritinib as a bridge to transplantation, the acquisition of aFLT3mutation or the presence of aTP53co‐mutation was associated with significantly reduced survival probability (p= .0066 andp= .022, respectively), as well as a poorer response rate. In contrast, co‐mutations inNPM1,IDH1/2, orDNMT3Adid not significantly affect survival outcomes (FigureS5; TableS2).

In the cohort of 46 patients who received gilteritinib for relapse after transplantation, those who acquired the FLT3 mutation had a trend toward worse prognosis, although this did not reach statistical significance (p= .064). The presence of co‐mutations inTP53,NPM1,IDH1/2, orDNMT3Adid not significantly impact survival probability (FigureS6).

In the group of patients not eligible to transplantation, no significant differences were found based on the presence or absence of the different co‐mutations in terms of overall survival (FigureS7).

A total of 113 patients had prior exposure toFLT3inhibitors before initiating gilteritinib. Of these, 110 patients received midostaurin during “3 + 7” induction (including two who also received posttransplant sorafenib), and three patients received sorafenib posttransplant only. Among the 163 patients who underwent intensive chemotherapy, those with priorFLT3inhibitor exposure (110 patients) demonstrated significantly improved OS compared to those without such exposure (53 patients) (log‐rank test,p= .0025). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the two groups are presented in FigureS8. In the TKI‐exposed group, the median OS was 13.2 months, with 1‐year and 3‐year survival rates of 51.3% (95% CI, 42.4–62.2) and 33.9% (95% CI, 25.4–45.1), respectively. In contrast, patients without prior TKI exposure had a median OS of 8.0 months, with 1‐year and 3‐year survival rates of 38.4% (95% CI, 26.9–54.9) and 11.1% (95% CI, 4.6–27.8), respectively. The two subgroups differed in baseline characteristics, including age distribution, ELN risk classification, and AML type (secondary vs. de novo). Patients with prior TKI exposure were younger, with a median age of 55 years compared to 58 years in the No‐TKI group. Additionally, the TKI group had a lower proportion of patients with adverse ELN risk (32.7% vs. 45.3%) and secondary AML (13.6% vs. 47.2%).

The analysis of clinical data from patients enrolled in the gilteritinib EAP across Italian hospitals confirms the treatment’s efficacy in improving overall survival and response rates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest cohort of R/R AML patients treated with gilteritinib outside the setting of a clinical trial to date.

At diagnosis (175),FLT3mutation was present in 175 patients (85.4% of the total). Among these, the majority harbored theFLT3‐ITD mutation (84%), whereas 13.1% exhibitedFLT3‐TKD and 2.9% had both ITD and TKD mutations. The most frequently observed co‐mutations wereNPM1(47.4%) andDNMT3A(40%), consistent with previous reports.8Notably, 14.6% of patients (30 patients) acquired anFLT3mutation at relapse, underscoring the importance ofFLT3retesting in this setting. At relapse,NPM1remained the most commonly mutated gene (40%), whereasDNMT3Amutations were not detected. Considering the entire cohort of 205 patients who received gilteritinib, we observed an ORR of 52.2%, with a CR rate of 43.4% and a CR with CRi rate of 8.8%.

To better understand the therapeutic potency of gilteritinib in different clinical contexts, we analyzed outcomes in three distinct groups: 1) patients fit for intensive chemotherapy and candidates for allogeneic transplantation; 2) patients who relapsed after an allogeneic transplant; and 3) patients who experienced relapse or progression after less‐intensive chemotherapy and received gilteritinib until progression or unacceptable toxicity. As expected, the three groups were not matched for age and performance status, with a significantly older median age (75 years) among patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. The best outcomes were observed in the 124 patients treated with gilteritinib as a bridge to transplantation. The ORR in this cohort was 62.9%, with a CR rate of 52.2%. Nearly half of the patients in this cohort (47.6%) successfully proceeded to transplantation after a median of 3.7 months. Posttransplant survival was 65.2% (95% CI, 53.0–80.3) at 1 year and 56.1% (95% CI, 43.5–72.4) at 3 years (FigureS3). Among this group, patients who acquired theFLT3mutation at relapse and those with aTP53mutation had significantly worse outcomes, with higher mortality, a reduced response rate, and a lower number of patients proceeding to transplantation (FigureS5). Additionally, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in response to gilteritinib between patients refractory to one course versus multiple courses of intensive chemotherapy.

An unexpected finding in our study was that prior treatment with anFLT3inhibitor was associated with significantly improved survival compared with patients without such exposure. However, this observation should be interpreted with caution, as the two subgroups differed substantially in baseline characteristics. Patients who had received a priorFLT3inhibitor were younger (median age, 55 vs. 58 years), had a lower proportion of adverse ELN risk classification (32.7% vs. 45.3%), and were less likely to have secondary AML (13.6% vs. 47.2%). These imbalances suggest that the observed survival advantage may, at least in part, reflect more favorable baseline prognostic factors rather than a direct effect of priorFLT3inhibitor therapy. Multivariate analyses adjusting for these potential confounders would be necessary to clarify the independent impact of priorFLT3inhibitor exposure; however, such analyses were not performed in the present study.

Notably, our findings are consistent with reports from the Spanish CETLAM and PETHEMA groups, which also demonstrated improved overall survival among patients previously treated withFLT3inhibitors compared with unexposed individuals.22In the Spanish cohort, unexposed patients were likewise significantly older, reinforcing the importance of adjusting for baseline imbalances when interpreting these associations.

The poorest outcomes with gilteritinib were observed in patients previously treated with less‐intensive chemotherapy. In this subgroup, 65.8% of patients did not respond, the CR rate was below 10%, and the ORR was 11.4%, resulting in a 1‐year OS probability of just 29%. When compared with the study by Othman et al.,14recently published inBlood Advances, our findings appear broadly consistent. In their cohort of 37 patients previously treated with VEN‐AZA, a median OS of 4.5 months was reported, whereas in our cohort of 35 patients treated with less‐intensive chemotherapy, the median OS was 5.9 months. At 12 months, survival rates were 15% and 29% in their and our cohorts, respectively. In both studies, no patients survived beyond 18 months, underscoring the poor prognosis in this population.

Among the 17 patients in our cohort who received VEN‐AZA, we observed a median OS of 7.5 months. Although this appears slightly longer than the median OS reported by Othman et al.,14differences in patient characteristics and treatment patterns may account for this variability.

Despite these challenges, the use of gilteritinib in relapsed/refractory AML after HMA or HMA plus venetoclax remains appropriate. The drug is approved for this indication, can be administered safely in the outpatient setting, and currently no alternative therapies are available outside of clinical trials.

The patient population included in the present study is not directly comparable to that enrolled in the Admiral trial, and several important differences should be noted. In our cohort, the proportion of patients with primary refractory disease was 27.9%, including 10 individuals who were refractory to two or more courses of intensive chemotherapy, compared with 39.4% in the Admiral study. Moreover, in our analysis, 40% of patients were classified as having an adverse risk according to the ELN classification, whereas only 10% of patients in the Admiral trial had an adverse cytogenetic risk. With regard to prior treatments, the Admiral trial population largely received anthracycline‐based chemotherapy, with only 12.4% previously exposed to a TKI. In contrast, 67.5% of patients in our cohort had received a TKI before gilteritinib. Notably, 35 patients (17%), were refractory to or had relapsed after a less‐intensive regimen consisting of venetoclax and azacitidine and were considered ineligible for transplant. This subgroup experienced the poorest outcomes, with a 1‐year OS of 29%, likely due to a combination of older age (median age, 75 years), a high prevalence of adverse‐risk ELN features (54.3%), and secondary AML (51.4%). Despite differences in baseline characteristics and prior treatment histories, our study demonstrated an ORR (CR + CRi + CRp) of 52.2%, which is comparable to the 60% observed in the Admiral trial, with a similar median OS (10.3 months vs. 9.3 months, respectively).

We acknowledge several limitations of our study. As with any retrospective analysis, there is a potential for selection bias and incomplete data capture. However, the inclusion of consecutive patients from multiple centers helps reduce this risk and enhances the generalizability of our findings. Measurable residual disease (MRD) data were not systematically collected, which limits our ability to evaluate the depth and durability of responses to gilteritinib. Nevertheless, this reflects the reality of clinical practice during the study period, when MRD assessment was not yet widely implemented outside of clinical trials. Additionally, response assessments were determined by treating clinicians rather than through standardized bone marrow evaluations at predefined intervals. Although this may have introduced some variability, it also mirrors real‐world practice, where rigid response monitoring is often not feasible. Despite these constraints, our results provide valuable insights into the use of gilteritinib in routine clinical settings.

To date, seven other real‐world studies on gilteritinib have been published. Notably, patients enrolled in real‐world settings often differ significantly from those in clinical trials, because they are commonly excluded from such trials due to poor performance status or extensive prior treatments. For example, in the observational study by the French AML Intergroup ALFA/FILO,12a substantial proportion of patients received gilteritinib in later lines of therapy, with 37.1% treated beyond the second line. Additionally, baseline performance status was considerably poorer, with 83.6% of patients having an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score ≥2, compared to only 16.6% in the Admiral trial. Similarly, the Japanese post‐marketing surveillance study reported 23.4% of patients with ECOG ≥2 and 75% with multiple comorbidities, further illustrating that many patients treated in real‐world practice would not meet clinical trial eligibility criteria.9In the UK cohort, 36% of patients received at least two prior lines of therapy before starting gilteritinib. Prior treatments included intensive chemotherapy (79%), venetoclax (24%), allogeneic HSCT (19%), andFLT3inhibitors—most commonly midostaurin (41%).14Despite these differences in patient populations, clinical outcomes in real‐world studies were broadly consistent with those observed in the Admiral trial, as summarized in Table4. Composite CR rates ranged from 43.4% in our cohort to 20.5% in the UK study, whereas median overall survival ranged from 11.8 to 6.2 months. Taken together, these real‐world data support the clinical utility of gilteritinib in a broader patient population, including individuals with poor performance status or those who are heavily pretreated—groups typically underrepresented in clinical trials. In conclusion, this real‐world analysis from the Italian EAP demonstrates that patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated with gilteritinib achieved clinical outcomes comparable to those observed in the pivotal Admiral trial. These findings further support the effectiveness of gilteritinib in a more heterogeneous patient population. Further studies are warranted to optimize patient selection, enhance response rates, and improve long‐term outcomes.
