To determine the presence of acute myocardial dysfunction in status asthmaticus.

From 2006 to 2025, we studied severe asthma patients, healthy controls, and weightlifters performing bench press. Group differences were evaluated using echocardiography with Speckle Tracking by velocity vector imaging (VVI). Asthma patients were followed for 6 months.

Of 357 participants, 169 were controls. The median age of asthmatic patients (n= 188) was 58.11 ± 12.97 years, comparable to controls. Thirty-one patients died. All patients with severe asthma demonstrated reduced biventricular strain. After bench press, all echocardiographic values were higher compared to non-sportsmen and asthmatic patients. Acute asthma patients demonstrated lower strain in the four cavities, and more asynchrony versus controls. Right ventricular global longitudinal strain was ([− 27.56 ± 4.56] in the control group, [− 24.08 ± 1.23] in the basal weightlifters’ group, [− 30.88 ± 1.02] after bench press and [− 17.98 ± 2.57] in severe asthma, p value = 0.0001). Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (%) were (− 21.02 ± 3.28, − 19.34 ± 3.78, − 25.21 ± 9.32, − 14.88 ± 1.27, p value = 0.012) respectively. Multivariate analysis identified right atrial pump strain (OR 0.457 [0.189–0.746]) and as factors associated with mortality. Mechanical Ventilation was associated with RVGLS (OR 0.637, CI 95% [0.248–0.925]) and right atrial pump strain (OR 0.783, CI 95% [0.349–0.967]). At 6 months follow-up, asthmatic patients exhibited lower deformity parameters and decreased Speckle Tracking vectorial velocity analysis in all cardiac chambers compared to control groups.

Patients with acute asthma exhibit decreased strain in all cardiac chambers, which remains reduced at the six-month follow-up. Asthma may contribute to latent heart failure.

Severe asthma or status asthmaticus can lead to ICU admission due to exacerbations caused by multiple factors. It is primarily a respiratory disease but can affect pulmonary vascularization. Recent studies using 2D echocardiography and tissue Doppler suggest that severe asthma may cause right heart overload, pulmonary hypertension, and systolic or diastolic dysfunction [1].

While severe asthma is generally regarded as a respiratory condition, the heart should ideally function normally, or even better during an exacerbation, similar to how athletes’ hearts perform during exercise. Nonetheless, if asthma precipitates latent heart failure, an exacerbation could potentially aggravate heart failure and deteriorate the patient’s overall health [2].

Severe asthma exacerbations may be associated with latent cardiac dysfunction not detectable by routine echocardiographic parameters. However, there is a lack of data in this area. This observational study aimed to use speckle tracking echocardiography to detect subclinical cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult asthmatic patients. Early detection of cardiac dysfunction may help with risk stratification in the acute phase of illness as well as help identify those who may benefit from cardiology follow up after ICU discharge [3,4].

We hypothesise that ICU patients with severe asthma show widespread cardiovascular changes, causing biventricular and biatrial dysfunction detectable by VVI speckle tracking echocardiography.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential presence of heart failure using VVI speckle tracking echocardiography in severe acute asthma patients who required ICU admission. Secondary objectives included assessing whether these echocardiographic parameters are associated with ICU mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill patients with severe asthma.

This observational study was conducted in the Intensive Care Units of University Hospital of Jaén and University Hospital of Torrecárdenas, involving patients with acute asthma, a control group of healthy individuals, and athletes undergoing physical exercise. The study period is from to January 2006 to May 2025, excluding 2020–2022 due to Covid-19. Follow-up assessments were done at hospital discharge and after 6 months using Speckle Tracking VVI echocardiography.

All participants provided informed consent before the commencement of the study, which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ensuring the adherence to ethical clinical practices as well as to applicable laws and regulations. This work received support from PAIDI CTS 606 and the Andalusian Health Service Project no. “PI-0585-2012 Ecocardiografía en Medicina Crítica. Detección de la disfunción Miocárdica del Paciente Crítico e interacción entre la ecocardiografía y la ventilación mecánica”; both approved by the local ethics committee and funded by the Department of Health of the regional government of Andalusia, Spain.

Asthmatic groups:Patients with a confirmed asthma diagnosis requiring ICU admission were included. Figure1.

Patients included in the study had severe asthma requiring ICU admission, without heart failure, cardiovascular events, ischemic heart disease, or a previously normal echocardiography without Speckle Tracking upon admission. Additionally, echocardiography needed to be feasible within the first 24 h post-admission. All patients received standard management from the responsible intensivist, utilizing various medications such as salbutamol, magnesium, epinephrine, ipratropium bromide, sodium hemisuccinate 6-methylprednisolone, and sedation if necessary.

Patients were excluded from the study if they had a prior cardiac arrest, multiorgan failure upon arrival, were transferred for ECMO, were under 14 years old, or had a Covid infection.

To evaluate these participants, two control groups were used: one with non-athletes and the other with trained athletes. The athletes underwent a bench press exercise to exhaustion to evaluate their cardiac response to stress. Figure1.

The control group consisted of healthy individuals who were neither athletes nor trained in strength exercises like bench press. This group did not participate in any exercise and results were used to determine baseline values for echocardiographic variables.

Athletes specializing in weightlifting, along with 27 who practiced Kumite karate Shotokan and kendo, voluntarily participated in a study to evaluate their cardiac function response to exercise. The study included athletes aged 20 to 65 years, defined as individuals achieving over 3000 MET/min per week of physical activity, according to the IPAQ (Spanish version, 2002).

Measurements were taken before and after exercise. Echocardiography was performed immediately prior to strength training. Following the echocardiography, the bench press exercise was performed. Subsequently, a new echocardiography was done immediately after the exercise. The degree of strength training was assessed by the maximum load for 1 repetition maximum (RM). This test was performed at least three days before the bench press study to prevent muscle fatigue. To assess chest strength and prevent injuries, participants were instructed to follow this protocol: 1. Start with a light-load warm-up set allowing you to perform 10 repetitions. 2. Rest for one minute. 3. Perform another series with a load that allows for 3–5 repetitions (this usually involves increasing the load by 5–10%). 4. Rest for two minutes. 5. Increase the load again (by 5–10%) so that you can complete 2–3 repetitions. 6. Rest for four minutes. 7. Increase the load again (by 5–10%) so that you can complete a single, correct repetition. 8. Rest for four minutes and then increase weight moderately again (5–10%) and repeat the test. 9. If you cannot lift the weight, after a four- minute break reduce load by 2.5-5%) and repeat. Continue increasing or decreasing the weight as necessary to determine your one-repetition maximum (1 RM). After determining the training load using the 1 RM test, a total of 10 replicates were estimated. The training protocol is based on 10 sets of 10 repetitions with 75% of 1 RM, each with a break of 1’30” between sets. After this exercise (series and rest included) an echocardiography was performed.

All eligible patients received transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with images saved as digital DICOM files, archived on magneto-optical discs and DVDs. Most studies used the Sequoia c512 system; additional equipment included Acuson SC 2000, Siemens Medical Systems (Mountain View, CA, USA), Phillips iE33, and Epiq CX50. In some intubated asthmatic patients, TTE and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were performed. Echocardiographic variables were assessed both online and offline utilizing Syngo software, Siemens®U.S., and Tomtec Arena (Tomtec). In earlier studies utilizing appropriate frame rates, speckle tracking was retrospectively conducted using frame rates of 70–120 frames per second and multiple focal points. All images were optimized for gain, compression, and dynamic range. Data were stored in a dissociated database to ensure blinding throughout the study. Cardiac function and stress response among asthmatic patients, a control group, and athletes were evaluated through offline analysis using hybrid speckle tracking with Velocity Vector Imaging (Syngo Software, Siemens®, U.S. 2013) and Tomtec Arena Software (Tomtec). Longitudinal strain of both ventricles and the right atrium was quantified via Velocity Vector Imaging (Syngo, Siemens®U.S. 2013), while left atrial strain was measured using the autostrain feature within Tomtec Arena software (https://www.tomtec.de/excellence-in-digital-healthcare/). The Philips®autostrain software (2021) was compared with Speckle Tracking by velocity vector imagen (VVI) by Syngo, Siemens®2013 software in the control group. Through strain analysis, we thoroughly assessed the three primary atrial functions: the reservoir phase (Ss), during which blood flow is temporarily stored; the conduit phase (SE), facilitating blood flow into the ventricles during relaxation; and the booster pump phase (SA), corresponding to atrial contraction. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was estimated using the Nagueh [5,6] and Kuecherer formulas [7].

The normal value for left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) is generally (−20), while for right ventricular global longitudinal strain (RVGLS), a value higher than (−25) is considered normal [8–11]. We have determined that myocardial dysfunction is present when LVGLS is less than (−17) or RVGLS is less than (−20).

Normality and homoscedasticity were assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Quantitative variables were analysed with ANOVA and Student’s t-test, while nonparametric tests like Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon were used for non-normal distributions. Exploratory analysis focused on ICU mortality and MV needs without predictive analysis. Binary logistic regression assessed variables related to mortality and MV use. The concordance between Syngo software and Autostrain Tomtec Arena measurements was evaluated via Bland-Altman plots. Figure2. Quantitative variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and qualitative variables as absolute (n) and relative frequency (%). A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS version 30 software (Chicago, USA).

Thirty-fifty-seven individuals participated in the study, 169 of them were part of the control groups, and one hundred eighty-eight patients were included with a diagnosis of severe asthma. Among them, 92 were female (48.9%) and the participants mean age was 58.11 ± 12.97 years. Thirty-two patients (17.0%) had diabetes, 49 (26.1%) had hypertension, 11 (5.8%) were smokers, and 67 (35.6%) had hypercholesterolemia. Tables1and2. Figure1. One hundred seventy-eight patients underwent an echocardiography without Speckle Tracking prior to the asthmatic condition, with no evidence of structural heart disease.

The forced expiratory volume in the 1 st second or FEV1, forced vital capacity or FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio were [(76.12 ± 14.27%), (90.45 ± 6.37%), (84.86 ± 10.57%), respectively]. Forty-four patients (23.40%) needed invasive MV for an average of 7.38 ± 3.28 days, while 21 patients (11.17%) required non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 3.12 ± 1.18 days. Twenty-nine patients (15.4%) died during admission, and 31 (16.5%) died at the 6-month follow-up. The average APACHE II score was 21.78 ± 3.18 points.

In the first 12 h, 32 asthma patients had temporary ST-segment elevation in V5, which normalized within a week. The average QTc was 426.36 ± 16.48 ms, with T wave flattening in V1 to V3 in 27 patients. Fourteen coronary angiographies showed normal results. Twelve atrial fibrillation episodes were detected, three recurrent. In 38 patients (20.2%), troponin T levels were elevated for at least a week, and brain natriuretic peptide was elevated in 57 patients (30.3%). Table2shows the physiological variables of the groups studied, with 36 asthmatic patients developing apical ballooning observed by 2D echocardiography.

The parasternal long-axis and apical 4-chamber projections showed high concordance and there was a strong interobserver agreement. In 7 patients, dynamic obstruction was detected, while in 13 patients’ functional mitral regurgitation occurred. Both conditions resolved within a week. Generally, the control group of healthy non-sportsmen participants showed better values derived from Speckle Tracking in the 4 cardiac chambers compared to weightlifters at baseline; however, after exercise, all values increased in the weightlifter group. Asthmatic patients had a higher estimated PCWP, a higher tricuspid regurgitation velocity, a shorter pulmonary flow acceleration time (PFAT). Asthmatic patients also showed normal mean LVEF and RVEF but had ventricular dysfunction. We determined a RVGLS averaged − 17.98 ± 2.57(%) and LVGLS averaged − 14.88 ± 1.27(%), both significantly lower than controls and athletes, particularly post-exercise. Asthmatic patients exhibited a lower velocity-time integral (VTI) in the left ventricular outflow tract and reduced isovolumic acceleration (IVA) compared to non-sportsmen and athletes after performing a bench press [(15.54 ± 3.28, 22.12 ± 09.37 and 36.12 ± 10.07 cm,p< 0.001), (0.89 ± 0.37, 2.67 ± 0.38 and 6.11 ± 0.87 m/s²,p< 0.001)], respectively, which supports the values detected by strain. PCWP estimation was conducted using two different equations and methods indicated that PCWP was higher in asthmatic patients compared to non-athletes and athletes. Table3. Figures3and4.

Asthmatic patients showed greater left ventricular asynchrony, measured by the delay in longitudinal strain between septal and lateral segments. The delay was notably higher in status asthmaticus compared to non-athletes and athletes (188.32 ± 13.41 vs. 61.32 ± 11.28 and 41.57 ± 2.38 ms respectively,p< 0.001). The biauricular strain could be performed very easily in both atria, showing in the reservoir (SS), conduit (SE) and pump (SA) phases a very significant lower value in asthmatics than in the rest of the groups.

The interventricular septum motion to the left in systole suggested RV pressure overload in all patients. Patients on mechanical ventilation had significantly better right ventricular function, as indicated by higher TAPSE, 2D RV fractional shortening, and IVA (1.25 ± 0.02 vs. 0.78 ± 01.3 m/s²), and showed improved VVI Speckle Tracking parameters compared to those not requiring MV. Right intraventricular asynchrony, reflected by deformation delays between basolateral and basal-septal walls, was linked to MV need. This parameter was assessed in 36 out of 44 patients with MV using transthoracic echocardiography, and it was determined in all patients using transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Table4. Multivariate analysis identified the following echocardiographic parameters as variables associated with the need for MV in asthmatic patients: RVGLS (OR 0.538, CI 95% [0.213–0.894]), right intraventricular asynchrony (OR 1.425, CI 95% [1.125–2.361]), and IVA (OR 0.834, CI 95% [0.457–0.891]). If we consider intraventricular asynchrony a confounding variable by RVGLS and remove it from the analysis, the remaining variables are RVGLS (OR 0.637, CI 95% [0.248–0.925]) and right atrial pump strain (OR 0.783, CI 95% [0.349–0.967]). Table4.

ICU mortality was recorded in 29 patients, and cumulative mortality over the following 6 months was observed in 31 patients (16.49%). A bivariate analysis of ICU mortality in severe asthma patients revealed significant associations with age, hypercholesterolemia, MV use, APACHE 2 score, elevated troponin levels, IVA, RVGLS, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, PFAT, RVOT VTI, PCWP estimated by Kuecherer on transoesophageal echocardiography, and all deformity parameters in both atria. Table5.

The multivariate analysis conducted to determine associations with cumulative mortality in severe asthma patients at hospital discharge and at 6-month follow-up identified that the variables independently associated are right atrial strain in the pump phase (SA) OR 0.457 (95% CI [0.189–0.746]).

When comparing non-athletic controls with asthmatic patients both at admission and at the 6-month follow-up, our observations indicated that while TAPSE showed improvement, IVA, biventricular and biauricular deformity, were found to be lower. Additionally, the PCWP remained elevated in asthmatic patients. Table6.

In the present study we found that all asthmatic patients, despite having a normal TAPSE, RVEF and LVEF, presented severe deterioration of strain in the 4 cardiac chambers which could indicate that they all have myocardial dysfunction. Similarly, we have also detected that asthmatic patients have elevated end-diastolic pressures, suggesting that they also have diastolic dysfunction. In addition, these asthmatic patients present right intraventricular asynchrony, all of which is compatible with ventricular and atrial dysfunction. One possible explanation could be biventricular systolic and diastolic involvement, in addition to changes in transmural pressures and the increase in pulmonary resistances. This follows the theory of Francisco Torrent-Guasp under which the fibres that make up the heart induce systolic and diastolic dysfunction at the same time, because systolic and diastolic function is a “continuum.” [12,13].

Diagnosing exacerbations in critically ill adults is challenging, especially when asthma and heart failure coexist with features like reduced RVGLS and right ventricular asynchrony [14]. Elevated PCWP in asthmatic patients suggests both precapillary and postcapillary oedema in status asthmaticus. Left atrial dilatation and reduced strain in the left and right atrial during reservoir, conduit, and pump phases indicate diastolic dysfunction or atrial myopathy, which can trigger atrial fibrillation episodes in severe asthma [15,16].

Interestingly, we found a low incidence of dynamic acceleration, which could be related to the age of the patients, the absence of sigmoid septum and mitral annulus calcifications, which are the main factors for its induction.

Previous studies by our group [17–20] and Abbas et al. [18,19] have confirmed ventricular strain alterations in asthma. Additionally, other researchers have found that speckle tracking echocardiography can detect early right ventricular systolic dysfunction, which worsens with asthma severity [21–23]. Özde et al. [24] suggest that subclinical myocardial dysfunction may improve with asthma treatment and can be monitored via speckle tracking. Although there are many heterogeneous studies, they all concur in finding cardiac dysfunction in severe asthma. Here we show for the first time a dysfunction in all four cardiac chambers as well as the aorta.

This study, along with previously cited research, indicates that severe asthma may lead to myocardial dysfunction. This dysfunction could be reversible and like cases of asthma-induced Takotsubo syndrome [25–28], or alternatively, asthma might cause myocardial fiber injury resulting in latent myocardial dysfunction [21–24]. Our investigation included a cohort of non-athletic individuals to establish baseline values, alongside athletes subjected to exhaustive exercise, which led to the release of interleukin 6. In these non-asthmatic athletes, myocardial fibers exhibited appropriate physiological responses by increasing their velocities, deformity, and displacement [29]. It is possible that asthma induces non-reversible muscle fiber injury, which is responsible for maintaining latent myocardial dysfunction.

In addition, we showed that the heart of an asthmatic patient exhibits deterioration in all values detected by VVI speckle tracking. At six months, asthmatic patients have worse VVI speckle tracking values than the normal population, suggesting latent cardiac dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction that regular echocardiography might miss but Speckle Tracking can detect [22].

Considering this dysfunction, the question about the aetiology of cardiovascular system dysfunction naturally arises. The answer is unknown and likely multifactorial [30], involving changes in transmural pressure, preload, afterload, ventricular interdependence, immunological responses, inflammatory processes, catecholaminergic reactions, critical situations, hypoxemia, and the administration of cardiotoxic drugs. Asthma involves an immunological alteration [31,32] that induces a sustained inflammatory response [33–36], which could be included in metabolic syndrome [37,38]. Understanding that asthma has an inflammatory aetiology, the cardiovascular system may also be affected [35,36,39], consistent with cases of myocarditis [27,28,33–35,40–43]. This would also explain the elevation of troponins or other biological markers. Asthma generates elevated Interleukin 6, related to a chronic inflammatory state, potentially inducing myocardial dysfunction. However, this is not the only explanation, as athletes also elevate Interleukin 6 after strenuous exercise, yet their cardiovascular response remains optimal. Another possible explanation could be the production of catecholaminergic cardiomyopathy due to the release of endogenous and exogenous catecholamines [26,42–45].

Cardiotoxicity potentially caused by therapeutic management is another consideration, although this effect remains under debate [46–47] Turcatel et al. [48] utilized artificial intelligence to evaluate 1,331,934 asthma patients and predicted that factors associated with exacerbations included a history of exacerbation, prednisone use, high-dose albuterol use, and elevated troponin I levels. However, beta-stimulants are commonly used as doping agents among athletes without reducing strain in healthy individuals [49,50]. Another asthma medication, which has been associated with heart failure, is currently under review. The CORTAHF pilot trial indicates that a 7-day treatment with prednisone for patients with elevated Interleukin 6 may improve quality of life in heart failure [51].

The development of heart failure -whether clinical or subclinical- has important clinical implications, given that classic cardiological complications may develop, such as shock, arrhythmias [52], the need for mechanical ventilation [53] or even ECMO [54].

Asthma can have severe complications, including mortality. This study identifies Atrial SA (right atrial pump) and DTA rotational displacement as factors associated with asthma-related mortality, which may result from myocardial dysfunction and pre- and postcapillary oedema. Atrial strain is asociated of various cardiovascular events and are linked to increased mortality in asthma [55–60]. This association could be due to atrial dysfunction or atrial myopathy leading to episodes of arrhythmias in severe asthma cases [15,56].

In severe asthma cases, elevated levels of troponins or brain natriuretic peptide are indicative of a poor prognosis and potential exacerbations [56]. Asthma may serve as a predictor of cardiovascular disease and is associated with acute myocardial infarction [57], thereby worsening the prognosis and extending hospital stays [58–62].

Another significant clinical implication is the therapeutic management of severe asthma, which may involve precapillary and postcapillary oedema, arrhythmias, or other cardiovascular complications. In addition to standard treatment protocols [53,63,64], consideration should be given to the incorporation of cardioprotective medications, such as vasodilators or aldosterone inhibitors.

The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to its extended cohort and reliance on echocardiographic data without the necessary patients or variables for a multivariate predictive study of mortality. Pharmacological management was not considered, and heart failure in any patient cannot be definitively ruled out despite the absence of related symptoms and normal baseline echocardiograms.

It is primarily an echocardiographic study, providing haemodynamic (e.g. cardiac output), ventilatory and clinical data, which are obviously essential for intensivists and for establishing adequate predictive studies. Our aim was to determine if myocardial dysfunction existed. Furthermore, this study was conducted over an extended period during which clinical classifications, therapeutic approaches, and technological advancements evolved, potentially introducing bias, despite the consistent use of the same software throughout. Additionally, the cohort analyzed was relatively small, with a limited number of deaths, few patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and a short duration of follow-up. Although the sample size is small, this study indicates that all echocardiographic parameters improve after MV. This may be due to ventilatory recruitment, reduced resistance from therapeutic changes like the AnaConDa system, or the effects of PEEP and positive pressure on myocardial fibre geometry and deformity. We have observed that VTI is associated with mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism [55]. In asthmatic patients, the VTI remains above 12 cm but does not reach 20 cm; this may be related to the administration of catecholaminergic drugs, which may increase the VTI in patients with low cardiac output. Asthma or mechanical ventilation may affect left ventricular filling velocity, such as transmitral E-wave and tissue Doppler basal segment velocities, and changes in the left atrium can alter atrial filling phases, potentially causing echocardiographic equations for predicting PCWP to be inaccurate. However, recent evidence suggests these formulas are robust [5].

The study aims to assess the hypothesis that Speckle Tracking is a more sensitive approach to detect myocardial dysfunction in asthmatic patients. The study suggests that asthma may lead to right and left heart failure with pre- and postcapillary oedema. It may be beneficial to perform an echocardiogram to evaluate at least the strain and the E/E’ ratio, which could potentially alter therapeutic approaches. In estimating high diastolic pressure, consideration should be given to using vasodilators and reducing cardiotoxic therapy.

Patients with acute asthma exhibit decreased strain in all cardiac chambers, which remains reduced at the six-month follow-up. Asthma may contribute to latent heart failure.
