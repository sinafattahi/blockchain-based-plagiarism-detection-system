Calorie preference refers to an individual's systematic inclination toward selecting foods based on their caloric density. The causal impact of dietary calorie preference on cancer development remains uncertain.

In this study, data on dietary calorie preference were sourced from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) database of food liking, while information on 18 cancer types was obtained from Finger R9 database. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the causal effects of Calorie Dietary Liking on 18 types of cancers. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was the primary analytical approach, with significant correlations further examined using Egger regression, MR-PRESSO, and weighted median methods.

Our analyses revealed that a genetically predicted preference for high-calorie diets significantly raised the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.175 to 2.598), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.147 to 1.693), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.097 to 3.866), and gastric cancer (GC) (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.087 to 1.991). Further subgroup analyses confirmed that high-calorie foods liking, particularly cheese liking, were strongly linked to an elevated HCC risk (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.509 to 3.899), while deep-fried food liking were associated with increased NSCLC risk (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.073 to 1.490). Low-calorie dietary liking showed causal association with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.745 to 0.965).

This comprehensive MR analysis suggested that genetically predicted high-calorie food liking, as well as its subgroups, may be a risk factor in the development of NHL, NSCLC, HCC, and GC. A low-calorie diet may have a protective effect on the risk of PCa.

Numerous epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between food consumption and cancer risk, focusing primarily on the effects of individual dietary factors. For instance, a Mendelian randomization study highlighted a significant link between the intake of dried fruits, beer, and cheese and an increased risk of lung cancer [9]. Additionally, various epidemiological studies have reported a protective association between coffee consumption and reduced incidence of cancers such as colorectal [10], prostate [11], liver [12], and endometrial [13]. However, population diets are better represented by holistic dietary patterns, which encompass the interactive combinations of foods and nutrients, rather than focusing solely on individual foods or nutrients. The impact of overall dietary choices, particularly caloric liking (the hedonic preference for calorie-dense foods driven by biological and environmental factors), remains understudied. Recent advances suggest diet’s role in non-communicable diseases is better captured through dietary patterns than isolated nutrients [14]. Understanding how caloric liking influences cancer incidence is critical for prevention and mortality reduction.

Mendelian randomization (MR) studies use common genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to make causal inferences [15]. In this approach, genetic variants linked to a particular exposure (such as caloric food liking) are identified through a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) and applied to an independent dataset to provide an unbiased estimate of the exposure-outcome relationship [16]. By using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with exposure factors as instrumental variables (IVs), MR simulates random allocation, thereby helping to control for confounding factors. This method aims to more reliably uncover causal relationships between exposure factors and disease outcomes, offering a novel approach for exploring the causal links between caloric food liking and cancers.

In this study, the causal associations between 18 dietary calorie liking (including 2 dietary calorie liking and 16 dietary liking segmented by calories) and 18 common cancers were analyzed using two-sample univariate MR analyses. It is important to note that this study adheres strictly to the fundamental assumptions of MR analysis, which include the following: (1) establishing a robust relationship between IVs and exposure, (2) ensuring that IVs are independent of potential confounding factors, and (3) confirming that IVs only exert a direct impact on the results through exposure. Ethical approval was not required due to this study solely used public GWAS summary data. The flowchart is depicted in Fig.1.

A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) focused on food liking [17], specifically calorie intake, was chosen as the exposure to investigate its potential causal relationship with 18 different cancers. High/low caloric liking was defined based on the hierarchical food-liking tree’s three higher-order factors (F-traits) derived from genetic and phenotypic clustering of 87 foods [17]: F-Highly palatable: Preference for energy-dense foods (e.g., sweets, fried foods, processed meats) with high fat/sugar content, validated by genetic correlations with obesity traits (higher BMI, body fat) and lower socioeconomic status. F-Low-caloric: Preference for nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods (e.g., vegetables, fruits, whole grains), associated with healthier lifestyles (higher physical activity, dietary supplement use) and lower urinary sodium/creatinine. F-Acquired: Preference for culturally acquired tastes (e.g., coffee, alcohol, spicy foods), linked to mixed health outcomes (e.g., lower obesity but higher smoking/alcohol use). From this GWAS, 154998 European males and females were selected as part of the exposure cohort. The study, participants, and quality control have been described previously [18]. Additional details on the exposures GWAS are provided in Supplementary Table S1. The meticulous selection of IVs is widely recognized as fundamental to ensuring the robustness of MR analysis results. Initially, SNPs for target diseases were screened based on a threshold ofP< 5 × 10–8. If more than three SNPs were obtained, a threshold ofP< 5 × 10–8was applied; conversely,P< 5 × 10–6was used as the screening criterion. SNPs with a physical distance of at least 10,000 kb and lower linkage disequilibrium (R2< 0.001) were kept for further analysis. We removed SNPs directly linked to cancer or common confounders in carcinogenesis, such as smoking [19], alcohol use [20], and obesity [21] using LDlink (https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=ldtrait). Information on the excluded SNPs and their associated traits can be found in Supplementary Table S2. To mitigate weak instrument bias, we assessed the strength of the SNP-exposure associations using the F-statistic (F = beta/se)2for each SNP, considering values greater than 10 as indicative of a robust association between the selected instrumental variables and the exposure [22]. We first classified total dietary calorie liking into two groups: low-calorie and high-calorie food liking, to conduct an overall causal analysis of 18 cancer types. Cancer types showing statistically significant causal associations were subsequently selected for further analysis based on specific dietary calorie liking. Subtypes of low-calorie diet liking included a strong liking for vegetables, salad vegetables, cooked vegetables, fish, fruits, and dairy products. Meanwhile, high-calorie diet liking included liking for fried foods, fatty or savory dishes, carbohydrates, desserts, cheese, deep-fried fish, and cakes or cookies.

This study evaluated the causal associations between dietary calorie liking and various cancer types, including brain, lung, esophageal, stomach, liver, pancreatic, colorectal (colon and rectal), bladder, prostate, thyroid, ovarian, cervical, kidney, breast cancers, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The data for all 18 cancer types were sourced from the FinnGen R9 database (https://r9.finngen.fi/). Cancer cases are identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) -10 codes and morphology codes (ICD-O-3) from the Finnish Cancer Registry, supplemented by histopathological confirmation in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) (https://www.finngen.fi/en/researchers/clinical-endpoints). Further details on the datasets can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Ethical approval and participant consent were secured in all of the original studies, though neither was required for this study.

The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was primarily employed to estimate the causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed using the weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Egger techniques. Results are expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To ensure the robustness of our findings, we assessed heterogeneity among individual SNPs using Cochran’s Q statistic. If substantial heterogeneity was detected, we applied the IVW random-effects model for adjustment [23,24]. The MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) method, which identifies and corrects for horizontal pleiotropy by removing outliers, was also used to evaluate pleiotropy [25]. When significant pleiotropy was identified, outlier SNPs were excluded, and adjusted ORs and CIs were calculated using the MR-PRESSO approach. AP-value greater than 0.05 was taken as an indication of no significant heterogeneity or pleiotropy among the SNPs. Additionally, a leave-one-out test was conducted to assess the influence of outlying or pleiotropic SNPs on the causal estimates [26]. Any MR results that still exhibited significant heterogeneity or pleiotropy after MR-PRESSO outlier removal were excluded from the meta-analysis [27]. The choice between fixed-effects and random-effects models depended on the degree of heterogeneity. If the I2value was ≤ 50%, the fixed-effects model was used; otherwise, for I2> 50%, indicating considerable heterogeneity, the random-effects model was applied. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.2. A significance level ofP< 0.05 was set to infer genetic causation. Specifically, aP< 0.05 and an odds ratio (OR) > 1 indicated positive genetic causation, while an OR < 1 suggested a negative genetic causal association. Additionally, we used the MR Steiger directionality test to examine whether exposure was directionally causal for the outcome [28].

In this study, 6 SNPs were used as instruments for low-calorie food liking and 12 SNPs for high-calorie food liking. Within the low-calorie food liking subgroups, SNPs were employed as follows: 12 for cooking vegetable liking, 23 for dairy liking, 26 for fish liking, 14 for fruit liking, 10 for salad vegetable liking, 22 for strong vegetable liking, and 12 for vegetarian liking. In the high-calorie food liking subgroup, the SNP distribution was: 17 for cake/biscuit liking, 3 for carbohydrate liking, 14 for cheese liking, 7 for deep-fried food liking, 14 for dessert liking, 12 for fatty/salty food liking, and 12 for oily fish liking. as shown in Supplementary table S3-6.

Firstly, we initially used two large groups (low-caloric food and savour/caloric food liking) to determine the causal relationship between dietary calorie liking and cancer. We found a causal relationship between low caloric food liking and prostate cancer (OR: 0.848; 95% CI 0.745 to 0.965;P= 0.013) (Fig.2A and Supplementary tables S7). People who preferred high calorie diet have causal relationship with the incidence rate of NSCLC (OR: 1.394; 95% CI 1.147 to 1.693;P= 0.000), HCC (OR: 2.059; 95% CI 1.097 to 3.866;P= 0.025), GC (OR: 1.471; 95% CI 1.087 to 1.991;P= 0.012) and NHL (OR: 1.747; 95% CI 1.175 to 2.598;P= 0.006). With the exception of the tumors mentioned above, none of the other types of cancer were causally associated with dietary caloric liking (Fig.2B and Supplementary tables S8). Subsequent subgroups causal analyses of low-calorie dietary liking showed that no specific 7 low-calorie food liking was causally associated with prostate cancer (Fig.3A, Supplementary Table S9). In the subgroup causality analyses of high-calorie diet liking, NSCLC (OR: 1.264; 95% CI 1.073 to 1.490;P= 0.005) was found to have a causal association with deep-fried food liking, while HCC (OR: 2.426; 95% CI 1.509 to 3.899;P= 0.000) and NHL (OR: 0.635; 95% CI 0.455 to 0.884;P= 0.007) were both causally linked to cheese liking. No significant associations were observed for GC in the subgroup analyses (Fig.3B, Supplementary Table S10).

Our study found no evidence of potential pleiotropy (Supplementary tables S7-10). However, a significant heterogeneity effect was observed, leading us to use the random-effects IVW method as the primary analytical approach. For dietary habits without significant heterogeneity in the MR analysis, the fixed-effect IVW method was applied. After the random-effects IVW method is carried out, the results obtained are the same as fixed-effect IVW. The MR-PRESSO global test identified no significant outliers in all results. The Steiger directionality test confirmed the causal direction of dietary liking and cancer (Supplementary tables S7-10). In the sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, we performed a leave-one-out analysis by excluding one significant SNP at a time. For all associations with cancer, the leave-one-out estimates were also statistically significant. The results obtained using the weighted median method, weighted mode, and the MR-Egger method largely aligned with the trends observed in the IVW method, although someP-values slightly exceeded the 0.05 threshold. Additionally, scatter plots were created to visualize the primary findings. Funnel plots further validated the robustness of the IVW method results (Supplementary figure S1-71).

This study has several limitations. First, all analyses were conducted exclusively with European participants, which limits the ability to generalize the findings to other populations. Additionally, although the largest available GWAS datasets were used to identify genetic variants, the instrumental variables explained only a small portion of trait variance, which reduced statistical power and limited the ability to detect weak to moderate associations for many dietary factors. Finally, while our study demonstrated that high-calorie dietary patterns contribute to an increased cancer risk, only one significant association was found between low-calorie diets and cancer risk. This result contrasts with findings from other epidemiological studies, highlighting the need for larger GWAS datasets to validate our conclusions.
