Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a considerable global health challenge, notably due to the resistance to sorafenib therapy, which significantly impedes effective treatment strategies. This study aimed to identify potential resistance-associated genes and develop a robust prognostic model to predict patient outcomes.

We utilized transcriptomic data from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, focusing on sorafenib-resistant Huh7 and MHCC97H cell lines (GSE94550andGSE176151), and integrated expression, mutation, and clinical data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and international cancer genome consortium (ICGC) databases. Single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE149614) were processed with the Seurat and Harmony R packages for quality control and integration. Differential gene expression analysis, consensus clustering, and principal component analysis were performed to identify significant genes and stratify patients based on prognostic outcomes.

The analysis revealed 305 potential resistance-associated genes, with a seven-gene (ANAPC13, NCAPD2, KIF2C, CDK5RAP2, MANBA, PPAT, and LPCAT1) risk model demonstrating significant prognostic capability, indicated by area under curve values of 0.824, 0.746, and 0.717 for 1, 3, and 5-year survival predictions, respectively. Notably, immune cell infiltration analyses highlighted significant correlations between risk scores and specific immune cell types, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Drug sensitivity analysis further identified various compounds with lower IC50 values in high-risk groups. To facilitate clinical application, a nomogram plot was designed.

This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding sorafenib resistance in HCC, alongside a validated prognostic model that holds potential for clinical application.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health issue, ranking sixth in cancer incidence and third in cancer-related deaths [1]. Its strong association with chronic liver diseases, particularly hepatitis B and C, complicates prevention, control, and treatment efforts [2]. Although hepatitis virus vaccines have reduced HCC burden, overall cases continue to rise. Despite remarkable advances in medical science and technology, treating advanced HCC continues to pose difficulties. Despite remarkable advances in medical science and technology, treating advanced HCC continues to pose difficulties. Currently, immunotherapy and targeted therapies are key treatments for advanced HCC, with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, serving as the first-line agent [3]. Sorafenib demonstrates efficacy by promoting apoptosis, inducing ferroptosis, reducing angiogenesis, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation [4]. However, as clinical practice evolves, sorafenib resistance has emerged as a critical limitation to its effectiveness.

Sorafenib resistance can be categorized into primary and acquired type [5]. Primary resistance means that tumor cells naturally tolerate the drug, reducing its effectiveness. In contrast, acquired resistance develops as tumor cells gradually adapt to the pharmacological environment during treatment, leading to a progressive decline in therapeutic efficacy. This complex form of drug resistance is influenced not only by the biological characteristics of tumor cells but also by interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) [6]. Several mechanisms contribute to sorafenib resistance in HCC, such as autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inhibition of ferroptosis, and the survival of tumor-initiating cells [7]. These mechanisms form a complex network that allows tumor cells to escape the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib. For example, in hypoxic conditions, the activation of fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells can further enhance resistance to sorafenib [8]. The TME is composed of various cell types, such as fibroblasts, immune-inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes, all of which play a role in the development of drug resistance. These cells interact with tumor cells by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which collectively foster the emergence of drug resistance. Additionally, hypoxia not only boosts autophagy, which negatively affects the efficacy of sorafenib, but also promotes resistance through alternative mechanisms [9]. Changes in signaling pathways within tumor cells are crucial in the context of drug resistance. For instance, sorafenib can inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells that are influenced by macrophages by blocking the release of insulin-like growth factor from M2 macrophages [10]. However, tumor cells have the ability to evade the effects of treatment by modifying their internal signaling pathways. Recent research has pinpointed the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 as potential paracrine factors secreted by M2 tumor-associated macrophages, which contribute to sorafenib resistance in HCC cells via the CXCR2/ERK signaling pathway [11]. These discoveries underscore the intricate relationship between resistance-related genes and the TME, both of which play crucial roles in determining patient responses to therapy and their overall prognosis. Consequently, a deeper investigation into drug resistance-related genes and their interactions with the TME is essential for enhancing our understanding of how cancer cells acquire drug resistance. This insight will serve as a scientific foundation for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies, paving the way for innovative methods to predict the prognosis of HCC patients while also aiming to improve their quality of life and survival rates.

In this study, we initiated our research by gathering cell sequencing data related to sorafenib resistance in HCC from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, aiming to identify the genes associated with this resistance. Following this, we performed molecular typing using the identified potential resistance genes within the TCGA-LIHC cohort, which enabled us to investigate variations in pathological stratification, tumor gene mutations, prognosis, and relevant pathways across different types. We also created prognostic molecular models based on the resistance-associated genes and assessed their influence on patient outcomes and the TME. The analysis of the risk-prognostic model and gene subtypes provided fresh perspectives on precision treatment strategies for HCC immunotherapy, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making. Moreover, our findings serve as a valuable resource for future investigations into the mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance and the development of potential therapeutic approaches for HCC.

In this study, we carefully selected transcriptional data from the GEO database for an in vitro model of sorafenib resistance in the Huh7 HCC cell line (GSE94550) [12]and mRNA profiles comparing MHCC97H control cells to sorafenib-resistant cells (GSE176151) [13]. We downloaded expression data, mutation data, clinical follow-up information, and relevant pathological details for HCC from the TCGA database, alongside additional expression and clinical follow-up data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database.

The scRNA-seq data for 21 liver tissue samples from 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE149614:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). These samples were collected from four sites: primary tumor (Tumor,n= 10), portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT,n= 2), metastatic lymph node (Lymph,n= 1), and non-tumor liver (Normal,n= 8) [14]. The scRNA-seq data were processed using the Seurat R package (version 4.4.0). Quality control was conducted to filter out low-quality or dying cells based on the following criteria: nFeature_RNA > 500 and mitochondrial gene expression < 10%. Subsequently, all samples were integrated using the Harmony R package. For principal component analysis, the Seurat FindVariableFeatures function was employed to select the top 2,000 variable genes. Cell clustering was performed using the Seurat FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction was executed using the Seurat RunTSNE function with default settings. The FindAllMarkers function was utilized to identify specific gene markers for each cluster, with parameters set to min.pct = 0.25 and logfc.threshold = 0.25. Finally, cell clusters were annotated using classic markers: T cells (CD3E, CD3D), HSC (ACTA2), hepatocytes (APOE, ALB), endothelial cells (VWF, CLEC4G), B cells (MS4A1, CD79A), plasma cells (MZB1, CD38), macrophages (CD68, MARCO), and monocytes (S100A8, FCN1).

To identify drug resistance genes, we conducted an in-depth analysis of differential gene expression between resistant and normal cell lines in theGSE94550andGSE176151datasets using the limma package. We set the criteria for significant differential genes as |logFC| >1 and p-value < 0.01 to filter potential candidate genes. Following this, we employed Venn diagrams to pinpoint common differential genes present in both datasets, which we then regarded as potential resistance-related genes.

To gain a clearer understanding of the biological significance of the identified differential genes, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses with the R package “clusterProfiler,” using a statistical significance threshold of FDR < 0.05. Furthermore, to further explore the gene expression patterns, we conducted Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) using the GSVA package.

We employed the “ConsensusClusterPlus” R package, a clustering technique based on repetitive sampling for unsupervised cluster analysis, to categorize patients into two subclusters based on the expression matrix of drug resistance-related genes from the TCGA-LIHC cohort. Following this, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) using the “ggplot2” R package to investigate gene signatures within the HCC subclusters.

In this study, we utilized a decision tree-based random forest modeling algorithm to identify key genes significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. The random forest algorithm assesses feature importance by averaging the results from several decision trees. Initially, we identified candidate genes strongly associated with HCC prognosis using univariate Cox regression analysis, applying a stringent criterion ofp< 0.01. Next, we used the random forest algorithm to rank the importance of these candidate genes. This process allowed us to identify the top 10 as potential key candidates. We then performed undifferentiated combinations of these 10 genes and conducted Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis for each combination. To assess the statistical significance of these combinations, we applied a negative logarithmic transformation (-log10) to the p-values and ranked the combinations based on these transformed values. This process enabled us to identify statistically significant gene combinations with fewer genes, laying the groundwork for constructing an efficient and accurate survival prediction model.

We categorized HCC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the median risk score to compare their prognoses in both the training and validation sets. We conducted a survival analysis using the K-M method. Additionally, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the risk scores with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, employing the time-dependent ROC approach through the R package “survival-ROC.” Additionally, we employed a Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess the significance of each parameter on overall survival (OS), which refers to the duration of time from diagnosis or start of treatment until death from any cause. To further investigate the relationship between risk scores and prognosis, we performed a two-factor survival analysis combining risk scores with proliferation-related pathways.

In our study of potential drug candidates for high-risk populations, we used the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each patient with HCC. These values enabled us to assess therapeutic responses using data from the Genomics of Cancer Drug Sensitivity (GDSC) database. We correlated the risk scores with IC50 values to identify drugs that could benefit high-risk patients.

The proportional hazards assumption was tested and Cox regression was performed on Riskscore and Stage using the R survival package. Subsequently, a nomogram model was created and visualized with the rms package, followed by calibration analysis. The prognostic model was evaluated using the timeROC package, with visualization carried out via ggplot2. Finally, the prognostic model was fitted with the survival package, and decision curve analysis (DCA) analysis was conducted using the stdca.R package.

We utilized R software (version 4.4.1,https://www.r-project.org) to analyze data and generate graphs for this study. We assessed survival outcomes using the log-rank test and compared risk scores between the groups with the “wilcox.test” function.

We obtained transcriptome sequencing data from the GEO database for sorafenib-resistant cell lines, focusing on the Huh7 cell line. This dataset included three resistant lines and three untreated control lines (GSE94450), as well as theGSE176151dataset, which comprised the MHCC97H cell line with three resistant lines and three control lines. The comprehensive workflow diagram for this study is illustrated in Fig.1. In the GSE94450 dataset, we identified approximately 998 down-regulated genes and approximately 1,321 up-regulated genes (Fig.2A). In theGSE176151dataset, we found approximately 872 down-regulated genes and approximately 669 up-regulated genes (Fig.2B). By comparing these results with a Venn diagram, we identified approximately 305 differentially expressed genes in both datasets that may be linked to sorafenib resistance in HCC (Fig.2C). These findings highlight potential targets for further investigation into the mechanisms of drug resistance in HCC.

To clarify the impact of drug resistance genes on HCC prognosis, we conducted a consensus clustering analysis of 305 potential drug resistance-related genes from the TCGA-LIHC cohort. We tested cluster numbers (K) ranging from 2 to 9. At K = 2, we observed a clear demarcation, indicating that this clustering captured the dataset’s main structural features (Fig.2D). PCA further confirmed that the two clusters exhibited more distinct differentiation (Fig.2E). Based on the expression of these 305 genes, we categorized HCC patients into two clusters: Cluster A and Cluster B. K-M survival analysis revealed that the survival rate of Cluster A was significantly better than that of Cluster B (Fig.2F). Gene mutations play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and prognosis. To gain insight into the survival differences between the two clusters, we analyzed their gene mutations. Notably, Cluster A exhibited a higher mutation rate of CTNNB1, while its TP53 mutation rate was significantly lower compared to Cluster B (Fig.3A, B). Clinical correlation data further demonstrated significantly different pathological characteristics between the clusters, with Cluster B showing higher mortality rates and more advanced pathological stages (Fig.3C, D). To explore the potential functional differences between the two subgroups, we conducted GSVA. The major enriched pathways in Cluster A included retinol metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and pyruvate metabolism. In contrast, Cluster B was primarily enriched in pathways related to spliceosome, RNA degradation, cell cycle, and DNA replication (Fig.4A). Subsequently, we identified differential genes between the two clusters and analyzed them through GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The results indicated that these differential genes were involved in small molecule catabolic processes and organic acid biosynthetic processes. The major enriched pathways included drug metabolism, cell cycle, retinol metabolism, and the PPAR signaling pathway (Fig.4B, C).

We screened 128 genes associated with HCC prognosis through univariate Cox regression analysis based on the expression profiles of 305 potential drug resistance genes in the TCGA-LIHC cohort, along with relevant clinical information (Fig.5A). Next, we assessed the importance of these 128 genes for prognosis using the random forest algorithm, identifying the top 10 prognostic genes: LPCAT1, PPAT, MANBA, CDK5RAP2, KIF2C, SRD5A3, NCAPD2, WDR77, ANAPC13, and CCNB1 ( Fig.5B). We randomized combinations of these 10 genes to construct prognostic models. The combination yielding the most significant p-value resulted in a 7-gene risk model comprising ANAPC13, NCAPD2, KIF2C, CDK5RAP2, MANBA, PPAT, and LPCAT1 (Fig.5C). Based on the median risk score from this model, we categorized the cohort into low-risk and high-risk groups. The high-risk group exhibited elevated risk scores and a higher number of deaths (Fig.5D). PCA demonstrated significant differentiation between the high- and low-risk groups (Fig.5E). K-M survival analysis revealed a notable difference in survival outcomes, with the high-risk group showing significantly poorer survival rates compared to the low-risk group (Fig.5F). Subsequently, ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) values for this risk model in predicting the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of HCC patients were 0.824, 0.746, and 0.717, respectively (Fig.5G). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that this risk model is an independent prognostic factor for HCC, irrespective of other clinical variables (Fig.5H). Additionally, consistency scores demonstrated that this risk model surpassed other clinical factors in predicting survival among HCC patients (Fig.5I). These findings emphasize the reliability of our risk model in prognostic assessments for HCC, showcasing its potential application in clinical practice.

We validated the risk model in the ICGC-LINC-JP cohort, and the results were consistent with those from the TCGA-LIHC cohort. Consistently, the high-risk group showed higher risk scores and more deaths (Fig.6A). PCA indicated a clear boundary between the high- and low-risk groups, confirming distinct separation (Fig.6B). K-M survival analysis revealed a significant difference in survival outcomes between the two groups, highlighting the prognostic value of the risk model (Fig.6C). ROC analysis confirmed the model’s predictive capability, showing AUC values of 0.754, 0.794, and 0.806 for HCC patients at 1, 3, and 4 years, respectively (Fig.6D). Both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses confirmed that the risk model serves as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients (Fig.6E). Furthermore, consistency evaluation demonstrated that the model effectively predicts patient prognosis and outperforms other clinical factors (Fig.6F). These findings reinforce the reliability and applicability of our risk model in diverse cohorts, underscoring its potential utility in guiding clinical decision-making for HCC patients.

As the importance of immune cells in tumor therapy becomes clearer, we decided to analyze their infiltration status in both high-risk and low-risk groups. In the TCGA-LIHC cohort, we calculated the immune cell scores for each sample using single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and correlated these scores with the risk scores. Our analysis revealed that Th2 cells exhibited a significant positive correlation with the risk score (Fig.7A), indicating that HCC patients with higher risk scores had greater infiltration of Th2 cells. Additionally, using the CIBERSORT algorithm, we found a significant positive correlation between the risk score and both M0 macrophages and regulatory T cells (Fig.7B). The MCPcounter algorithm further confirmed a significant positive correlation between the risk score and the presence of macrophages and monocytes (Fig.7C). According to the EPIC algorithm, the high-risk group had an increased number of fibroblasts, while the counts of CD4 + T cells and macrophages were lower (Fig.7D). We also investigated the expression levels of immunosuppression-related genes between the high- and low-risk groups. Our findings showed that the expression levels of CD276, CD27, and CTLA4 were significantly higher in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (Fig.7E). These results show a complex relationship between immune cell infiltration and risk stratification in HCC, suggesting potential strategies for targeted immunotherapy in high-risk patients.

The GDSC database provides data on the sensitivity of over 1000 cancer cell lines to 621 anticancer compounds. Our study focused on analyzing patients in the high-risk group who may be resistant to sorafenib. Therefore, we analyzed the sensitivity of different drugs in both the high-risk and low-risk groups. The results showed that Tipifarnib, S-Trityl-L-cysteine, QS11, Pyrimethamine, PD-173,074, and Nilotinib exhibited lower IC50 values in the high-risk group (Fig.8).

In clinical practice, accurately predicting the overall survival of HCC patients is essential for personalized treatment and patient management. We have developed a practical prediction method: a nomogram that integrates risk scores and pathological stages (Fig.9A). This tool offers clinicians a quantitative way to assess HCC prognosis. We validated its predictive accuracy using calibration curves, which show the model’s consistency with actual outcomes. The nomogram’s predicted survival probabilities closely matched the observed outcomes for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in HCC patients, demonstrating its reliability and clinical utility (Fig.9B). Utilizing ROC analysis, our study determined that the integrated nomogram exhibited enhanced predictive performance for the 2- to 5-year overall survival rates of HCC patients, surpassing that of individual risk scores and clinical staging (Fig.9C). Additionally, DCA substantiated the clinical utility of the combined nomogram, demonstrating that it provides greater net benefits in the prediction process compared to the use of clinical staging or risk scores in isolation (Fig.9D–F).

After quality control, 67,060 cells were used for further analysis. These cells were categorized into 26 clusters (Fig.10A). Based on the transcript levels of typical marker genes, the cells were classified into eight major types: 23,532 T cells (CD3E, CD3D), 2033 hematopoietic stem cells (ACTA2), 18,603 hepatocytes (APOE, ALB), 3742 endothelial cells (VWF, CLEC4G), 2174 B cells (MS4A1, CD79A), 1655 plasma cells (MZB1, CD38), 9484 macrophages (CD68, MARCO), and 5837 monocytes (S100A8, FCN1) (Fig.10B, C). The expression of LPCAT1, PPAT, MANBA, CDK5RAP2, KIF2C, NCAPD2, and ANAPC13 is shown. LPCAT1 exhibited relatively high expression in both macrophages and hepatocytes. PPAT showed elevated expression predominantly in hepatocytes. Similarly, MANBA had a higher expression level in macrophages. CDK5RAP2, KIF2C, and NCAPD2 were all found to have relatively high expression in hepatocytes. Finally, ANAPC13 displayed increased expression in both hepatocytes and endothelial cells (Fig.10D).

Sorafenib is the first targeted drug approved for treating advanced HCC [15]. It works by inhibiting several pathways that contribute to tumor growth and blood vessel formation. Clinical trials show that sorafenib significantly prolongs survival in patients with advanced HCC [16]. Despite its proven effectiveness, the development of drug resistance limits its overall impact. The mechanisms behind sorafenib resistance in HCC are not fully understood. Additionally, there are no effective predictors of treatment response available.

This study conducted a thorough analysis of transcriptomic data from various cell lines, resulting in the identification of 305 potential genes associated with resistance to sorafenib. We categorized HCC patients into two distinct groups, referred to as Cluster A and Cluster B, based on the expression levels of these genes within the TCGA-LIHC dataset. Our findings revealed significant disparities in survival outcomes between the two clusters, with Cluster B exhibiting a poorer prognosis and a higher incidence of TP53 mutations. This finding aligns with earlier research indicating a positive correlation between TP53 mutations and resistance to sorafenib [17]. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis highlighted that pathways associated with drug and small molecule metabolism were notably enriched in both clusters. These outcomes imply that the 305 differentially expressed genes could be pivotal in the emergence of sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC. To explore the potential mechanisms of sorafenib resistance and identify predictive markers of efficacy, we employed Cox regression, random forest algorithms, and other methodologies, ultimately identifying a prognostic model consisting of seven genes. The model showed strong discrimination and validity, with an accuracy of 0.824 in predicting the 1-year survival of HCC patients, making it an independent predictor of poor prognosis. We further validated the stability and effectiveness of the model in an independent external cohort, ICGC-LINC-JP. The model achieved AUC values of 0.754, 0.794, and 0.806 for predicting 1-, 3-, and 4-year survival of HCC patients, respectively, demonstrating robust predictive capability. Zhang S et al. developed a 7-gene risk model based on mitochondrial UPR-related genes for predicting drug resistance, while our study focused specifically on genes linked to sorafenib resistance, offering a more targeted approach. Our model outperformed Zhang S et al.‘s in prediction efficiency, suggesting better identification of patients at risk of sorafenib resistance [18]. Luo T et al. used a broader set of 19 sorafenib resistance-related genes, which, although comprehensive, may complicate clinical application. In contrast, our streamlined gene set maintains high predictive accuracy and is more practical for clinical use [19]. These findings suggest that our prognostic model, built on genes related to sorafenib resistance, possesses strong predictive power.

Studies have shown that the TME, cancer stem cells, and EMT significantly interact, affecting HCC cells’ tolerance to sorafenib [20,21]. In the HCC microenvironment, the infiltration and types of T cells play a critical role in immune escape and therapeutic resistance [22]. Numerous studies indicate that in various solid tumors, including HCC, infiltrating T cells mainly consist of tumor-promoting TH2 cells and regulatory T cells [23,24]. These cells play a crucial role in supporting tumor growth by releasing pro-tumorigenic cytokines. In particular, TH2 cells foster an immunosuppressive environment within tumors by producing cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5 [25]. These cytokines not only promote the survival of HCC cells but also enhance their resistance to drugs. As a result, the presence of TH2 cells may diminish the effectiveness of other anti-tumor T cells, including cytotoxic T cells and TH1 cells. Our research has uncovered a strong positive correlation between the risk score and the infiltration of TH2 cells, indicating that these cells play a significant role in the resistance to sorafenib and contribute to a poor prognosis for patients. These findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance in HCC and highlight potential strategies for future treatments.

A prognostic model based on seven genes associated with sorafenib resistance—ANAPC13, NCAPD2, KIF2C, CDK5RAP2, MANBA, PPAT, and LPCAT1—offers a promising foundation for personalized treatment of HCC patients and may enhance the accuracy of prognostic assessments. NCAPD2 is crucial for cell division, influencing chromosome stability and microtubule polymerization. Its overexpression was linked to poor prognosis in HCC patients, potentially facilitating tumor development by impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis [26,27]. Regulation of NCAPD2 may also affect HCC cell responses to sorafenib, especially when cell cycle and apoptotic pathways are altered. KIF2C, a protein associated with microtubule motility, plays a significant role in cytokinesis [28]. High expression levels of KIF2C were commonly associated with tumor malignancy and poor patient outcomes. Inhibition of KIF2C expression significantly reduced the proliferation and migratory capacity of HCC cells [29]. CDK5RAP2 is involved in cell cycle regulation and microtubule organization [30]. CDK5RAP2 has been found to be aberrantly expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer, and promotes the EMT and metastasis of cancer cells [31,32]. MANBA is implicated in polysaccharide metabolism, which is vital for cellular signaling and metabolism [33]. PPAT, an enzyme involved in purine metabolism, is essential for cellular energy metabolism [34]. ANAPC13, also referred to as anaphase promoting complex subunit 13, is a crucial cation exchange protein in human cells, playing a significant role in various biological processes [35,36]. However, the expression and function of CDK5RAP2, MANBA, PPAT and ANAPC13 in HCC have not been reported. LPCAT1 is associated with phospholipid metabolism and plays a role in the construction of cell membranes and signaling [37,38]. Studies have shown that LPCAT1 is upregulated in HCC cells, potentially enhancing the invasive and migratory capabilities of tumor cells [39,40]. Changes in LPCAT1 expression may further contribute to the resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib by affecting cell membrane fluidity and signaling. The functions of these seven genes are closely tied to the survival, proliferation, and drug tolerance of HCC cells, although their specific mechanisms in HCC require further investigation. They may be involved in the development of sorafenib resistance through the regulation of cell cycle, metabolism, and signaling pathways. A deeper exploration of these genes could provide insights into drug resistance mechanisms in HCC and identify potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies.

We analyzed the GDSC database and identified potential therapeutic agents, including Tipifarnib and S-Trityl-L-cysteine, which exhibit lower IC50 values in the high-risk group. These findings suggest new treatment directions for hepatocellular carcinoma, warranting further validation of their efficacy and mechanisms in clinical studies. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in HCC and offers crucial theoretical guidance for future clinical applications. Additionally, we developed a nomogram by integrating the risk score with clinical staging. This integrated nomogram enhances the accuracy of survival predictions by incorporating multiple predictive factors. DCA further underscores the significant potential of this nomogram in clinical practice.

This study is subject to several limitations. Firstly, although we identified numerous differentially expressed genes associated with sorafenib resistance using bioinformatics approaches, these findings were not corroborated through experimental validation. This shortcoming diminishes the biological relevance and practical applicability of the results. Secondly, the limited sample size may have compromised the statistical robustness and generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the use of data from multiple public databases may introduce batch effects, potentially affecting the reliability of the results. Consequently, future research should incorporate larger, multicenter clinical samples and laboratory validation to more effectively substantiate the role of these genes in drug resistance in HCC.

In summary, this study identified key genes related to sorafenib resistance and developed an effective prognostic risk model, contributing significantly to the field of HCC treatment.
