Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease affecting millions worldwide. Recent evidence has demonstrated the crucial role of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, in the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disorders. While previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA-502-5p (miR-502-5p) can protect chondrocytes through p53/NF-κB pathway modulation, its role in human synovial tissue remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns and correlations of the miR-502-5p/p53/NF-κB signaling pathway in KOA synovial tissue across different disease severities.

This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 80 KOA patients undergoing knee arthroscopy from March 2019 to October 2019, stratified by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades (20 patients per grade). Due to ethical constraints, true healthy control synovial tissue could not be obtained; therefore, synovial samples from 6 KL grade I patients with minimal pathology served as reference controls. Clinical assessments included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. Synovial tissue samples were collected from standardized locations in the suprapatellar pouch during surgery and processed within 2 h. Histopathological analysis was performed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining with Mankin's scoring system. Expression of miR-502-5p and p53/NF-κB pathway components was analyzed using immunofluorescence double-labeling (primary antibodies: anti-p53 1:200, anti-NF-κB p65 1:100, with appropriate negative and isotype controls) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with U6 as internal control. Sample size for molecular analyses (n= 6 per group) limits statistical power.

(1) Clinical scores (VAS, WOMAC) and pathological scores (synovial Mankin's score, cartilage injury score) showed progressive increases with KL grade advancement (allP< 0.01 after Bonferroni correction). Strong positive correlations were observed between clinical symptoms and tissue pathology (r= 0.69–0.87,P< 0.001), though causality cannot be inferred. (2) Immunofluorescence analysis revealed p53 protein expression decreased progressively from reference to severe synovitis (P< 0.05), while TRAF2, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-13 showed opposite trends (allP< 0.05). (3) qRT-PCR demonstrated miR-502-5p mRNA expression increased 2.5-fold in mild, 4.2-fold in moderate, and 3.8-fold in severe synovitis compared to reference tissue (P< 0.001). However, these findings represent associations only and do not establish causal relationships.

Our findings reveal an association between miR-502-5p upregulation and KOA severity in synovial tissue, contrasting with its reported protective role in chondrocytes. While we observed correlations between miR-502-5p expression, p53 suppression, and NF-κB activation, causal relationships remain unestablished due to lack of functional validation. These results suggest tissue-specific expression patterns that warrant further mechanistic investigation before therapeutic implications can be determined.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) represents a major public health challenge, affecting approximately 250 million people globally and constituting the leading cause of disability in elderly populations [1,2]. Its primary pathological features include joint cartilage destruction, subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and synovial hyperplasia [3]. Recent evidence has highlighted the critical role of synovial inflammation in KOA pathogenesis and progression, shifting the paradigm from a purely "wear and tear" disease to an inflammatory disorder [4].

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression in musculoskeletal diseases [5–10]. Recent studies have demonstrated that ncRNAs play pivotal roles in chondrocyte metabolism, synovial inflammation, and bone remodeling in osteoarthritis [5]. The dysregulation of specific ncRNA networks has been associated with disease progression and severity in various forms of arthritis [6,7]. Moreover, ncRNAs have shown promise as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in musculoskeletal conditions [8–10].

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression in various pathological processes, including osteoarthritis [11–13]. Among these, miR-502-5p has garnered attention due to its protective effects on chondrocytes, where it promotes cell proliferation and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the p53/NF-κB signaling axis [14]. However, the expression pattern and functional role of miR-502-5p in synovial tissue, another key player in KOA pathogenesis, remains largely unexplored. The potential tissue-specific functions of miRNAs in joint tissues require careful investigation with appropriate controls and functional validation.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein and NF-κB transcription factor represent two critical nodes in cellular stress responses and inflammation [15–18]. In the context of osteoarthritis, p53 has been shown to induce synoviocyte apoptosis, while NF-κB activation drives inflammatory cascades and matrix degradation [19,20]. Recent studies suggest a complex interplay between these pathways, with p53 capable of suppressing NF-κB activity through multiple mechanisms [21,22]. Importantly, p53 dysfunction in chondrocytes has been linked to enhanced MMP-13 expression and accelerated cartilage degradation [23–28], suggesting that the p53/NF-κB axis may serve as a critical link between synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction.

This study aimed to characterize the expression patterns of the miR-502-5p/p53/NF-κB signaling pathway in synovial tissues from KOA patients with varying disease severities, and to explore the correlations between molecular alterations, synovial pathology, and clinical symptoms. We acknowledge that our cross-sectional design permits only observational conclusions rather than mechanistic insights.

This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine from March 2019 to October 2019. The study protocol was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee (approval number: BZYSY-2019KYKTPJ-26) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment, including consent for tissue collection and molecular analyses.

Sample size calculation was based on preliminary pilot data from 10 patients showing a standard deviation of 1.2 for synovial pathology scores, with an expected difference of 1.5 between groups. Using α = 0.05 and β = 0.20, we calculated a minimum of 17 patients per group. We enrolled 20 patients per KL grade to account for potential dropouts. For molecular analyses, resource constraints limited us to 6 samples per group, which we acknowledge reduces statistical power.

Due to ethical constraints, we could not obtain synovial tissue from truly healthy individuals. As a reference control, we used synovial samples from 6 patients with KL grade I OA showing minimal histological changes (Mankin score ≤ 2). We acknowledge this represents a significant limitation of our study design.

Arthroscopic cartilage damage was assessed using the Outerbridge classification at six sites: medial and lateral femoral condyles, medial and lateral tibial plateaus, patella, and femoral trochlea. Total cartilage damage score ranged from 0–24 (Figs.1,2and3).

Total score ranged from 0–10, with higher scores indicating more severe synovitis. Inter-rater reliability was assessed (κ = 0.82).

Antibody specificity was validated using peptide blocking. Negative controls included omission of primary antibody and use of species-matched isotype controls. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 and 594, 1:500) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61) at standardized exposure settings and analyzed with ImageJ software (version 1.53). Mean fluorescence intensity was calculated from five random fields per section by an investigator blinded to sample identity.

Primer specificity was confirmed by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis of PCR products. Amplification efficiency was validated to be between 90–110%. Relative expression was calculated using the 2^-ΔΔCt method with U6 as the reference gene. All samples were run in triplicate with both technical and biological replicates. We acknowledge that using only U6 as a reference gene is a limitation, and future studies should include multiple reference genes.

Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with input from a biostatistician. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range) based on distribution normality assessed by Shapiro–Wilk test. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages.

Between-group comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for normally distributed data, or Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc test for non-normally distributed data. To control for multiple testing, we applied false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Correlations were assessed using Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficients as appropriate. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of synovial pathology scores, with age, sex, BMI, and disease duration included as covariates.

P-values < 0.05 after correction were considered statistically significant. All tests were two-tailed. Due to the small sample size for molecular analyses (n= 6), results should be interpreted with caution.

The study included 80 patients (27 males, 53 females) with a mean age of 59.36 ± 12.24 years (range: 37–85). Patient demographics showed significant age progression across KL grades (Table1). Female predominance was observed in higher KL grades (80% in grade IV vs 50% in grade I,P= 0.045). Age was identified as a potential confounding factor and was adjusted for in subsequent analyses.

Clinical symptom scores demonstrated progressive worsening with advancing KL grades (Table2). Both VAS and WOMAC scores showed significant differences between consecutive grades after FDR correction, except between grades I and II. Age-adjusted analysis confirmed these associations remained significant. The age-matched representative figures shown in our immunofluorescence analyses (Figs.4,5and6) were selected from patients within similar age ranges (± 5 years) to minimize age-related confounding effects on protein expression patterns.

Strong positive correlations were observed between clinical symptoms and pathological changes (Table3). Multiple regression analysis controlling for age, sex, BMI, and disease duration revealed that synovial pathology score was significantly associated with VAS score (β = 0.542,P< 0.001), though causality cannot be inferred from these cross-sectional data.

Synovial tissue analysis revealed progressive pathological changes correlating with clinical severity. Reference synovium from KL grade I patients with minimal pathology (n= 6) showed 1–2 cell layers with minimal vascularity. Mild synovitis (n= 31) demonstrated 3–4 layer hyperplasia with scattered inflammatory cells. Moderate synovitis (n= 27) exhibited 5–6 layers with diffuse inflammation and neovascularization. Severe synovitis (n= 16) showed > 6 layers with lymphoid aggregates and extensive vascular proliferation.

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed inverse expression patterns of p53 and MMP-13 across synovitis grades. p53 showed predominantly nuclear localization in reference tissue (mean fluorescence intensity: 85.3 ± 12.4) but decreased progressively in mild (52.4 ± 8.7,P< 0.001), moderate (28.6 ± 6.3,P< 0.001), and severe synovitis (35.2 ± 7.8,P< 0.001 vs reference,P= 0.032 vs moderate). The progressive decrease in p53 expression with increasing synovitis severity may reflect the loss of its anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic functions, allowing for unchecked synovial proliferation and inflammation. Previous studies in human synovium and cartilage have similarly demonstrated reduced p53 expression in advanced OA [23,24].

Conversely, MMP-13 expression increased from reference (18.5 ± 4.2) to mild (45.6 ± 9.3,P< 0.001), moderate (78.9 ± 11.5,P< 0.001), and severe synovitis (65.4 ± 10.2,P< 0.001 vs reference,P= 0.018 vs moderate). The upregulation of MMP-13 in inflamed synovium contributes to cartilage degradation and joint destruction, consistent with previous reports showing elevated MMP-13 in human OA synovium and its correlation with disease severity [29,30].

Progressive activation of the NF-κB pathway was observed across synovitis grades. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 increased from 15.2 ± 3.8% in reference tissue to 38.5 ± 6.2% in mild (P< 0.001), 62.8 ± 8.5% in moderate (P< 0.001), and 78.6 ± 9.2% in severe synovitis (P< 0.001). The progressive nuclear translocation of NF-κB reflects its activation status and correlates with the inflammatory cascade in synovitis. This finding aligns with the recognized role of NF-κB as a master regulator of inflammation in OA [20].

Downstream inflammatory mediators showed parallel increases: IL-1β expression rose 3.2-fold in mild, 5.8-fold in moderate, and 7.5-fold in severe synovitis compared to reference (allP< 0.001). TNF-α levels increased 2.8-fold, 4.5-fold, and 5.2-fold respectively (allP< 0.001).

TRAF2, a key mediator linking TNF receptors to NF-κB activation, showed significant upregulation in synovitis. Expression increased from baseline (20.3 ± 5.1) to mild (48.7 ± 8.3,P< 0.001) and moderate synovitis (82.4 ± 12.6,P< 0.001), with slight reduction in severe cases (68.9 ± 10.4,P< 0.001 vs reference,P= 0.021 vs moderate).

qRT-PCR analysis revealed upregulation of miR-502-5p in synovitis tissues. Expression levels increased 2.5 ± 0.4-fold in mild (P< 0.001), 4.2 ± 0.6-fold in moderate (P< 0.001), and 3.8 ± 0.5-fold in severe synovitis (P< 0.001) compared to reference tissue. The slight decrease from moderate to severe synovitis was not statistically significant (P= 0.082).

Linear regression analysis showed miR-502-5p expression was associated with synovial pathology score (r= 0.72,P< 0.001) and inversely associated with p53 protein levels (r= −0.68,P< 0.001). However, these correlations do not establish causality (Fig.7).

Our study provides the first comprehensive observational analysis of the miR-502-5p/p53/NF-κB signaling axis in synovial tissues from KOA patients across different disease severities. The key findings reveal an association between miR-502-5p upregulation and disease severity in inflamed synovium, contrasting with its known protective role in chondrocytes. However, we must emphasize that our cross-sectional design and lack of functional validation limit conclusions to correlative observations rather than mechanistic insights.

The strong correlations between synovial pathology scores and clinical symptoms (r= 0.74 for VAS,r= 0.75 for WOMAC) support the clinical significance of synovitis in KOA symptomatology. Our findings align with recent MRI studies demonstrating that synovial inflammation contributes to pain in KOA patients [31,32]. The association of synovial pathology with pain severity (β = 0.542,P< 0.001) suggests that anti-inflammatory therapies targeting synovium may offer symptomatic relief, though prospective intervention studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. This finding has important clinical implications for treatment strategies, as current therapies primarily focus on cartilage protection rather than synovial inflammation. The development of synovium-targeted interventions could potentially provide more effective pain relief and disease modification in KOA patients.

Our findings, combined with previous literature, suggest that the p53/NF-κB axis serves as a critical molecular bridge linking synovial inflammation to cartilage degradation in KOA [25–28]. The progressive decrease in p53 expression observed in inflamed synovium parallels the loss of p53 function reported in OA chondrocytes, where p53 deficiency leads to enhanced MMP-13 production and accelerated cartilage breakdown [23–25]. This synchronized dysfunction across joint tissues suggests a coordinated pathological process rather than isolated tissue-specific changes.

The mechanistic connection likely operates through multiple pathways: (1) Inflammatory mediators produced by inflamed synovium, including IL-1β and TNF-α, can diffuse through synovial fluid to directly suppress p53 expression in chondrocytes [26]; (2) The loss of p53-mediated suppression of NF-κB in both synovium and cartilage creates a feed-forward inflammatory loop, amplifying MMP-13 production and matrix degradation [27]; (3) Synovium-derived MMPs, particularly MMP-13, directly contribute to cartilage erosion at the synovial-cartilage interface [28]. This bidirectional crosstalk between synovium and cartilage, mediated through the p53/NF-κB/MMP-13 axis, represents a potential therapeutic target for interrupting the cycle of inflammation and tissue destruction in KOA.

P53, traditionally known as a tumor suppressor, plays multifaceted roles in OA pathogenesis. In normal joint homeostasis, p53 maintains tissue integrity through regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses [15,16]. Our observation of decreased p53 expression with increasing synovitis severity suggests a loss of these protective functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that p53 can suppress NF-κB-mediated inflammation through direct protein–protein interactions and transcriptional regulation of anti-inflammatory genes [21,22]. In human OA cartilage, reduced p53 expression has been associated with increased chondrocyte survival but also enhanced production of inflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading enzymes [23,24]. The inverse relationship between p53 and MMP-13 expression observed in our study supports this dual role, where loss of p53 permits both synovial hyperplasia and enhanced matrix degradation.

The observed upregulation of miR-502-5p in synovial tissue represents an interesting contrast to its reported downregulation in OA cartilage [14,33]. This tissue-specific expression pattern suggests potential distinct regulatory mechanisms operating in different joint compartments. However, without direct comparison of paired tissues or functional studies, we cannot confirm whether miR-502-5p truly has opposing functions in these tissues.

Similar tissue-specific miRNA effects have been reported for miR-210 and miR-27a in OA [34–37], supporting the plausibility of our observations.

Our data demonstrate inverse expression patterns between p53 and NF-κB pathways in synovial inflammation. The progressive decrease in p53 expression coinciding with enhanced NF-κB activation supports existing literature suggesting p53 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB-driven inflammation [38,39]. However, we emphasize these are correlative observations that do not prove direct regulatory relationships.

The partial recovery of p53 expression in severe synovitis (35.2 ± 7.8) may represent a compensatory mechanism, cellular senescence, or simply biological variability given our small sample size. This phenomenon warrants investigation with larger cohorts and mechanistic studies.

Lack of true healthy controls: Ethical constraints prevented obtaining synovial tissue from healthy individuals. Our"reference"samples from KL grade I patients may already exhibit molecular changes.

Small sample size for molecular analyses: Resource limitations restricted molecular studies ton= 6 per group, significantly limiting statistical power and generalizability.

Absence of functional validation: Without in vitro or in vivo experiments, we cannot establish causal relationships between miR-502-5p expression and pathway alterations.

Single tissue analysis: We did not examine paired synovial and cartilage samples from the same patients, preventing direct tissue comparisons.

Technical limitations: Use of only U6 as a reference gene for qPCR and limited antibody validation reduce the robustness of our molecular findings.

Recent advances in targeted drug delivery [40] make tissue-specific therapies increasingly feasible, though significant development is needed before clinical application.

This cross-sectional study reveals associations between miR-502-5p upregulation, p53 suppression, and NF-κB activation in KOA synovial tissue that correlate with disease severity and clinical symptoms. Our findings, together with existing literature, suggest that the p53/NF-κB/MMP-13 axis may serve as a molecular link between synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction, though direct causality remains to be established. While these findings suggest tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms that differ from those in cartilage, we emphasize that our observational design precludes mechanistic conclusions. The lack of true healthy controls, small sample size for molecular analyses, and absence of functional validation represent significant limitations that must be addressed in future studies. Nevertheless, our findings provide a foundation for hypothesis generation and highlight the complexity of miRNA regulation in joint tissues. Rigorous mechanistic studies with appropriate controls and functional validation are essential before therapeutic implications can be determined.
