This study aimed to investigate the burnout and related factors of infection control nurses in long‐term care hospitals.

An anonymous, self‐administered survey was conducted among 177 nursing home infection control nurses. The questionnaire included stress levels, self‐efficacy, social support, and burnout. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 to calculate descriptive statistics and multiple regression.

Stress (β = .70,p< .001) and social support (β = −.18,p= .007) were found to have significant effects on emotional exhaustion, with an explanatory power of 57%. Stress (β = .62,p< .001) and social support (β = −.20,p= .006) also significantly influenced depersonalization, with an explanatory power of 49%. Self‐efficacy (β = −.61,p< .001) significantly impacted reduced personal accomplishment, with an explanatory power of 53%.

To reduce burnout among infection control nurses in long‐term care hospitals, there is a need for systematic and continuous mental health services tailored to individuals, the development and implementation of nursing interventions to enhance self‐efficacy, and the establishment of a supportive organizational culture and system.

The proportion of older people is increasing globally due to longer life expectancy and declining fertility rates, and the WHO reports that by 2025, the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to reach approximately 16% of the world's population (WHO,2023). In Asia, many countries, including South Korea, are entering an ultra‐elderly society, with the proportion of people aged 65 and older expected to exceed 40% by 2050 (WHO,2023). With a growing elderly population, South Korea has the highest number of nursing home beds per 1,000 people among OECD countries at 13.2, which is three times the OECD average of 4.4. In South Korea, the number of nursing home beds is twice as high as in the United States and Japan, and the quality of nursing home services is receiving increasing social attention (MOHW,2023).

Prolonged hospitalizations among these patients have led to an increased prevalence of infectious diseases in these settings (Maven et al.,2022). The global spread of COVID‐19 that began in December 2019 underscored weaknesses in infection control practices within South Korea's LTC hospitals, as multiple outbreaks in these facilities highlighted deficiencies in surveillance monitoring systems (Kim et al.,2024). Among these facilities, only 55.5% have independent infection control departments, and within these, only 3.1% employ dedicated infection control nurses (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency,2023, December 7). The shortage of specialized infection control staff can lead to higher rates of healthcare‐associated infections, extended hospital stays, increased mortality, and unnecessary financial and human resource burdens (van den Broek et al.,2010). In addition, infection control nurses, who play a central role in infection control, have experienced a dramatic increase in burnout compared to nurses who provide direct care since the COVID‐19 pandemic (Maven et al.,2022).

Burnout—a syndrome often seen in professionals working directly with people—encompasses three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment (Maslach et al.,2001). Emotional exhaustion reflects a sense of depleted emotional resources due to excessive psychological demands, while depersonalization involves a detached and cynical approach toward patients. Reduced personal accomplishment refers to the negative self‐evaluation of job performance (Maslach & Jackson,1981). Persistent burnout can lead to chronic fatigue, weakness, headaches, insomnia, and psychological symptoms such as low self‐esteem and negative attitudes toward oneself or others (Maslach et al.,2001). Therefore, understanding the degree of burnout among infection control nurses and identifying its related factors is essential.

Job stress, which can arise when personal needs remain unmet and energy is depleted, is a state of stress related to one's work that is severe enough to result in significant physiological, psychological, and social impairments (Jenaro et al.,2007). The higher the job stress of infection control nurses, the lower their job satisfaction and the lower their job performance; that is, their ability to perform infection control (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024).

Social support received from colleagues, supervisors, and family has been found to serve as a coping strategy for stress with positive effects on job satisfaction (Çelik & Tosun,2020) and reduced burnout (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024). Additionally, self‐efficacy was negatively correlated with burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic (Cotel et al.,2021). Further, positive evaluations, such as self‐efficacy, are significant related factors of motivation and job performance (Judge et al.,2004), underscoring the importance of studies to confirm their potential as a target of nursing interventions to amplify the positive aspects experienced by infection control nurses and alleviate their burnout.

Despite its importance, research specifically focusing on infection control nurses in LTC settings has been limited, with studies only addressing infection control training needs (Kim et al.,2020), infection control experiences among LTC hospital nurses (Kim & Kim,2023), and perceived importance among infection control staff in LTC hospitals (Kim & Park,2017). The emergence of new infectious diseases, such as COVID‐19, and the re‐emergence of existing infections (Cho et al.,2017) continue to pose challenges with broad impacts on health care, society, and the economy (Cha et al.,2017). Thus, understanding and addressing burnout in infection control nurses within LTC hospitals is crucial.

By assessing burnout levels and identifying burnout‐related factors among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals, this study aims to facilitate the development of infection control professionals, promote continuity in infection prevention activities, and enhance healthcare quality. In order to manage burnout effectively, we need to understand the structural processes through which burnout occurs. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress appraisal–coping model can be used to identify intrapersonal characteristics and environmental factors that contribute to burnout, and to analyze the impact of coping resources on burnout so that it can be managed more effectively.

In this context, we identify the related factors of burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals based on Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress appraisal‐coping model to provide foundational insights for intervention programs designed to reduce burnout in infection control nurses.

Adopting a descriptive survey method, we aimed to investigate the predictors of burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals. We used Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress appraisal‐coping model as a framework to examine the relationship between stress and burnout among infection control nurses. Stress is explained as an interaction between the individual and the environment rather than a simple stimulus (Lazarus & Folkman,1984), so personal variables (e.g., gender, age, education, spouse, position, number of beds, employment type, clinical career, career of infection control, and certification) and stress were included as factors that can affect burnout. Personal variables were classified by referring to a previous similar paper (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024). We included social support and self‐efficacy as coping resources. Burnout was used as the negative outcome measure. This study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guidelines (Vandenbroucke et al.,2007).

A total of 177 infection control nurses working at 30‐bed or larger LTC hospitals who provided informed consent to participate in the study were enrolled. The sample size was determined using the program G*power 3.1.9.7. For a regression analysis with a significance level of .05, medium effect size of .15, power of 90% (Han et al.,2015), and 13 predictors, the minimum sample size was 162. To consider the 10% dropout rate, the questionnaire was administered to 180 participants; after excluding three with insincere responses, 177 were included in the final analysis.

The Korean version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory‐Human Services Survey (Medical Personnel), MBI‐HSS (MP), developed by Maslach and Jackson (1981) was purchased and used in this study. The MBI‐HSS (MP) includes 22 items across three subscales: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items), and reduced personal accomplishment (8 items).

Each question is answered on a 7‐point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never), 1 (a few times a year or less), 2 (once a month or less), 3 (a few times a month), 4 (once a week), 5 (a few times a week), and 6 (every day), with higher scores indicating higher levels of burnout. Per the manual, the subscale scores were calculated separately, and items were not combined into a single “burnout” score (Leiter & Maslach,2018). In the study by Maslach and Jackson (1981), Cronbach's α was .90 for emotional exhaustion, .79 for depersonalization, and .71 for reduced personal accomplishment. In this study, Cronbach's α was .93 for emotional exhaustion, .89 for depersonalization, and .92 for reduced personal accomplishment.

Four items for stress and four items for cognitive stress were adopted from the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II (COPSOQII), developed by Pejtersen et al. (2010) and translated into Korean (COPSOQ‐K) by Jeon and Choi (2013) after obtaining author permission. Each item is rated on a five‐point scale ranging from 0 (“never/hardly ever”), 25 (“seldom”), 50 (“sometimes”), 75 (“often”), to 100 (“always”). Higher scores indicate a higher level of stress. The Cronbach's α was .81 in Pejtersen et al.'s (2010) study, .82 in Jeon and Choi's (2013) study, and .94 in this study. The study confirmed content validity, with an S‐CVI of 1.0.

Six items for self‐efficacy were adopted from the COPSOQII, developed by Pejtersen et al. (2010) and translated into Korean (COPSOQ‐K) by Jeon and Choi (2013) after obtaining author permission. Each item is rated on a five‐point scale ranging from 0 (“never/hardly ever”), 25 (“seldom”), 50 (“sometimes”), 75 (“often”), to 100 (“always”). Higher scores indicate higher self‐efficacy. The Cronbach's α was .80 in the studies by Pejtersen et al. (2010) and Jeon and Choi (2013), and .92 in this study. The study confirmed content validity, with an S‐CVI of 1.0.

Three items for support from colleagues and three items for support from supervisors were adopted from the COPSOQII, developed by Pejtersen et al. (2010) and translated into Korean (COPSOQ‐K) by Jeon and Choi (2013) after obtaining author permission. Each item is rated on a five‐point scale ranging from 0 (“never/hardly ever”), 25 (“seldom”), 50 (“sometimes”), 75 (“often”), to 100 (“always”). Higher scores indicate higher social support. The Cronbach's α was 0.77 for support from colleagues and 0.80 for support from supervisors in Pejtersen et al.'s (2010) study, 0.76 and 0.86, respectively, in Jeon and Choi's (2013) study, and 0.88 and 0.91, respectively, in this study. The study confirmed content validity, with an S‐CVI of 1.0.

Data were collected from June 6, 2024, to July 2, 2024. The study population was 177 infection control nurses who understood and agreed to the purpose of the study. Inclusion criteria were infection control nurses working in the infection control department of LTC hospitals with 30 beds or more, and exclusion criteria were those who were temporarily assigned to infection control duties. After explaining the aim and methods of the study to an infection control nurse, we obtained recommendations for potential participants and sent the online survey link to these potential candidates. Then, we used purposive sampling, where the survey participants were asked to refer other eligible infection control nurses who may participate in the study. To ensure adequate recruitment, an announcement for participation was posted on an online community frequented by infection control nurses in LTC hospitals. The survey took approximately 20 min to complete, and respondents received a small token of appreciation upon completion.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the researcher's affiliated school (No. ewha‐202406‐0002‐01). Participants accessed the online survey via a link, reviewed the information sheet, and indicated agreement by selecting “I agree” before beginning the survey. The information sheet outlined the study's purpose, participant anonymity, freedom of withdrawal at any point without consequence, and both the benefits and potential risks of participation. To ensure anonymity, participants' personal information was encoded using serial numbers. All data files related to the study are securely stored on a first author's encrypted computer and will be strictly managed and disposed of after the legally required retention period of 3 years.

The collected data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 26; statistical significance was determined at a level of .05. The following statistical analyses were used.

First, participants' general characteristics were analyzed using frequency analysis and descriptive statistics. Second, the levels of stress, self‐efficacy, social support, and burnout among infection control nurses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Third, the correlations among stress, self‐efficacy, social support, and burnout among infection control nurses were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Fourth, the significance of the difference in burnout according to participants' general characteristics was tested with an independent t‐test and one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Scheffé's post hoc test if significant. Fifth, the predictors of burnout among infection control nurses were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Multiple regression analysis is necessary to identify factors that influence infection control nurse burnout in complex situations because it allows the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable to be estimated separately.

The majority of the participants were female (96.6%). The mean age was 37.4 years, with 52.5% aged 30–39 years. The most common education level was a bachelor's degree (68.4%), and 52.5% had a spouse. The majority (65.0%) were general nurses. The mean number of beds at the participants' LTC hospitals was 224.2, with the highest percentage of nurses working in a hospital with 200–299 beds (31.1%). Regarding work type, 81.9% worked as full‐time infection control nurses, while 18.1% had dual roles. The mean total clinical career was 9.7 years, with most having 5–9 years (33.3%) of clinical experience. The mean length of career in the infection control unit was 2.5 years, with many having less than 1 year of experience (36.2%). The certifications obtained included infection control specialist nurse (28.8%), infection control practitioner nurses (6.8%), and no certification (64.4%) (Table1).

Participants' levels of stress, self‐efficacy, social support, and burnout were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The mean scores were 42.7 for stress, 57.5 for self‐efficacy, and 57.0 for social support. For burnout (0–6), the mean scores were 2.9 for emotional exhaustion, 2.2 for depersonalization, and 2.6 for reduced personal accomplishment.

The normality of the data was tested using skewness and kurtosis. The absolute value was below 2 and 7, respectively, confirming the normality of the data (Curran et al.,1996). In other words, the distribution of study data was appropriate for statistical analysis (Table2).

The correlations among stress, self‐efficacy, social support, and burnout among participants were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Stress was negatively correlated with self‐efficacy (r = −.44,p< .001) and social support (r = −.31,p< .001). There was a positive correlation between self‐efficacy and social support (r = .61,p< .001). The three subscales of burnout—emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment—were significantly positively correlated with stress and significantly negatively correlated with self‐efficacy and social support (Table3).

Note: Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess the relationship between the variables; the significance level was set atp< .05.

Differences in burnout according to participants' characteristics were analyzed using independent t‐test and one‐way ANOVA. Emotional exhaustion significantly differed according to gender (t= −4.88,p= .002), age (F= 4.96,p= .003), clinical experience (F= 5.20,p= .002), and certification (F= 3.44,p= .034). In terms of gender, emotional exhaustion was significantly higher among women than men. Scheffé's post hoc analysis showed that emotional exhaustion was significantly higher in participants aged 30–39 years compared to those aged 20–29 years, among those with 5–10 years of clinical experience compared to those with less than 5 years, and among infection control practitioner nurses compared to infection control specialist nurses.

Depersonalization significantly differed according to age (F= 5.67,p= .001), education level (F= 4.06,p= .019), clinical experience (F= 7.00,p< .001), and length of career in the infection control unit (F= 2.82,p= .040). Scheffé's post hoc results revealed that depersonalization was significantly higher among those aged 30–39 years compared to those aged 20–29 years, among participants with a graduate degree compared to those with an associate degree, and among those with 5–9 years of clinical experience compared to those with either less than 5 years or more than 15 years. Depersonalization was also significantly higher among those with 1–2 years of experience in the infection control unit compared to those with more than 5 years of experience in the unit.

Reduced personal accomplishment significantly differed according to education level (F= 3.41,p= .035), employment type (t= 2.20,p= .029), clinical experience (F= 3.09,p= .028), and length of career in the infection control unit (F= 3.21,p= .024). Scheffé's post hoc analysis and mean comparisons indicated that reduced personal accomplishment was significantly higher among those with an associate degree compared to those with a bachelor's degree, among full‐time infection control staff compared to those with dual roles, among participants with 5–10 years of clinical experience compared to those with more than 15 years, and among those with less than 1 year of experience in the infection control unit compared to those with more than 5 years of experience in the unit (Table4).

Difference of burnout according to general characteristics (n= 177).

Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of burnout in the study population. For emotional exhaustion, the regression model explained approximately 57% of the variance. Stress (β = .70,p< .001) had a significant positive effect on emotional exhaustion, while social support (β = −.18,p= .007) had a significant negative effect. The regression model explained 49% of the variance in depersonalization. Stress (β = .62,p< .001) had a significant positive effect on depersonalization, while social support (β = −.20,p< .001) had a significant negative effect on depersonalization. Among general characteristics, gender significantly predicted emotional exhaustion, where emotional exhaustion was significantly higher among women than men (β = .11,p< .001). Education level also showed a significant effect, with depersonalization being significantly higher among those with a bachelor's degree (β = .14,p= .050) or graduate degree (β = .18,p= .011) compared to those with an associate degree.

For reduced personal accomplishment, the model explained approximately 53% of the variance. Self‐efficacy (β = −.61,p< .001) had a significant negative effect on reduced personal accomplishment. Employment type also showed a significant effect, with those in full‐time infection control roles reporting significantly higher levels of reduced personal accomplishment compared to those in dual roles (β = .14,p= .011). In summary, stress and social support were significant predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, while self‐efficacy was a significant predictor of reduced personal accomplishment (Table5).

This study aimed to examine the levels of stress, self‐efficacy, social support, and burnout and identify the predictors of burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals based on Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress appraisal‐coping model. The results showed that stress levels were varied depending on experience and role, aligning with burnout theory (Maslach,1998).

The mean stress score was 42.7 among our participants, which is lower than the mean stress score of 56.6 reported among infection control nurses in general hospitals who experienced the COVID‐19 pandemic (Lee, Kim, & Park,2024). This higher stress level in general hospital nurses is likely attributable to the intense responsibility of caring for COVID‐19 patients and leading infection control efforts (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024). Although there is limited prior research specifically on stress among infection control nurses in LTC settings, studies of general nurses show that those with direct COVID‐19 care experience reported higher job‐related infection control stress compared to those without such experience (Lee,2022) confirming that infection control is a stressor. Nurses in LTC facilities face distinctive stressors, such as providing care for older adults with chronic and cognitive conditions, and navigating interdepartmental infection control responsibilities (Park & Ahn,2019). These responsibilities, while not involving direct patient care, demand complex decision‐making and advanced expertise, which contribute significantly to occupational stress (Cha & Lee,2019). This stress, when unmanaged, aligns with Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) framework where appraisal of demands outweighs available coping mechanisms, potentially leading to burnout. Given these multifaceted stressors, further research on LTC infection control nurses and initiatives to alleviate their stress are needed.

In this study, the mean self‐efficacy score was 57.5, slightly higher than the 54.6 reported among infection control nurses in general hospitals (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024). Previous studies have shown that nurses with more experience tend to have higher self‐efficacy than less experienced nurses (Kallerhult Hermansson et al.,2024; Kim & Kim,2022). The infection control nurses in LTC hospitals reported an average clinical experience of 9.68 years, compared to 8.63 years among their general hospital counterparts (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024), supporting these findings. This aligns with Bandura's (1977) concept that self‐efficacy increases with mastery experience. Higher self‐efficacy enables infection control nurses to carry out complex tasks with autonomy and confidence, which is essential in LTC settings (Cha & Lee,2019).

The participants' mean social support score was 57.0, compared to 58.7 for infection control nurses in general hospitals who worked during the COVID‐19 pandemic (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024). According to Lazarus and Folkman's model, lack of external coping resources like social support heightens stress impact. Therefore, lower support may exacerbate emotional exhaustion or depersonalization in LTC infection control nurses. Support from individuals and organizations helps moderate stress and enhance health outcomes, productivity, and satisfaction (Baek & Kim,2024). Given the stressors specific to LTC settings, enhancing social support mechanisms—such as team cohesion, supervisor feedback, and organizational recognition—could buffer against burnout dimensions, particularly emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

The mean scores for the three subscales of burnout were 2.9 for emotional exhaustion, 2.2 for depersonalization, and 2.6 for reduced personal accomplishment. For comparison, in Park and Ahn's (2019) study, general nurses in LTC hospitals scored 2.5 in emotional exhaustion, 1.8 in depersonalization, and 2.8 in reduced personal accomplishment using the same instrument. Infection control nurses showed higher scores in emotional exhaustion, while general nurses had the highest scores in reduced personal accomplishment. General nurses in LTC hospitals often perform administrative tasks and report feeling limited in developing or using their clinical skills, which likely contributes to higher reduced personal accomplishment scores (Park & Ahn,2019). In contrast, infection control nurses in LTC hospitals seemed to have high levels of emotional exhaustion due to their pivotal roles in infection control even during the COVID‐19 pandemic despite only 3.1% of the LTC hospitals having dedicated infection control staff (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency,2023, December 7). However, they also have low levels of reduced personal accomplishment because they perform specialized tasks as infection control nurses. According to Eltaybani et al. (2021), increased emotional exhaustion in nurses correlates with higher rates of patient complications such as pneumonia and pressure injuries, and lower personal accomplishment is associated with higher enteral feeding rates. These findings underscore the critical role of nurse burnout in determining care quality. To mitigate burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals, there is a need for a comprehensive infection control system at the national level, which includes establishing dedicated infection control units and expanding infection control staffing. Such a system would not only improve patient outcomes but also enhance preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks.

In this study, we found significant differences in burnout according to age, clinical experience, and certification. Notably, burnout was higher among nurses with 5–10 years of clinical experience compared to those with over 15 years. Additionally, infection control practitioner nurses reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion than infection control specialist nurses, similar to findings by Lee, Kim, and Park, (2024). Burnout can lead to psychological challenges, such as feelings of failure and guilt, and contribute to reduced job performance and diminished nursing competencies (Lee,2022). Consequently, reducing burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals is critical to establishing an effective infection control system. To this end, adequate staffing with nurses with substantial clinical experience is crucial, as well as providing specialized training tailored to the unique demands of LTC facilities to cultivate infection control specialist nurses with enhanced infection control competencies.

While stress and social support were significant predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, self‐efficacy was significantly associated with reduced personal accomplishment. Direct comparison is difficult due to the lack of studies on burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals. A study on job stress and burnout among nurses (Kim & Ahn,2019) has similarly identified job stress as a significant predictor of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization but not reduced personal accomplishment (Kim & Ahn,2019), aligning with our findings. These results support burnout theory, which posits that emotional exhaustion and depersonalization present distinct patterns from reduced personal accomplishment (Maslach,1998).

Burnout occurs when physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion from unmanageable stress reaches a breaking point. Left unresolved, burnout can lead to psychological challenges such as failure and guilt, job deterioration, and decreased nursing performance (Lee,2022). Given that burnout in infection control nurses—driven by high levels of job‐related stress—has implications for both individuals and organizations (Lee, Kim, & Park,2024) it is essential to enhance educational and training opportunities pertaining to infection control, nurturing personnel with specialized knowledge, and providing support to infection control nurses so that they can perform their duties with pride.

Social support emerged as a protective factor against emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, consistent with findings from a study on nursing home nurses in Sweden (Lethin et al.,2021). Previous studies indicate that support from supervisors, friends, and family can effectively mitigate emotional exhaustion (Woodhead et al.,2016), and team cohesion and collaborative dynamics have also been shown to reduce depersonalization (Adali et al.,2003; Andela et al.,2016). Social support is particularly impactful in nursing due to the profession's collaborative nature, with high levels of peer interdependence and easy bonding. Thus, support from colleagues can improve job performance, while support from supervisors aids psychological adjustment, reducing stress and tension and subsequently decreasing burnout (Kim et al.,2019). Thus, fostering a supportive organizational culture and support system is important to mitigate burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals.

Self‐efficacy was found to have a negative correlation with reduced personal accomplishment. A previous study on burnout in LTC nurses (Kang,2019) reported that these nurses perceive a lack of expertise in providing patient care due to the complexity and severity of the conditions of older adult patients and that limited educational and training opportunities addressing the specific needs of older adults lead to a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Self‐efficacy is crucial for infection control nurses who must operate with high levels of responsibility and autonomy (Lee, Park, & Kim,2024). Thus, infection control education tailored to LTC hospitals that emphasizes self‐efficacy may be particularly beneficial for these nurses.

Limitations of this study include the cross‐sectional design of the study using an online survey, which prevents the establishment of causal relationships between variables, and the convenience sampling of nursing home infection control nurses, which limits the generalizability of the findings; thus, it is necessary to confirm the consistency of the findings through a replication study with a larger sample size. Nonetheless, this study contributes valuable insights by examining levels of stress, self‐efficacy, and social support and identifying predictors of burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals, thereby providing foundational data for developing interventions aimed at reducing burnout.

This study aimed to identify the predictors of burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals based on Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress appraisal‐coping model. While stress and social support were significant predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, self‐efficacy was significantly associated with reduced personal accomplishment. These results underscore the need for interventions that enhance stress management, self‐efficacy, and social support to reduce burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals. To this end, it is important to establish a systematic and ongoing approach that includes providing individualized mental health services incorporating both environmental and staffing support, developing and implementing interventions aimed at enhancing self‐efficacy, and fostering an organizational culture and system to cultivate a supportive work environment.

Based on these findings, further research is recommended in several areas. There is a need for additional studies on infection control nurses in LTC hospitals, including both regional and hospital‐size‐specific investigations and qualitative research that delves deeply into their experiences. Future studies should also develop and evaluate intervention programs to manage stress and enhance self‐efficacy and social support to reduce burnout among infection control nurses in LTC hospitals.
