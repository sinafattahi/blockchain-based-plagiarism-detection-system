Ammonia (NH3) is a key precursor of secondary inorganic aerosols. During precipitation, NH3in the atmosphere can be captured by rain and converted to NH4+, whereas during evaporation, NH4+can become NH3and be released again. The northeastern region of China experiences diverse precipitation types, making the study of the NH3release flux and its influencing factors during evaporation highly significant. In this study, precipitation samples of haze (HZ), dust (DS), convective (CC), and monsoon (MN) events were collected three times in Changchun from March to September 2024 (a total of twelve rain events), and indoor simulation evaporation experiments were conducted. The results revealed significant differences in the NH4+conversion rate (R), NH3release flux (F) and release rate (V) across the precipitation types (P< 0.05). The NH3flux released from precipitation evaporation was 20.33 µg/m2in spring and 64.53 µg/m2in summer, accounting for approximately 4.14% and 7.70%, respectively, of the corresponding atmospheric NH3concentrations. Meteorological factors influenced NH3release similarly across precipitation types.Rpeaked and then decreased with increasing temperature and was significantly negatively correlated with wind speed and precipitation amount (P< 0.05). In addition, this study calculates the temperature coefficient (K1), wind speed coefficient (K2), and precipitation amount coefficient (K3) by considering these factors. These findings provide valuable insights for estimating NH3release fluxes from precipitation evaporation in different regions.

Ammonia (NH3), the most abundant alkaline gas in the atmosphere1readily neutralizes acidic gases in the air, forming secondary inorganic aerosols such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium bisulfate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium chloride2,3. Ammonium (NH4+) accounts for up to 57% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)4–6significantly affecting human health7climate models8nutrient cycling9the atmospheric radiation balance and air quality10. Recent satellite monitoring has indicated a rise in global atmospheric NH3concentrations, driven by factors such as decreased emissions of acidic gases (e.g., SO2and NO2), rising temperatures, and increased fertilizer use11. This trend has transformed urban atmospheres into NH3-rich environments, raising widespread concern regarding NH3sources and concentrations.

Previous studies have identified agricultural activities, such as fertilization and livestock farming, as the primary sources of atmospheric NH3>12,13. Other significant contributors include vehicle emissions14coal and biomass combustion15industrial and power plant NH3emissions16and dew volatilization17. NH3released from these sources enters the atmosphere, and owing to its water-soluble properties, it can be absorbed during precipitation formation and settle to the surface with rainfall18,19leading to high concentrations of NH4+in atmospheric precipitation. For example, NH4+was the most abundant ion in precipitation from Ya’an15and Dalian, China20with concentrations of 169.6 µEq/L and 107.76 µEq/L, respectively, accounting for 36% and 19.75% of the total ion concentration. High concentrations of NH4+are likely to be re-emitted as NH3during the evaporation of precipitation. Previous studies reported a rapid increase in near-surface NH3concentrations 1–2 h after specific rainfall events in northern Colorado, USA17as well as in Beijing1and Nanchang, China21.

Precipitation serves as an indirect indicator of local air pollution levels, with its chemical composition and amount varying significantly on the basis of meteorological conditions, air mass trajectories, and pollution sources. For example, precipitation in Guiyang is influenced primarily by atmospheric circulation and terrain, with the majority occurring in summer as convective rain. In contrast, spring is dominated by persistent precipitation caused by stratiform clouds. The major ions in precipitation are SO42−and Ca2+, with NH4+concentrations of approximately 50 µEq/L22. In comparison, Beijing experiences frequent dust storms in spring, and precipitation is mostly of the dust type23. The main ions in precipitation are SO42−and NH4+, with the NH4+concentration reaching as high as 346 µEq/L24approximately seven times higher than those observed in Guiyang. Unlike Guiyang and Beijing, precipitation in Changchun is mainly haze-type and dust-type during spring, whereas convective and monsoonal rainfall prevails in summer. Precipitation in Changchun contains high concentrations of SO42−and Mg2+, with an average NH4+concentration of 104.54 ± 35.97 µEq/L25.

The experimental study was conducted in Changchun City, Jilin Province (Fig.1(a)). Changchun, located in northeastern China (43.88°N, 125.35°E), is a central city in the Northeast Asia economic zone and is a former industrial hub. The city covers a total area of 24,744.6 km2and has a population exceeding 9.1 million.

On the basis of air quality monitoring data collected during the 24 h preceding precipitation events (PM2.5and PM10), backward air mass trajectories, and precipitation characteristics, the precipitation events in Changchun were classified into four types: haze type (HZ), dust type (DS), monsoon type (MN), and convective type (CC).

CC: precipitation duration < 1 h, accompanied by strong convection or thunderstorm activity.

Changchun is located in the high-latitude northern temperate zone and experiences a typical continental monsoon climate. Both precipitation types and meteorological conditions exhibit pronounced seasonal variations. In spring, inland airflow from the Eurasian continent dominated, leading to a higher frequency of DS and HZ events. In contrast, summer precipitation is influenced primarily by Pacific-sourced moisture transport and thermally induced surface convection, resulting in more frequent MN and CC events.

Precipitation samples were collected from March 15, 2024, to September 15, 2024, with three sampling events for each precipitation type. Although the number of events was limited, the sampling strategy was designed to reflect the dominant precipitation types and seasonal variation in Changchun during this period. This approach enabled a controlled comparative analysis under a consistent classification scheme and standardized indoor simulation conditions. For each precipitation type, the average outdoor temperature and wind speed during the evaporation period, as well as the total precipitation amount were recorded (Table1). Specifically, the post-rainfall evaporation period was set to 5 h for DS and HZ events and 3 h for CC and MN events.

Outdoor meteorological conditions during the evaporation phases of precipitation.

Precipitation samples were collected from a lawn located approximately 50 m from the main road on the campus of Jilin Jianzhu University. No industrial pollution sources or buildings exceeding 30 m in height were located in the vicinity, and the surrounding area lacked dense vegetation canopies or open water bodies, making this location representative of typical urban precipitation conditions. Importantly, the samples were collected directly during rainfall events using pre-cleaned glass beakers, without any contact with terrestrial or aquatic surfaces (e.g., forest litter, rivers, soil). This approach ensured that the chemical composition of the samples solely reflected atmospheric wet deposition, without influence from post-depositional surface interactions. Prior to use, the beakers were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water (18.25 MΩ cm) and dried in an oven to minimize dilution effects from residual water. The beakers were placed within 30 min before the onset of each precipitation event, and samples were collected within 30 min after the event ended. Under these conditions, the influence of dry deposition on the samples can be considered negligible. In addition, to meet the analytical requirements, the collected volume of each sample exceeded 20 mL.

The samples were filtered within 30 min of collection via a 0.45 μm microporous membrane filter. The pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured using a Leici DZS-706-A multiparameter analyzer immediately after filtration to prevent alterations caused by contamination or storage (Fig.1(b)). The concentrations of four anions (Cl−, NO2−, NO3−, and SO42−) and five cations (NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) in the precipitate were determined via ion chromatography (Thermo Fisher, USA). The anions were separated via an AS-19 column with 20 mM KOH as the eluent. Cations were separated via a CS-15 column with methanesulfonic acid as the isocratic eluent. All the samples were stored in the dark at ~ 4 °C until further analysis.

After analyzing the chemical compositions of the four types of precipitation, we quantified the NH3release flux and rate through complete evaporation experiments. A single-factor experimental design was employed to examine the factors influencing the NH4+conversion rate. On the basis of the seasonal characteristics of the precipitation types presented in Table1, different evaporation conditions were set to compare the effects of temperature and wind speed on the NH4+conversion rates during precipitation evaporation. The effect of the rainfall amount on NH3release was assessed by adjusting the sample volume in the glass test tube to simulate different rainfall amounts.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig.1(c). The samples were placed in a glass test tube, with one end connected to an air compressor pump supplying clean zero air and the other end linked to a URG-2000-30*150-3CSS annular denuder to collect the NH3released during precipitation evaporation. The denuder was cleaned and coated before use, following a procedure detailed in previous studies25. During evaporation, some NH4+can volatilize as gaseous NH3and N2. The released NH3is captured by the annular denuder, while N2is released directly into the atmosphere. Moreover, some NH4+remains as ammonium salts in the glass test tube. Once the solution fully evaporated, 20 mL of deionized water was added to the test tube, and the tube was thoroughly shaken to extract residual components remaining after complete evaporation. Subsequently, 10 mL of deionized water was added to the denuder, which was slowly rotated for ~ 30 s to extract trapped substances. (Fig.1(d)). Both extracts were analyzed for NH4+concentration via ion chromatography, and the data were used to calculate the NH4+release ratio and residual rate during the precipitation evaporation phase.

Given the limited sample size for each event type (n= 3), nonparametric statistical methods were applied to assess differences between groups. A significance level ofP< 0.05 was adopted for reference.

The 24-hour concentration data of air pollutants, including PM2.5and PM10, in Changchun are freely available from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (https://quotsoft.net/air/).Meteorological parameters for the study area, such as the wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, were obtained from the automatic weather station (MK-111-LR) at Jilin Jianzhu University. Airflow characteristics near the study area are analyzed via the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (https://www.ready.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT_traj.php)30,31. This model uses an altitude of 500 m as the boundary layer height to generate 24-hour backward trajectories of air masses. Data on the atmospheric quality and fire hotspot distribution along air mass pathways can be obtained from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) (https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/).

According to statistics, there were 20 precipitation days in spring in Changchun, with a total rainfall of 15.2 mm. Among them, HZ and DS occurred three times each, generally accompanied by low rainfall amounts. In summer, precipitation was predominantly classified as MN, which was influenced mainly by East Pacific circulation and typhoons. In addition, the concentrations of PM2.5and PM10in spring were significantly higher than those in summer (P< 0.05). Different meteorological conditions and air quality levels can result in variations in the chemical compositions of different types of precipitation.

pH is a fundamental and widely recognized indicator for assessing precipitation acidity15. Fig2demonstrated that the pH values of the four types of rainfall ranged from 5.75 to 7.41, with significant differences (P< 0.05). The VWM pH, determined from rainfall data via Eq. (5), followed the sequence HZ < MN < CC < DS (P< 0.05). All the measured values exceeded the pH of natural precipitation in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2(pH = 5.6)26. Consequently, the four types of precipitation were considered nonacidic and unlikely to cause acid damage to the environment, which is consistent with the findings of Wu et al.32.

VWMs of ion concentrations (µEq/L), pH, EC (µS/cm), and total ion concentrations for various types of precipitation (numbers in circles).

EC is a crucial indicator of atmospheric pollution, with elevated values typically signifying increased pollution levels33. Figure2revealed that the EC of various types of precipitation followed the order DS > HZ > MN > CC (P< 0.05), with all values surpassing the average EC of 14.8 µS/cm at Waliguan Mountain, a background site in China34. Comparison analysis revealed notable seasonal differences, with the EC of spring precipitation being significantly greater than that of summer precipitation (P< 0.05). This trend reflects the improved air quality in summer compared with that in spring. On the one hand, the greater amount and frequency of rainfall in summer reduce the amount of suspended particulate pollutants in the atmosphere, resulting in lower EC values. On the other hand, the low temperatures and high atmospheric pressure characteristic of spring frequently create stagnant wind conditions, inhibiting the dispersion of atmospheric particulates and leaving more pollutants suspended in the air35.

According to Fig.2, the predominant water-soluble ions in HZ, DS, CC, and MN were SO42−, NO3−, Ca2+, and NH4+, accounting for 74%, 75%, 74%, and 67% of the total ion concentrations in these types of precipitation, respectively. Although the major cation and anion components were the same, the ion concentrations in HZ and DS were significantly greater than those in CC and MN (P< 0.05), reflecting marked seasonal variation. This disparity can be attributed to the difference in rainfall amounts between spring and summer, which resulted in varying levels of ion dilution. Additionally, the intensification of anthropogenic activities in spring, such as agricultural practices, urban construction, transportation, and biomass burning (e.g., straw or waste combustion), significantly enhances the emission of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, thereby shaping the unique seasonal characteristics of the different precipitation types36. A comparative analysis of precipitation types within the same season indicated that HZ and DS presented similar ion compositions, as did CC and MN. This similarity can be explained by the shared sources of pollutants. Spring haze formation is predominantly affected by meteorological drivers, pollutant sources, and atmospheric circulation patterns rather than by coal burning or heating emissions, distinguishing it from the haze formation mechanisms observed in autumn and winter37,38. As a result, the ionic characteristics of HZ and DS were consistent. The ionic composition of precipitation driven by intense atmospheric convection under the strong influence of summer ocean monsoons is likely governed by marine air masses. Consequently, CC and MN exhibited analogous structural compositions.

The ratio of total anions to total cations (ΔC) is commonly used as an indicator of the relative amounts of major ionic components39. The calculations indicated that the total ion concentration ratio of anions to cations in all the precipitation samples was 0.93 ± 0.07, suggesting a deficiency of anions. This anion deficiency could be attributed to unmonitored inorganic anions (e.g., F−, PO43−) and organic anions (e.g., HCOO−, CH3COO−) present in the precipitation40. Additionally, construction dust from nearby areas and the naturally alkaline properties of northern China’s soil likely contributed to the enrichment of cations such as Ca2+and Mg2+41,42. Fig2demonstrated that the VWM of the total ion concentration in spring precipitation was approximately double that in summer precipitation. This observation was consistent with Rao et al. (2016), who reported that analyte concentrations were higher during dry periods than during wet periods, emphasizing the critical impact of climatic conditions on the composition of precipitation.

To examine the characteristics of airflow movement near the study area and identify the primary sources of ions in different precipitation types, specific dates were chosen to represent HZ, DS, CC, and MN: April 12, March 27, August 20, and July 22, respectively. Starting at an altitude of 500 m—selected to represent regional air mass transport while minimizing the effects of surface-layer turbulence—24-hour backward trajectories were calculated, as illustrated in Fig.3. The trajectories for different precipitation types showed significant differences and distinct seasonal patterns: in spring, terrestrial input predominated with poorer air quality, whereas summer air masses mainly originated from marine sources. Air masses generally acquire pollutants as they pass through regions with emission sources43. The air masses associated with the HZ (Fig.3(a)) followed long trajectories from the northeast, passing through areas with poor air quality, resulting in high concentrations of SO42−and NO3−. The air masses for DS (Fig.3(b)) predominantly originated from eastern Russia, with long-range transport of soil dust resulting in the enrichment of terrestrial components such as Ca2+and Mg2+44. CC air masses (Fig.3(c))involve primarily localized transport between northeastern cities, with significant contributions from anthropogenic pollution45. MN air masses (Fig.3(d)) are influenced by typhoon weather, characterized by long trajectories and fast-moving, clean marine airflow. After passing through regions of poor air quality in the Sea of Japan, these air masses carry some anthropogenic pollutants46.

The transformation of NH4+to NH3during evaporation is governed primarily by the acid–base equilibrium between NH4+and NH3(NH4+⇌ NH3+ H+, pKa ≈ 9.25), which is highly sensitive to changes in pH and temperature47,48. Under near-neutral or slightly acidic conditions (pH < 7), inorganic nitrogen predominantly exists as NH4+, making NH3volatilization thermodynamically unfavorable. However, as evaporation progresses, localized increases in pH may occur due to preferential water loss and ionic concentration effects, slightly shifting the equilibrium toward NH3. This shift can increase the volatilization of NH3. Additionally, the thermal instability and semi volatility of NH4NO3at temperatures above 25 °C may further contribute to NH3emissions49. Therefore, the observed unrecovered NH4+(26.90 ± 13.21%) may have resulted from the combined effects of the NH4+/NH3acid–base equilibrium and NH4NO3volatilization under the experimental conditions.

TheRvalues for the different precipitation types, ranked from high to low, were DS > HZ > CC > MN (P< 0.05), with average values of 61.67 ± 9.71%, 61.00 ± 1.73%, 45.67 ± 9.02%, and 38.67 ± 6.35%, respectively (Fig.4). This indicates that approximately half of the NH4+in the precipitation in the study area was released back into the boundary layer, facilitating nitrogen deposition. Assuming complete evaporation of all atmospheric precipitation, the NH3release flux (F) and release rate (V) were calculated via Eqs. (3) and (4), considering the different precipitation amounts and evaporation durations. The results revealed significant differences in both the release flux (F) and release rate (V) among the different precipitation types. In spring, theFvalues for HZ and DS were 1714.85 ± 1662.88 µg/m2and 4010.58 ± 2184.05 µg/m2, respectively, with correspondingVvalues of 93.34 ± 112.32 ng/m2·s and 216.43 ± 132.37 ng/m2·s, respectively. In summer, theFvalues for CC and MN were 905.39 ± 662.89 µg/m2and 11192.50 ± 6580.20 µg/m2, respectively, whereas theVvalues were 52.45 ± 39.03 ng/m2·s and 714.44 ± 408.37 ng/m2·s, respectively. These differences may result from variations in precipitation characteristics and evaporation durations among the different rain types. Notably, within the same precipitation type, large variations in the amount of precipitation among individual events can lead to substantial fluctuations inFvalues, thereby contributing to the large standard deviations observed.

NH4+conversion rate (R), NH3release flux (F), and release rate (V) during the evaporation of various types of precipitation.Experimental conditions: 15 °C, 1 m/s, 1 mL.

On the basis of the total precipitation during the study period and an actual evaporation ratio of approximately 6%50, the average NH3release flux from rainfall evaporation was estimated to be 20.33 µg/m2in spring and 64.53 µg/m2in summer. To further assess the potential contribution of this flux to atmospheric NH3levels, the atmospheric boundary layer was defined as 100 m, which more accurately represents the near-surface environment where NH3volatilization and deposition predominantly occur. By comparing the estimated release with the average atmospheric NH3concentrations in northeastern China51—4.83 µg/m3in spring and 8.44 µg/m3in summer—NH3released through rainfall evaporation accounted for approximately 4.14% of the total NH3concentration in spring and 7.70% of the total NH3concentration in summer. This further corroborated the phenomenon whereby NH3surges near the ground surface within 1–2 hours after precipitation.

TheFrac (NH3)for each precipitation event was calculated via Eq. (7). IfFrac (NH3)≥1, all NH4+is released as NH3into the atmosphere. If 0<Frac (NH3)<1, part of the NH4+is released as NH3, while the remaining NH4+forms ammonium salts with SO42−, Cl−, and NO3−, which are left as residues. IfFrac (NH3)<0, all NH4+remains in the form of ammonium salts, with no NH3released. The experimentally obtained relationship betweenRandFrac (NH3)is shown in Fig.5. The fitting coefficient (R2was 0.92, indicating a strong correlation. The observed discrepancy may be due to the failure to account for small amounts of formate, acetate, and other low-molecular-weight organic acids in the samples, which could slightly overestimate the theoretical values compared with the actual values17.

Actual and theoretical NH4+conversion rates during the evaporation of precipitation.

Solution evaporation is a complex process involving both chemical and physical mechanisms, with outcomes varying significantly depending on environmental conditions. Takenaka et al. (2009) reported that when an ammonium acetate solution rapidly evaporates at high temperatures (100 °C), the solute tends to deposit as a solid on the contact surface. In contrast, when the solution evaporates slowly at room temperature, the solute is released primarily in the gas phase, with minimal solid residue remaining on the surface. These findings indicate that the drying rate of the solution significantly influences the final fate of the solute; evaporation rates are affected by various meteorological factors, including temperature, wind speed, and droplet size19. To further investigate the effects of temperature, wind speed, and droplet size on the NH4+conversion rate during the evaporation of different types of precipitation, this study utilized natural precipitation samples collected on April 15, April 24, August 22, and July 22, representing HZ, DS, CC, and MN, respectively. Indoor simulation experiments were conducted to measure theRvalue under various experimental conditions. The results provide new insights into the dynamic characteristics of nitrogen cycling during precipitation evaporation and its broader environmental implications.

As shown in Fig.6, the temperature significantly influencedRduring the evaporation of different types of precipitation, with a consistent pattern across all types. Overall,Rincreased to a peak and then decreased with increasing temperature, suggesting that temperatures within a specific range promoted the conversion of NH4+to NH3. However, excessively high temperatures may trigger adverse reactions, further increasing the conversion rate. At low temperatures (T ≤ 10 °C),Rwas generally low. As the temperature increased from 10 °C to 25 °C,Rincreased significantly, peaking at 25 °C. This increase was likely due to the high concentrations of NO3−and NH4+in the precipitation, which, under optimal conditions, combined to form secondary ammonium salts (NH4NO3). These ammonium salts are thermally unstable and particularly sensitive to temperature changes. Studies have shown that when the temperature is between 5 °C and 25 °C and the relative humidity exceeds 40%, increasing the temperature accelerates the decomposition of ammonium salts, shifting the reaction equilibrium toward NH3release, which significantly enhances the ammonia flux and increasesR52. From a molecular dynamics perspective, higher temperatures increase molecular motion in solution, increasing the distance between molecules and weakening intermolecular interactions. This reduction in NH3solubility in solution facilitated the conversion of NH4+into NH3, allowing it to escape more readily from the solution53. However, as the temperature continued to rise,Rdecreased, reaching a minimum at 35 °C. This was likely due to the increased evaporation rate at higher temperatures, which caused water molecules to evaporate more rapidly48. Rapid evaporation increased the concentration of solutes in solution, leading to the precipitation of poorly soluble salts once their solubility limit was reached, removing them from the evaporation process. Concurrently, ions with higher solubilities, such as NH4+and NO2−, remained dissolved and continued to react to form NH4NO2. NH4NO2tends to decompose into N2and H2O at relatively high temperatures19leading to the consumption of NH4+and a further decrease inR.

Effects of temperature on the NH4+conversion rate during the evaporation of various rainfall types.

A comparison of different samples revealed significant systematic differences inRduring evaporation across the entire temperature range. The conversion rates followed the order HZ > DS > CC > MN (P< 0.05), reflecting the varying effects of the chemical composition of different precipitation types onR. This difference can be attributed to the combined effects of pH, excess nonvolatile anions, and the initial concentration of NH4+in the precipitation54. A relatively high pH typically favors the conversion of NH4+to NH3. However, the presence of excess nonvolatile anions in precipitation shifts the chemical equilibrium, reducingR19. Additionally, the initial concentration of NH4+has a complex effect on the conversion rate25. A higher initial concentration provides more NH4+but also amplifies the inhibitory effect of nonvolatile anions, further decreasingR. Although the pH of HZ was lower than those of the other precipitation types, the presence of excess nonvolatile anions and a moderate NH4+concentration contributed to its higherRvalue. In contrast, DS and CC exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect from excess nonvolatile anions, which prevented these samples from achieving highRvalues, despite having higher pH values. Finally, MN, with the lowest initial NH4+concentration and a low pH, presented the lowestRvalue during evaporation.

As shown in Fig.7, theRvalues during the evaporation of the four different types of precipitation ranged between 20% and 80%, exhibiting a significant decreasing trend with increasing WS. Specifically,Rwas negatively correlated with WS (P< 0.05). This trend indicated that wind speed had a pronounced inhibitory effect on the conversion of NH4+to NH3during precipitation evaporation. The main reason for this may be that an increase in the wind speed altered the microenvironment of the solution. On the one hand, higher wind speeds accelerated evaporation at the solution surface, and the cooling effect during evaporation lowered the surface temperature. Under these lower temperature conditions, NH4+tends to combine with acidic substances in solution to form ammonium salts, which remain in the liquid phase rather than being released as a gas. This resulted in a significant decrease inRwith increasing wind speed55. On the other hand, increased wind speed reduced the thickness of the stagnant boundary layer at the gas‒liquid interface, making it easier for water molecules to diffuse into the gas phase. This phenomenon accelerated evaporation, causing the concentration of solutes to gradually increase. As a result, some poorly soluble metal salts may have crystallized out due to supersaturation, limiting the escape of NH4+to the gas phase and causingRto decrease progressively.

Effects of the wind speed on the NH4+conversion rate during the evaporation of various rainfall types.

In addition, all types of precipitation presented different rates of decrease inRacross the range of wind speeds, which were influenced mainly by the initial NH4+concentration and solution saturation. Under calm wind or near-still conditions (wind speed = 0 m/s), theRvalue of CC was the highest and decreased most rapidly. When the wind speed increased to 3 m/s,Rdecreased to 19.12%, which was only one quarter of the rate under calm conditions. This suggested that CC was the most sensitive precipitation type to wind speed changes, with its evaporation highly dependent on disturbances at the gas‒liquid interface. Upon closer analysis, although CC had a low total ion concentration, resulting in low solution saturation, its significantly lower NH4+concentration reduced the inhibitory effect of excess NH4+onR25allowingRto vary significantly with changes in wind speed. In contrast, MN exhibited a more stable decreasing trend under different wind speeds, with a difference of only 29.01% between the maximum and minimum conversion rates, indicating that MN was the precipitation type least affected by wind speed changes. This was likely due to the low NH4+concentration and low solution saturation of MN, which weakened the impact of wind speed on its conversion rate. DS, with the highest solution saturation, showed a greater degree of wind speed-induced variation, although it was still lower than that of CC. Its decline pattern was characterized by an initial rapid decrease followed by a more gradual flattening. HZ, with NH4+and total ion concentrations intermediate between those of DS and MN, displayed a relatively uniform decreasing pattern, and its response to wind speed changes was also intermediate. Overall, owing to differences in initial NH4+concentration and solution saturation, the response ofRto variations in wind speed differed among the precipitation types, with the order from high to low being CC > DS > HZ > MN (P< 0.05). These differences highlight the driving effect of wind speed on the conversion of NH4+to NH3during precipitation evaporation and its underlying mechanisms.

The factors influencing solution evaporation include not only meteorological conditions such as temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation but also solution factors such as droplet size and solute concentration56. As shown in Fig.8, the NH3release andRresults for the different types of precipitation at different sample volumes revealed similar patterns across all precipitation types. Specifically, for 0.5 mL of precipitation, the amount of NH3released after evaporation ranged from 0.4 to 1.4 mg/L, while theRvalues remained between 60% and 75%. However, as the sample volume increased to 5 mL, the NH3release increased to 1.5–5.5 mg/L, whereasRsignificantly decreased to less than 30%. This suggested that increasing the sample volume significantly inhibited the conversion of NH4+to NH3during evaporation, with a negative correlation observed between the two factors (P< 0.05). By calculating the ratio of nonvolatile anions to nonvolatile cations in the samples, it was found that excess nonvolatile anions were present in all types of precipitation. As the sample volume increased, excess nonvolatile anions gradually accumulated in the solution, inhibiting the conversion of NH4+and resulting in a decrease inR. Moreover, as evaporation progressed, the reduction in water molecules caused metal cations in the precipitate to combine with nonvolatile anions such as SO42−, NO3−, and Cl−, forming salts with low solubility that exited the evaporation system as crystals. This weakened the promoting effect of metal cations on NH4+conversion, leading to the observed decline inRwith increasing sample volume. On the other hand, NH3release clearly increased with increasing sample volume, indicating a positive correlation between sample volume and NH3release (P< 0.05). This resulted from the increased NH4+concentration in the precipitate as the sample volume increased, leading to more NH3being released after evaporation. Furthermore, the NH3release levels for the different types of precipitation followed the order DS > HZ > CC > MN (P< 0.05), which was closely related to the initial NH4+content in the precipitation.

Effects of the amount of precipitation on the NH4+conversion rate and NH3release during the evaporation of various rainfall types.

On the basis of the results of the indoor simulation experiments conducted under different meteorological conditions to determineR, as well as theFrac (NH3)values calculated via Eq. (7), the temperature coefficient (K1), wind speed coefficient (K2), and precipitation amount coefficient (K3) affecting NH4+conversion during precipitation evaporation were further calculated via Eq. (8) (Table2). The results showed thatRwas controlled not only by the chemical parameters of precipitation, such as ion concentration and pH but also by meteorological conditions. Specifically, with the same chemical parameter values, the total NH3release during precipitation evaporation in moderate-temperature regions may be greater than that in colder or hotter regions, whereas theFvalue of precipitation in areas with mild winds and an arid climate may be lower than that in regions with strong winds and heavy rainfall. Therefore, theRvalues in different regions are constrained by both the chemical composition of precipitation and the local meteorological conditions, resulting in significant differences in the total NH3flux released after the evaporation of precipitation across various regions.

Temperature coefficient, wind speed coefficient, and precipitation amount coefficient.

By comprehensively considering the impacts of temperature, wind speed, and precipitation amount and quantitatively analyzing these factors, the changes in NH3flux under different spatial and temporal conditions can be predicted more accurately. This study provides valuable data for subsequent research and serves as a scientific basis for optimizing environmental management measures.

This study revealed that all precipitation types exhibited nonacidic characteristics and were dominated by water-soluble ions such as SO42−, NO3−, Ca2+, and NH4+. Significant differences were observed in the NH4+conversion rates among the precipitation types, and the release of NH3exhibited clear seasonal pattern. Meteorological factors, including temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, play critical roles in influencing NH3volatilization. In addition, the NH3fluxes released from precipitation evaporation were 20.33 µg/m2in spring and 64.53 µg/m2in summer, accounting for approximately 4.14% and 7.70%, respectively, of the corresponding atmospheric NH3concentrations.

By integrating chemical composition analysis with meteorological analysis, this study offers a novel approach to quantify NH3release from precipitation evaporation at local scales. These findings underscore the importance of precipitation evaporation as a nonnegligible source of atmospheric NH3and provide a scientific basis for improving ammonia emission inventories and atmospheric nitrogen management strategies.

This study is limited by a relatively small sample size and the absence of surface-level interactions under field conditions. Key environments factors such as relative humidity and photochemical processes were not considered, which may constrain the spatial applicability of the results. Moreover, in natural settings, post-depositional interactions with land, vegetation, and water bodies can alter NH4+concentrations and pH, thereby influencing NH3volatilization. Future research should incorporate field observations, large datasets, and coupled modeling approaches to capture a broader range of environmental variables and improve the mechanistic understanding of NH4+to NH3conversion under complex atmospheric and surface-mediated conditions.
