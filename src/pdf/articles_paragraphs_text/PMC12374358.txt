Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which serve as an early indicator of tumors in peripheral blood, are closely associated with unfavorable prognoses in individuals with cancer. Gaining a thorough understanding of the heterogeneity and specific trajectory of CTCs during metastasis can yield valuable insights for the development of effective cancer treatment strategies. This review critically examines the contemporary knowledge of the in vivo process of CTCs, with a focus on the four key stages: dissemination, homing, colonization, and macro-metastasis. Each stage is discussed in terms of its associated characteristics, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), dormancy, organotropism, and awakening. We also discuss recent advancements in CTC isolation, detection, cultivation and its potential applications. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive elucidation of the intricate mechanisms of immune evasion and drug resistance in CTCs, aiming to identify novel targets for cancer therapy. Finally, an overview of CTC interventions is presented, which may facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic approaches for patients and improve their metastasis-free prognostic outcomes.

The issue of metastasis has persisted since the inception of cancer treatment. However, it remains unresolved and accounts for over 90% of cancer-related fatalities [1]. Growing evidence highlights the crucial role of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in driving cancer metastasis. CTCs are neoplastic cells that evade the primary tumor or metastatic sites and enter the bloodstream during tumor progression. The notion of CTCs was first introduced by Ashworth, while Paget later employed the metaphor of CTCs as seeds and specific organs/tissues as fertile ground, vividly illustrating the migratory processes of CTCs within the human body [2]. Since then, an increasing number of investigations have documented a significant correlation between CTCs and the progression of malignancies.

During the progression of tumor metastasis, CTCs encounter numerous adverse circumstances. However, these resilient tumor cells exhibit adaptability by acquiring the phenotypic traits of other stromal cells in the circulatory system, allowing them to evade the harsh living environment and migrate to distant organs, where they form remote metastases.

In this in vivo process, employing distinct markers to delineate various states and subtypes of CTCs can unveil significant phenomena, such as immune evasion and resistance to pharmaceutical interventions. This approach may provide a foundation for identifying innovative therapeutic approaches and targets for cancer treatment. This review examines recent research on CTCs/ disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), summarizing their key characteristics during metastasis in vivo, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor dormancy, organotropism and awakening. These findings undoubtedly enhance our understanding of the substantial metastatic potential of CTCs.

Currently, CTCs have gained significant attention in cancer prediction, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis assessment, with liquid biopsy emerging as a prominent application. Nonetheless, a paradox arises due to the limited availability of CTCs and the imperative need for comprehensive investigation. Understanding the in vivo mechanisms of CTCs presents an essential challenge, particularly in accurately characterizing isolated CTCs to determine their stages and subtypes. Achieving a flawless technological system that ensures 100% separation purity, identification accuracy and culture reliability is of utmost importance. In addition, addressing the scarcity of CTCs requires the development of highly efficient methods for in vitro expansion.

In this review, we aim to comprehensively investigate the pathways and mechanisms underlying these events in the circulatory system of CTCs. Potential treatment strategies targeting CTCs are also summarized. By doing so, we aspire to generate insights that can guide the development of precision-targeted therapies, aligning with the existing clinical treatment strategy.

CTCs undergo several critical stages, beginning with their detachment from the primary tumor site (Fig.1). The whole process of metastasis has been well-reviewed by Gerstberger et al. and Ring et al. [3,4]. Specifically, the metastatic cascade involves four key stages: dissemination, homing, colonization, and macro-metastasis. Most CTCs acquire EMT characteristics to better adapt and survive in the dissemination journey. Despite quite a few primary tumor cells entering the bloodstream, the harsh pressures of circulation can eliminate a large number of these cells. However, some resilient CTCs withstand these pressures by entering a dormant state, particularly homing into the bone marrow, where they are known as DTCs. Once in the bone marrow, DTCs may undergo epigenetic changes and phenotypic remodeling, enhancing their stemness and metastatic potential. They then reenter the circulation and colonize distant organs, exhibiting organotropism, where they can remain dormant for extended periods. When appropriate stimuli disrupt this dormant state, these awakening cells regain vitality and contribute to macro-metastasis.

EMT involves several key changes: reorganization of the epithelial cell cytoskeleton, loss of cell polarity, detachment from the basement membrane, and the acquisition of mesenchymal cell function. This progress is crucial for enabling cells to evade shear stress, apoptosis, anoikis, cell senescence and immune surveillance. Additionally, EMT can contribute to the resistance of tumor cells against chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other treatments. Consequently, EMT makes a remarkable contribution to the survival and metastasis of CTCs. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the biological alterations that transpire in CTCs following EMT. Despite this, certain indications exist that offer insights for further investigation into these alterations.

Presently, most methods for detecting CTCs rely on the cell surface marker EpCAM, with the CellSearch platform being a notable example. However, during EMT, tumor cells undergo biological alterations that can reduce EpCAM expression. As a result, CTCs with low or absent EpCAM expression are often undetectable, leading to limited research on these CTCs. Investigating the biological changes in CTCs following EMT could provide valuable insights. For instance, blood samples from 72 colorectal cancer patients showed a significant reduction in epithelial markers (EpCAM, CK19, and CEA) in CTCs compared to tumor tissue, indicating that most CTCs lose their epithelial phenotype in the bloodstream. Similarly, DTCs in the bone marrow of esophageal cancer patients also often displayed low EpCAM levels [5]. Studies found that EpCAM-low CTCs had reduced proliferation but increased migration, suggesting these cells have a higher potential for metastasis [6]. G.Roa and colleagues noted that elevated EpCAM expression in primary and metastatic tumors is influenced by the local microenvironment, with EpCAM levels in CTCs or DTCs dropping approximately tenfold upon entering circulation [7]. Additionally, metastatic xenotransplantation mouse models and cell-based experiments demonstrated decreased EpCAM expression and upregulation of EMT-related genes, reinforcing the link between EMT and reduced EpCAM expression [8].

Conversely, EMT progress shows upregulated mesenchymal characteristics. This shift significantly enhances the aggressiveness of CTC clusters, as shown by Yu et al.. in 2013. Kallergi et al.. observed the expression of TWIST and Vimentin in CTCs among patients with metastatic or early breast cancer, indicating that breast cancer CTCs acquired mesenchymal characteristics. The higher prevalence of TWIST+and Vimentin+cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) supports the role of EMT-positive CTCs in metastasis [9]. Additionally, CTCs undergoing EMT regulate integrin β1 and the transcription factor SLUG through elevated fibronectin expression, boosting their metastatic potential [10]. The upregulation of N-cadherin and stem cell marker ABCB5 also contributes to EMT [11]. In a cohort of 149 primary breast cancer patients, CTCs were detected in about 25% of cases, with 13.4% showing EMT markers [12]. Elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) in these patients suggest a potential link between MMP1 and EMT-positive CTCs. These findings align with other researches indicating that EMT-positive CTCs are associated with poorer prognosis in primary breast cancer cases [13].

However, hybrid epithelial–mesenchymal (E/M) states can be enriched in CTCs from breast cancer patients [14]. These CTCs exhibit reversible E/M shifts that are associated with dynamic therapeutic responses and disease progression. Epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) refers to the ability of cells to adopt mixed E/M characteristics and interconvert between intermediate E/M phenotypic states [15]. This plasticity may confer a survival advantage to CTCs during the various stages of the metastatic cascade. Since EMP leads to the downregulation or loss of epithelial markers, it complicates the isolation and detection of all CTC subpopulations using EpCAM antibodies.

Controversies persist regarding whether EMT is the sole mechanism of CTC generation or the primary driver of metastasis. Padmanaban et al.. reported that the epithelial marker E-cadherin promotes metastasis in various models of breast cancer by limiting reactive oxygen-mediated apoptosis [16]. Using an EMT lineage-tracing system, another group identified that non-EMT tumor cells are the dominant population in lung metastases, while EMT cells play a significant role in chemoresistance and the recurrence of lung metastasis [17]. Furthermore, a subsequent study revealed that epithelial CTCs, with limited mesenchymal transition, exhibited a higher lung metastatic potential compared to mesenchymal CTCs in breast cancer models [18]. However, these studies did not address the hybrid states of CTCs during tumor dissemination. It is plausible that CTCs adopt a hybrid E/M state while disseminating to distant organs and later undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) to recover the epithelial phenotype. Additionally, it remains unclear which CTC subpopulation predominates in metastasis across different cancer types. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which EMT contributes to CTC formation and metastasis.

The mechanisms that regulate EMT progression in CTCs are not yet fully understood. However, key signaling pathways, such as TGF-β, NOTCH, WNT/β-catenin and Hippo appear to play significant roles. Additionally, circulation pressures such as shear stress and anoikis also contribute to EMT. TGF-β, secreted by platelets or other circulation cells, activates the TGF-β/SMAD pathway in CTCs to promote and sustain the EMT phenotype and thus enhance their metastatic potential [14,19]. Sprouse et al.. reported that polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) can interact with CTCs by forming CTC/PMN-MDSC clusters. This heterotypic clustering increases NOTCH activation in CTCs through the engagement of Jagged1 expressed by PMN-MDSCs to NOTCH1 receptor [20]. To depict the spatial heterogeneity of CTCs in epithelial and mesenchymal composition, blood samples from 73 localized hepatocellular carcinoma patients were collected from different veins before tumor resection. The results showed that CTCs were predominantly epithelial at the point of release, but transitioned to an EMT phenotype during circulating, mediated by SMAD2 and β-catenin signaling pathways [21].

Tumor cells undergoing EMT are accompanied by efficient intravasation/extravasation [3]. EMT boosts the invasion ability of CTCs, facilitating their movement into and out of blood vessels, thus selecting for more aggressive CTCs capable of metastasis. In essence, EMT acts as a “sword” for CTCs, facilitating their journey from primary tumors to distant organs.

Tumor cells encounter numerous adverse circumstances during metastasis, including chemotherapy, shear stress from blood flow, and immune surveillance. Dormancy can serve as a protective mechanism, providing a refuge for resilient tumor cells [22]. Typically, dormancy involves tumor cells exiting the cell cycle and entering the G0 phase, characterized by a quiescent state or very slow cell division, often associated with de-repressed p38 and suppressed ERK1/2 [23]. CTCs are capable of homing to the bone marrow, becoming DTCs that remain quiescent in the bone marrow for extended periods. These dormant DTCs are believed to be potential sources of CTCs, capable of migrating to other organs and initiating metastasis under appropriate conditions. Several pieces of evidence support the notion that the bone marrow serves as a critical niche for dormant CTCs/DTCs.

1) DTCs in the bone marrow are often detectable in early non-metastatic cancer patients and are associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease or locoregional relapse [24–28]. To investigate the origins of DTCs in breast cancer, Demeulemeester and colleagues performed single-cell sequencing on bone marrow epithelial-like cells from six non-metastatic breast cancer patients. They found that approximately half of these single cells were classified as DTCs originating from primary tumors and/or lymph node metastases, while the remaining CNA-positive cells were present in the bone marrow of non-metastatic patients. This suggests that the bone marrow acts as an early metastatic niche for DTCs and supports the notion that DTCs can evolve independently from the primary tumor [29].

2) The number of DTCs in the bone marrow is significantly higher than the number of CTCs in the peripheral blood collected from the same patient. For instance, in a study enrolling 40 neuroblastoma patients, matched blood and bone marrow samples were collected to detect GD2+/CD45−CTCs or DTCs using Imagestream flow cytometer. CTCs were detected in 26 of 42 patient blood samples (with the CTC number of mean 40/mL, range 1–264/mL at diagnosis; mean 6/mL, range, 1–39/mL at relapse), while DTCs were detected in 25 of 35 bone marrow samples (with the DTC number of mean 30,342/mL, range 57–291, 635/mL at diagnosis; mean 2,124/mL, range 112–15,688/mL at relapse) [30]. Other studies on breast cancer, prostate cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity have reported similar findings, reinforcing this conclusion [31–34].

3) The unique structure and diverse niches within the bone marrow play a crucial role in inducing and maintaining DTC dormancy. Bone marrow contains many different haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cell types. The bone marrow’s trabecular framework, surrounded by endosteum covered with osteoblasts and osteoclasts, includes a network of sinusoidal capillaries that facilitate the movement of DTCs in and out of circulation. The low hemodynamic pressure in these sinusoids, combined with the anchoring effect mediated by CXCR4/SDF-1, supports efficient DTC entry [35]. Specialized niches like the perivascular and endosteal niches help sustain DTC dormancy through direct and indirect interactions with host cells. It has been reported that the endosteal niche is the primary niche for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but prostate cancer DTCs can compete with HSCs to engage the endosteal niche [36]. A range of cellular factors such as osteopontin, GAS6, TGF-β, and BMP contribute to DTC dormancy by affecting cellular behavior and interactions [37–40]. For instance, TGF-β2 derived from osteoblasts diminishes DTC proliferation via TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRIII), though its effect is modulated by AXL expression in DTCs [38,39]. Similarly, NG2+and Nestin+mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) also produce TGF-β2 and BMP7, and activate the TGF-βRIII and BMPRIII-dependent quiescent pathway to induce dormancy in breast cancer DTCs [40]. Additionally, DTCs can alter the bone marrow microenvironment by secreting proteins that activate dormancy-related pathways. For instance, DTCs from indolent prostate cancer secrete acidic and cysteine-rich secretory proteins to indirectly trigger the activation of MSC-derived BMP7, which in turn activates dormancy-related signaling pathways in DTCs, such as p38, MAPK and p21 [41]. Furthermore, it has been observed that drug-resistant DTCs have the ability to localize in perivascular niches (PVN) withing the bone marrow, and immune signals like IFN-γ may serve as mediators of dormancy [42,43]. Dormant DTCs are also intricately linked to the EMT process of tumor cells [44]. Nevertheless, it is imperative to further investigate the intricate interactions among DTCs, different microenvironments, and cellular transitions.

4) Bone metastases can act as a source for subsequent multi-organ metastases. Some metastases are not directly from the primary tumor but from the further spread of existing metastases. Evidence suggests that the bone microenvironment significantly contributes to the development of secondary metastases in other organs [45–47]. For instance, Zhang et al.. revealed that metastasis initially targets the bone before spreading to other organs, using models such as intra-iliac artery (IIA) / vein (IIV) injection, mammary fat pad (MFP) implantation and parabiosis in breast and prostate cancer studies. Further utilizing an evolving barcode system (EBS), they uncovered that enhanced EZH2 activity mediated epigenetic reprogramming that conferred increased stemness on cancer cells disseminated from bone microenvironment [47]. Similarly, another group observed that the bone microenvironment induced increased metastatic ability and endocrine-resistant phenotype on bone-metastatic ER+breast cancer cells by using EBS analysis. This process was also dependent on EZH2-mediated epigenomic reprogramming that conferred hybrid EMT and increased stemness, as well as ER reduction [48]. Although the re-metastases of DTCs from bone marrow have been observed, the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Future studies should focus on how different bone niches and factors induce different epigenetic changes and phenotypic heterogeneity in DTCs, which could invigorate DTCs for further multi-organ dissemination.

After surviving circulation pressures and acquiring stemness and epigenetic changes, CTCs/DTCs migrate to colonize distant organs. This process, known as colonization, is characterized by organotropism and is influenced by tumor-specific traits, organ-specific environments, and hemodynamics.

Primary tumors can reprogram distant organ microenvironments by secreting soluble factors, such as cytokines, hormones, metabolites and extracellular vesicles [49]. For instance, different tumor-derived exosomal integrins uptaken by organ-specific cells promote the formation of different pre-metastatic niches. Lung-tropic exosomes containing integrins α6β4 and α6β1 tend to promote lung metastasis, whereas exosomal integrin αvβ5 is associated with liver metastasis [50]. Additionally, tumor cell-derived factors recruit immune suppressive cells such as MDSCs, TAMs, and Treg cells into distant sites, promoting pre-metastatic niche formation. Also, these factors can switch on stromal reprogramming, further remodeling the pre-metastatic niche [51].

Organ-specific environments, including cell composition, inflammation, and angiogenesis, play a crucial role in the adaptation and dormancy of CTCs/DTCs. For example, in lung metastasis, fibroblasts can greatly facilitate metastasis. Liu et al.. identified a metastasis-associated fibroblast subtype, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase-positive matrix fibroblasts (TDO2+MFs), which secret kynurenine to upregulate ferritin heavy chain 1 expression in DTCs, enabling DTCs to resist ferroptosis and inducing T cell dysfunction [52]. Gong et al.. found that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-expressing fibroblasts can produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to drive dysfunctional dendritic cells (DCs) and suppressive monocytes. Further, tumor-associated inflammation, particularly the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β remodeled a pre-metastatic niche [53]. Overall, the complex interactions and regulations within distant organs create an environment that supports CTCs/DTCs.

The bone marrow serves not only as an accessible homing organ for CTCs but also an organotropic niche for their settlement. Various niches within the bone marrow provide alternative survival and residency signals, and the interactions between bone marrow cells and tumor cells play a crucial role in the formation of pre-metastatic niches [54]. For instance, highly metastatic melanomas can secret exosomes that promote the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by reprogramming bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype, stimulated by exsome-derived receptor tyrosine kinase MET [55].

The liver is the predominant first site of metastasis for colorectal carcinoma, as colorectal cancer cells hematogenously disseminating from the intestines travel through the mesenteric vein into the hepatic portal vein and subsequently encountering the hepatic sinusoids. Similar to sinusoids in the bone marrow, CTCs can readily traverse the hepatic sinusoids and settle within the liver microenvironment. Although haemodynamics influence organotropism, the extent of this effect remains unclear. Notably, about 90% of uveal melanoma cases, despite being anatomically distant from the liver, metastasize to this organ, highlighting the significant role of tumor-specific characteristics and organ-specific niches in CTCs/DTCs homing [56].

DTCs in the host organ can remain in a dormant state for years, as proliferating DTCs are often cleared by immune cells. DTCs also continuously remodel the microenvironment to an immune suppressive niche during the residing. This ongoing interaction leads to a co-evolution between DTCs and the tumor microenvironment.

The establishment of a conducive microenvironment for tumor cell proliferation is essential for the efficient outgrowth of DTCs in distant organs, as it greatly influences the survival, sustenance, and awakening of DTCs. Reactivating dormant DTCs involves disrupting their quiescent niche, with a key mechanism being the inflammation-induced activation of the stroma.

Liver and lung fibrosis, resulting from stromal cell activation, are highly associated with metastatic outgrowth and serve as sources of awakening signals for dormant DTCs [57]. In the liver, NK cells sustain metastatic breast cancer cell dormancy through IFN-γ signaling. However, activated hepatic stellate cells secrete the chemokine CXCL12 to induce NK cell quiescence via its receptor CXCR4, acting as a master switch for DTCs awakening [58]. In the lungs, fibrosis induced by collagen I enables integrin β1-mediated outgrowth of dormant D2.0R cells through the phosphorylation of Src, FAK, and subsequent activation of myosin light chain [59]. Additionally, WNT5A maintains melanoma DTCs in a dormant state within the lung, but age-related reprogramming of lung fibroblasts increases the secretion of the soluble WNT antagonist sFRP1. This inhibition of WNT5A in melanoma DTCs enables efficient metastatic outgrowth. Tyrosine kinase receptors AXL and MER also play roles in regulating the dormancy-to-reactivation transition in melanoma DTCs [60]. Furthermore, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), observed in the tumor microenvironment of an inflammation model in mice, contribute to the activation of DTCs and promote cancer recurrence and metastasis. This is primarily attributed to the hydrolysis of laminin by neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), as well as the activation of the integrin α3β1 signaling pathway [61]. NETs also protect tumor cells from interactions with neighboring CD8+T cells and NK cells, thereby impeding the activity of anti-tumor immune cells [62].

DTCs awake from eradicating dormancy signaling such as STING, p38 signaling after adaption to their microenvironment. Tumor-intrinsic immune regulator STING typically inhibits DTC awakening, but this inhibition can be reduced by hypermethylation of STING promoters and enhancers, thus facilitating DTC reactivation and metastatic outgrowth [63]. In lung metastatic niches with low TGF-β2 levels, DTCs’ dormant state is more readily disrupted, leading to outgrowth. Therefore, systemic inhibition of TGF-βRI or p38α/β activities can awaken dormant DTCs, resulting in multi-organ metastases [64].

Additionally, the activation of dormant DTCs can be influenced by non-cellular factors present in the microenvironment, such as hypoxia and acidic conditions [65,66]. Enhancing our comprehension of the attributes and processes involved in the regulation of dormancy and awakening will enable the identification of prospective targets for augmenting susceptibility to chemotherapy resistance. This, in turn, may ultimately mitigate the likelihood of cancer recurrence and metastasis.

Unlike other targets in liquid biopsy, CTCs retain the complete set of genes inherited from the primary tumor, making them a potentially better reflection of both primary and secondary tissues. Consequently, the detection and analysis of CTCs offer valuable insights for cancer research, contingent upon the accurate identification of CTCs. Currently, a growing number of markers and their combinations are employed to isolate CTCs from patients’ peripheral blood, focusing mainly on tumor cell surface proteins and transcription factors. The presence of EMT and stemness-related markers on CTCs can vary depending on their initiation state and trajectory.

Markers associated with EMT are frequently employed for the isolation and enrichment of CTCs. A key marker is EpCAM, an epithelial transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on tumor cell surfaces, distinguishing tumor cells from normal epithelial cells in the bloodstream. The CellSearch platform, the first FDA-approved CTC isolation platform, focuses on EpCAM and another prevalent epithelial marker, cytokeratins (CKs). Research has shown that, besides EMT, the expression of EpCAM can also be influenced by TNF-α and NF-κB [67]. Additionally, E-cadherins and zonula occludens (ZOs) are crucial for maintaining epithelial tissue integrity [68].

CTCs undergoing EMT can be categorized as mesenchymal or mixed epithelial-mesenchymal CTCs, depending on whether they express mesenchymal markers alongside epithelial markers. Common mesenchymal markers include Vimentin, N-Cadherin and Fibronectin [69–71]. However, Vimentin is also found in certain normal blood cells, making it crucial to use additional indicators to identify mesenchymal CTCs accurately. Evidence shows that URI and miR-515-3p play regulatory roles in metastasis driven by vimentin in cervical and esophageal cancers, respectively [72,73]. Various transcription factors, such as TWIST, are crucial for initiating EMT [74]. Compared to cell surface protein markers, SNAI1 and ZEB are part of a more intricate regulatory network, influenced by miR-34 (SNAIL) and miR-200 (ZEB) families [75–77]. Increased MMP9 due to SNAIL upregulation elucidates the enhanced invasiveness and metastatic potential of EMT-driven CTCs. The involvement of the PI3K/AKT pathway in cancer is well-documented, with a recent study showing it functions as an EMT inducer in colorectal cancer [78]. Additionally, Plastin3 has been identified as both an EMT marker and a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer patients, based on research involving 132 Japanese patients [79].

The persistence of CTCs in the circulatory system may be linked to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Research has shown that CSCs, originating from somatic stem cells or differentiated progenitor cells, can drive cancer recurrence and metastasis [80]. Therefore, identifying and targeting CSCs within CTCs could be a promising strategy to impede cancer progression. Currently, several markers such as CD44, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), and gangliosides have been identified for this purpose [81,82]. For example, Tian et al. discovered that ALDH1-positive cells effectively represent ALDH1+CTCs in the peripheral blood of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, suggesting that ALDH1 could serve as a marker for CSCs and aid in the depletion of circulating NSCLC cells [82]. The identification of such specific markers for CTCs remains a crucial objective in CTC research, as detailed in Table1. Additionally, other specific markers exit in unique tumor types beyond those mentioned above, such as melanin in melanoma, which has been utilized to detect CTCs in melanoma patients [83]. In summary, pinpointing highly specific markers for CTCs is essential for advancing our understanding of their roles in cancer initiation and progression, thereby laying the groundwork for more precise CTC research.

Currently, methods for isolating CTCs from peripheral blood primarily fall into three categories: direct separation methods based on cellular physical characteristics, immunomagnetic bead approaches that leverage biochemical characteristics and microfluidic chip technology (Fig.2).

Physical isolation methods exploit the differences in cell size, density, dielectric properties, or acoustic characteristics between CTCs and other blood cells. However, a limitation of these methods is their low specificity, which can hinder the isolation of pure CTCs.

The immunomagnetic bead technique employs tumor surface antigens to selectively bind to monoclonal antibodies conjugated with magnetic beads for CTC isolation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, cells coated with these magnetic beads are captured or directed to a designated region for isolation. This method allows for positive and negative sorting of CTCs and white blood cells (WBCs), separately. Epithelial markers, such as EpCAM and CK, are often used to distinguish CTCs from other blood cells. The CellSearch platform developed by Veridex utilizes nanoscale magnetic beads to enhance CTC capture efficiency while minimizing mechanical strain. However, this method may overlook CTCs that have undergone EMT, as these cells typically express lower levels of EpCAM [118,119]. Negative sorting employs antibodies such as CD45 or CD41 to identify and eliminate non-tumor cells, particularly WBCs, thereby enriching the CTC population and addressing challenges related to negative EpCAM expression [120].

Microfluidics involves the precise control of fluids at the micro-scale, focusing on fluid management within micro-nano spaces, with the microfluidic chip as its core component. Recently, professor Lei and his team developed an innovative separation method called integrated ferrohydrodynamic cell separation (iFCS), which uses surface markers on leukocytes (CD45, CD15, CD66b) to selectively bind magnetic beads to WBCs, leaving CTCs unlabeled. The iFCS process consists of three stages: the first stage removes debris larger than 50 μm; the second stage enriches CTCs while removing the magnetic bead-WBC complexes; and the third stage adsorbs additional magnetic beads and WBCs, facilitating the movement of CTCs to the sides of the channel for recovery. This method does not depend on specific antigens on tumor cells and effectively isolates CTCs with minimal leukocyte contamination, achieving a separation efficiency of up to 99%. Captured CTCs with epithelial and/or mesenchymal features maintain their integrity and can survive and proliferate for a short period. Recently, microfluidics technologies, such as acoustic microfluidics that rely solely on physical properties, have emerged as efficient methods for isolating CTCs [121]. Other methodologies such as metabolism labeling and click chemistry, are emerging as effective and non-destructive approaches for capturing CTCs [122]. As innovative isolation technologies continue to emerge and advance, the enrichment of CTCs will provide a solid foundation for further research in the CTC field.

Flow cytometry (FCM): Provides rapid, quantitative analysis and multi-channel detection. However, creating single-cell suspensions may affect cell integrity and morphology.

Immunofluorescence (IF): Uses fluorescence microscopy to visualize tumor markers like CK or EpCAM. It’s susceptible to observer bias and false negatives from CTCs with an EMT phenotype.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH): Detects specific gene sequences using fluorescent probes. It can be costly and complex but can be combined with IF for improved detection, as demonstrated by combining DAPI+and CD45+staining with a CEP8 probe, and utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analysis [123].

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR): Amplifies tumor-specific mRNA sequences to profile gene expression, allowing for precise tumor cell detection [124].

Electrochemical sensors: Identifies CTCs and quantifies tumor markers using enzymes, antibodies, or aptamers. This method is rapid, cost-effective, and easily automated, with examples including MUC1/EpCAM aptamers for detecting various cancer-derived CTCs [125]. Compared with the above methods, this method is easy to operate, more rapid, lower cost, and easier to automate.

Photoacoustic flow cytometry: Detects melanin-bearing CTCs in vivo in melanoma patients using a high pulse rate laser and focused ultrasound transducers [83]. It’s label free, enabling real-time CTC counting and long-term monitoring. However, its application is limited to melanoma detection, and other tumor types require the integration of additional physical or chemical characteristics for detection by this system.

Each method offers unique advantages and limitations, making the choice of technique dependent on specific research or clinical needs.

Currently, most research on CTCs focuses on quantifying their numbers to facilitate cancer diagnosis, adjuvant therapy, and prognosis prediction. However, existing capture and detection methods often fail to distinguish between viable and non-viable tumor cells. Therefore, relying solely on CTC counts for clinical decision-making is suboptimal. Besides enumeration, gene expression profile analysis of CTCs can reveal cellular changes during tumor development and provide insights into various phenotypes. While the scarcity of CTCs limits the number of available research samples, potentially hindering significant studies, the potential for in vitro cultivation of CTCs offers a promising solution. Although the literature is still limited, valuable insights can be gained from the existing resources.

The cultivation of CTCs in vitro encounters two primary challenges. The first is obtaining viable CTCs, which depends on efficient enrichment methods for isolating live CTCs from cancer patients. Techniques such as microfluidic chips, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and negative enrichment have been shown to improve the preservation of cellular integrity and molecular characteristics. The second challenge is creating an optimal culture environment that supports CTC expansion in vitro. This involves carefully managing various physical, chemical, and biological conditions (Table2).

Research has increasingly highlighted the importance of non-adherent culture conditions and low oxygen environments for successful in vitro cultivation of CTCs [126]. For instance, Yu et al.. established CTC lines from six patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer using these conditions [127]. Additionally, three-dimension (3D) organoids have been developed to provide physical support that could enhance the proliferation and stemness of CTCs [128,129]. These 3D structures often incorporate synthetic hydrogels, matrigel, or natural extracellular matrix (ECM) materials such as collagen [130]. While synthetic hydrogels only offer basic physical support, matrigel and ECM provide enriched growth factors that promote CTC proliferation. However, the impact of different components and stiffness levels of 3D organoids on CTC organogenesis remains an unresolved issue.

Several chemical factors are crucial for the rapid expansion of CTCs in vitro, and their roles can be broadly categorized into four aspects: awakening, proliferation, stemness, and oxidative balance. Firstly, CTCs often remain in a dormant state to evade circulation stress in the blood. Awakening these dormant CTCs is essential for their expansion. Typically, a low ERK and high p38 MAPK signaling coupling inhibits proliferation in dormant CTCs. Using a p38 inhibitor like SB202190 can disrupt this coupling, thereby promoting CTC awakening [131]. Secondly, growth factors are required to facilitate the proliferation of CTCs via G protein-coupled receptor signals. A recent work has revealed that long-term CTC-derived organoids can be established from mBC patients through the supplement of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and/or FGF, which activates NRG1-HER3 and FGFR1 signaling to promote CTC survival and growth [132]. Importantly, the stemness properties of CTCs can be maintained with stem-cell factors such as WNT3a [133]. Moreover, antioxidants such as N-Acetylcysteine are used to prevent CTCs from oxidative stress [134]. However, it remains unclear whether other factors, beyond the aforementioned mechanisms, contribute to the successful expansion of CTCs. Moreover, the extent to which different combinations of these factors promote the expansion of CTCs from various cancer patients or multiple samples of a single patient is still unknown.

One of the most successful applications of biological conditions is conditional reprogramming (CR), which involves co-culturing primary cells with irradiated mouse 3T3-J2 fibroblasts in the presence of RHO-related protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 [135]. The 3T3-J2 cells provide a supportive growth niche and a cocktail of factors for primary cells, enabling them to acquire stem-like characteristics and enhance their proliferation ability. CR has proven highly effective for the expansion of primary cancer cells and is now used in various oncology areas including the establishment of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models, drug susceptibility testing, and precision medicine. Despite its success with primary tumor cells, the CR method has seen limited success in expanding CTCs, and the reasons for this remain unclear. One potential avenue for improvement is the inclusion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [136]. Research indicates that CAFs can significantly impact CTC proliferation, especially in 3D culture environments [137]. Additionally, LWRN cells may promote gastrointestinal CTC expansion because of their secretion of stem-cell factors [138]. Although the presence of these feeder cells may hinder the observation of CTCs, these specialized biological settings are crucial for facilitating the proliferation and survival of CTCs.

Although the cultivation of CTCs in vitro can serve as a platform for screening metastatic intervention drugs and promoting CTC phenotypic analysis, it poses a significant challenge, as highlighted by the low efficiency of in vitro CTC culture (Table3). In conclusion, CTCs from advanced patients or those who progress rapidly on treatment with a high CTC count are more likely to culture in vitro successfully. Negative selection such as CD45 deletion can enrich heterogeneous CTCs for cultivation and seems to be the most feasible isolation method currently. Although suspension and organoid cultivation methods have shown promising paradigms in CTC cultivation, future research should focus on developing more efficient CTC expansion methods. Following this, establishing an effective in vitro screening platform for metastasis intervention drugs will be crucial for improving metastasis prevention strategies.

The identification of CTCs as potential indicators throughout the entire metastatic cascade has garnered significant interest in clinical translational research (Fig.3A).

Several studies have suggested the occurrence of metastatic transmission of CTCs during the initial phases of cancer progression. Barriere and colleagues successfully detected CTCs in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with two types of early breast cancer, specifically those with stage T1 and axillary lymph node-negative disease [169]. Some researchers suggest that CTCs could indicate potential cancer progression before primary tumors are detectable through imaging [170]. By leveraging the biological characteristics of CTCs, clinicians can improve early cancer diagnosis and prevention. For example, detecting biomarkers such as MART1, gp100, and S100β in blood samples from patients with uveal melanoma could aid in the early identification of cancer risk [171]. However, the use of CTCs for early diagnosis remains limited due to their scarcity and the low sensitivity of current detection methods.

The primary goal of CTC biology is to provide prognostic insights in cancer [172]. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that CTCs can effectively predict the prognosis of patients with metastatic cancers, particularly in mBC, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), as detected by the CellSearch system [173–175]. For example, in mBC, foundational studies dating back to 2004 assessed the relationship between CTC count and OS using data from 177 mBC patients [176]. The study compared two groups based on base line CTC count (≥ 5/7.5 mL whole blood vs. < 5/7.5 mL whole blood), revealing that pretreatment CTC count is a reliable and independent predictor of PFS (2.7 months vs. 7.0 months;P< 0.001) and OS (8.2 months vs. >18 months;P< 0.001) in patients with mBC. Subsequently, researchers focused on using CTC count to monitor survival variations across different therapies. These studies showed that persistent high or elevated CTC count during treatment are indicative of a worse prognosis for mBC patients [177,178]. Similarly, CTC enumeration has proven to be a valuable, non-invasive tool for predicting recurrence and metastasis in NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and gastric cancer [179–182].

A series of studies have focused on whether CTC count can inform treatment choices and improve patient outcomes. In a STIC CTC randomized phase 3 trial, researchers compared the efficacy of clinician-driven versus CTC-driven first-line therapy choices (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT01710605). In this study, 755 patients with hormone receptor-positive, ERBB2-negative mBC were randomized into two groups, patients received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy based on CTC count (chemotherapy if CTC count ≥ 5/7.5 mL whole blood; endocrine therapy if CTC count < 5/7.5 mL whole blood). The result showed the median PFS was 15.5 months (95% CI, 12.7–17.3) in the CTC arm and 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.2–16.3) in the standard arm, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.94 (90% CI, 0.81–1.09) [183]. Additionally, after a median follow-up of 4.7 years, the OS was reported as 51.3 months (95% CI, 46.8 to 55.1) and 45.5 months (95% CI, 40.9 to 51.1) in the two arms (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.03;P= 0.11) [184]. These findings suggest that CTC count has clinical potential as a reliable biomarker to guide therapy decision making. However, some studies have shown that CTC count failed to guide clinical chemotherapy in mBC [173,185]. A well-known negative study comes from the SWOG S0500 clinical trial, conducted by Hayes and his team. In this study, mBC patients with persistent CTCs ≥ 5/7.5 mL whole blood before receiving first-line chemotherapy and after 21 days of first-line chemotherapy were randomized into switch therapy and maintain therapy groups. The switch therapy group experienced early switching to an alternate cytotoxic treatment. However, the switch therapy group did not show a significant improvement in OS compared to the maintain therapy group (10.7 vs. 12.5 months, respectively;P= 0.98) [173]. The negative results may be due to the low sensitivity of CTC detection by the CellSearch system and the insufficient duration of the intervention. In addition to CTC count guiding therapy decisions, the integration of CTC biomarkers is a promising direction for targeted therapy decision making. For example, Scher and his colleagues conducted a clinical trial to determine whether the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) positive CTC test for patients with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer could improve therapy decision making at second line or later therapies [116]. The results showed that patients with detectable AR-V7+CTCs had superior survival when treated with taxanes compared to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors.

A recent study that enrolled data from 4,436 mBC patients, with CTC results from both baseline and one follow-up, demonstrated that follow-up CTC enumeration is a strong predictor of OS independent of tumor subtype and treatment [186]. This suggests that CTC monitoring could serve as an early response marker in mBC, highlighting the importance of CTC monitoring in patient follow-up.

It is worth noting that most clinical trials relating to CTC count or biomarkers rely on the FDA-approved CellSearch system. However, CTC detection technologies have evolved from single-parameter enumeration to multimodal integration. Advances in technical frontiers, such as microfluidics and metabolic labeling, are improving non-structive capture and singe-cell analysis, addressing the challenges of heterogeneity [122,187]. Furthermore, the integration of CTC molecular profiling enables the prediction of responses to targeted therapies, though larger-scale clinical trials are required to validate these findings [188]. As multicenter trials rigorously compare platform performance, CTCs, as a crucial tool in liquid biopsy, have the potential to cover the full spectrum from early diagnosis and prognosis to therapy decision making, real-time therapeutic efficacy monitoring and patient follow-up.

Once CTCs are effectively cultured and propagated in vitro, extensive molecular and functional investigations can be carried out (Fig.3B-3F). These CTCs can be utilized for drug susceptibility testing (DST) and screening potentially efficient drugs for cancer patients with metastasis, as well as for monitoring drug responses in vitro [127,189]. In the first reported ex vivo expansion of CTCs, Yu et al.., employed breast cancer CTC lines to identify changing patterns of drug susceptibility. Genome sequencing of these CTCs unveiled the presence ofPIK3CAand newly acquired mutations inESR1andFGFR2. Notably, combinatorial drug targeting of mutantESR1andPIK3CAsuggested potential new therapeutic avenues using these CTC lines [73]. Another group focused on CTC lines derived from circulating colorectal cancer cells to monitor therapy-driven tumor changes. Nine CTC lines were isolated from a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer, with blood samples collected before and after multi-therapy, as well as during cancer progression. These cell lines showed changes in mRNA and protein expression (e.g., DEFA6, ABCB1 and GAL), indicating that phenotypic characteristics were selected over time [158]. Furthermore, the researchers compared the gene expression profiles of these CTC lines and revealed that some upregulated genes were involved in mTOR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. High expression of cytidine deaminase was associated with resistance to 5-fluorouracil-based treatments, while dysregulation of xenobiotic and energy metabolism pathways was also observed following selective treatment pressure [190].

Long-term maintenance of CTC line expansion in vitro is often time-consuming and inefficient, limiting the ability to evaluate drug response for cancer patients. To address this issue, Lim et al.. developed a microfluidics-based culture approach that facilitates the co-culture of immune cells and CTCs from the same patient blood sample within specially designed microwells. This innovative method enables CTC cluster formation within 2 weeks, achieving an efficiency of approximately 50% [191]. In their study, drug screening was facilitated through the incorporation of a gradient generator, allowing for parallel exposure to two or more drugs at various concentrations. A total of 24 breast cancer samples were used for this drug evaluation, and the potential for cluster formation was found to correlate inversely with increased drug concentration [192]. The rapid evaluation may help clinicians better assess drug responses in patients, ultimately enabling personalized therapy.

Recent improvements in multiomics technologies at single-cell resolution have allowed extensive exploration of CTC biology and its molecular profiles. Multiomics analysis can be integrated across various levels including genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic features, enabling researchers to construct a complete revolution trajectory of tumor cells from primary to metastatic sites [193,194]. For example, Ebright et al.. conducted an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR activation screen in breast cancer CTCs to identify genes that promote distant metastasis in mice [195]. This identified the enrichment of ribosomal proteins and their regulators of translation. Among them,RPL15, which encodes a component of large ribosomal subunits, was correlated with increased metastatic growth in multiple organs. It’s expression also enhanced the translation of other ribosomal proteins and cell cycle regulators. Notably, in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 studies of CTCs can provide a valuable tool to examine spontaneous cancer metastasis, and reveal specific factors in promoting each step of the metastatic process.

Additionally, exploring the epigenetic landscape of CTCs has been increasingly studied, particularly DNA methylation. A comparative analysis of the methylome of breast cancer CTCs revealed that CTC clusters exhibited a hypomethylation pattern in DNA binding sites for stemness- and proliferation- associated transcription factors (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and SIN3A). And CTC cluster hypomethylated regions at the primary tumor levels in breast cancers were associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its prognostic value [196]. More recently, Guo et al.. conducted high-resolution genome-wide single-cell DNA methylation sequencing to identify the correlation of hypomethylation and tumorigenesis. In the CTCs from the earliest detectable stages of prostate malignancy, transcriptionally silenced genes within the core hypomethylated domains were enriched for immune-related genes, particularly CD1 and IFI16. The re-expression of CD1 or IFI16 murine orthologs in immuno-competent mice abrogated tumorigenesis, which was consistent with the activation of anti-tumor immunity [197]. Thus, the comprehensive analysis of the CTC methylome has revealed the active expression of genes associated with proliferation and stemness, and silenced expression of anti-tumor immune genes. Further investigation of histone marks or transcription factor binding through omics techniques will provide more information on CTC regulation.

Cultivation of CTCs in vitro imposes a strong selection pressure on CTCs, potentially leading to genomic variations. Research using gene expression profiling has revealed that short-term in vitro culture facilitates the differentiation process of CTCs growing on a membrane, indicating that their genomes have adapted to this process [198]. In a study analyzing CNA inferring in 1,110 PDX samples across multiple cancer types, nearly 60% of samples acquired at least one large chromosomal abnormality within a single passage, and this increased to 90% after the first four passages [199]. Despite these findings, there have been no systematic evaluations of the consistency of the genetic background in CTCs.

To ensure that in vitro drug susceptibility testing of CTCs reliably reflects patient responses to multiple treatment courses, it is crucial to assess the genetic consistency of CTCs passaged in vitro over time. High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, exome sequencing, and scRNA sequencing can be employed to provide a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape. This will enable researchers to conduct longitudinal studies to examine how genetic backgrounds evolve and their implications for treatment, ultimately leading to better-targeted therapies and improved patient outcomes.

Clonal evolution is a fundamental biological phenomenon. Alix-Panabières and colleagues established nine permanent colon CTC lines from peripheral blood samples of a single patient with metastatic colon cancer [190]. These CTCs were collected before treatment initiation, after the first- and second-line treatments, and one week before the patient’s death, providing valuable insights into the trajectory of clonal evolution during treatment and cancer progression. To compare the gene expression profiles of these CTC lines, they identified the mTOR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, cytidine deaminase metabolism, and stem cell properties, all of which were associated with drug resistance and clonal evolution of CTCs. Additionally, they recently conducted proteomic profiling and functional analysis of extracellular vesicles derived from these CTCs [200]. This analysis revealed that integrin family proteins were significantly enriched in extracellular vesicles from CTC lines derived after therapy failure. These studies further underscore that in vitro-expanded CTCs are an ideal tool for studying clonal evolution and other biological changes related to therapy.

CTCs can be utilized to establish CTC-derived xenograft models (CDXs), which effectively recapitulate the genetic and morphological characteristics of the tumors from donor patients, as well as their responses to various drugs. For example, Drapkin et al.. generated PDXs using biopsies and CTCs from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. CTCs were enriched using CTC-iChipnegdevice and subsequently injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NSG mice. The mice were monitored for tumorigenesis, and then tumor cells were serially passaged, resulting in the generation of 17 CDXs with 38% efficiency. In conjunction with biopsy-derived xenografts, a total of 30 PDX models underwent in vivo treatment with etoposide and platinum (EP). The results demonstrated greater sensitivity in PDXs from EP-naïve patients, while resistance to EP was associated with an upregulatedMYCgene signature. Notably, serial CDXs obtained from an individual patient at different time points accurately reflected the evolving drug susceptibilities of that patient’s disease [201]. Later, Stewart et al.. employed SCLC-CDXs to investigate intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) through single-cell RNA sequencing of both chemo-sensitive and -resistant CDXs, as well as patient-derived CTCs. Their findings indicated that platinum-resistant CDXs exhibited increased ITH, characterized by heterogeneous expression of therapeutic targets and EMT-related genes [202]. Additionally, researchers used the BR16 breast cancer CTC line to conduct an in vivo loss-of-function genome-wide CRISPR screen in BR16 CDXs. In this study, BR16-Cas9-GFP cells were transduced with genome-wide sgRNA library and injected in the mammary fat pad of NSG mice. After 5–7 months, primary tumors, single CTCs, CTC clusters, and organs with metastasis were isolated and subjected to next-generation sequencing for sgRNA readout. This revealed that the deletion ofIL18R1,ITGA2,CSNK1A1L, andCSNK2A2led to decreased CTC cluster formation and reduced metastatic burden in vivo. Furthermore, PLK1 was found to be essential for the intravasation of both single CTCs and CTC clusters, suggesting that it’s inhibitors could efficiently prevent CTC intravasation [203].

The low efficiency in generating CDXs, whether through the direct injection of freshly isolated CTCs or in vitro CTC expansion, presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue will require further technical advancements in isolating viable CTCs and improving the efficiency of CTC expansion. Another limitation of CDXs is the scarcity of archival tissue samples, which hinders comparisons of ITH between patient tumor biopsies, CDXs and CTCs. As CDX libraries and banking of patient samples continue to expand, researchers will be better positioned to investigate how ITH is influenced by specific transcriptional subtypes. Additionally, longitudinal samples from individual patients both pre- and post-treatment may provide valuable insights into tumor evolution that underlies shifts in treatment sensitivity.

Shedding of tumor cells from the primary site is a common event, yet only a small fraction of CTCs successfully complete metastasis due to various unfavorable conditions in the blood environment [204,205]. The immune system plays a pivotal role in monitoring and eliminating CTCs. Research on how CTCs evade immune detection has become a significant focus. We explore recent findings on the mechanisms and pathways of immune evasion employed by CTCs. Specifically, we investigate the roles of immune dampening, antigen deficiency, and camouflage (Fig.4).

Immune checkpoints are widely recognized as crucial mechanisms facilitating immune evasion by tumor cells. Key immune checkpoints such as PD-L1/PD-1 and CD47/SIRPα are known to interact between CTCs and CTLs or macrophages [206]. Recently, the discovery of a novel immune checkpoint, HLA-E: CD94/NKG2A, has generated significant interest. This study reveals a significant enhancement in the inhibition of tumor metastasis in vivo and the killing of CTCs in vitro when NKG2A is blocked or HLA-E on CTCs is knocked down, leading to increased activity of NK cells. This research ultimately establishes HLA-E: CD94/NKG2A as a functional immune checkpoint between CTCs and NK cells. Furthermore, it was found that the protective impact of this immune checkpoint against CTCs is associated with the AKT-GSK3β-CREB signaling pathway, which involves regulation from platelet-derived RGS18 [193]. A recent study also reported that CTCs evade NK cell killing via immune checkpoint CD155-TIGIT [207]. These promising findings underscore the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors as a powerful strategy for cancer treatment.

CTCs interact extensively with various blood cells, including platelets, MSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and neutrophils [2,208]. Their interactions usually escort CTCs to evade immune surveillance. For instance, CTCs interact with MSCs through cGAMP delivery in a gap junction-dependent manner. The cGAMP-STING signaling activation leads to increased production of IFNβ by MSCs. IFNβ in turn enhances IFN-I signaling in CTCs and promotes the expression of HLA-I, thereby protecting CTCs from NK cell killing [209]. Similarly, platelets aid CTC evasion by directly adhering to CTCs, activating the FAK/JNK/c-Jun cascade to upregulate the inhibitory checkpoint CD155 [207]. Further investigation into these CTC-blood cell clusters could facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Cytokine secretion or immunosuppressive cell recruitment by CTCs plays a crucial role in the immune evasion of CTCs. Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β, PGE2, secreted by CTCs or platelets can directly inhibit immune surveillance functions of CTLs, NK cells, and macrophages [2,208]. For example, TGF-β from platelets down-regulates the expression of immune receptor NKG2D on NK cells, reducing their anti-tumor reactivity. In addition, CTCs secret CCL5 to recruit Tregs, facilitating their immune escape through the release of various immunosuppressive cytokines, including TGF-β and IL-10 [210,211]. Tregs also express surface proteins such as CTLA-4, which binds to CD80/CD86 on dendritic cells, inhibiting T cell activation [212]. Furthermore, the expression of CD25 (IL2Rα) allows Tregs to compete with effector T cells for IL-2, thereby inhibiting CD8+T lymphocyte proliferation [213]. Additionally, granzyme B and perforin released by Treg cells further suppress the activity of NK and CTL cells, exacerbating tumor-induced immunosuppression [214].

The FAS/FASL apoptotic pathway plays a significant role in helping CTCs evade immune surveillance. The loss or downregulation of FAS on CTCs reduces their susceptibility to apoptosis. Conversely, CTCs expressing FASL can induce apoptosis in T cells through their FAS receptors [208,215]. Though the precise extent to which FAS and FASL surface expression contributes to T cell apoptosis remains elusive, there’s no doubt that FASL/FAS-mediated apoptosis of T cells is a key mechanism of immune evasion for CTCs.

Abnormal antigen presentation has been shown to protect CTCs from recognition by CTLs and NK cells. Platelets can transfer their MHC-Ⅰ molecules to the surface of CTCs, thereby preventing recognition by NK and T cells [216]. Additionally, CTCs may downregulate or completely lose MHC-I expression, further interfering with TCR recognition of MHC-I molecules [208]. Furthermore, the surface expression of cytokeratin 8 in cancer cells can restrict the interaction between MHC-I and TCR on CTLs [217]. These mechanisms collectively enable CTCs to evade MHC-I-mediated recognition by both NK and T cells.

CTCs fused with macrophage or shielded by platelets/CD45, can camouflage themselves to evade immune surveillance. CTC-macrophage hybrid cells have been linked to increased tumor metastasis and poorer overall survival in several cancers [218,219]. A study detects uveal melanoma disseminated hybrid cells and verifies they highly express CD74, which may contribute to immune evasion [220]. Understanding the fusion mechanism between CTCs and macrophages, as well as its role in immune evasion, is of great significance for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Recent studies have highlighted how platelets facilitate CTC immune evasion, with barrier protection emerging as a key mechanism [221,222]. Platelets aggregate to form a protective shield around CTCs to defend them against NK cell killing [223]. Several studies have reported the presence of CD45+CTCs in patients with various types of tumors, but their origin and biological characteristics remains unclear [224–226]. Our recent research indicates that CTCs shielded with extracellular vesicle-derived CD45 can escape T cell killing via attenuating TCR signaling, indicating that this pseudo-immune-like identity may further enable CTCs to evade immune surveillance [227].

CTCs exhibit extensive phenotypic and molecular heterogeneities that enable their survival in circulation and resistance to chemotherapy. Factors such as drug selection, circadian rhythm regulation and circulation pressure significantly contribute to the specific drug resistance observed in CTCs (Fig.5).

Cytotoxic chemotherapy can induce reversible changes in the molecular phenotype of CTCs. In HER2-negative breast cancer patients, CTCs may develop a HER2+subpopulation after multiple courses of therapy. Both HER2+and HER2−CTCs demonstrate comparable tumor-initiating potential, but HER2+CTCs exhibit stronger proliferation capability. Additionally, oxidative stress or cytotoxic chemotherapy can promote the transition from HER2+CTCs to HER2−CTCs [228]. This suggests the interconverting phenotypes within CTCs contribute to cancer progression and drug resistance. In prostate cancer, resistant CTCs in patients treated with androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors show notable expression of non-classical WNT signaling, particularly WNT5A, which enhances the survival of LNCaP cells after treatment [229].

CTC release is influenced by circadian rhythm. Diamantopoulouthat et al.. reported that most spontaneous CTC intravasation events occur during sleep, termed “rest-phase CTCs”. These rest-phase CTCs are particularly prone to metastasis [230]. Consequently, administering drugs at varied times may result in inefficient plasma drug concentrations when the number of metastasis-prone CTCs is at its peak. This temporal mismatch can allow rest-phase CTCs to evade cytotoxic chemotherapy, facilitating their spread to distant organs. This highlights the importance of considering circadian rhythms in the timing of therapeutic interventions for improved treatment efficacy.

Circulation pressures, such as shear stress, anoikis, oxidative stress and immune surveillance, play crucial roles in the evolution of CTCs. These pressures finally enhance CTCs surviving and resisting to chemotherapy. Notably, CTCs harboring intracellular bacteria show enhanced resistance to fluid shear stress by reorganizing actin cytoskeleton [231]. This adaptation underscores the complex interplay between external pressures and CTC resilience.

During cancer metastasis, various CTCs undergo EMT, seen in breast, non-small cell lung, colorectal, prostate, and pancreatic cancers [225,232]. CTCs with mesenchymal or epithelial-mesenchymal mixed phenotypes exhibit enhanced migration and invasion abilities, but also display reduced sensitively to chemotherapy and immunotherapy [233]. Recent research has demonstrated that FGL1, a ligand for the tumor immune checkpoint LAG-3, exhibits significant expression in CTCs with a mixed epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype. Elevated FGL1 expression in these cells is more prone to immunotherapy resistance, thus following increased distal metastasis and unfavorable prognosis. While the precise association between FGL1 expression and EMT is still being explored, this suggests that the resistance mechanism of CTCs to immunotherapy is closely linked to the EMT process [234]. It is worth mentioning that dynamic changes in the epithelial and mesenchymal composition of CTCs accompany therapy resistance and disease progression [14].

The dormant state of CTCs significantly contributes to the development of drug resistance. Most CTCs enter a dormant state to evade various challenges within the circulatory system. Research has demonstrated that the endosseous microenvironment offers direct attachment and protection for CTCs, allowing them to colonize the bone marrow during the metastatic process or even earlier, where they can remain dormant for extended periods [235]. Chemotherapy drugs primarily target rapidly proliferating tumor cells, making dormant CTCs highly resistant to their effects. In patients with SCLC under chemotherapy, have been observed that their CTC spheroids exist in a hypoxic and nearly quiescent state. Additionally, the limited penetration of drugs into these spheroids further aids their evasion from therapy, offering a plausible explanation for the widespread occurrence of drug resistance in advanced SCLC [236].

CTC clusters have been linked to increased stemness, drug resistance and metastatic potential [237,238]. Gkountela et al. reported that specific binding sites for transcription factors in CTC clusters, including OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and SIN3A, which are correlated to stemness and proliferation, are hypomethylated in CTC clusters [196]. In addition, chemotherapy-evasive CTC clusters tend to be relatively quiescent with glycoprotein hyposialylation [239]. Certain membrane and adhesive proteins, such as CD44, Plakoglobin, Fibronectin, ICAM1, DSC2, and PKP1, promote the formation of CTC clusters [104,113,141,237,240]. CTCs can also be protected by other circulating cells. For instance, platelets can induce resistance to anoikis by promoting RhoA-MYPT1-PP1-mediated YAP1 nuclear translocation, leading to a pro-survival gene expression signature [241]. Furthermore, the adipogenesis regulatory factor SREBP2 can directly induce the transcription of iron carrier transferrin (TF), thereby reducing intracellular iron pool, reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation. These effects promote CTC resistance to ferroptosis [161]. Finally, various immune evasion mechanisms discussed earlier also play a significant role in the drug resistance of CTCs.

In conclusion, the unique microenvironment and distinct states of CTCs, differed from primary tumors, play a crucial role in promoting their drug resistance.

The presence of CTCs in the blood is a dynamic process, with their dissemination occurring early and continuing throughout the entire metastatic cascade [242]. Conversely, CTCs may originate from specific subpopulations within tumors and evolve in the bone marrow, making current strategies for eliminating primary tumors limited in their ability to eradicate CTCs to prevent metastatic disease. Although there is currently no specific targeted therapy for CTCs, targeting these cells from multiple perspectives within the metastatic cascade holds promise for effectively disrupting metastatic progression (Fig.6).

Significant progress has been made toward developing pharmacological interventions to inhibit EMT/stemness signaling pathways such as the inhibition of TGF-β, NOTCH, WNT/β-catenin, and YAP/TEAD signaling pathways (Table4). However, these efforts are still in the clinical trial phase. It’s worth mentioning that bispecific antibodies such as SHR-1701, which target PD-L1/TGF-βRII protein, have shown promising clinical trial results in unresectable stage III NSCLC and recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients [243,244]. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the bispecific antibodies to treat multiple advanced tumors [245]. Recently, a netrin-1-blocking monoclonal antibody, NP137, demonstrated significant efficacy in clinical trials for human cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT02977195) by effectively inhibiting EMT in skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and reducing metastasis [246]. This inspiring result indicates the feasibility of targeting EMT to prevent metastasis. However, it is important to recognize that CTCs have different states including epithelial, mesenchymal and epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid states. Therefore, when considering targeting EMT, it’s necessary to understand the roles and the mechanisms by which EMT regulates the biological phenotypes of CTCs.

When considering targeting dormant CTCs/DTCs, three strategies can be summarized as a priori concept: (i) Awakening strategy followed by anti-proliferative therapy; (ii) Sleeping strategy to maintain CTCs/DTCs in a dormant state; and (iii) Killing strategy to directly eradicate CTCs/DTCs [247]. The awakening strategy involves inhibiting the p38, TGF-β, STING, and WNT signaling pathways. It’s important to note that the awakening of CTCs/DTCs should be followed by the administration of highly effective anti-proliferative agents to eradicate them, to prevent reactivated cells from becoming more aggressive and worsening the patient’s prognosis. This concern is underscored by the observation that inhibition of the TGFβ-p38 signaling pathway can reactivate dormant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lading to their multiorgan metastasis [64]. The sleeping strategy focuses on keeping CTCs/DTCs in a dormant state by inhibiting proliferative signaling (e.g., ERK signaling inhibition), sustaining dormant signaling (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib), or providing components for dormant niches (e.g., GAS6, BMP4, BMP7, TGF-β2) [247,248]. However, this strategy faces challenges due to the risk that dormant cells may eventually proliferate without continuous supplementation of dormancy-agents. The killing strategy aims for a permanent solution; however, existing drugs show limited effectiveness in eradicating dormant tumor cells. Potential methods, such as ferroptosis activation (e.g., GPX4 inhibitors), epigenetic treatments (e.g., HDAC inhibitors), and the synergistic inhibition of dormancy and survival signaling pathways (e.g., the combination of Src and ERK inhibitors), have shown promising efficacy to kill dormant cells [161,247,249,250].

Destruction of CTC clusters could significantly decrease their survival and metastatic potential. Various molecules such as CD44, Plakoglobin, Fibronectin, and ICAM1 have been implicated in the formation of CTC clusters, making them promising targets for intervention [104,113,237,240]. Recently, a single-arm phase I study investigated whether the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor digoxin could disrupt CTC clusters in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03928210) [251]. The results showed that nine patients treated daily with a maintenance digoxin dose (0.7–1.4 ng ml− 1serum level) experienced a reduction in the mean cluster size by -2.2 cells per cluster (P= 0.003). Additionally, transcriptome profiling of CTCs revealed downregulation of cell-cell adhesion and cell-cycle-related genes following treatment with digoxin. These promising findings lay the groundwork for larger follow-up studies involving refined Na+/K+ATPase inhibitors. Additionally, disrupting immune cell and platelet-mediated protection on CTCs may expose more vulnerabilities of CTCs to immune surveillance. For instance, VCAM1 functionally mediates the formation of CTC-neutrophil clusters that enhance the survival of CTCs; thus, inhibiting VCAM1 can prevent these interactions between CTCs and neutrophils [252]. A study examining the effects of aspirin on the number and subtype of CTCs in metastatic breast and colorectal cancer showed positive efficacy in reducing CTC counts (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT02602938) [253]. Further research in this area is advancing efforts to dismantle CTC clusters [254,255]. Additionally, NETs are also a therapeutic target in the treatment of CTC-NET interactions to mitigate metastasis [256]. Furthermore, the formation of these clusters and the processes of intravasation and extravasation are influenced by adhesion molecules such as integrin-β1, P-selectin, and ICAM1 [257–259]. Targeting these adhesion molecules may effectively disrupt these processes [260]. Furthermore, focusing on invadopodia and other molecules regulating intravasation and extravasation could also help decrease metastasis [203,261].

Targeting immune evasion-related molecules is an applicable direction to clear CTCs. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA4, CD47, CD155/TIGIT, and NKG2 can significantly enhance cancer cell killing by immune cells [3,262]. These inhibitors have shown great therapeutic efficacy against both primary and metastatic tumors, with one mechanism potentially involving immune cell-mediated CTC clearance. However, the extent to which immune checkpoint inhibitors contribute to CTC clearance remains unclear. Further research is needed to fully understand their impact on the elimination of CTCs and optimize therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes.

Other strategies for targeting CTCs include interfering with their metabolism vulnerabilities, developing CTC vaccine, and implementing CTC-based chronotherapy, etc [3,4]. Despite these approaches direct exciting explorations for targeting CTCs, most clinical trials to date have primarily focused on the detection, isolation, and expansion of CTCs for research and prognosis monitoring. Hence, the clinical application of targeting CTCs still faces significant challenges and has a long way to go before being fully realized.

It’s indisputable that CTCs play a pivotal role in initiating cancer metastasis. Therefore, enhancing our comprehension of targeting strategies for CTCs is essential to impede cancer progression and its metastatic spread. As previously stated, CTCs can adapt to diverse states for survival during metastasis. In that case, CTCs exhibit distinctive biological characteristics and phenotypes compared to stromal cells. Therefore, it is crucial to further investigate the alternative states of CTCs within the tumor microenvironment and develop or refine approaches for their comprehensive characterization. Clarifying these two aspects will provide a solid foundation for a deeper understanding of CTCs.

Despite the ongoing comprehensive investigation into CTCs, the current landscape remains highly challenging. First, the metastasis of CTCs is an intricate and inefficient process, compounded by a hostile circulatory environment, which leads to their scarcity and hampers research progress. Second, though CTC-related technologies have significantly advanced over the past decade, they still fall short of meeting the scientific community’s aspirations for thorough exploration. Techniques for enriching, capturing, separating, and detecting CTCs often rely on size, density, deformability, and electrical properties, but these conventional methods are insufficient despite their cost-effectiveness. Enrichment approaches based on antigen-antibody interactions, particularly those using EpCAM, are widely used; however, their reliability may be compromised by the considerable heterogeneity of CTC surface antigens. As a result, the CTC research field lacks a universally accepted technological benchmark, and while advanced techniques using nanomaterials and microfluidic chips have emerged, achieving specific detection of CTCs remains a significant challenge. Third, investigations into the genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic characteristics of CTCs face bottlenecks due to these aforementioned limitations. Despite the significant advancements in single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology in recent years, the analysis of the proteome of CTCs remains stagnant. Proteomics can reveal additional biological characteristics and specific membrane proteins, making multi-omics characterization a promising avenue for future research. Finally, the continuous analysis of CTC genomes and phenotypes relies heavily on effective in vitro CTC expansion, which currently suffers from low efficiency and success rates, limiting further drug susceptibility tests and exploration of drug resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, ongoing research provides encouraging prospects for overcoming these challenges, and it is imperative to remain optimistic about CTC research’s potential to identify precise therapeutic targets for reversing or eradicating metastasis-related mortality.
