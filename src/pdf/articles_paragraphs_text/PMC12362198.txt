Gene model for the ortholog of gigas
(gig) in the May 2011 (Agencourt dmoj_caf1/DmojCAF1) Genome Assembly (GenBank Accession: GCA_000005175.1 ) ofDrosophila mojavensis. This ortholog was characterized as part of a developing dataset to study the evolution of the Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) across the genusDrosophilausing the Genomics Education Partnership gene annotation protocol for Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences.

(A) Synteny comparison of the genomic neighborhoods forgiginDrosophila melanogasterandD. mojavensis.Thin underlying arrows indicate the DNA strand within which the target gene–gig–is located inD. melanogaster(top) andD. mojavensis(bottom). The thin arrow pointing to the right indicates thatgigis on the positive (+) strand inD. melanogaster, and the thin arrow pointing to the left indicates thatgigis on the negative (-) strand inD. mojavensis. The wide gene arrows pointing in the same direction asgigare on the same strand relative to the thin underlying arrows, while wide gene arrows pointing in the opposite direction ofgigare on the opposite strand relative to the thin underlying arrows. White gene arrows inD. mojavensisindicate orthology to the corresponding gene inD. melanogaster, while black gene arrows indicate non-orthology. Gene symbols given in theD. mojavensisgene arrows indicate the orthologous gene inD. melanogaster, while the locus identifiers are specific toD. mojavensis.(B) Gene Model in GEP UCSC Track Data Hub (Raney et al., 2014).The coding-regions ofgiginD. mojavensisare displayed in the User Supplied Track (black); coding CDSs are depicted by thick rectangles and introns by thin lines with arrows indicating the direction of transcription. Subsequent evidence tracks include BLAT Alignments of NCBI RefSeq Genes (dark blue, alignment of Ref-Seq genes forD. mojavensis), Spaln ofD. melanogasterProteins (purple, alignment of Ref-Seq proteins fromD. melanogaster), Transcripts and Coding Regions Predicted by TransDecoder (dark green), RNA-Seq from Adult Females and Adult Males (red and light blue, respectively; alignment of Illumina RNA-Seq reads fromD. mojavensis), and Splice Junctions Predicted by regtools usingD. mojavensisRNA-Seq (SRP006203). Splice junctions shown have a read-depth of 100-499 supporting reads in pink.(C) Dot Plot of gig-PA inD. melanogaster(x-axis) vs. the orthologous peptide inD. mojavensis(y-axis).Amino acid number is indicated along the left and bottom; coding-CDS number is indicated along the top and right, and CDSs are also highlighted with alternating colors. InD. mojavensis, the seventh coding CDS inD. melanogasteris split into two, with the location of the split denoted by a blue arrow in the dot plot. Regions which lack sequence similarity are highlighted in green and purple, labeled Box X and Y, respectively.(D) Protein alignment of gig-PA inD. melanogasterand the orthologous peptide inD. mojavensis.The symbols in the match line denote the level of similarity between the aligned residues. An asterisk (*) indicates that the aligned residues are identical. A colon (:) indicates the aligned residues have highly similar chemical properties—roughly equivalent to scoring > 0.5 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix (Gonnet et al., 1992). A period (.) indicates that the aligned residues have weakly similar chemically properties—roughly equivalent to scoring > 0 and ≤ 0.5 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix. A space indicates a gap or mismatch when the aligned residues have a complete lack of similarity—roughly equivalent to scoring ≤ 0 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix. The green and purple box labeled X and Y correspond to small regions of dissimilarity between the protein sequence of gig-PA inD. melanogasterwith that of the putative ortholog.

This article reports a predicted gene model generated by undergraduate work using a structured gene model annotation protocol defined by the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; thegep.org) for Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). The following information in this box may be repeated in other articles submitted by participants using the same GEP CURE protocol for annotating Drosophila species orthologs of Drosophila melanogaster genes in the insulin signaling pathway.

"In this GEP CURE protocol students use web-based tools to manually annotate genes in non-modelDrosophilaspecies based on orthology to genes in the well-annotated model organism fruitflyDrosophila melanogaster. The GEP uses web-based tools to allow undergraduates to participate in course-based research by generating manual annotations of genes in non-model species (Rele et al., 2023). Computational-based gene predictions in any organism are often improved by careful manual annotation and curation, allowing for more accurate analyses of gene and genome evolution (Mudge and Harrow 2016; Tello-Ruiz et al., 2019). These models of orthologous genes across species, such as the one presented here, then provide a reliable basis for further evolutionary genomic analyses when made available to the scientific community.” (Myers et al., 2024).

“The particular gene ortholog described here was characterized as part of a developing dataset to study the evolution of the Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) across the genusDrosophila. The Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) is a highly conserved signaling pathway in animals and is central to mediating organismal responses to nutrients (Hietakangas and Cohen 2009; Grewal 2009).” (Myers et al., 2024).

“D.mojavensis(NCBI:txid7230) is part of themulleri complexin therepletaspecies group within the subgenusDrosophilaof the genusDrosophila(Wasserman 1992; Durando et al., 2000).It was first described by Patterson (Patterson and Crow 1940).D. mojavensisspecializes on rotting cactus as its host and is found in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico including the Baja Peninsula, as well as on the channel-islands off the coast of California (https://www.taxodros.uzh.ch, accessed 1 Feb 2023).” (Congleton et al., 2023).

We propose a gene model for theD. mojavensisortholog of theD. melanogastergigas(gig)
gene. The genomic region of the ortholog corresponds to the uncharacterized proteinLOC6583279(RefSeq accessionXP_002008952.2) in the Dmoj_CAF1 Genome Assembly ofD. mojavensis(GenBank Accession:GCA_000005175.1,Drosophila12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007). This model is based on RNA-Seq data fromD. mojavensis(SRP006203- Chen
et al., 2014)
andgiginD. melanogasterusing FlyBase release FB2022_04 (GCA_000001215.4; Larkin et al.,
2021; Gramates et al., 2022; Jenkins et al., 2022).

Genegig(short for gigas, akaTSC2, CG6975, FBgn0005198) encodes a tumor suppressor protein that controls cell size, cell proliferation, and organ size (Ito and Rubin, 1999). The gig protein contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and forms a complex with protein Tsc1 (Gao et al., 2001; Potter et al., 2001). The gig-Tsc1 protein complex promotes GTP hydrolysis of the small G-protein Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), thereby antagonizing the insulin and TOR signaling pathways (Gao et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003). This gene was originally
identified in humans as TSC2, and mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 result in tuberous sclerosis, a syndrome characterized by widespread benign tumors (European Consortium 1993; van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997).

The referece gene,gig,
occurs on
chromosome 3L inD. melanogasterand nests two genes,obstructor-J(obst-J) andCG7335. gigis flanked upstream byCG14187andCG7365and downstream byCG7328andSnakeskin(Ssk) that is nested byCG42674. Thetblastnsearch ofD. melanogastergig-PA (query) against theD. mojavensis(GenBank Accession:GCA_000005175.1) Genome Assembly (database) placed the putative ortholog ofgigwithin scaffold scaffold_6680 (CH933809.1) at locusLOC6583279(XP_002008952.2)— with an E-value of 0.0 and a percent identity of 57.97%. Furthermore, the putative ortholog nests two genes:LOC6583281(XP_002008954.1) andLOC6583280(XP_002008953.1) (E-value: 5e-58 and 4e-135; identity: 36.19% and 54.57%, respectively) which correspond toobst-JandCG7335inD. melanogaster,as determined byblastp;Figure 1A,Altschul et al., 1990).The putative ortholog is flanked upstream byLOC6583283(XP_002008956.1) andLOC6583282(XP_002008955.1) which correspond toGrip163(Grip163) andendosulfine(endos) inD. melanogaster(E-value: 0.0 and 9e-62; identity: 38.99% and 90.00%, respectively, as determined byblastp). The putative ortholog ofgigis flanked downstream byLOC6583278(XP_002008951.1) andLOC6583276(XP_002008949.1) that is nested byLOC6583274(XP_043865822.1); correspond toCG7328,SskandCG42674inD. melanogaster(E-value: 3e-146, 1e-112 and 0.0; identity: 64.06%, 96.30% and 79.40%, respectively, as determined byblastp). The putative ortholog assignment forgiginD. mojavensisis supported by the following evidence: The genes surrounding thegigortholog are orthologous to the genes at the same locus inD. melanogasterand local synteny is nearly completely conserved, aside from the upstream neighborhood, and is supported by results generated fromblastp, so we conclude thatLOC6583279is the correct ortholog ofgiginD. mojavensis(Figure 1A).

giginD. mojavensishas two unique protein-coding isoforms (gig-PA and gig-PB;Figure 1B). mRNA isoforms (gig-RAandgig-RB) contain fifteen CDSs. Relative to the ortholog inD. melanogaster, the RNA CDS number is not conserved. There appears to be a splitting of the seventh CDS inD. mojavensis(CDS 7_905_0), denoted by a green arrow in the dot plot (Figure 1C), with a new CDS being produced and increasing the number ofgig-RACDSs inD. mojavensisto sixteen. The sequence of
gig-PA
inD. mojavensishas 69.73% identity (E-value: 0.0) with the
protein-coding isoform
gig-PA
inD. melanogaster,
as determined byblastp(Figure 1C). Differences were found in small regions which lack sequence similarity, highlighted by the green and purple boxes (Box X and Y) in bothFigure 1CandFigure 1D,and a difference in length of CDS 12_905_1 inD. mojavensis, compared toD. melanogaster, which may be explained by an indel of 47 amino acids in the protein alignment (Box X,Figure 1D). Coordinates of this curated gene model (gig-PA, gig-PB) are stored by NCBI at GenBank/BankIt (accessionBK064558,BK064559). These data are also archived in the CaltechDATA repository (see “Extended Data” section below).

CDS Split:InD. mojavensis, the seventh CDS ofgiginD. melanogaster(CDS 7_905_0) is split. This produces a new CDS and increases the total number of coding CDSs of thegigortholog inD. mojavensisto sixteen. The location of this split is denoted by a blue arrow in the provided dot plot and protein alignment (Figure 1CandFigure 1D).

Regions of Low Conservation:Several small regions of dissimilarity exist between the sequence of gig-PA inD. melanogasterandD. mojavensis. The most significant regions with low sequence conservation are found in CDS 12_905_1 (CDS eleven inD. melanogasterand CDS twelve inD. mojavensis), highlighted by Box X and Y in green and purple, respectively. Analysis of the protein alignment reveals these regions can be attributed to nonmatching amino acid residues and a longer sequence for this CDS inD. mojavensis(Box X and Y,Figure 1D).

Potential Indel:The difference in length of CDS 12_905_1 inD. melanogasterandD. mojavensismay be explained by an indel of 47 amino acids. Box X in Figures 1C and 1D indicate the region of this split, which is most notable by the shift in the main line of the dot plot.

Detailed methods including algorithms, database versions, and citations for the complete annotation process can be found in Rele et al.
(2023). Briefly, students use the GEP instance of the UCSC Genome Browser v.435 (https://gander.wustl.edu; Kent WJ et al., 2002; Navarro Gonzalez et al., 2021) to examine the genomic neighborhood of their reference IIS gene in theD. melanogastergenome assembly (Aug. 2014; BDGP Release 6 + ISO1 MT/dm6). Students then retrieve the protein sequence for theD. melanogasterreference gene for a given isoform and run it usingtblastnagainst their targetDrosophilaspecies genome assembly on the NCBI BLAST server (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; Altschul et al., 1990) to identify potential orthologs. To validate the potential ortholog, students compare the local genomic neighborhood of their potential ortholog with the genomic neighborhood of their reference gene inD. melanogaster. This local synteny analysis includes at minimum the two upstream and downstream genes relative to their putative ortholog. They also explore other sets of genomic evidence using multiple alignment tracks in the Genome Browser, including BLAT alignments of RefSeq Genes, Spaln alignment ofD. melanogasterproteins, multiple gene prediction tracks (e.g., GeMoMa, Geneid, Augustus), and modENCODE RNA-Seq from the target species. Detailed explanation of how these lines of genomic evidenced are leveraged by students in gene model development are described in Rele et al. (2023). Genomic structure information (e.g., CDSs, intron-exon number and boundaries, number of isoforms) for theD. melanogasterreference gene is retrieved through the Gene Record Finder (https://gander.wustl.edu/~wilson/dmelgenerecord/index.html; Rele et al.,2023). Approximate splice sites within the target gene are determined usingtblastnusing the CDSs from theD. melanogaster reference gene. Coordinates of CDSs are then refined by examining aligned modENCODE RNA-Seq data, and by applying paradigms of molecular biology such as identifying canonical splice site sequences and ensuring the maintenance of an open reading frame across hypothesized splice sites. Students then confirm the biological validity of their target gene model using the Gene Model Checker (https://gander.wustl.edu/~wilson/dmelgenerecord/index.html; Rele et al., 2023), which compares the structure and translated sequence from their hypothesized target gene model against theD. melanogasterreference
gene model. At least two independent models for a gene are generated by students under mentorship of their faculty course instructors. Those models are then reconciled by a third independent researcher mentored by the project leaders to produce the final model. Note: comparison of 5' and 3' UTR sequence information is not included in this GEP CURE protocol (Gruys et al., 2025).
