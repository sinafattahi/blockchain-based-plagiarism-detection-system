Conventional anesthesia for clavicular fracture surgery poses significant challenges. General anesthesia risks pulmonary complications, while traditional nerve blocks may cause diaphragmatic paralysis or motor impairment. Ultrasound-guided techniques improve precision, but standalone superficial cervical plexus or interscalene brachial plexus blocks often fail to fully anesthetize the deep clavicular region, especially in polytrauma patients. An optimized combined approach could provide effective analgesia while preserving respiratory and motor function.

A 65-year-old male patient with a comminuted fracture of the middle right clavicle and multiple injuries underwent surgery with an ultrasound-guided selective supraclavicular nerve block (SSNB) combined with a modified clavipectoral fascial plane block (MCPB), referred to here as SSCPB. The supraclavicular nerve and clavipectoral fascia were precisely located using ultrasound, and 0.4% ropivacaine was administered, supplemented with dexmedetomidine and sufentanil. The patient maintained stable intraoperative vitals with no pain responses and preserved diaphragmatic/limb function. Postoperatively, analgesia was excellent (VAS 0–2 at rest, 3 on movement) without neurological compromise.

The SSCPB technique achieves optimal anesthesia for mid-clavicular fracture surgery by combining SSNB with MCPB. This approach effectively prevents diaphragmatic paralysis and upper limb dysfunction, making it particularly suitable for patients with concomitant cardiopulmonary injuries or comminuted fractures. Characterized by its simplicity in operation and high safety profile (avoiding general anesthesia-related risks), SSCPB reduces opioid dependence and promotes postoperative recovery. However, more extensive clinical research is required to establish its long-term safety and efficacy profile, particularly in complicated acromioclavicular joint dislocations where adjunctive sedation or suprascapular nerve blocks might be indicated.

Surgical management of clavicle fractures plays a critical role in anatomical restoration and functional recovery, especially in significantly displaced fractures [1]. Anesthesia choice significantly impacts surgical outcomes by reducing intraoperative pain, optimizing procedural success, and accelerating postoperative recovery [2]. Traditional anesthesia options like general anesthesia and interscalene blocks have drawbacks: pulmonary infection risk with general anesthesia, and potential diaphragmatic dysfunction with interscalene blocks.

In recent years, ultrasound-guided nerve block technology has been widely used due to its accuracy and safety. This case report describes a modified technique, SSCPB, which demonstrated effective anesthesia for midshaft clavicular fracture surgery. While SSNB provides effective anesthesia for the clavicle and shoulder region, MCPB offers supplemental coverage of the clavicle’s deep surface. This combined nerve block technique achieves complete surgical anesthesia without compromising respiratory or motor function. Our case demonstrates its successful application in mid-clavicle fracture surgery, proposing a refined anesthetic protocol with enhanced patient safety.

We obtained informed consent from the patient for the publication of identifying information/images. The 65-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment after a fall. Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with: (1) A comminuted midshaft fracture of the right clavicle; (2) Fractures of the right 2nd to 9th ribs; (3) Bilateral pulmonary contusions; 3. Right-sided hemothorax; 5. Pneumonia; 6. Hypoxemia. Following 3 days of preoperative optimization through supportive treatment, the patient demonstrated sufficient clinical improvement to proceed with surgical intervention. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation for a right clavicular fracture under SSCPB. The patient was placed in a supine position with the head tilted to the left. After the skin was thoroughly disinfected, SSNB was first performed (Fig.1): Using a high-frequency linear array transducer, we identified the C7 transverse process by tracing the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle caudally until the characteristic bony prominence was visualized. The typical ultrasound imaging showed that the anterior tubercle was short or absent, the posterior tubercle was relatively flat, and the angle was abducted. The ultrasound in-plane puncture technique was used, and a nerve block puncture needle (Tuoren Medical Devices Co., Ltd. model: 0.7*50 mm) was used to block the supraclavicular nerve located between the superficial cervical fascia and the prevertebral fascia on the laterosuperior of the middle scalene muscle, The supraclavicular nerve typically appears as a hyperechoic structure under ultrasound, dividing into 2–3 branches with a width of approximately 3–5 mm. After aspiration without blood, 5 ml of 0.4% ropivacaine was injected. Then, MCPB was performed (Fig.2): Ultrasound probes were positioned bilaterally 3 cm lateral to the clavicular fracture site. Under real-time guidance, the needle was advanced in a caudal-to-cephalad direction through the clavipectoral fascia plane between the pectoralis major and subclavius muscles. At each injection site, 15 mL of 0.4% ropivacaine was administered without procedural discomfort. After block completion, the patient exhibited no numbness in the upper limb and no reduction in upper limb muscle strength. Shoulder movement resulted in significantly reduced pain at the mid-clavicular fracture site. Ten minutes later, pinprick testing confirmed no pain in the surgical area, with preserved upper limb sensation and muscle strength. Ultrasound evaluation demonstrated no significant changes in right diaphragm function compared to pre-block baseline. Immediately, dexmedetomidine was pumped 10 min before the start of the operation, and a loading dose of 50ug was given. Dexmedetomidine was administered via continuous infusion at a rate of 0.2ug/kg/h, with a total cumulative dose of approximately 70 ug during the surgical procedure. Sufentanil (5 µg) was administered intravenously 5 min prior to surgical incision for optimal analgesic effect. The patient fell asleep quietly, could be awakened during the operation, and had stable vital signs. During the operation, the patient did not complain of pain or discomfort. The operation was successful and lasted 90 min. The patient regained consciousness promptly following the procedure. The patient had no pain in the surgical area, no dyspnea and no other discomfort. The upper limb muscle strength was tested without reduction, and the proper diaphragmatic function was normal by ultrasound measurement. After the operation, the patient was sent to the general ward for rest. After the operation, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia was used. The patient slept well at night without explosive pain. Within 48 h after the operation, the patient was in good condition. The highest VAS score for pain at rest was 2 points, and the highest VAS score for pain with movement was 3 points. The patient had no adverse reactions, such as respiratory depression, dizziness, and upper limb paresthesia. The shoulder and upper limbs could move slightly, and the patient had good self-care ability. The patient’s postoperative recovery was satisfactory; the pain was well controlled, the joint movement gradually returned to normal, the quality of life was significantly improved, and no complications occurred. The patient has met the discharge criteria.

Clavicle fractures are common shoulder girdle injuries, and for patients with displaced or comminuted fractures, surgical open fixation remains the preferred treatment approach [1]. Clavicle fracture surgery can be performed under general anesthesia, nerve block anesthesia, or a combination of both. Nerve block anesthesia offers unique advantages, particularly its minimal impact on respiratory and circulatory function. The clavicle is generally considered to be dually innervated by the brachial and cervical plexuses, primarily originating from the C3-C7 nerve roots [3]. Therefore, the standard nerve block approach for clavicle fracture surgery typically involves a combination of the SCPB and IBPB [4,5], or cervical nerve root and SCPB [6,7]. However, this approach may result in phrenic nerve blockade, leading to diaphragmatic paralysis and impaired ventilation [8]. Additionally, IBPB can lead to reduced upper limb strength and sensory disturbances, causing discomfort such as forearm weakness and finger numbness. This can interfere with early postoperative functional recovery. Consequently, these methods often present limitations and complications.

In this case, the patient had rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, and hypoxemia. General anesthesia could exacerbate lung injury, while the IBPB risks further impairing ventilation due to phrenic nerve blockade. Thus, a modified nerve block approach was selected for this patient: SSCPB.

Maybin et al. [8] first described ultrasound-guided SSNB, suggesting it could provide effective anesthesia and analgesia for shoulder surgeries. Valdéz [9]also recognized SSNB as key to anesthesia for clavicle fracture surgery. Typically, SSNB is combined with the brachial plexus superior trunk block for clavicle fracture surgery [10,11]. We observed that the supraclavicular nerve demonstrates relative fixation at the level of the C7 transverse process. It typically courses along the superficial aspect of the prevertebral fascia, superior and lateral to the middle scalene muscle. Under ultrasound imaging, the nerve generally presents as a hypoechoic structure, dividing into 2–3 branches with a width ranging from 3 to 5 mm. However, current literature lacks comprehensive studies detailing the sonographic anatomical morphology of the supraclavicular nerve. We previously attempted to use SSNB alone for mid-clavicular fracture surgery. Although SSNB effectively provided satisfactory anesthesia and analgesia at the surgical incision and periosteal surface, patients often experienced significant pain and discomfort during intraoperative manipulation of the deep clavicular structures for anatomic reduction, necessitating substantial additional doses of analgesics and sedatives. Therefore, we conclude that isolated SSNB provides insufficient analgesic coverage for the deep subclavicular regions.

Valdés first introduced the clavipectoral fascia block (CPB) anesthesia method at the 36th Annual Congress of the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Therapy in 2017 [12]. Subsequent studies [13,14] have reported that ultrasound-guided CPB combined with SCPB or ICPB can provide effective anesthesia for mid-clavicular surgery. Labandeyra et al. [15] dissected five cadavers that had received CPB and performed CT imaging on three of them. They found that the injected local anesthetic solution was primarily distributed in the anterior and superior regions of the clavicular periosteum, superficial muscle planes, and supraclavicular nerves, but failed to stain the posterior-inferior regions of the clavicular periosteum, deep muscular planes (including the subclavius and pectoralis minor muscles), or the clavipectoral fascia itself. Based on these findings, they questioned the ability of CPB to provide reliable anesthesia and analgesia to the deep structures of the clavicle. Considering the above situation, we have modified the CPB technique, referred to as MCPB, which involves injecting 10-15 ml of local anesthetic into the deep clavipectoral fascia between the pectoralis major and subclavius muscles on both the medial and lateral of the mid-clavicular fracture. No nociceptive responses were observed during the most stimulating portions of the procedure, including deep dissection and fracture realignment. This observation is consistent with the efficacy of ultrasound-guided MCPB in providing effective perioperative analgesia for mid clavicular fractures, as it targets the deep neural supply of the clavicle. A cadaveric anatomical study [16] revealed that the clavicle is innervated by the supraclavicular nerve, subclavian nerve, and lateral pectoral nerve. The supraclavicular nerve exclusively innervates the upper clavicle segment (100%) and also supplies the sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints, while the subclavian and lateral pectoral nerves innervate the lower clavicle segment. No contribution from the accessory nerve, long thoracic nerve, or suprascapular nerve to clavicular innervation was identified. The SSCPB technique validated the functional contributions and importance of these nerves in clavicular innervation.

Although the midclavicular fracture surgery was successfully performed under SSCPB in this case, we identified two important technical considerations: consistent ultrasound visualization of the supraclavicular nerve at the C7 transverse process level remains challenging in some patients, and the MCPB component requires relatively high volumes of local anesthetic, potentially increasing toxicity risks. These observations highlight the need for further investigation into: the sonographic anatomy and morphological variations of supraclavicular nerves to improve identification reliability, and the optimal local anesthetic dosing both volume and concentration for SSCPB to maximize efficacy while minimizing potential toxicity. Additionally, this study did not monitor the patient’s sedation level post-administration of sedative medications like the Ramsay Sedation Score, a measure that should be included in future prospective trials.

The SSCPB technique offers a comprehensive anesthetic effect for mid-clavicular fracture surgery, providing precise analgesia while preventing diaphragmatic paralysis and preserving upper limb movement. This approach is particularly well-suited for patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function or comminuted clavicle fractures. Additionally, the technique is easy to perform, making it a promising option for clinical practice. Its simplicity and effectiveness suggest potential for broader application in optimizing anesthesia management for clavicle fracture surgeries. Although the combination of ultrasound-guided SSCPB has shown clinical advantages, the available studies on its application are limited. To fully assess the safety and efficacy of this technique, further high-quality clinical research is necessary. Such studies should explore its broader applications and determine its suitability for various types of clavicle fractures.
