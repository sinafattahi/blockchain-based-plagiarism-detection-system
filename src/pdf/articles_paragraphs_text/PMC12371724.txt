Polymeric microparticles (MPs) are valuable drug delivery
vehicles
for extended-release applications, but current manufacturing techniques
present significant challenges in balancing size control with scalability.
Industrial synthesis processes provide high throughput but limited
precision, while laboratory-scale technologies offer precise control
but poor scalability. This study explores Sequential NanoPrecipitation
(SNaP), a two-step controlled precipitation process for polymeric
microparticle production, to bridge the gap between laboratory precision
and industrial scalability. We systematically investigated critical
process parameters governing MP formation, focusing on poly­(lactic
acid) (PLA) MPs stabilized with poly­(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). By comparing
vortex and impinging jet mixing geometries, we demonstrated that vortex
mixing provides superior performance for core assembly, particularly
at higher polymer concentrations. We established the influence of
delay time (Td) and core stream concentration
(Ccore) on particle size, confirming that
microparticle assembly follows Smoluchowski diffusion-limited growth
kinetics within defined operational boundaries. Through this approach,
we achieved precise control over microparticle size (1.6–3.0
μm) with narrow polydispersity. The versatility of SNaP was
further demonstrated by the successful formation of MPs with different
stabilizers while maintaining consistent size control. Finally, we
validated the pharmaceutical relevance of SNaP by encapsulating itraconazole
with high efficiency (83–85%) and characterizing its sustained
release profile. These findings establish SNaP as a robust, scalable
platform for high-quality pharmaceutical microparticle production
with superior control over critical quality attributes.

Polymeric microparticles
(MPs) have emerged as important drug delivery
vehicles, particularly for extended-release parenteral formulations,
inhalable formulations and vaccines.−Their biocompatibility, favorable tissue retention, and controllable
release kinetics make them well-suited for depot applications.,,,Commercial
successes include extended-release parenteral formulations such as
naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid addiction, risperidone (Risperdal
Consta) for schizophrenia, and metoprolol succinate (Betaloc ZOK)
for angina.−Despite these achievements, pharmaceutical MP production
faces significant challenges across scales. Industrial processes like
spray drying and emulsification suffer from limited control over particle
size and uniformity.,Moreover, scaling down spray
drying to small batch sizes for formulation development proves technically
difficult. Conversely, newer laboratory
technologies such as microfluidics and membrane emulsification excel
at precise size control and small-scale operation but face severe
scale-up limitations due to their inherently low throughput capacities
(<10 mL/min).−This dichotomy creates a critical gap between laboratory-scale precision
and industrial-scale production capacity.

Schematic of the SNaP process.An organic stream containing
the microparticle core components is rapidly mixed against an antisolvent
in the first micromixing step to initiate the core formation. The
outlet is connected to a second micromixer, which introduces the stabilizer
and arrests the microparticle growth. The delay time between the first
and second mixing steps controls the time of the core growth.

In this study, we systematically investigated SNaP
process parameters
and formulation variables to elucidate the governing principles of
MP property control. We employed SNaP to synthesize spherical polymeric
MPs comprising industry-standard components: hydrophobic polylactic
acid (PLA) cores stabilized via hydrophilic poly­(vinyl alcohol) (PVA).
We first investigated the core assembly mixing step by evaluating
the importance of mixing geometry for uniform particle assembly. We
subsequently explore the process parameters ofTdand core stream solids concentration (Ccore),
establishing the variable parameter space, identifying regions of
tunable particle assembly, and determining the boundaries of process
stability. Through this systematic approach, we demonstrate precise
and reproducible size control of monodisperse particles within the
1.6–3.0 μm diameter range, ideal for inhalation delivery
applications. We go on to show consistency in PLA MP size across different
stabilizing polymers. Finally, we validate the drug loading capability
of the system through reproducible, high-efficiency encapsulation
of itraconazole and characterize the MP drug release rate. With these
findings, we present the SNaP process as a promising new standard
for high quality production of polymeric MPs.

Scientific (USA). Rubrene (98%), poly­(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 13–23
kDa), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 40 kDa) and Tween-80 (ultrapure)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Polyethylene glycol polylactic
acid block copolymer (PEG–PLA, 5kD-5kD) was purchased from
Evonik Inc. (Germany). Itraconazole (98%) was purchased from TCI America.
Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm) was generated by a MilliporeSigma
Milli-Q Water Purification System (USA). Polylactic acid homopolymer
(PLA, 10–18 kDa) was synthesized in-house according to the
protocol described inSection. For mixer assembly, Tefzel tubing (0.040”
& 0.060” ID), female LuerTight syringe fitting systems

and flangeless male nut fittings (1/4–28, 1/16”) were
purchased from Idex Health and Science (USA). O-rings (75 Viton, 1.5
× 35 mm) and heated inserts for 3D printed mixer inlets were
purchased from McMaster Carr (USA).

For polymer synthesis, 2-hydroxyethyl
bromoisobutyrate (95%), 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)­undec-7-ene (95%),
methanol (ACS grade), and deuterated chloroform were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Chloroform (anhydrous, extra dry) and octadecyltrichlorosilane

Hydrochloric acid (37%) was purchased from Acros Organics (USA).

Dl-lactide was added (12.6 g, 87.6 mmol) to a flame-dried,
silanzied 200 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a large stir bar
before undergoing three vacuum/nitrogen purge cycles followed by overnight
drying under high vacuum. In a glovebox, DBU (1.12 mmol) was added
to a flame-dried pear-shaped flask equipped with a stir bar. Anhydrous
chloroform, extra dry over molecular sieves, was then used to dilute
the monomer and catalyst with 82 and 18 mL, respectively. The monomer
solution was then heated to 50 °C using a mineral oil bath. The
initiator, HeBriB (1.19 mmol), was then added to the monomer solution
and allowed to stir for 15 min. To initiate the reaction, the catalyst
solution was transferred via cannula to the monomer solution for a
final reaction molarity of 0.9 M. Following initiation, the heat was
immediately turned off, and the reaction solution was allowed to remain
in the cooling mineral oil under nitrogen. The reaction was terminated
after 2 h by extracting the catalyst with 1 M HCl(aq)followed
by two brine washes. The organic phase was then concentrated and precipitated
over 30x excess ice-cold methanol to isolate the PLA. The product
was transferred to silanzied scintillation vials and dried overnight
under high vacuum to yield a crystalline, white powder (12.2 g, 94.4%
yield, Đ = 1.18).

Polymer characterization was performed
by1H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC).1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE NEO 500 MHz
instrument with minimum 32 scans and a 10-s relaxation delay time.1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, 0.03 wt % TMS) δ 5.38–4.99
(m, 155H), 4.50–4.27 (m, 5H), 1.92 (s, 6H), 1.82–1.34
(m, 499H).

Molecular weight distributions were analyzed on a
Shimadzu GPC
system equipped with a guard column (KD-G) and analytical column (KD-804)
with a target molecular weight range of 2–200 kDa. The mobile
phase consisted of HPLC-grade N,N’-dimethylformamide containing
10 mM lithium bromide at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, with the column,
UV, and RI detector temperatures maintained at 50 °C. GPC samples
were prepared as 2 mg/mL polymer solutions in mobile phase, sonicated
for 10 min, and filtered through 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filters
prior to injection (100 μL). Molecular weights were determined
relative to narrow poly­(methyl methacrylate) standards (Shodex M-75).
Polymer size distributions can be found in theSI (SI Figure S1).

A 3D-printed
dual-inlet vortex mixer (DIVM) was employed for the initial mixing
step. The mixer was designed using Autodesk Fusion360 and fabricated
on a Stratasys Objet30 Pro using Veroclear resin. Postprinting processing
involved the removal of support material under running water, installation
of threaded heat inserts using an arbor press, and thorough compressed
air cleaning to eliminate residual material. O-rings were positioned
into the mixing stages, which were then assembled and secured using
shoulder bolts, washers, and nuts.

For particle synthesis using
the DIVM-MIVM configuration, the outlet of the 3D-printed mixer was
connected to a stainless-steel multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) via
0.04″ or 0.06″ inner diameter tubing. For the CIJM-MIVM
configuration, a confined impinging jet mixer (CIJM) was connected
to an MIVM.

MPs were
synthesized via Sequential Nanoprecipitation (SNaP) using the described
mixer configurations. Before and after the MP synthesis, all mixer
streams were flushed with 3 mL of THF (60 mL/min) followed by 3 mL
of water (60 mL/min).

For the synthesis of MPs, a THF stream
with dissolved PLA and rubrene (2 wt %) was mixed against an equal
volume stream of ultrapure water in the first mixer, which was either
a 3D-printed DIVM or a CIJM. The output of this first mixing stage
flowed into the inlet of the second mixer (MIVM), where it was mixed
against three streams of 1 mg/mL PVA in ultrapure water. For the synthesis
of itraconazole loaded MPs, itraconazole was added to the THF stream
at a 10 wt % total solids concentration.

To achieve the desiredTd, the flow
rate for each stream was held constant at 60 mg/mL using a syringe
pump (PHD Ultra Syringe pump, Harvard Apparatus) and the length/diameter
of the tubing between mixing stages was varied. Stream concentrations,
mixer setups andTdcalculations can be
found in theSI (Figures S2 and S3).

To simulate a continuous flow system, MP samples were collected
only after the flow had fully developed. This solution was collected
in an ultrapure water quenching bath to reduce the final organic concentration
to 5 vol % THF. Startup and end volumes were not collected.

MPs were purified via dialysis to remove organic solvent and unencapsulated
drug. Using regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing (12–14 kDa
MWCO, Repligen), particles were dialyzed against a large excess of
ultrapure water, changing the water bath each hour for 6 h.

MP morphology
was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were
prepared by concentrating MPs via centrifugation (2,000 rcf, 5 min)
followed by dropwise deposition onto silicon wafers. After ambient
drying, samples were sputter-coated with a thin conductive platinum
layer (3 nm) using an EMS 150R ES sputter coater and imaged using
the SE2 detector on a Zeiss Merlin FE-SEM microscope operating at
1 kV EHT and 110 pA.

Particle size distributions were determined
through image analysis of multiple SEM micrographs acquired at 1000×
magnification. A custom MATLAB-based circular Hough transform algorithm
was employed to detect particles and measure their diameters. For
each formulation, a minimum of 2,000 particles were analyzed across
multiple fields of view to ensure statistical robustness. Further
details can be found in the results section.

Total solids concentration
(Ctotal) in purified MP suspensions
was determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Discovery 550
TGA, TA Instruments). Samples were heated under nitrogen from 25 to
105 °C at 10 °C/min and maintained at 105 °C for 20
min to ensure complete water evaporation. Total particle concentration
was calculated by dividing the residual solid weight by the initial
sample volume.

Itraconazole mass concentration (Cdrug) for purified
MP samples was determined via High Performance Liquid Chromatography
on a Thermofisher Vanquish Core HPLC equipped with an autosampler,
quarternary pump, UV detector, and column (Hypersil Gold C18, 3 μm
particle size, 175 Å pore size, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 30 °C).
HPLC samples were prepared by diluting NP solutions into acetonitrile
to a final 50 vol % acetonitrile. The mobile phase was 50 vol % acetonitrile
with 0.1 vol % trifluoracetic acid and 50 vol % water with 0.1 vol
% trifluoracetic acid, with a total flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for 20
min. Detection was performed at 256 nm.

MP drug loading wt %
(DL) was calculated using the equationDL=CdrugCtotal×100. Encapsulation efficiency (EE%), or the
percent of drug that incorporated into MPs, was calculated using the
equationEE%=DLDLtarget×100where DLtargetwas 10% for all
batches.

To characterize the itraconazole release rate, MP dispersions
were
gently concentrated via centrifugation at 2000 rcf for 5 min, followed
by decanting off the supernatant. MPs were then redispersed at a 10-fold
dilution into sink condition release media comprised of phosphate
buffered saline and 10 v/v% Tween-80 surfactant. After initial sampling
to determine the initial drug concentration (Cinitial),
the dispersion was agitated at 90 rpm in a 37° water bath. At
predetermined time points, 1 mL aliquots were withdrawn and centrifuged
(2000 rcf, 5 min) to separate MPs from released drug. The supernatant
was analyzed via HPLC for released itraconazole (Creleased), with the cumulative release calculated asCinitialCreleased×100for each time point.

In this study,
we aimed to identify critical SNaP process and formulation
variables and define their optimal operating ranges for robust and
tunable MP synthesis. First, we developed a quantitative size analysis
methodology for MP size characterization, our key quality attribute
of interest. We then investigated the importance of mixing geometry
by comparing confined impinging jet mixing and vortex mixing in the
first micromixing step which initiates core assembly. Next, we explored
the variable workspace ofTdand Ccore, investigating the influence of each parameter on particle
size and identifying regions of predictable particle assembly. Finally,
we demonstrated the versatility of SNaP by varying stabilizer composition
and encapsulating a model therapeutic agent.

MP size is a key quality attribute that
influences particle biodistribution, drug release rate, and efficacy.
MPs synthesized in this study exhibited diameters exceeding 1 μm
with sedimentation rates on the order of minutes, precluding reliable
characterization via conventional dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques.
To address this limitation, we opted to use scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) to visualize the MPs. We then developed a high-throughput image
analysis protocol capable of providing both quantitative size distribution
data and qualitative morphological insights that were critical for
evaluating this nascent fabrication process.

Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was selected as the primary imaging modality due
to its superior resolution and magnification capabilities. Upon visual
inspection, the SNaP-produced particles consistently exhibited high
sphericity, enabling the implementation of a circular Hough transform
algorithm for automated particle detection and measurement via a MATLAB
script. This image analysis approach successfully detected spherical
particles even when partially obscured, permitting accurate analysis
of densely populated fields containing thousands of closely packed
MPs (FigureA-B).

To ensure statistical significance, multiple SEM
micrographs were
captured at 1000× magnification (1024 × 768 resolution)
for each formulation. Particle diameters detected via the MATLAB-implemented
algorithm were converted to micron scale and aggregated to generate
comprehensive size distribution profiles (FigureC). Each formulation was independently synthesized
in triplicate (N = 3) to evaluate process reproducibility, with a
minimum of 2,000 particles analyzed per formulation to ensure robust
statistical representation. The microparticle polydispersity index
(PDI), the relative variance of particle size assuming a Gaussian
distribution, was calculated for each sample asσ2D2, whereDwas mean particle
diameter and σ was distribution standard deviation.

analysis revealed a greater than 2-fold increase in solution viscosity
between 40 mg/mL (0.99 mPa•s) and 100 mg/mL (2.21 mPa•s)
formulations. Full calculation details can be found in theSI (Figure S4).

In the CIJM-MIVM setup, uniform particle assembly
was observed
at 40 mg/mL, producing monodisperse 1.9 μm particles (FigureB). However, at 100
mg/mL, severe polydispersity and irregular morphologies emerged, including
pear and disc-shaped aggregatesindicators of insufficient
mixing during core assembly (FigureC). In contrast, the DIVM-MIVM configuration maintained
uniform assembly at both concentrations, producing spherical populations
with diameters of 1.6 and 2.2 μm, respectively (FiguresE-F). These observations were
consistent at a longer delay times (Td= 90 ms), where the CIJM-MIVM configuration produced 3.0 μm
particles at 40 mg/mL, and aggregates at 100 mg/mL, and the DIVIM-MIVM
configuration produced 2.2 and 3.0 μm particles at the same
respective Ccorevalues (SI Figure S5).

The superior performance of the vortex mixing geometry
likely stems
from its enhanced tolerance to increased stream viscosity, effectively
expanding the operational parameter space for Ccoreconditions.
Notably, vortex mixing accommodates asymmetric flow rates, enabling
greater flexibility in antisolvent/solvent ratios and supersaturation
states. Based on these advantages, the DIVM-MIVM configuration was
selected for subsequent investigations.

Having established the optimal
mixing configuration, we proceeded to investigate the primary parameters
controlling MP formation during SNaP. Our previous study identifiedTd, the residence time between core nucleation
in the first mixer and stabilization in the second mixer, as a critical
determinant of MP size. While our earlier
work demonstrated size-tunable assembly of MPs from 0.7 to 1.2 μm
using delay times of 7–23 ms, the
present study extends this investigation to longer delay times to
access larger MP size regimes.

established delay times of 30, 60, and 90 ms (Figure).

Concurrently, we investigated the influence of
Ccoreon MP characteristics. Previous FNP studies have
demonstrated that
increasing the total solids concentration results in larger nanoparticles
for systems involving core material aggregation.,,We hypothesized that similar trends would
occur with Ccoreconcentrations in the SNaP process, giving
us a facile lever for tuning MP size. We evaluated Ccorevalues ranging from 40 to 100 mg/mL PLA, with the upper bound approaching
the solubility limit of PLA (18 kDa) in THF, which we determined experimentally
to be approximately 120 mg/mL.

Within these parameter ranges,
we mapped the operational space
for SNaP by determining achievable MP sizes (FigureA). As expected, increasingTdled to larger MP sizes across all core concentrations,
though the effect was less pronounced at the 100 mg/mL PLA Ccore.This is consistent with our hypothesis that core growth continues
during theTdbetween two mixers. Longer
core assembly times therefore result in larger particles. Similarly,
increasing Ccoreproduced larger particles, giving us an
additional lever for controlling MP size. This effect likely stems
from an increase in the core growth rate relative to the core nucleation
rate, similar to single step nanoprecipitation. Within this variable space, we were able to produce MPs
ranging from 1.59 ± 0.01 μm (40 mg/mL PLA, 30 msTd) to 2.98 ± 0.35 μm (100 mg/mL PLA,
90 msTd) with narrow size distributions.
It should be noted that the MP PDIs did increase at the higher 80
and 100 mg/mL PLA Ccoreconditions. Example SEM images
of the spherical MPs are shown inFigureD-F. The complete data set can be found inTable.

where t is growth time (in
our caseTd), T is temperature, η
is solution dynamic viscosity, ρ is core material density, Ccoreis the core concentration, and kBis the Boltzmann
constant. This supported our hypothesis
that SNaP particle formation proceeds via diffusion-limited aggregation
of hydrophobic species in the delay channel. In the current study, we extended this analysis to longer delay
times up to 90 ms. When linearizing our microparticle size data (FigureB), we observed two
distinct trends depending on core concentration. For Ccorevalues of 40, 60, and 80 mg/mL, the data followed diffusion-limited
growth kinetics with slope values of approximately 1/3, consistent
with Smoluchowski’s model. However, at 100 mg/mL Ccore, this relationship broke down, and particle size became largely
independent of delay time, suggesting a shift in the underlying assembly
mechanism.

where N is the number of Kuhn
segments (121), b is the Kuhn length (8.81 Å), M is molecular
weight (17.5 kDa), and NAis Avogadro’s number. Kuhn length calculations can be found in theSI. The calculatedRgvalue of 39.6 Å yielded a C* of 112 mg/mL, confirming that
our 100 mg/mL formulation approached the threshold for chain entanglement.
This explains the deviation from Smoluchowski kinetics at this concentration,
as polymer chain entanglements can lead to network formation during
precipitation, altering the fundamental assembly mechanism. Additional
experiments at a Ccoreof 120 mg/mL (above C*) resulted
in visible PLA macroprecipitates immediately after synthesis, further
confirming that polymer chain entanglements in the organic stream
lead to uncontrolled aggregation. These findings establish an important
process constraint: polymeric materials in SNaP should remain below
their overlap concentration in the solvent stream to ensure controlled
assembly.

Next, using the Smoluchowski scaling law, we successfully
collapsed
MP size data from formulations with 40, 60, and 80 mg/mL PLA Ccore’s onto a single predictive curve (FigureC). This notable finding demonstrates
that particle size in SNaP processes follows fundamental diffusion-limited
aggregation principles, enabling precise prediction of microparticle
dimensions based on CcoreandTd. Such predictive capability represents a significant advancement
in controlled microparticle manufacturing.

Based on our comprehensive
analysis, we developed a process phase
diagram for 17.5 kDa PLA microparticles (Figure) that delineates regions of controlled,
diffusion-limited growth from zones of process instability. This diagram
serves as a practical guide for formulation scientists, enabling rational
selection of formulation (Ccore) and process parameters
(Td) to achieve target particle specifications.
Within the stable operating region, we demonstrated reproducible size
control from 1.6 to 2.9 μm by systematically varying core concentration
and delay time.

While hydrophilic stabilizers (PVA and PVP) were introduced
in the aqueous streams of the second mixing step, the amphiphilic
PEG–PLA was incorporated in a second organic stream that replaced
one of the water streams. As shown inFigure, all three formulations produced MPs with
virtually identical morphologies and mean diameters. PVP-stabilized
MPs exhibited slightly higher polydispersity, likely attributable
to the substantially higher molecular weight of PVP (40 kDa) compared
to PVA (18 kDa) and PEG–PLA (10 kDa), resulting in slower diffusion
kinetics during the stabilization phase.

sizes of PLA MPs stabilized byA.PVAB.PVP, andC.PEG–PLA. (N= 3).

The consistency in particle size across diverse
stabilizers with
fundamentally different stabilization mechanisms - adsorption of water-soluble
polymers versus hydrophobic anchoring of amphiphilic copolymers -
provides compelling evidence that MP size is predominantly determined
by core growth during the intermixer delay time rather than by stabilizer
characteristics. This mechanistic insight further supports the robustness
and versatility of the SNaP process for producing MPs with tailored
surface properties.

To evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of SNaP-produced
MPs, we investigated the encapsulation of itraconazole, a weakly hydrophobic
antifungal agent (FigureA). To be a viable process for therapeutic MP production,
high encapsulation efficiency of small molecule drugs is imperative.
Itraconazole was incorporated into the core organic stream at a 10
wt % target loading while maintaining Ccoreat 60 mg/mL.
Delay times were varied from 30 to 90 ms to assess the influence of
particle size on drug loading efficiency.

Itraconazole loaded MPs were successfully synthesized
at all three
delay times. A representative SEM image of the spherical MPs is shown
inFigureB. Shown
inFigureC, the drug-loaded
MPs exhibited slightly smaller diameters than their nondrug-loaded
counterparts, attributable to the higher density of itraconazole (1.60
g/mL) compared to PLA (1.25 g/mL). Encapsulation efficiency remained
remarkably consistent across all delay times, with values of 83%,
84%, and 85% for 30, 60, and 90 ms, respectively. These efficiencies
are comparable to those achieved in small molecule-loaded polymeric
MPs synthesized via industrial-scale emulsification techniques, demonstrating the pharmaceutical relevance of
the SNaP process. Moreover, the consistent drug loading efficiency
across varying delay times demonstrates that MP size can be independently
tuned without compromising therapeutic incorporation, highlighting
the orthogonal control of critical quality attributes afforded by
the SNaP process.

Release kinetics studies revealed a biphasic
pattern characteristic
of matrix-type polymeric delivery systems:,an initial burst release of approximately 23% upon dispersion into
sink conditions, followed by a slow sustained release over the 5 days
tested (FigureD).
This release profile indicates the potential utility of SNaP-produced
MPs for extended-release pharmaceutical applications.

In this work, we have established
Sequential NanoPrecipitation
(SNaP) as a robust and versatile platform for the controlled assembly
of polymeric microparticles. By systematically investigating key process
parameters, we have developed a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanisms governing particle formation and size control in this nascent
technology. Our findings demonstrate that vortex mixing geometries
provide superior performance in the core assembly step, particularly
at higher polymer concentrations where increased solution viscosity
can compromise mixing efficiency in confined impinging jet systems.
Through careful manipulation ofTdand
core concentration Ccore, we achieved precise size control
of monodisperse microparticles ranging from 1.6 to 3.0 μm -
dimensions particularly valuable for applications in pulmonary drug
delivery.

The mechanistic insights gained from this study are
significant;
we confirmed that particle assembly follows Smoluchowski diffusion-limited
growth kinetics across a wide operating space, enabling predictive
modeling of particle size based on fundamental process parameters.
We identified critical process boundaries, particularly the polymer
overlap concentration threshold, above which controlled assembly transitions
to undesirable aggregation.

The versatility of SNaP was further
demonstrated through successful
particle formation using diverse stabilizing polymers while maintaining
consistent size control, highlighting the process’s adaptability
to different surface functionalization strategies. Most importantly,
we validated the pharmaceutical relevance of SNaP by achieving consistently
high encapsulation efficiency (83–85%) of itraconazole across
various formulations, with release profiles suitable for extended-release
applications.

SNaP uniquely bridges the gap between laboratory
precision and
industrial scalability. Our lab-scale system demonstrated production
rates of 144 to 360 g of microparticles per hour, with established
potential for scale-up using larger mixing geometries. This combination
of precise size control, predictable assembly behavior, material efficiency,
and scalability positions SNaP as a transformative approach for polymeric
microparticle production that overcomes the longstanding dichotomy
between laboratory-scale precision and industrial manufacturing requirements.

Future investigations will focus on determining the role of solvent
quality in the first mixing step and further expanding the achievable
size range by increasing delay times.
