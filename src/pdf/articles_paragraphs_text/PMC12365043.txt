CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkane is a promising and innovative technology for light olefin production; however, the interference of side reactions and sluggish reactivity of CO2limit olefin yields. This paper describes an economically viable tandem catalytic system by coupling alkane dehydrogenation and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, employing PtSn/SiO2as ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) sites and nano-CaCO3as the hydrogen acceptor for sequent RWGS. This tandem catalytic system significantly surpasses commercial CrOx- and Pt-based catalytic systems, and breaks the EDH thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, reaching 142% of the nominal equilibrium ethylene yield of non-oxidative EDH process with 96.7% selectivity under industrially relevant conditions. Experimental characterization and theoretical analysis confirm that CaCO3mediates the pathway of hydrogen spillover that originates from adjacent PtSn/SiO2, which effectively facilitates the RWGS reaction and thus shifts the EDH toward ethylene. This tandem catalytic strategy assisted by carbonates potentially expands the palette of catalytic systems pertaining to hydrogen transfer mechanisms in CO2-involved hydrogenation or dehydrogenation reactions.

CO2-assisted alkane dehydrogenation faces sluggish reactions and limited yields. Here, a PtSn/SiO2+nano-CaCO3tandem catalyst achieves superior ethylene yields by coupling ethane dehydrogenation with RWGS, effectively surpassing the equilibrium limit of nonoxidative ethane dehydrogenation process.

Ethylene is a crucial foundational feedstock in the chemical industry1,2. Traditional ethylene production processes, including naphtha steam cracking, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of olefins and methanol to olefins, are afflicted by high energy consumption, numerous operating units, and low atom utilization3–6. Ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) presents significant cost advantages in the direct conversion of ethane from shale gas into ethylene6,7. However, the single-pass yield of ethylene in the EDH process is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium (Supplementary Fig.1)8–11. Taking into consideration of Le Chatelier’s principle, prompt removal of H2from the product mixture can shift the reaction equilibrium to enhance ethylene yield12–14. Addition of the oxidant, such as O2is a universal method for removing H215–17. Nevertheless, O2co-feeding inevitably leads to excessive oxidation of products and the risk of explosion5.

CO2, which is considered a mild oxidant, is capable of avoiding the over-oxidation of products and it also holds great significance in consuming H2through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction18–23. CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (CO2-ODHE) provides a higher theoretical yield of ethylene than EDH (Fig.1aand Supplementary Figs.2–4)14,24. Nevertheless, the dry reforming of ethane (DRE) is thermodynamically more favorable than CO2-ODHE (Supplementary Fig.2: ΔGDRE< ΔGCO2-ODHE), which results in low ethylene selectivity and yield from ODHE due to the thermodynamic competition from DRE (Supplementary Fig.3)25–29. Chen et al. recently demonstrated that a PtSn/SiO2catalyst exhibits excellent propylene selectivity in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP)30. However, the rate-determining RWGS reaction still limited the single-pass yield of propylene30, in which the inert CO2molecules displayed finite removal of the H2generated from alkane dehydrogenation. Consequently, effective activation of CO2molecules is crucial for tuning hydrogen consumption and mediating the tandem process of EDH and RWGS reactions.

Reaction conditions: T = 600 °C, catalyst: 200 mg, total flow rate of 20 mL/min, Ar balanced (50% C2H6, 50% CO2; 50% C2H6, 10% CO2; 50% C2H6, 25% CO2; 75% C2H6, 25% CO2).

CaCO3is a low-cost and common material in integrated CO2capture and utilization, which can act as a reversible carrier for gas-solid carbonate hydrogenation in the calcium looping process31–35. Thermodynamically, the decomposition of CaCO3is apparently expedited in the presence of H2(Supplementary Fig.5), inferring that CaCO3might be a potential hydrogen acceptor. Moreover, solid carbonates can heuristically serve as intermediate regulators that are favorable to CO2-involved reactions. For instance, Xia et al. observed that the chemical activation of CO2molecules in the form of carbonates on PbO facilitated the CO2reduction reaction toward HCOOH36. Here, we describe a tandem process of alkane dehydrogenation and the RWGS reaction over CaCO3coupled with PtSn/SiO2catalysts to enhance ethylene yield (Supplementary Fig.6). In the tandem catalytic system, PtSn/SiO2converts ethane into ethylene and hydrogen species (H*), while the adjacent CaCO3induces H* to migrate from the dehydrogenation sites to react with solid carbonates, generating H2O and CO via the RWGS reaction. Simultaneously, the CO2molecules are trapped by vacancies in CaCO3to complete the redox cycle. Under near-realistic and challenging conditions of high space velocity and high ethane concentration, the tandem catalyst achieves 31.9% ethylene single-pass yield with 96.7% ethylene selectivity, exceeding the equilibrium yield of the non-oxidative EDH process and closely approaching the equilibrium of CO2-ODHE. The ethylene space-time yield (STY) is respectively 112- and 1.6-fold higher than that of commercial CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts under equivalent conditions. In addition, energy consumption and net CO2emissions of the tandem catalytic system were also significantly lower than those of commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3catalytic EDH system.

The catalytic performances of different catalytic systems were tested on stream of 50 vol.% C2H6balanced with either Ar or CO2at 600 °C. In the absence of CO2, PtSn/SiO2attained high ethylene selectivity (98.5%) at 22.4% ethane conversion that approached thermodynamic equilibrium of EDH (22.5%), comparable to commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3(Fig.1band Supplementary Fig.7). After co-feeding CO2with ethane, PtSn/SiO2presented 26.2% ethylene yield with 96.0% ethylene selectivity, breaking the thermodynamic equilibrium limit of EDH (Fig.1c). When coupling PtSn/SiO2with CaCO3, we noted that the H2yield decreased at the increased conversions of ethane and CO2, and the highest ethylene yield (selectivity) of 31.9% (96.7%) was obtained (Fig.1b, c). This reached 142% of the nominal equilibrium ethylene yield of EDH (Fig.1d), outperforming the commercial CrOx- and Pt-based catalytic systems, as well as other previous reported catalysts (Fig.1eand Supplementary Table2). Moreover, the ethylene yields of PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3tandem catalyst were near the thermodynamic equilibrium values of CO2-ODHE across different temperatures (450–650 °C) and ethane volume fractions (10–50%) (Fig.1fand Supplementary Fig.8). The carbon balance in CxHyand total carbon balance of PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3tandem catalyst reached 99.1% and 99.0%, respectively (Supplementary Fig.9), demonstrating the negligible influences of DRE and deep dehydrogenation side reactions during CO2-ODHE. We found an induction period of C2H6and CO2conversions over PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3tandem catalysts in the initial 30 min of reaction, and in situ X-ray diffraction (in situ XRD) confirmed that this stage corresponds to the transformation of CO2into carbonate (Supplementary Fig.10). CaCO3alone produced 0.9% ethylene yield at 600 °C (Fig.1f), implying CaCO3is inclined to function as a hydrogen acceptor rather than an EDH site.

Concerning the evaluation of ethylene productivity, ethylene STY was calculated to reach 7.81 mol C2H4gmetal−1h−1(78.1 mmol C2H4·gcat−1·h−1) upon tandem catalyst, which was 112 and 1.6 times higher than those of the commercial CrOx- and Pt-based catalytic systems, respectively (Fig.1d). The STY was significantly higher than those reported catalysts for CO2-ODHE, EDH, and O2-ODH (Supplementary Table2). In addition, for CO2-ODHP, the tandem catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity with 94.5% propylene selectivity and 55.0% single-pass propylene yield (Supplementary Fig.11), which moved beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH, 48.0%) at 550 °C (Supplementary Fig.4), surpassing the values reported in the previous literature (Supplementary Fig.12and Supplementary Table3).

For the long-term cyclic stability at 600 °C, the tandem catalyst showed a slightly declined ethane conversion that remained higher than the equilibrium of non-oxidative EDH process (22.5%), whereas the commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3and K-CrOx/γ-Al2O3showed rapid deactivation during 10 h at high ethane concentration and weight hourly space velocity (50 vol.% C2H6, WHSV = 8.14 h−1) (Fig.1gand Supplementary Fig.13). Notably, the deactivation constant (kd) of PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3was only 0.046 h−1, much lower than that of the commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3(0.121 h−1) and K- CrOx/γ-Al2O3(0.331 h−1) under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig.14). In addition, the PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3tandem catalytic system offers significant advantages in terms of energy consumption and net CO2emissions compared to the commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3catalytic system, with energy savings of about 8.3% and CO2emission reductions of 60.6% for ethylene production per unit (Supplementary Fig.15). This suggests that the catalytic performance and economic potential of our proposed tandem catalytic process has a significant advantage over commercial catalytic systems under near-realistic and challenging operating conditions. We also evaluated the cyclic stability of the tandem catalyst for CO2-ODHE under various feed conditions (high ethane/CO2ratios, 75% high concentration of ethane). After several regeneration cycles, the catalytic performance was basically restored (Fig.1g). To verify the potential of the tandem catalytic system for industrial scale-up, we appropriately increased the reactor scale (total flow rate: 400 mL/min) and tested its catalytic performance (Supplementary Fig.16). The ethane conversion, ethylene selectivity, and stability were almost identical to the results obtained in the laboratory-scale reactor.

XRD and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) of PtSn/SiO2showed that the PtSn nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the amorphous SiO2support (Supplementary Figs.17and18). For the tandem catalyst, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) images discerned independent nano-CaCO3(ca. 52 nm) and highly dispersed PtSn nanoparticles (ca. 1.9 nm) on SiO2with nanoscale intimacy (Fig.2b–gand Supplementary Figs.19–23), as described in Fig.2a. The shortest distance between PtSn nanoparticles and CaCO3was less than 1 nm in the analysis of the HRTEM image (Fig.2hand Supplementary Fig.23). Pt 4fX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and PtL3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra verified the electron transfer from Sn to Pt in the PtSn/SiO2and tandem catalyst, possibly due to the alloying effect of PtSn (Fig.2iand Supplementary Fig.24)37,38, as evidenced by the Pt-Sn bond formation determined by PtL3-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra and wavelet transform (Fig.2jand Supplementary Fig.25)37,39. Importantly, the chemical states of Pt and Sn would not be subject to physical integration with CaCO3, as sustained by XPS and PtL3-edge XANES spectra (Supplementary Figs.24–27and Supplementary Table6). In addition, a J factor was defined as the ratio of CNPt-Sn/ (CNPt-Sn+ CNPt-Pt) versus the theoretical value of thermally stable phase (Supplementary Table7)30,40. As JPt3Snwas close to 1, Pt3Sn was affirmed as the main phase in PtSn/SiO2and the tandem catalyst, consistent with the results of HRTEM. We also conducted in situ ambient pressure XPS to further investigate the valence states of Pt and Sn during the CO2-ODHE (Supplementary Fig.28). The difference in the binding energy shifts of Pt 4fin Pt/SiO2and PtSn/SiO2after introducing the reaction gas indicates that the PtSn alloy effect weakens the interaction between Pt and H*20.

To investigate the cause of catalyst deactivation, we conducted HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, EDS mapping, solid-state NMR, and Raman spectroscopy on both the spent and regenerated catalysts. The XRD, HAADF-STEM, HRTEM, and EDS mapping results indicated that the structure of the catalyst and the size of PtSn particles remained unchanged after 10 h of reaction and subsequent regeneration (Supplementary Figs.29–32). However, Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of defective carbon (D band: 1326 cm−1) and graphitic carbon (G band: 1594 cm−1) on spent catalysts (Fig.3a)29. Notably, individual PtSn/SiO2and the tandem catalyst showed similar defective and graphitic carbon contents and ID/IG, indicating that the introduction of CaCO3does not affect the coke-induced deactivation of PtSn/SiO2. Compared to the commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3system, the tandem catalytic system exhibited lower coke content, which accounts for the lower kdobserved. Solid-state NMR analysis showed abundant saturated aliphatic carbon species on the spent tandem catalyst (Supplementary Fig.31), suggesting that coke formation may be associated with ethylene polymerization products at high temperature41. Additionally, O2-TPO analysis of spent catalysts after different reaction times revealed that coke accumulation increased with reaction time, although the deposition rate gradually slowed (Supplementary Fig.33). The accumulation of the coke may cover the active sites and lead to catalyst deactivation19,42. However, after the regeneration, the disappearance of graphite carbon and defective carbon on the catalyst indicated that the coke was completely removed, thereby restoring the catalytic activity.

Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of C2H6/CO2(Ar) showed that the introduction of CaCO3significantly increased the yield of ethylene by PtSn/SiO2, accompanied by noticeable consumption of CO2and decreased production of H2. This suggests that CaCO3refines the process of RWGS in CO2-ODHE (Supplementary Fig.34). For the tandem catalyst, H2and CO2conversion of 36.0% and 35.4%, respectively, approached the thermodynamic equilibrium value of RWGS (38.3%) at 600 °C (Supplementary Fig.35), higher than those of PtSn/SiO2without CaCO3(28.7% H2and 28.2% CO2conversion). These results are mutually corroborated with the improved performance in the CO2-ODHE mediated by the integration of CaCO3.

For manipulating the distance between dehydrogenation sites and the CaCO3hydrogen acceptor, we coupled PtSn/SiO2with CaCO3in three tandem modes denoted as M1, M2, and M3(Fig.3b, c)13. Based on Monte Carlo estimations, the distances between the two components in M1, M2, and M3are approximately 2.4 mm, 472.8, and 43.6 μm, respectively (Supplementary Fig.36). A strong correlation was found between the distance of PtSn/SiO2and CaCO3and the catalytic performance. As the distance between PtSn/SiO2and CaCO3decreases, the ethane reaction rate, ethylene selectivity, and CO2conversion significantly increase (M3> M2> M1), accompanied by lower H2yield (Supplementary Fig.37). According to the concept of “the closer, the better” for tandem sites43, the shorter distance between reactive centers is conducive to the migration of intermediates or active species. Therefore, we ascribe this proximity-dependent phenomenon to the intensified intermediate species spillover between PtSn/SiO2and CaCO3at the nanoscale.

We conducted kinetic experiments to further investigate the crucial role of CaCO3in the CO2-ODHE. At 600 °C, by varying the partial pressure of C2H6or CO2, we determined the reaction orders of ethane and CO2over PtSn/SiO2and the tandem catalyst, as shown in Fig.3d, e. The reaction orders of ethane were significantly higher than those of CO2(0.84  > 0.16, 0.75  > 0.33). The ethane reaction rate increased with increasing CO2partial pressure, which can be attributed to the consumption of H* by CO2via the RWGS reaction, thereby promoting ethane conversion Notably, the reaction order of CO2on the tandem catalyst (nCO2= 0.16) was lower than that on PtSn/SiO2(nCO2= 0.33), suggesting that the incorporation of CaCO3reduces the dependence of ethane conversion on CO2partial pressure. In addition, we tested the apparent activation energies (Ea) of ethane over the tandem catalyst and PtSn/SiO2(in the presence and absence of CO2) (Fig.3f). For PtSn/SiO2, the introduction of CO2significantly lowered theEafrom 127.2 kJ/mol (without CO2) to 111.2 kJ/mol (with CO2). After the tandem integration of CaCO3and PtSn/SiO2, theEawas further reduced to 84.8 kJ/mol, indicating that CaCO3can activate CO2to further consume H*and thereby improve ethylene production. The kinetic analysis of propane revealed similar trends (Supplementary Fig.38), confirming the mechanistic consistency of the tandem catalyst in promoting alkane conversion.

The smooth migration of intermediates or H* species between reactive sites in closer proximity over the nanoscale tandem catalyst is of paramount importance to accelerate tandem catalytic coupling processes13,44,45. For EDH, the kinetic analysis indicated that promptly removing H2or H* from the dehydrogenation sites can enhance the reaction rate of EDH to ethylene (Supplementary kinetic analysis). We performed H2-TPR and NH3temperature-programmed reduction (NH3-TPR) to validate the spillover performance of hydrogen intermediates on the tandem catalyst (Fig.4aand Supplementary Fig.39). The temperature of reduction peak over CaCO3decreased from 726 °C to 671 °C when coupling with PtSn/SiO2(Fig.4a). As shown by mass spectrometry, hydrogenation products formed more easily at a lower temperature on the tandem catalyst compared with individual CaCO3.

The inset schematic in (i) depicts the evolution processes of Si-OH over PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3.

H2-TPR for tandem catalyst with different tandem modes also reflects that the distance between two components is strongly interrelated to hydrogen spillover (Supplementary Fig.40). Specifically, as the distance between the components decreases, the reduction temperature of CaCO3shifts earlier, which is attributed to the enhanced hydrogen spillover from PtSn/SiO2to CaCO3. For tandem catalyst, the H2signal increased slowly initially, while CO and H2O signals exhibited a rapid rise, suggesting a higher rate of CaCO3hydrogenation in the presence of PtSn/SiO2(Supplementary Fig.41). In situ XRD under H2/Ar at 600 °C (Fig.4b, c) and ex situ Raman Spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.42) demonstrated that CaCO3in the tandem catalyst was completely reduced into CaO at 600 °C within approximately 60 min in contrast to the poor reducibility of individual CaCO3. These results hint that the occurrence of hydrogen spillover induced by nanoscale contact between two components in the tandem catalyst should result in the acceleration of the CaCO3hydrogenation rate.

To deeply delve into the role of CaCO3in the hydrogen spillover process, we switched the reaction atmospheres and observed the changes of it during CO2-ODHE (Fig.4d). XRD revealed that CaCO3was first reduced to CaO via H2/Ar pretreatment. When switching to C2H6/CO2, CaO rapidly underwent carbonation back to CaCO3, corresponding to the induction period in the former 30-min reaction of CO2-ODHE (Supplementary Fig.10). This suggests that the supplement of CO2is faster than consumption, leading to the existence of CaCO3under the reaction condition. Subsequently, on exposure to C2H6/Ar, the CaO phase reappears. Isotopic13CO2and H2TPSR (13CO2-H2/TPSR) on the tandem catalyst indicated that the RWGS reaction dominated below 485 °C with13CO as the main products (Fig.4e). In the temperature range of 485–650 °C,12CO signal increased continuously while13CO signal remained almost unchanged, illuminating that H* preferably reacts with the carbonates in CaCO3rather than13CO2molecules. Therefore, we conclude that the active carbonates in CaCO3are responsible for driving hydrogen spillover and rapidly consuming H* to reinforce the equilibrium shift of CO2-ODHE. Subsequently, the reduced CaCO3captures CO2molecules to accomplish the regeneration cycle of carbonates, as illustrated in Fig.4f.

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) experiments further unravel the hydrogen spillover mediated by carbonates in CaCO3during CO2-ODHE (Fig.4g, h). After feeding ethane at 600 °C, the signals at 3728–3734 cm−1assigned to the Si−OH groups46,47were observed in both the tandem catalyst and individual PtSn/SiO2. The relative content of Si−OH species over individual PtSn/SiO2rapidly increased to 87.8% of the infrared signal during the steady state within 15 min (Fig.4i). In contrast, the Si-OH species on the tandem catalyst increased slowly and accounted for only 16.8% of the integral intensity of the steady state, pointing to the fact that the adjacent CaCO3with nanoscale proximity triggers H* migration from the Pt3Sn sites toward carbonates producing CO (2110 cm−1and 2175 cm−1)48, thus expediting the removal of H*. After the 15-min period, the continuous consumption of carbonates without replenishment leads to weakened impetus for H* spillover, accounting for the rapid increase of Si-OH content.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on the surface of CaCO3(010) and Pt3Sn (100) (Supplementary Fig.43). Figure5apresents a uniform charge distribution in CO2molecule, with both C = O bond lengths of 1.18 Å. Comparably, the carbonate of CaCO3due to uneven charge distribution was comprised of three distinct C−O linkages with relatively elongated bond lengths of 1.27, 1.31, and 1.32 Å, enabling the easier activation of C−O bonds per se. Potential density of states (PDOS) analysis (Fig.5b) demonstrates a more dispersive electron distribution in carbonates of CaCO3, confirming the weaker strength of C−O bonds in carbonates compared with CO2molecules. Collectively, we infer that carbonates within CaCO3are more accessible to undergo the RWGS reaction compared with CO2molecules. Notably, the hydrogen adsorption on O-CaCO3(−1.12 eV) was considerably stronger than those on Ca-CaCO3(−0.26 eV), C-CaCO3(−0.62 eV), Pt–Pt3Sn (−0.79 eV), and Sn–Pt3Sn (–0.71 eV) (Fig.5cand Supplementary Fig.44), illustrating that the hydrogen spillover from Pt3Sn sites to O-CaCO3is thermodynamically favorable.

Color scheme: red, gray, white, green, purple, and blue balls stand for O, C, H, Ca, Pt, and Sn atoms, respectively.

The molecular-level details of EDH and RWGS processes were elaborated through the calculation of relative energy. For the EDH process, ethane is first adsorbed onto the Pt3Sn site and then dehydrogenated to form ethylene and hydrogen (Fig.5dand Supplementary Figs.45and46). The highest energy barrier in this reaction corresponds to the first C-H bond cleavage of ethane (TS1 in Fig.5d, E0= 1.67 eV), which aligns with the kinetic observation that the reaction order of ethane is relatively high. In addition, the energy barrier for hydrogen formation is 1.56 eV (TS3 in Fig.5d, E1). In the reaction pathway of RWGS involving CO2molecules on the Pt3Sn surface, the formation of COOH* from H* and CO2* is the rate-determining step (TS1 in Fig.5e, E2= 1.47 eV), with a lower energy barrier than hydrogen formation in the EDH process, indicating CO2is kinetically viable to consume H*. In contrast, the RWGS process steered by CaCO3involving H* and carbonates requires a much lower energy barrier (TS2 in Fig.5f, E3= 1.38 eV, E3< E2< E1). This is consistent with the kinetic results showing that theEaof the tandem catalyst is significantly lower than that of the individual PtSn/SiO2catalyst (84.8 kJ/mol <111.2 kJ/mol). Therefore, H* is energetically favored to undergo RWGS with the carbonates in CaCO3, which is consistent with the results of13CO2-H2/TPSR. In this process, H* adsorption steps are exothermic, suggesting the feasibility of hydrogen spillover from Pt3Sn sites to CaCO3. Based on the above calculation results, we propose a reaction mechanism of the CO2-ODHE process. Pt3Sn serves as the dehydrogenation site to convert ethane into ethylene and H*. Subsequently, H* spills over to the nanoscale-adjacent CaCO3and reacts with carbonates via RWGS to produce H2O and CO. Finally, CO2replenishes the vacancies in CaCO3to complete the cycle.

To assess the generality of hydrogen spillover effects over carbonate-mediated tandem catalytic systems, we utilized other alkaline earth metal carbonates (such as MgCO3, SrCO3, and BaCO3) to replace CaCO3as hydrogen acceptors in the tandem catalyst. As expected, these carbonates consumed hydrogen to varying degrees, thereby increasing the ethylene single-pass yield. All tandem catalysts showed enhanced ethylene yield that exceeded the non-oxidative EDH process equilibrium value (22.5%), with selectivity greater than 93% (Supplementary Figs.47and48). These results support the universal principle of carbonate-induced hydrogen spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.

We describe a CaCO3-mediated strategy for tandem catalytic process of EDH and RWGS to tackle the imposing constraint on the selectivity and yield of ethylene in CO2-ODHE. PtSn/SiO2coupled with nanoscale-adjacent CaCO3achieved 31.9% ethylene single-pass yield with 96.7% ethylene selectivity under industrially relevant conditions, exceeding the equilibrium yield of the non-oxidative EDH process and outperforming commercial CrOx- and Pt-based catalyst systems. Moreover, the tandem catalytic system showed lower energy consumption and net CO2emissions compared to commercial PtSn/γ-Al2O3catalytic EDH system. The comprehensive studies elucidate that PtSn/SiO2catalyzes EDH to produce ethylene and H*, while the intrinsic carbonates in CaCO3induce H* migration and thus shift the CO2-ODHE toward high-efficiency ethylene production. Simultaneously, the carbonates in CaCO3could be reversibly replenished by CO2molecules to complete the cycle. This tandem catalytic system also works efficaciously for CO2-ODHP to produce propylene. Our study offers an inspiration for catalyst design with application in the reactions involving hydrogen transfer catalysis and processes.

The tandem catalysts comprising PtSn/SiO2and nano-CaCO3(average particle size of 50 nm, Macklin) were prepared by physical mixing. The actual contents of Pt and Sn in PtSn/SiO2were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to be 0.98 wt% and 0.59 wt%, respectively. The control of the spatial distribution distance between PtSn/SiO2and CaCO3were prepared by three different tandem modes.M1: initially, PtSn/SiO2and nano-CaCO3were individually pressed, crushed, and sieved to granules between 20 and 40 mesh, respectively. Subsequently, PtSn/SiO2granules were placed on the top layer, CaCO3granules were placed on the bottom layer, and a quartz wool layer approximately 2 mm thick was used to separate the two layers.M2: the equal mass sieved PtSn/SiO2(20–40 mesh) and nano-CaCO3(20–40 mesh) were placed into a 10 mL centrifuge tube, followed by shaking to ensure homogeneous mixing.M3: equal masses of PtSn/SiO2and nano-CaCO3powders were ground together in the agate mortar for 10 min and then placed into a 10 mL centrifuge tube, followed by shaking to achieve uniform mixing. Subsequently, the obtained mixtures were pressed, crushed, and sieved to granules between 20 and 40 mesh. Tandem catalysts were mixed using the M3method unless otherwise specified.

Common commercial catalyst analogues in EDH (PDH) system are PtSn/γ-Al2O3and K-CrOX/Al2O3. In a typical synthesis of PtSn/γ-Al2O39,38, H2PtCl6(Macklin) and SnCl4·5H2O (Meryer) were added to a 0.1 M HCl solution and ultrasonically mixed for 30 min in which the final molar concentration of Pt and Sn ions were 102 mM and 510 mM. Then, 1 mL of the above solution was diluted to 40 mL of deionized water, which was added to 2 g of γ-Al2O3and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The theoretical loading of Pt was controlled at 1%. For synthesis of K-CrOx/Al2O317,47, 1.58 g of γ-Al2O3support was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 3.08 g of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Meryer) and 0.05 g of KNO3(Meryer), and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The theoretical loadings of Cr and K were controlled at 20% and 1%, respectively. The above solution was dried overnight at 373 K. Finally, the obtained solid was calcined in air at 550 °C for 3 h.

The EDH and CO2-ODHE catalytic performance were conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure13. Typically, 0.1 g of PtSn/SiO2and 0.1 g of nano-CaCO3(or other mixtures) composing the tandem catalyst (20–40 mesh) were placed in a quartz tube (inner diameter 8 mm), with quartz wool filled both above and below the tandem catalyst. The temperature of the catalyst bed was controlled by a K-type thermocouple. The catalyst was pretreated in 10 vol.% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) at 600 °C for 2 h, followed by Ar (50 mL/min) purging for 10 min. Next, the specified reaction conditions (C2H6: CO2= 1:1, total flow rate of 20 mL/min) was switched into the reactor and stabilized for 30 min. The effluent from the reactor outlet was thoroughly mixed with pure N2(5 mL/min) before entering the gas chromatograph (GC) for analysis. For the tests at different temperatures, the gas composition and catalyst loading were consistent with the above conditions, except that the reaction temperature was decreased to the desired value (450–650 °C) and data points were collected after stabilization for 30 min. For tests with different ethane volume fractions, the flow rates of C2H6and CO2were adjusted to 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2 mL/min, respectively, while Ar was used as a balance gas with flow rates of 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mL/min, maintaining a total flow rate of 20 mL/min. For the tests on individual PtSn/SiO2, SiO2was used instead of CaCO3to mix with PtSn/SiO2. For EDH tests, Ar was used instead of CO2to mix with C2H6(C2H6: Ar = 1:1). For RWGS tests, H2was used instead of C2H6to mix with CO2(H2: CO2= 1:1).

For the catalyst regeneration process, the reaction temperature was lowered to 500 °C, and the reactor was purged with Ar (50 mL/min) for 10 min to ensure the complete removal of ethane and CO2. Then, 1 vol.% O2/Ar (30 mL/min) was introduced for 30 min, followed by purging with Ar (50 mL/min) for 10 min to ensure the complete removal of O2. Next, the gas was switched to 10 vol.% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) as the temperature increased to 600 °C and maintained for 2 h. Finally, purge with Ar (50 mL/min) for 10 min to ensure the complete removal of H2.

In situ X-ray diffraction (In situ XRD) experiments were conducted on a 45 kV, 220 mA, and 9 kW Rigaku Smartlab using Cu Kα radiation filtered with graphite (λ = 1.5406 Å) and equipped with a high temperature cell. The powder samples of CaCO3+ SiO2and PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3were separately loaded into high temperature cell vessels, and then purged with 10 vol.% H2/Ar (20 mL/min) for 10 min. Firstly, an XRD pattern was recorded at room temperature. Then, the sample was heated at a rate of 20 °C/min under 10 vol.% H2/Ar (20 mL/min) to 600 °C and maintained for 2 h. The XRD patterns were recorded immediately upon reaching 600 °C with 2θ range of 25–75° at a scan speed of 5°/min and at intervals of 15 min during the isothermal process. The in situ XRD experiments during the reaction process were conducted similarly. After treatment under 10 vol.% H2/Ar (20 mL/min) for 2 h, the gas was switched to the reaction atmosphere (50 vol.% C2H6/CO2), and XRD patterns were recorded.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra obtained at the BL14W beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The storage rings at SSRF operated at 3.5 GeV with a stable current of 200 mA. Data was collected using a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. The spectra of Pt L3-edge and Sn K-edge were collected in transmission mode and fluorescence mode by Lytle detector, respectively at room temperature.

H2temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and H2isothermal mass spectrometry (H2-IMS) experiments were conducted on a chemical adsorption instrument (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920) equipped with a mass spectrometer (HRP-20 EGA) at atmospheric pressure. The samples (0.1 g) of PtSn/SiO2+ CaCO3or SiO2+ CaCO3(mass ratio of 1:1) were separately loaded into U-shaped quartz tubes. For H2-TPR testing process, the sample was pretreated with pure Ar (30 mL/min) at 150 °C for 1 h and cooled to 50 °C, followed by ramping the temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min from 50 °C to 850 °C in 10 vol.% H2/Ar (30 mL/min). For H2-IMS testing process, the sample was heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C /min in pure Ar (30 mL/min) and stabilized for 10 min, then the gas was switched to 10 vol.% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) and maintained at 600 °C for an additional 2 h. The exhaust gases were analyzed for signals of H2(m/z = 2), CO (m/z = 28), CO2(m/z = 44), and H2O (m/z = 18) via mass spectrometer. Other temperature-programmed experiment details were showed in the supporting information.

In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 spectrometer, equipped with a high temperature cell featuring ZnSe windows and a liquid nitrogen-cooled detector. The catalyst powder was loaded into the center of the high temperature cell, and surface was leveled to minimize interference from reflections. The sample was initially heated to 600 °C in pure Ar (30 mL/min) flow and held for 0.5 h. Subsequently, background spectra were recorded under steady state conditions, followed the 10 vol.% C2H6/Ar (20 mL/min) was introduced into the high temperature reaction cell at 600 °C, with spectra recorded at intervals of one minute during this process.

All DFT calculations were carried out utilizing the Materials Studio and the ultrasoft method. Details were shown in the supplementary.
