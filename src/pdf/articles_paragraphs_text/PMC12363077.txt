Physically trapped patients following motor vehicle collisions are at high risk of time-critical injuries and poor outcomes. Despite this, there is limited consensus on which injuries should be prioritised and which early interventions are both necessary and feasible in the prehospital setting. This study aims to develop expert consensus on injury categorisation and the delivery of early care interventions to guide clinical and operational decision-making at the scene.

A modified Delphi method was used to gather consensus from a multidisciplinary panel of subject matter experts, including clinicians, paramedics, and members of fire and rescue services. In Round 1, participants contributed to the development of draft statements relating to injury time sensitivity, intervention prioritisation, and responder roles. In Rounds 2 and 3, participants rated their level of agreement with these refined statements. A final face-to-face consensus meeting was held to discuss statements that had not yet reached consensus, explore areas of disagreement, and conduct further voting where appropriate. Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement.

Consensus was achieved on 45 statements across the domains of injury categorisation, time-critical interventions, and multi-agency responsibilities. Participants strongly endorsed the early delivery of analgesia, tranexamic acid, and protection from environmental stressors, regardless of provider background, provided that appropriate training and governance are in place. There was broad support for expanding the scope of practice of non-clinical responders to meet urgent patient needs.

This Delphi consensus provides a framework for prioritising early interventions in the care of trapped patients. It supports a patient-centred, capability-based approach to prehospital care, emphasising feasibility, urgency, and ethical responsibility. Findings should inform the development of standard operating procedures, triage tools, and training frameworks across emergency services, with further research needed to validate assessment heuristics and address barriers to implementation.

Motor vehicle collisions remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide [1]. Approximately 11% of casualties will be physically trapped following a collision, resulting in delayed access to definitive care and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [2]. Entrapment prolongs scene times, complicates clinical intervention, and is associated with worse outcomes compared to non-trapped patients [2]. Although recent work has highlighted the need for patient-centred, time-sensitive extrication strategies, the clinical care of trapped patients remains underdeveloped [3]. Specifically, there is limited consensus on which injuries require immediate intervention during entrapment, which interventions are appropriate or feasible to deliver before extrication, and how to prioritise care in the challenging operational environment of the trapped patient [4].

Clinical decision-making during entrapment presents complex challenges. Rescuers and clinicians must carefully weigh the potential benefits of delivering interventions in the vehicle against the harms associated with prolonged entrapment [2]. Interventions that are valuable in conventional prehospital care may carry heightened risks when attempted in confined, unstable, and hazardous environments; confined space environments create logistical and technical challenges including limited patient access, restricted movement, and reduced visibility [5]. In such environments, providers face substantial cognitive load, and the need to manage multiple competing priorities can critically exceed the limits of working memory [6]. Delivering interventions may delay extrication, compounding physiological deterioration, while failure to intervene risks preventable deterioration from time-sensitive injuries [7,8]. In the absence of clear, structured guidance, these decisions often fall to individual judgement, leading to variability in practice and cognitive overload in already stressful situations [6]. Research demonstrates that standardised protocols can improve outcomes and reduce practice variation in emergency care settings [9]. Standardised expert guidance is urgently needed to support consistent, informed decision-making in the care of trapped patients, enabling responders to optimise outcomes while minimising harm.

Traditional research methodologies, such as randomised controlled trials, are ill-suited to address these challenges. The heterogeneity of injury patterns, intervention feasibility, responder training, and entrapment environments make controlled studies logistically and ethically difficult. In contrast, consensus-based methodologies, such as Delphi studies, are specifically designed to generate structured guidance in areas of clinical complexity and uncertainty [10]. The Delphi approach enables systematic collection and refinement of expert opinion, balancing diverse perspectives to create practical recommendations where empirical data are limited or unavailable [10]. For problems characterised by operational variation and clinical nuance — such as the care of trapped trauma patients — the Delphi method is a robust and appropriate tool for developing actionable consensus.

This study employed a two-stage process: a three-round Delphi study followed by a consensus meeting. The Delphi study aimed to achieve expert consensus on two domains: (1) the categorisation of injuries encountered in trapped patients as time-critical or time-dependent, and (2) the prioritisation of clinical interventions deliverable during entrapment. The subsequent consensus meeting addressed areas where Delphi consensus had not been achieved and explored a third domain: (3) strategies for ensuring equitable delivery of time-sensitive interventions, including the potential roles of non-clinical responders. This study complements and extends prior consensus work on extrication strategy, together forming a broader framework for improving the care of trapped casualties following motor vehicle collisions [4].

The aims of this study are to support clinicians and operational responders in making critical early decisions, inform future training and operational guidance, and provide a foundation for policymakers to develop standardised, equitable systems of care for trapped trauma patients.

This study was designed, conducted, and reported in accordance with the Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies (CREDES) framework [11]. A three-round modified Delphi process was conducted, followed by a structured consensus meeting to address areas of ambiguity and extend recommendations beyond the scope of the Delphi rounds.

A multi-professional steering group was established prior to study initiation. Members were purposively selected based on recognised subject expertise in extrication, fire and rescue, prehospital care, emergency medicine, intensive care, psychology, and patient and public involvement. The steering group provided methodological oversight, contributed to the development and refinement of statements, and ensured the clinical, operational, and ethical relevance of the study. Steering group members did not participate in the Delphi panel itself.

Key stakeholder organisations involved in the care of trapped patients in the United Kingdom were identified and invited to nominate subject matter experts (SMEs) for participation. These included the IMPACT Ambassadors Network, the United Kingdom Rescue Organisation (UKRO), the National HEMS Research & Audit Forum (NHRAF), and the Faculty of Pre-Hospital Care (FPHC).

Nominees were required to have a minimum of five years of operational experience in extrication, prehospital, or trauma care.

Patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives were not included as Delphi participants due to the technical nature of the statements. However, PPI contributors were involved in study design through participation in the steering group.

Round 1: SMEs were presented with a series of preliminary statements derived from a previously published literature review and steering group input [4]. Participants were asked to provide qualitative feedback, suggest modifications, and propose new statements to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive dataset reflecting real-world operational experience. Participants were able to opt out of individual questions and were not required to provide feedback on every item.

Round 2: Revised statements, incorporating feedback from Round 1, were redistributed. Participants were asked to agree or disagree with each statement using a 5-point Likert scale. They could opt out of statements if they felt the topic was outside their professional expertise.

Round 3: Statements remaining unresolved after Round 2 were further refined and redistributed for final rating.

Consensus was predefined as ≥ 70% agreement or disagreement among responding SMEs, excluding those who opted out of a given statement [10]. Free-text feedback was encouraged in all rounds to support iterative refinement. Each statement invited participants to provide comments, suggest revisions, or propose new topics. This qualitative input directly informed the revision of unresolved statements, ensuring that subsequent versions better reflected the perspectives of the SMEs. Statements that reached consensus were removed from future rounds, while those without consensus were revised and redistributed. Where participants proposed new areas of focus, additional statements were generated and included in subsequent rounds. All new and revised statements were reviewed and approved by the steering group prior to redistribution. SMEs who did not complete a round were not eligible to participate in later rounds.

Following the Delphi rounds, a structured consensus meeting was convened to further refine and finalise the findings. All original Delphi SMEs were invited to participate, alongside members of the IMPACT Centre for Post-Collision Research, Innovation and Translation’s expert ambassador network.

The consensus meeting was held in person during an international trauma care conference (Trauma Care, UK, March 2025), and additional attendees with a professional interest in post-collision care were invited to contribute. Participants included clinicians, prehospital care providers, fire and rescue personnel, and researchers.

In addition to structured voting, the consensus meeting included real-time, facilitated discussions led by members of the steering group. These discussions enabled participants to interpret and contextualise unresolved Delphi statements, explore operational and ethical considerations, and propose new formulations where appropriate. Interpretation was conducted in real time during the meeting rather than through formal qualitative analysis. New statements were developed through this structured discussion and were immediately subjected to voting. Notes were captured contemporaneously by the study team to document key points and areas of agreement; however, no formal thematic or content analysis was undertaken. This approach allowed the group to refine concepts and reach consensus efficiently while maintaining transparency and participant engagement.

Progression and generation of statements through the study is summarised in Fig.1.

A total of 70 SMEs were invited to participate, of whom 66 engaged with the process and 60 completed all three Delphi rounds. The panel included prehospital physicians, paramedics, fire and rescue service personnel, and other trauma or rescue specialists, providing a broad multidisciplinary perspective.

Rounds 1–3 were conducted in January to March 2025 with the consensus meeting held on the 11th March 2025. The background and experience of SMEs are summarised in Table1.

A time-dependent condition is any injury or illness where when treatment is delayed this leads to worse patient outcomes.

A time-critical condition is any injury or illness where there is an immediate threat to life or significant morbidity, requiring immediate intervention to improve outcomes.

Routine (Standard Practice) – These interventions are considered essential and should be applied whenever clinically indicated. They are commonly performed in most entrapment situations prior to extrication.

Context-Dependent – These interventions are not universally required but may be appropriate depending on specific patient / situation / extrication complexities. Their use should be guided by the situation, available resources, and responder skill level.

Rare or Never – These interventions are exceptional measures.

Statements that reached consensus during the formal consensus meeting are also indicated. Summary statements are included in the table - with full statements which include examples of application in the Supplementary materials.

During the consensus meeting, real-time, structured discussions were facilitated by members of the steering group following the presentation of Delphi results. These discussions enabled participants to interpret unresolved statements, explore their operational relevance, and propose alternative formulations where appropriate. One key topic was the provision of analgesia. Participants agreed that timely access to effective analgesia is a fundamental component of trauma care, but felt that the previous Delphi framing—based on specific routes of administration (e.g. intravenous, intranasal, inhaled)—introduced unnecessary complexity. Rather than re-voting on individual routes, participants proposed a new, simplified formulation focused on the safe and feasible delivery of analgesia by any available means. This revised statement was immediately voted on using the established consensus threshold and is reported in Table3.

Beyond analgesia, participants broadened the scope of the discussion to emphasise that interventions identified during the study should not be restricted to physically trapped patients alone. Although entrapment framed the original study focus, it was strongly felt that patients with similar injury patterns or time-sensitive needs—regardless of their entrapment status—should benefit from the same principles of early and equitable care. This led to additional voting on the systems and delivery mechanisms required to make routine interventions more widely accessible, as summarised in Table4.

This Delphi consensus study identified and categorised time-sensitive injuries and interventions relevant to the care of patients physically trapped following motor vehicle collisions. Through iterative survey rounds and a final consensus meeting, SMEs reached agreement on key principles guiding injury classification and intervention. Notably, there was strong agreement that certain clinical interventions—including administration of analgesia, tranexamic acid (TXA), and protection from environmental stressors—are essential and should be considered routine. These interventions were seen as both feasible and ethically necessary to be delivered as early as possible following road injury; including by trained non-clinical personnel such as police or fire and rescue services.

The study used a rigorous Delphi methodology, including diverse SME’s across emergency medicine, pre-hospital care, fire and rescue services, and paramedicine. Anonymised feedback, iterative voting, and a facilitated consensus meeting provides a robust framework to generate and refine statements, and to support convergence towards agreement.

However, there are limitations; some stakeholder groups were underrepresented, particularly patients and public contributors, who may have provided important insights into acceptability, ethics, and risk tolerance. Additionally, while Delphi processes are well-suited for complex or poorly evidenced topics, they are inherently consensus-driven and may fail to resolve deeply held differences in perspective or practice [10]. Furthermore, consensus meetings may be more likely to attract individuals who are already supportive of change, potentially skewing the discussion towards more progressive or interventionist positions and limiting the diversity of viewpoints. Several statements did not reach consensus, reflecting ongoing uncertainty or variability in operational capacity and governance frameworks. For categorising statements, definitions such as ‘respiratory failure’ or ‘physiological deterioration’ are not strictly defined and may be open to subjective interpretation leading to a lack of reproducibility.

The defining of “time critical” or “time dependent” interventions based on a specific diagnosis of injury (e.g. tension pneumothorax) may be overly complicated. Accurate clinical assessment to allow the diagnosis of specific injuries is known to be challenging in rescue environments, especially where there is limited access to the patient’s anatomy, safety considerations, and distractions including noise from cutting equipment. Clinical examination performed by experienced prehospital providers only has a moderate ability to correctly identify injuries, and responders without extensive medical training or exposure to trauma patients are even less likely to accurately diagnose these conditions [12–14]. This reinforces the need for pragmatic approaches to decision-making and the development of simple, recognisable heuristics and associated interventions —such as decreased level of consciousness or inability to speak in full sentences —to help identify patients in need of urgent care.

There is a growing body of literature recognising the challenges of delivering early, equitable care to trapped patients. Research demonstrates that women are significantly less likely to receive tranexamic acid treatment across all injury severity levels and baseline bleeding risk categories, despite equivalent clinical benefit, highlighting systemic inequities in trauma care delivery [15]. Similarly, sex-disaggregated analysis reveals that female patients are more frequently trapped than males (15.8% vs. 9.4%) and sustain different injury patterns, yet receive less aggressive treatment approaches [16]. These studies collectively demonstrate that current trauma care systems fail to deliver equitable treatment to all patient groups, particularly highlighting disparities affecting women and older patients. This study adds to existing literature by providing a structured, multi-agency view of which interventions should be prioritised and who might be empowered to deliver them, directly addressing the care delivery inequities identified in previous research. Interventions classified as routine included airway manoeuvres and basic adjuncts, oxygen administration, control of haemorrhage, analgesia and TXA. The prioritisation of analgesia and TXA aligns with previous research demonstrating their mortality benefit across patient populations, and importantly, our consensus supports making these interventions available regardless of provider background [17]. This finding underscores a collective willingness to re-evaluate traditional role boundaries and expand treatment access—a critical step toward addressing the systemic inequities documented in trapped patient care. The consensus approach of empowering non-clinical responders to deliver time-critical interventions, offers a potential solution to the access disparities that disproportionately affect vulnerable patient populations identified in the literature.

This study provides foundational consensus on priorities for early intervention during entrapment, offering guiding principles on which future clinical frameworks and operational guidance may be built. These principles can support the development of standard operating procedures, inform multi-agency training, and guide future policy. Most significantly, the findings provide a cross-disciplinary mandate to explore the safe extension of specific clinical responsibilities—such as delivery of analgesia or TXA—to appropriately trained non-clinical personnel, under suitable governance.

There are clear implications for the design of future trauma systems. Interventions should not be limited by provider role or professional boundary, but by the feasibility, safety, and impact of delivery in the pre-hospital phase. This supports the development of interoperable trauma care models that empower all responders to contribute to early stabilisation and symptom relief. Importantly, this study also suggests that principles developed for physically trapped patients should be extended to all seriously injured road users, given the similarity in their clinical needs and the urgency of care.

To realise the translational potential of these findings, targeted dissemination across all involved sectors is essential. The involvement of multiple agencies—each with distinct training structures, regulatory frameworks, and operational mandates—requires tailored approaches to education, guideline development, and policy translation. These findings will support the creation of role-specific guidance and underpin updates to joint operational procedures. Additionally, plain-language materials are needed to ensure accessibility for non-clinical responders, including fire and rescue personnel, who may assume new responsibilities as a result of this work.

Several questions remain. First, there is a need for better data linking specific injury patterns to outcomes in trapped patients, to refine our understanding of which conditions are genuinely time-critical and what impact early intervention may have. Second, although this study identified priority interventions, it remains unclear how best to train, equip, fund and govern non-clinical personnel to deliver them safely and consistently. Legislative frameworks—such as the Human Medicines Regulations (UK)—would need to be reconsidered. The potential role of novel technologies, app-based resources, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) should also be explored to support the delivery of these treatments and new models of care.

Finally, further research is required to validate simple heuristics or triage tools that can be reliably used by both clinicians and non-clinicians to identify critical injuries and associated interventions in the context of entrapment. These should be evaluated not only for accuracy but also for usability in high-stress, resource-constrained environments. This will be essential to underpin future decision support tools, frameworks, and training programmes aimed at improving outcomes for entrapped and seriously injured road users alike.

This Delphi consensus study provides a framework for prioritising time-sensitive interventions in the care of physically trapped patients. The findings challenge traditional role boundaries and support capability-based models that emphasise timely intervention, feasibility and patient need. Future efforts should validate simple heuristics, develop interoperable training and governance structures, and refine triage tools suitable for complex rescue environments. Aligning practice with these consensus-informed priorities offers real potential to improve outcomes for both trapped patients and the wider population of seriously injured road users.
