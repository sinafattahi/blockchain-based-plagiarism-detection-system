To assess the effectiveness of fractionated Gamma Knife radiosurgery (fGKS) as a primary treatment for newly diagnosed large (> 10 cm3) brain metastases.

Ninety-three patients with newly diagnosed large brain metastases, comprising 99 lesions, who underwent fGKS were included in this retrospective study. Tumor and edema volumes were measured using follow-up magnetic resonance imaging for longitudinal analysis. Local or distant progression-free survival (PFS) rate in the brain, and overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed. Cox regression analysis was used to assess prognostic factors for local progression. Radiation toxicity was evaluated based on RTOG CNS toxicity grades.

Median local PFS was 15.5 months, distant PFS was 13.2 months, overall PFS was 8.2 months, and OS was 15.2 months. Both tumor and edema volumes were significantly reduced by 78% and 82%, respectively, over 6–9 months after fGKS. Tumor volume decreased by ≥ 50% in 80.8% (n = 80) of lesions, with a median maximal reduction time of 3.3 months. Radiation necrosis occurred in 5.4% (n = 5) of patients. Within 6 months after fGKS, 45 patients showed neurological improvement, 36 remained stable, and 12 experienced neurological worsening. Systemic therapy was a significant prognostic factor for local PFS.

fGKS could be recommended as an effective and safe primary treatment for large brain metastases.

Several papers of fractionated SRS for large brain metastases showed local control rate and rate of radiation necrosis. The local control rate at 1 year was around 60–100% and the rate of radiation necrosis was 0–15.8%.9,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21Among these papers, studies utilizing Gamma Knife modality for large brain metastases were rare.17Furthermore, most studies have included heterogeneous patient groups such as post-operative, post-radiosurgery, or post-radiotherapy groups, leading to difficulties in analysis.

In this context, this study aimed to analyze treatment outcomes of fractionated Gamma Knife radiosurgery (fGKS) for 99 newly diagnosed large brain metastases in 93 patients who were initially treated with radiosurgery instead of microsurgery to assess the effectiveness and safety of fGKS as a primary treatment for large (> 10 cm3) brain metastases.

Since 2012, four neurosurgeons have performed fGKS for large brain metastases, except in cases requiring urgent decompression surgery. After explaining the pros and cons of microsurgery and GKS, patients who consented to undergo GKS were proceeded with fGKS.

Inclusion criteria were 1) newly diagnosed large (> 10 cm3) brain metastases without prior treatment; 2) histologically confirmed primary cancer; 3) at least one follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after fGKS; 4) available follow-up data on systemic treatment. Patients with extracranial metastases were excluded.

A total of 258 patients with tumor volumes > 10 cm3underwent fGKS, of which 93 patients with 99 large brain metastases met the inclusion criteria. Clinical profiles are shown inTable 1.

Radiosurgery was performed using either the Leksell Gamma Knife Model PERFEXION™ or ICON™ (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Since the introduction of the Gamma Knife ICON™ in 2016, most patients underwent mask-based fGKS, while those difficult to immobilize were received frame-fixed fGKS. For frame-fixed fGKS, patients were required to maintain frame fixation throughout the entire session.

The target volume was delineated using the 50% isodose line to encompass the tumor margin, with thin-slice gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI and the Leksell GammaPlan software (Elekta Instrument AB). Fractionation doses and schedules were tailored based on tumor size and location.

Total doses were calculated as BED using an α/β ratio of 10 to analyze dose-related responses.22Details of all fractionation schedules are provided inSupplementary Table 1.

For volume measurement, we utilized the 3D Slicer software version 4.10.2 (Surgical Planning Laboratory, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA). A total of 598 MRIs, including initial and follow-up T1-weighted enhanced thin-slice images and T2-weighted images, were analyzed. The region of interest was manually defined, and the “Grow from seed” function in 3D Slicer was used for automatic segmentation. This automated segmentation method provided more accurate volume outlining than manual outlining.23Afterward, manual revision was conducted to calculate tumor and edema volumes.

The primary endpoints were local and distant progression-free survival (PFS) in the brain as well as overall survival (OS). Local progression was defined as cases requiring secondary intervention or a continuous volume increase of more than 25% without any reduction after fGKS, excluding cases of radiation necrosis. Even though no standardized volume-based criteria have been established, we adopted the 25% threshold to align with previous studies from our institution.8,15Distant progression was defined as development of new lesions or leptomeningeal seeding. OS was calculated using death data from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

Secondary endpoints were longitudinal changes in tumor and edema volume at 3-month intervals over two years, radiation toxicity, and clinical outcomes. Volume change was expressed as a ratio relative to the initial volume at fGKS. Cases with an initial edema volume of 0 were excluded to avoid ratio distortion. Perilesional edema was categorized as mild to moderate (less than half of the hemisphere) or severe (more than half). Edema volumes over 80 cm3were defined as severe.

Radiation toxicity was assessed using the RTOG CNS toxicity grade24: grade I (mild), grade II (moderate), grade III (severe, requiring admission), grade IV (life-threatening, including radiation necrosis), and grade V (death).

Radiation necrosis was identified based on increased tumor and edema volume, central necrosis, T1/T2 mismatch,16and spontaneous regression on follow-up MRIs. In some cases, C-11 methionine PET was used to distinguish between true progression and radiation necrosis. If the fGKS lesion underwent microsurgery resulting in pathological evidence of necrosis without tumor, it was also considered radiation necrosis.

Clinical outcomes were assessed within six months post-fGKS. Symptom changes were categorized as improved, stable, or worsened, with any new symptoms classified as worsened.

After fGKS, patients were advised to undergo follow-up MRI every 1–3 months. If severe edema persisted or symptoms worsened, short-term steroid therapy was given, and further treatment was based on clinical symptoms and imaging.

When a lesion appeared larger on follow-up MRI, additional scans were scheduled to distinguish tumor progression from radiation necrosis. For cases identified as tumor progression, secondary interventions such as repeat fGKS, microsurgery or Ommaya insertion were performed. In cases where MRI findings suggested radiation necrosis, observation and additional follow-up MRI were recommended. If there was progression of distant lesions or leptomeningeal seeding, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) was considered.

When plotting the spaghetti plot of tumor volume changes, lesions showing progression were plotted until the time of secondary intervention, including repeat fGKS, microsurgery, Ommaya insertion, or WBRT. If a lesion had not undergone secondary intervention, data were shown up to the last follow-up MRI.

Kaplan-Meier survival plots estimated local PFS, distant PFS, overall PFS and OS. For patients with multiple large lesions, when plotting local PFS, any lesion progression resulted in inclusion in the progression group. For overall PFS plotting, in patients showing both local and distant progression, the earliest event was chosen for plotting. The PFS period was defined from initial fGKS to the last follow-up MRI or the time of secondary intervention and for OS, from fGKS to the last clinical follow-up or the date of death.

Factors withP< 0.2 from univariate Cox regression analysis were selected for multivariate Cox regression, with factors havingP< 0.05 considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using R version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. 1908-006-1051). Due to the retrospective nature of this study, the requirement for written informed consent was waived by the IRB.

Fig. 1Adisplays a spaghetti plot illustrating the ratio of tumor volume change for all lesions from the time of fGKS until the last MRIs or secondary interventions. Mean radiological follow-up duration forFig. 1Awas 13.9 months.Fig. 1Bshows 5 lesions where the volume consistently exceeded 125% without any decrease after fGKS. Among these, three cases with volume increase due to radiation necrosis, one case with volume increase caused by tumor bleeding (Supplementary Fig. 1), and one case with tumor progression despite receiving fGKS. Therefore, two cases were included in the local progression group.

PFS = progression-free survival, fGKS = fractionated Gamma Knife radiosurgery.

As secondary interventions for local tumor progression, 20 lesions underwent repeat fGKS, 10 underwent surgical resection, and one cystic lesion underwent Ommaya insertion. Pathology examination confirmed the presence of tumor in all surgically treated lesions. A total of 31 lesions received post-fGKS secondary interventions for local tumor progression at a median of 11.3 months. The total number of lesions in the local tumor progression group was 33, consisting of two that exceeded the 125% volume criterion and 31 that required secondary interventions.

There were no emergency surgeries such as external ventricular drain or craniectomy to control intracranial pressure, except for one case of tumor bleeding. Ten patients showed leptomeningeal seeding, and 24 patients developed new lesions. Consequently, intracranial distant progression occurred in 34 patients. Seventeen patients underwent WBRT due to intracranial distant progression, with a median of 8.9 months after fGKS.

Kaplan-Meier plots of local PFS, distant PFS, overall PFS and OS rates were shown inFig. 1C-F. The median value of local PFS was 15.5 months, 13.2 months for distant PFS, 8.2 months for overall PFS, 15.2 months for OS.

The local PFS rate was 89.9% at 6 months, 67.7% at 1 year and 41.5% at 2 years. The distant PFS rate was 71.1% at 6 months, 56.5% at 1 year, and 46.0% at 2 years. The overall PFS rate was 63.9% at 6 months, 41.6% at 1 year, and 18.0% at 2 years. The OS rate was 76.1% at 6 months, 57.4% at 1 year, and 37.6% at 2 years.

Tumor volumes were distributed as follows: 10–14 cm3(approximately 2.7–3 cm in diameter) for 39 (39.4%) lesions, 14–33.5 cm3(approximately 3–4 cm in diameter) for 49 (49.5%) lesions, and 33.5 cm3or larger (approximately ≥ 4 cm in diameter) for 11 (11.1%) lesions. Median tumor volume was 16.3 cm3. There were 40 (40.4%) lesions with severe edema, 50 (50.5%) lesions with mild to moderate edema, and 9 (9.1%) lesions without any edema. Median edema volume was 58.3 cm3. At the time of fGKS, the median ratio of edema to tumor volume was 3.1.

Fig. 2illustrate median volume reduction for tumor and edema over 3-month intervals, showing steady volume reduction for 6–9 months, followed by fluctuations up to 18 months and stabilization thereafter, with only stable lesions remaining.Table 2lists the maximum tumor volume reduction and corresponding time points for each lesion. Of the 99 lesions, 80 (80.8%) exhibited a maximum volume reduction of 50% or more, with a median duration of 3.3 months after GKS.

For cases where the initial edema volume was 0, two lesions showed volume increases by more than 80 cm3, although such increase was transient in one case. For other cases, the increase was observed as moderate to mild edema.Supplementary Fig. 2shows a representative case of a long-term favorable outcome after fGKS.

At the time of fGKS, symptom presentation among patients included hemiparesis (n = 28), asymptomatic (n = 21), headache (n = 11), dizziness (n = 6), gait disturbance (n = 5), visual disturbance (n = 5), dysphasia (n = 4), vomiting (n = 3), memory impairment (n = 2), seizure (n = 2), dysarthria (n = 2), disorientation (n = 2), hearing loss (n = 1), and hypesthesia (n = 1). These symptoms were improved (n = 45), stable (n = 36), or worsened (n = 12) within 6 months after fGKS.

During the follow-up period after fGKS, short-term steroid therapy was administered to 44 (46%) patients, with an average duration of 7.1 days. RTOG CNS toxicity grade was grade 0 for 62 patients, grade I for 11 patients, grade II for 10 patients, grade III for 5 patients, and grade IV for 5 patients with radiation necrosis.Fig. 3shows a representative case of radiation necrosis.

This study conducted a longitudinal analysis of tumor and edema volume changes in large brain metastases after fGKS. Following fGKS, tumor and edema volumes continuously reduced for 6–9 months, with median decreases of 78% and 82%, respectively. Tumor volume decreased by ≥ 50% in 80.8% of lesions (n = 80), with a median maximum reduction time of 3.3 months. Considering a median interval of 11.3 months for intervention due to tumor progression, it was speculated that there was a higher progression rate between 9–18 months, accompanied by fluctuations in volume reduction rate (Fig. 2A). Taking into account a median OS of 15.2 months of this cohort, it could be inferred that beyond 18 months, relatively stable lesions predominated, displaying superior volume reduction rates (Fig. 2A).

Several studies have reported clinical outcomes of microsurgery for brain metastases, with median OS ranging from 5 to 18 months.6,7,25,26,27In our study, the median OS was 15.2 months, suggesting fGKS is not inferior to surgery.

Local progression in our study reflects tumor recurrence, with tumors initially shrinking after fGKS but later increasing in size. The local progression rate (9.6% at 6 months, 30.6% at 1 year, and 55.7% at 2 years) may seem unfavorable, but recurrence rates after microsurgery are also significant. Yoo et al.28reported a one-year recurrence rate of 29.1% for microscopic total resection and 58.6% for gross total resection. Stark et al.29found a 58.9% recurrence rate after surgical resection. When comparing recurrence between surgery and SRS, the surgical group had higher early recurrence.30In this context, it is challenging to conclude that our local progression rate is inferior to that of surgical resection.

In our study, five patients (5.4%) had grade III radiation toxicity requiring admission, and five (5.4%) experienced grade IV radiation necrosis. However, none of these patients exhibited severe neurologic deficits necessitating admission. Furthermore, 87.1% of patients showed stable or improved neurologic outcomes within 6 months post-fGKS. This indicates that we can avoid the complications associated with microsurgery while achieving neurological improvement. Our findings also demonstrate that as tumor volume decreased, edema diminished, leading to better neurologic symptoms. Therefore, this study supports fGKS as a primary treatment option over microsurgery.

Patel et al.32have analyzed volume changes in 500 metastatic brain tumors after radiosurgery, showing an average volume reduction of around 50% up to 9 months, followed by a period of volume increase at 12–15 months. Similar to our study results, at the end of follow-ups, a greater increase in volume reduction was found. Additionally, Goethe et al.33have demonstrated a volume reduction of approximately 16% per month in the first 6 months after GKS, with a 64% reduction observed at the 6-month follow-up. To date, there have been no studies analyzing longitudinal volume changes of large brain metastases or edema. Collectively, these studies including our study indicate that around 60% volume reduction can be anticipated within six months.

In the past, there was much controversy regarding the efficacy of systemic therapy due to issues with blood-brain barrier penetration.34However, with the advent of next-generation systemic therapies such as tyrosine kinases inhibitor demonstrating high intracranial efficacy, such concerns have diminished.35,36Prognostic factor evaluation for local progression has also shown that in patients receiving systemic therapy alongside fGKS, local progression is suppressed, indicating the importance of continuous treatment with systemic therapy to maintain the volume reduction effect of fGKS.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and the diverse fractionation regimens used by four neurosurgeons, complicating recommendations for the most effective regimen. Additionally, irregular follow-up intervals for each patient weakened the robustness of our findings on volume changes compared to prospective studies with regular follow-ups. Furthermore, three lesions had follow-up volume ratios between 1.0 (initial volume) and 1.25 (local progression threshold) without volume reduction. If longer follow-up imaging were available, their classification might change, potentially impacting the local progression rate. Therefore, careful consideration is needed when interpreting our results on local progression.

However, to date, there has been no prospective study conducting a longitudinal analysis of volume changes in large brain metastases after SRS. We believe this study provides unique information about volume changes following fGKS.

fGKS is effective in reducing both tumor volume and edema in large brain metastases with tolerable radiation toxicity. fGKS could be considered as the primary treatment option for large brain metastases.
