While sarcopenia is associated with adverse pancreatic cancer (PC) outcomes, prospective evidence linking muscle health to PC risk remains limited. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the associations of grip strength and muscle mass with incident PC risk in the UK Biobank cohort.

Among 363,693 UK Biobank participants, grip strength (kg) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived muscle mass (weight-normalized) were measured. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, lifestyle factors, and metabolic syndrome components, assessed PC risk over a median 13.7-year follow-up.

Higher muscle mass (HR = 0.86, 95% Confidential Interval [CI]:0.78–0.95) and grip strength (HR = 0.90, 95% CI:0.83–0.98) demonstrated linear inverse associations with PC risk showing sex-specific divergence: muscle mass reduction conferred stronger protection in men (HR = 0.84, 95% CI:0.74–0.96), whereas grip strength showed greater impact in women (HR = 0.84, 95% CI:0.74–0.96). Subgroup analyses revealed that improved grip strength reduced PC risk in diabetics (HR = 0.89, 95% CI:0.80–0.99), while obese individuals benefited from both enhanced grip strength (HR = 0.95, 95% CI:0.90–0.99) and muscle mass (HR = 0.88, 95% CI:0.82–0.94). Population-attributable fraction estimates suggest 5–12% of PC cases could be prevented through muscle health interventions.

These findings highlight an association between improved physical capability and reduced PC risk, supporting the adoption of sex-specific preventive strategies—prioritizing muscle mass augmentation in men and grip strength enhancement in women, particularly in high-risk metabolic subgroups. By characterizing sarcopenia as an independent risk factor, this study underscores the imperative to integrate muscle preservation into pancreatic cancer prevention paradigms.

In recent decades, research has revealed that skeletal muscle acts not only as a movement organ but also releases bioactive molecules called myokines. These myokines influence nearby tissues (e.g., fat, liver) and distant organs (e.g., pancreas, brain) through local, regional, and systemic signaling [1]. This discovery has transformed our understanding of muscle’s role in whole-body health [2]. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that muscle-derived factors may also play a role in cancer progression [3].

Cancer-associated cachexia, a multifactorial wasting disorder characterized by involuntary muscle loss (with or without fat loss) and functional impairment, affects up to 80% of cancer patients and accounts for 20–30% of cancer-related deaths [4–7]. Among cancers, pancreatic cancer (PC) exhibits the highest prevalence of cachexia, with pathologic alterations uniquely predisposing patients to this condition [8,9]. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that cachexia or weight loss in PC correlates with significantly poorer survival across two-thirds of studies [10]. Progressive muscle wasting in these patients exacerbates treatment toxicity while reducing therapeutic tolerance and efficacy [11,12]. While cachexia and sarcopenia both involve muscle loss, they differ mechanistically: cachexia reflects systemic metabolic dysregulation driven by inflammation, whereas sarcopenia primarily denotes age- or inactivity-related muscle decline [13,14]. This distinction is critical given that low muscle mass and strength are frequently observed in PC patients [10]. However, while prior studies have primarily relied on cross-sectional designs to examine associations between sarcopenia/cachexia and PC prognosis [3,10], prospective population-based evidence linking preserved muscle mass or strength to PC risk or outcomes is lacking—a gap critical to guiding interventions. To address this gap, we leverage the UK Biobank—a prospective cohort of > 500,000 individuals with detailed medical data — to investigate the association between muscle mass/strength and PC risk. By focusing on sarcopenia through standardized physical indicators [15], this pioneering prospective analysis aims to clarify the associations between sarcopenia and PC and how muscle preservation might influence PC outcomes. Understanding the role of sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer risk may guide proactive clinical management through early detection in high-risk populations and tailored interventions to preserve muscle health, thereby reducing therapeutic resistance and improving long-term survival outcomes of PC.

The UK Biobank is an extensive prospective cohort study that recruited over 500,000 participants aged 37 to 73 between 2006 and 2010. Participants provided extensive information through touchscreen questionnaires, verbal interviews, physical measurements, biological samples, and multimodal imaging (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) [16]. Several exclusion criteria were applied. First, individuals with pre-existing pancreatic or other malignancies were excluded (n= 43,222) to establish temporal precedence (outcome-free baseline) and avoid confounding by cancer-related treatments or biology. Second, participants with incomplete covariate information were excluded to maintain the integrity of adjusted analyses (n= 86,558). Values beyond ± 2.5 SD (gender-standardized) were removed to address potential outliers, following epidemiological best practices (n= 8,531). These criteria, while streamlined in the main text for brevity, adhere to widely accepted cohort study design principles [16–18]. After these exclusions, the final analysis included 363,693 participants. Figure1visually represents these exclusion criteria.

Sarcopenia was defined according to European consensus criteria [15], incorporating both low muscle mass (gender-specific thresholds via bioelectrical impedance analysis [BIA]) and reduced grip strength. These parameters—central to sarcopenia diagnosis—were selected as physical capacity indicators. This approach aligns with operational definitions employed in prior prospective cohorts [15]. Gait speed, another metric for severe sarcopenia, was only included in a sensitivity analysis due to its self-reported nature in the UK Biobank, which limited our ability to examine nonlinear associations as reported in a previous study [18]. Grip strength was measured using the JamarJ00105hydraulic hand dynamometer, with values recorded for each hand and averaged in kilograms for analysis. Skeletal muscle mass was estimated using the Janssen equation applied to whole-body composition measurements obtained through BIA (Tanita BC418MA, Tokyo, Japan) [19]. While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard, its limited availability in the UK Biobank (n= 5,000) necessitated the use of BIA. The validity of these BIA-derived muscle mass measurements was confirmed in a subset of UK Biobank participants by comparing them to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry results, ensuring reliability and accuracy [20]. However, we acknowledge that BIA measurements can be influenced by hydration status or low-grade inflammation, which may be relevant in preclinical populations. To account for potential confounding by body size, muscle mass was normalized by body weight, ensuring comparability across individuals with varying physiques. Grip strength was recorded in absolute units, as previous studies have indicated that the link between grip strength and health outcomes remains stable whether it is presented in absolute or relative terms [20] (Fig.1).

The diagnosis of PC was carried out in two stages. Initially, PC cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes (K25.0-K25.9) from inpatient hospital records. This was followed by incorporating self-reported cancer codes obtained during verbal medical condition interviews at assessment centers. For the primary analysis, PC was defined as ICD-10 K25.0-K25.9 (Malignant neoplasm of pancreas).

The baseline age of participants was determined based on their date of birth at the time of the initial assessment. Gender information was self-reported. Deprivation levels were measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation, sourced from UK government open data [21]. Ethnicity was self-reported and classified as either White or Non-White. Participants self-reported their smoking status, which was categorized into four groups: never, former, current smokers, and ‘Prefer not to answer.’ Similarly, they reported their alcohol consumption frequency, which was divided into seven categories: daily/almost daily, 3–4 times per week, 1–2 times per week, 1–3 times per month, only on special occasions, never, and ‘Prefer not to answer’ [16].

Metabolic syndrome components (central obesity, high glycaemia/diabetes, high blood pressure/hypertension, low HDL, and high triglycerides) were defined using baseline data [22]. Central obesity criteria included a waist-to-height ratio of ≥ 0.5 for both men and women. Additionally, for men, a waist circumference of ≥ 90 cm or a waist-to-hip ratio of ≥ 0.9 was considered. For women, the criteria included a waist circumference of ≥ 80 cm or a waist-to-hip ratio of ≥ 0.85 [17]. Hypertension was characterized by a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 85 mmHg or higher, or a self-reported diagnosis by a physician [22]. Elevated triglycerides were defined as levels of 1.7 mmol/L or higher, while low HDL-cholesterol was defined as less than 1.3 mmol/L in women and less than 1.0 mmol/L in men [23,24]. Physical activity type, which participants self-reported using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form, was also included [25]. A dietary risk score (range: 0–9) was derived from baseline intake frequencies of nine food groups—with 0 indicating optimal adherence to UK dietary guidelines and 9 representing the highest risk—using methods validated in prior UK Biobank studies [26].

Baseline characteristics for grip strength and muscle mass were described using mean values with standard deviations (SDs) for quantitative variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent follow-up were employed to estimate hazard ratios, and the proportional hazards assumption was rigorously assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. To explore nonlinear associations between these physical fitness indicators and PC, restricted cubic spline functions were fitted within the Cox models [27]. Additionally, a 2-year landmark analysis was conducted, excluding participants who experienced events within the first 2 years of follow-up (n= 240) to minimize reverse causality. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated to estimate the proportion of PC cases attributable to exposure under a hypothetical causal scenario, derived from the adjusted HRs obtained from the nonlinear associations [28]. These estimates are exploratory and contingent on unproven causal assumptions.

The analysis was adjusted for confounding factors, including age, gender, deprivation, ethnicity, and individual components of metabolic syndrome (central obesity, hyperglycemia/diabetes, hypertension/elevated blood pressure, low HDL, and high triglycerides), as well as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and dietary score. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) illustrated the relationships between exposure, outcome, and covariates (Figure S2). Three sensitivity analyses were performed: (i) including individuals who developed PC within the first two years of follow-up; (ii) excluding individuals who developed PC within the first three years of follow-up; and (iii) using categorical gait speed as the exposure for the primary outcome. Finally, to determine if the associations between physical fitness indicators and PC differed across population subgroups, analyses were repeated and stratified by age (≥ and < 60 years), gender (male and female), central obesity (yes/no), and diabetes status (yes/no). The analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.0 with the “forestplot”, “survival”, and “ggplot2” packages. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Over a median follow-up of 13.7 years (inter quartile range: 13.7–15.2 years), 2,130 participants developed pancreatic cancer (Fig.1). Higher grip strength and muscle mass were associated with a 10% (HR: 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.98) and 14% (HR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.95) reduction in pancreatic cancer risk, respectively (Fig.2). Population-attributable fraction (PAF) estimates suggested that improving muscle mass and grip strength could prevent 11.86% (95% CI 5.15–18.91) and 5.26% (95% CI 0.2–10.5) of pancreatic cancer cases, respectively, assuming a causal relationship (TableS1).

The key baseline characteristics of participants’ grip strength (Table S2) and muscle mass (Table1) were analyzed. Generally, individuals with higher grip strength and muscle mass were younger, less likely to be deprived, consumed more alcohol, and engaged in more physical activities such as walking, swimming, cycling, fitness exercises, bowling, and strenuous sports. Compared to those with lower grip strength and muscle mass, they also had lower prevalence rates of central obesity, hyperglycemia/diabetes, hypertension/high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and low HDL. Notably, among individuals with lower muscle mass, the proportion of central obesity was 93.2%, compared to 53.0% with higher muscle mass (Table1).

We next examined the association between physical capability markers and PC risk. Compared to individuals with lower grip strength, those with higher grip strength had a 10% reduced risk of developing PC (95% CI 0.83–0.98) (Fig.2). A similar pattern was observed for individuals with higher muscle mass (HR: 0.86; 95% CI 0.78–0.95). Overall, each incremental unit increase in grip strength and muscle mass was associated with a 5% (95% CI 0.91–0.99) and 10% (95% CI 0.84–0.95) reduced risk of PC, respectively. Individual associations for each covariate included in these analyses are detailed in Tables S3 and S4. In a sensitivity analysis using gait speed as the exposure, individuals with average or fast gait speeds had a lower risk of developing PC compared to those reporting slow gait speeds (Table S5).

Non-linear relationships between grip strength, muscle mass, and PC risk were then investigated (Fig.3). After accounting for covariates, increased grip strength and muscle mass were linked to a reduced risk of PC (pgrip= 0.044;pmuscle< 0.001). However, no significant non-linear relationships were observed between these physical fitness indicators and PC risk (non-linearpgrip= 0.051 andpmuscle= 0.084, respectively). Similar results and trends were observed when individuals who developed PC within the first 2 years of follow-up were included (Figure S2) and when those who developed PC within the first 3 years were excluded (Figure S3).

Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate whether associations differed by sex, age, diabetes status, or central obesity—factors previously linked to both sarcopenia and pancreatic cancer pathogenesis (Table2, Table S6-S8). For instance, sex-based differences in muscle composition (e.g., androgen-driven hypertrophy in males vs. estrogen-mediated neuromuscular coordination in females) may modulate myokine secretion or metabolic interactions. Similarly, diabetes and obesity are established PC risk factors that exacerbate systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, potentially altering muscle-cancer crosstalk. Our analyses revealed no significant interactions between baseline muscle status (mass/strength) and components of metabolic syndrome, suggesting that muscle loss may represent a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer independent of metabolic dysregulation. Strikingly, we observed that higher grip strength was linked to a reduced risk of PC exclusively in women (HR: 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96), with no significant correlation in men (HR: 0.96, 95% CI 0.85–1.08) (Table2). Regarding muscle mass, it was generally associated with a lower risk of PC in both men and women (HRmale: 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97; HRfemale: 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.97). However, subgroup analysis indicated that only in males was higher muscle mass significantly associated with reduced risk of PC (HR: 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96). These findings highlight a notable gender difference in how increasing muscle mass and strength can lower the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Age stratification (< 60 or ≥ 60 years) showed that higher grip strength and muscle mass were associated with decreased PC risk in both age groups (Table S6). Subgroup analysis by diabetes status (Table S7) revealed a trend of decreased PC risk with increasing grip strength only in diabetic individuals (HR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.99). In contrast, increasing muscle mass was associated with a reduced PC risk in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals (diabetic: HR: 0.91, 95% CI 0.84–0.97; non-diabetic: HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–0.99). At the subgroup level, only non-diabetic individuals with higher muscle mass showed a reduced PC risk (HR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–0.98). When stratified by central obesity, higher grip strength and muscle mass were both associated with decreased PC risk in obese individuals (HRgrip: 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–0.99; HRmuscle: 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.94), but not in non-obese individuals (Table S8).

This research represents the first European cohort study to investigate the prospective link between grip strength, muscle mass, and PC. This large prospective study demonstrates that higher muscle mass and grip strength are associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Our results demonstrate that lower muscle mass and grip strength correlate with an elevated risk of PC, with notable differences observed across gender, diabetes status, and central obesity subgroups. These associations persisted even after adjusting for potential confounders. The connection between muscle strength, muscle quantity, and PC was largely linear. Given the prospective nature of our study and the consistency of findings using a 2-year landmark analysis, it is unlikely that the observed associations are due to reverse causation. Moreover, statistical adjustments reinforced that these associations were not simply due to confounding by individual components of metabolic syndrome, such as diabetes, high blood sugar, low HDL, high triglycerides, hypertension, and central obesity, particularly diabetes, which is frequently associated with PC. The observed gender disparity—muscle mass’s stronger association in men versus grip strength’s effect in women—may reflect androgen-mediated muscle hypertrophy enhancing myokine production in males, while estrogen’s influence on neuromuscular efficiency prioritizes functional strength in females. Similarly, grip strength’s pronounced link to PC risk reduction in diabetics may arise from its role as a surrogate for systemic insulin sensitivity, a known modulator of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Conversely, muscle mass’s protective effect in obese individuals may counteract adipose-driven inflammation via myokine-immune crosstalk. While speculative, these explanations align with mechanistic studies and highlight the need for targeted interventions [29–31].

Although the biological mechanism linking muscle loss to PC remains to be fully understood, it may involve a decrease in muscle-derived factors, such as myokines and miRNAs, which could be responsible for inter-tissue communications that can affect cancer dynamics [3]. For instance, exercise-induced myokines like irisin suppress tumor growth via AMPK-mTOR and PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathways [32,33], potentially explaining the protective effect of muscle preservation. IL-6 further supports muscle maintenance through JAK/STAT signaling [34], creating a feedback loop where preserved muscle mass sustains anti-tumor immunity. The gender-specific associations may reflect divergent hormonal pathways. In women, estrogen-mediated muscle preservation may explain the stronger protective effect of grip strength: estrogen enhances neuromuscular efficiency by upregulating type I fiber oxidative capacity [35] and potentiates IL-6 release during contraction [36], which mobilizes cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and natural killer (NK) cells [31,37]. In contrast, weaker muscle mass associations in women (vs. men) align with estrogen’s preferential lipid storage over lean mass accretion [38], reducing myokine output per muscle unit. In males, higher muscle mass may enhance secretion of tumor-suppressive myokines like SPARC, though the hormonal drivers (e.g., testosterone) of this association require further investigation [29,30]. Concurrently, testosterone’s anabolic effects elevate IGF-1—a double-edged mediator that promotes muscle protein synthesis but may paradoxically activate oncogenic PI3K/AKT pathways [39,40]. This duality might attenuate the protective effect of muscle mass despite higher absolute myokine output. These mechanisms suggest that sarcopenia exacerbates PC risk through both metabolic dysfunction and impaired myokine-mediated tumor suppression, with sex-specific pathways underscoring the need for gender-tailored interventions. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended that men prioritize increasing muscle mass, while women should focus on enhancing muscle strength. Our findings partially corroborate previous research, which demonstrated an inverse relationship between grip strength and mortality risk in older adults, with a more pronounced effect observed in women [41]. Strengthening muscular capacity appears particularly vital for the most vulnerable individuals to reduce their early mortality risk.

Obesity and diabetes, established modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer [42–44], require multidisciplinary management centered on weight control. Evidence-based strategies include diets rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and dairy, alongside physical activity to enhance insulin sensitivity [45]. Regular physical activity is also advised to maintain a healthy weight and improve insulin sensitivity. Our findings extend these approaches by demonstrating muscle health’s preventive potential: diabetic patients achieved greater risk reduction through grip strength improvement, while obese individuals benefited from combined muscle mass. Population-attributable fraction estimates (5–12%) suggest that optimizing muscle health could prevent a substantial proportion of cases, complementing dietary/exercise interventions. These results advocate personalized protocols—prioritizing strength training for diabetics and dual muscle-strength/mass regimens for obese patients—tailored to individual metabolic profiles.

Our findings align with prior cross-sectional studies linking sarcopenia to poor PC prognosis [3,10], but extend this evidence by demonstrating, for the first time in a prospective cohort, that preserved muscle mass and grip strength are associated with reduced PC risk. For instance, while cross-sectional studies [3], reported sarcopenia prevalence in 30–50% of PC patients, our results suggest that sarcopenia precedes cancer development, supporting its role as a modifiable risk factor. Our observation that higher muscle mass reduces PC risk in men mirrors preclinical data showing androgen-dependent myokines like SPARC inhibit tumor growth [29,30], whereas the female-specific protective effect of grip strength parallels cohort studies linking neuromuscular health to cancer immunity [42]. Discrepancies with null findings in smaller cohorts may stem from our large sample size, rigorous adjustment for metabolic confounders, and sex-stratified analyses.

Our study robustly links muscle health to PC risk reduction, yet certain limitations require careful interpretation. First, while our 2-year landmark analysis addressed reverse causation, preclinical PC might still influence muscle metrics prior to clinical detection. Nevertheless, the consistent associations observed in sensitivity analyses excluding cases within 3 years (Figure S3)—coupled with linear dose-response relationships (Fig.3)—support muscle loss as a precursor rather than consequence of PC. Second, despite comprehensive adjustments, residual confounding by unmeasured factors (e.g., chronic inflammation markers like C-reactive protein/IL-6 or genetic predispositions such as KRAS mutations) remains plausible. For instance, systemic inflammation could concurrently drive muscle wasting and tumorigenesis, introducing bidirectional bias. Similarly, genetic variants affecting myokine regulation might confound muscle-cancer associations. Though sensitivity analyses suggest robustness to such confounding, future studies are essential to clarify causality. Third, selection bias may arise from the UK Biobank’s healthier-than-general population, potentially attenuating risk estimates. However, the cohort’s large size and long follow-up strengthen confidence in the validity of our findings. Fourth, although we did not distinguish between different types of pancreatic cancer, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) representing 90% of cases and other types like pancreatic endocrine tumors and pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma accounting for smaller proportions, this focus on PDAC is justified. Fifth, the cohort’s European ancestry (90.5% White) and age profile (mean 57 years) limit generalizability; however, this aligns with PC epidemiology, as 90% of cases occur post-55 years, ensuring adequate case ascertainment. Generalizability to non-European populations warrants further study. Methodologically, gait speed—a recognized sarcopenia marker—was analyzed only as a categorical variable (slow/average/fast) due to lack of continuous data, possibly reducing sensitivity [16]. Finally, while few prospective studies have investigated the association between these exposures and pancreatic cancer, the observational design of our study prevented us from inferring causality, necessitating future trials to explore the potential causal link between physical capability markers and PC.

In conclusion, our study underscores the importance of muscle health in pancreatic cancer prevention. Public health initiatives should embrace sex-specific strategies: training regimens for men to optimize muscle mass and targeted training for women to amplify grip strength. For diabetic populations, integrating strength training into standard care protocols may synergistically improve metabolic control and reduce oncologic risk, as evidenced by the pronounced protective association in this subgroup. Mechanistically, prioritizing translational studies on muscle-secreted factors like SPARC and irisin could unlock novel therapeutic avenues, while randomized trials testing androgen-modulating exercise programs in men or estrogen-enhanced neuromuscular interventions in women are warranted to validate causality. Given the rising global burden of pancreatic cancer and the dose-dependent relationships observed, population-wide interventions to preserve muscle integrity could serve as a cornerstone of preventive oncology.
