High-flow nasal cannula is widespread in patients with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, but physiological data concerning influence of the combination of breathing pattern, preset flow rate (PFR), and inspiratory oxygen fraction (FDO2) on end-expiratory pressure (EEP), capnogram, oxygram, and exhaled tidal volume (VTe) remains insufficient.

The study included 20 healthy subjects with 12 combinations of PFR (30–60-80 L/min) and FDO2(40–60-80–100%) multiplied by 4 breathing patterns: mouth closed (CM), mouth open (OM), and combination of the CM and OM with hyperpnea (HCM and HOM). Pressure, capnogram, oxygram were measured from hypopharyngeal catheter, VTe, and subject’s comfort were assessed.

Inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) were close to FDO2at the PFR of 30 L/min (CM), and 60 L/min (HCM). FiO2during the OM and HOM were much less than FDO2, variable and unpredictable. PFR of 60 L/min was sufficient to keep FiO2close to FDO2during the CM and HCM. End-expiratory carbon dioxide (FECO2) decreased with an increase in the PFR and FDO2, reaching 1.4 (1.1–1.7)% at FDO2100% and PFR of 80 L/min. EEP had grown a lot with the PFR increase and were highly variable reaching 11.1 (7.7–14.8) cmH2O at the PFR of 80 L/min. VTe at the PFR of 60 and 80 L/min were 948.0 (715.0–1204.8) and 948.0 (869.0–1422.0) ml, respectively. PFR of 60 L/min and 80 L/min were associated with discomfort.

HCM, OM, and HOM in healthy subjects decreased FiO2and FECO2(more pronounced during OM and HOM). HFNC within the CM and HCM provided flow-dependent CPAP-effects over a wide range and could be associated with lung hyperinflation. An excessive PFR led to discomfort.

A high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a promising tool for patients with respiratory failure that uses a combination of a continuously blended flow of air and oxygen delivered through a nasal cannula at preset flow rates close to or higher than the patient’s mean inspiratory flow [1]. Flow from the HFNC device is warmed and humidified according to physiological levels inside the trachea, bronchi, and even alveoli [2]. HFNCs are currently widely used for patients with hypoxemic and hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF), including severe pneumonia, COVID-19, and COPD [3,4]. The physiological effects of the HFNC are realized through more accurate inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) titration [5–7], improved carbon dioxide (CO2) clearance [8–10], an elevated expiratory pressure (EEP) with an increase in the end-expiratory lung volume [11,12], and better tolerance than noninvasive ventilation (NIV) [13].

Despite these effects and the clinical data concerning the efficacy of HFNCs, real O2and CO2fractions and end-expiratory pressure (EEP) close to the trachea are not well established, nor are data on the influence of different breathing patterns on these values [3,4]. Changes in gas composition, expiratory pressure, and inspiratory/expiratory time with changes in breathing patterns could be of utmost importance because of their influences on the clinical efficacy and local or general side effects of HFNC therapy. For example, an increase in a subject’s minute ventilation from normal to 20 L/min during low-flow oxygen therapy through a facial mask (or nasal cannula) may decrease the FiO2from 100 to almost 30%, thus greatly reducing the usefulness of oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemia [14,15].

Optimal combinations of the preset flow rate and preset oxygen fraction (FDO2) in patients with different breathing patterns are urgently needed to improve clinical efficacy and decrease the possible side effects of HFNCs. We performed our study to clarify these important points using simultaneous pressure, respiratory gases close to the trachea (in the hypopharynx), and tidal volume measurements in healthy volunteers with different breathing patterns.

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (reference number: 25–23, date of approval 14/12/2023) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06189716). Written informed consent was obtained from all healthy volunteers enrolled in the study.

We recruited healthy volunteers (students, residents, and anaesthesiologists from Sechenov University) through oral advertisements and announcements in local social networks. The participants were not compensated. We recruited only nonsmokers or mild smokers (smoking index < 200, where the smoking index = cigarettes per day * years of smoking). Volunteers fasted for no less than 3 h before the study.

Volunteers were seated in a chair. We applied topical anaesthesia with a lidocaine spray in both nostrils, on the surface of the tongue, and the pharynx. After two minutes, a lubricated multiperforated 8 French catheter was inserted into the hypopharynx through a nostril until the tip of the catheter was below the root of the tongue. The appropriate position of the catheter was checked by visual inspection throughout the study (after each step). Before all the measurements, the volunteers remained seated for 5 min to calm their breathing. At baseline, we recorded the atmospheric pressure from the local weather station and measured peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), the inspiratory and expiratory fractions of oxygen (FiO2and FeO2, respectively), the end-tidal carbon dioxide fraction (FeCO2), the respiratory rate (RR), and the inspiratory and expiratory times (Ti and Te, respectively) using a side-stream multigas analyser (MPR6‒03 monitor, Treaton Electronics, Russia), the expired tidal volume (VTe) using an expiratory flow sensor of the ventilator through a mouthpiece (Savina Select E, Drager, Germany), and the EEP using a pressure transducer (AICU Vision, Bark Technology, Kazakhstan). Data on oximetry, capnography, Ti, and Te were analysed using dedicated software (SideStream Capno, Treaton Electronics, Russia). All measurements were recorded within the stable respiratory pattern viewed on capnography. The catheter was flushed with air on demand. Additionally, we recorded patient comfort using a visual analogue scale (from 1 to 10, where 10 meant full comfort) and asked the subjects to describe their sensations throughout the study period.

After the initial measurements, we established a high-flow oxygen device through a nasal cannula (Hifent HUMID-BH, RespirCare Medical Solutions, China) at a flow rate of 30 L/min and a preset oxygen fraction (FDO2) of 40%. Cannula sizes were selected according to the manufacturer’s manual (5 mm diameter for all subjects). We performed 12 series of measurements with preset flow rates (PFR) of 30, 60, and 80 L/min combined with preset FDO2values of 40, 60, 80, and 100% at each flow rate. In each series, we asked the subjects to breathe in four different respiratory patterns: quiet breathing with a closed mouth (CM), quiet breathing with an open mouth (OM), hyperpnea with a closed mouth (HCM), and hyperpnea with an open mouth (HOM). For the hyperpnea series, the subjects were asked to breathe approximately two times deeper (subjects were trained with a volumetric assessment) at a rate of 30 breaths per minute, and the RR in these series was controlled with a multigas monitor. For the open mouth series (OM and HOM), the volunteers were asked to breathe through the mouth. We performed all measurements the same as in the baseline period at each series combined with each respiratory pattern (48 steps total), except VTe during OM and HOM (unable to perform the correct VTe measurements). All the measurements were recorded after 2 min of the current step. The wash-out period between each step was approximately 2 min. The total duration of the measurements for a subject was approximately 4 h. We also assessed oxygram and capnogram waveforms during all steps of the study. Additionally, after completing all the measurements, the volunteers were asked to describe their feelings in their own words. We calculated the modified ventilatory ratio (mVR) at the end of the CM and HCM steps with the following equation: mVR = [RR * VTe * (PetCO2(mmHg)—4 mmHg)]/[predicted body weight (kg) * 100 (ml/kg/min) * 37.5 mmHg]. We calculated the mean volunteer flow by dividing VTe by Ti at the end of each step for CM and HCM with the assumption that VTe was close to the inspired tidal volume. The mean subject flow was compared with the preset flow rate and VAS comfort score at all steps.

Given the physiological design of the study, we did not perform a formal sample size calculation. We used a sample size of 10 patients for this study, in accordance with previous investigations on this topic [11]. Descriptive statistics included proportions for categorical variables and medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables. No imputation was performed for missing data. Comparisons between steps were performed using the Friedman test for continuous variables and the Cochran’s Q test for binary values. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were made using the Friedman test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (to reduce type I errors). A two-sidedp< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

We included 20 healthy volunteers (aged 24 (22–36) years, 11 men, height of 176 (167–181) cm, weight of 76.5 (66.0–85.0) kg, body mass index of 25.6 (21.2–28.5) kg/m2, two mild smokers). One volunteer refused to continue the study at a PFR of 80 L/min because of severe discomfort but completed all steps with PFR of 30 and 60 L/min (36 steps).

An increase in the PFR from 30 to 80 L/min during all phases led to a significant increase in FiO2(p< 0.05 for all comparisons). During the CM phase, PFR of 60 and 80 L/min provided the preset FDO2; at the PFR of 30 L/min, the FiO2was close to 100%. An increase in the PFR from 30 to 80 L/min in the OM phase increased the median FiO2to 97.8%, but with a wide interquartile range (IQR) (39.4–100.0%), an increase in the PFR from 30 to 60 L/min in the OM phase had a similar effect. During the HCM phase, an increase in the PFR from 30 to 60 and to 80 L/min provided an FiO2close to 100%. During the HOM pattern, only an increase from the PFR from 30 to 80 L/min led to a significant increase in FiO2, but it had a wide range of FiO2values and never reached the preset level of FDO2. OM and HOM patterns provided less FiO2than CM and HCM patterns, respectively, with very wide IQRs (Fig.1, Table1).

We discovered a variety of “abnormal” oxygram waveforms during the OM, HCM, and HOM patterns: inverted (almost copying the capnogram shape), flat (without prominent inspiratory and expiratory phases), and combined (combination of inverted and flat) (Fig.2). The prevalence of abnormal oxygrams was zero during CM breathing and very common during HCM, HOM, and OM breathing (less common than during HCM and HOM breathing) at all PFR (Table1). An increase in the PFR did not affect the oxygram waveform (Table1).

The initial FeCO2was 4.7 (4.3–5.3)%. The initiation of HFNC therapy resulted in a significant decrease in FeCO2(p< 0.001). An increase in the PFR from 30 to 80 L/min resulted in a significant decrease in FeCO2during all breathing patterns (p< 0.01 between all comparisons). Compared with the CM pattern, the OM pattern significantly decreased the FeCO2level; compared with the CM pattern, the HCM pattern decreased the FeCO2level; and compared with the HCM pattern, the HOM pattern decreased the FeCO2level (Fig.3, Table1).

An increase in the PFR to 30, 60 and 80 L/min during the CM pattern resulted in a significant increase in the EEP: 3.8 (3.1–6.6) mbar), 7.6 (6.4–11.4) mbar, and 11.1 (7.7–14.8) mbar, respectively (p< 0.001 for all comparisons). A change in the breathing mode to OM significantly decreased the EEP, and an increase in the PFR did not influence the EEP during OM (Fig.4A and B, Table1). A change in the breathing mode from CM to HCM resulted in an increase in the EEP in the hypopharynx (p< 0.05 for all comparisons) (Fig.4A and B, Table1). An increase in the PFR during the HCM pattern significantly increased the EEP (p< 0.001 for all comparisons) (Fig.4A and B, Table1). The EEP during the HOM pattern was significantly lower than that during the HCM pattern (p< 0.001 for all comparisons). An increase in the PFR significantly increased the EEP during the HOM pattern (p= 0.005 for all comparisons) (Table1).

DeltaP was lower during OM than during CM breathing, higher during HCM than during CM breathing, and lower during HOM than during HCM breathing (Table1). DeltaP significantly increased with the increasing PFR only during the HCM phase (Table1).

The initial VTe before the study was 422.7 (347.6–509.6) mL. VTe during CM with an FDO2of 100% increased from the baseline value to 711.0 (608.3–790.0), 948.0 (715.0–1204.8), and 948.0 (869.0–1422.0) mL at PFR of 30, 60, and 80 L/min, respectively (p< 0.001) (Fig.4C and D, Table1). An increase in the PFR during the HCM pattern also increased VTe (p< 0.001). The VTe during the HCM and CM patterns did not differ at any of the PFR (p> 0.05) (Fig.4C and D, Table1).

The initial Te before the study was 2.2 (2.0–2.7 s). The Te during the CM pattern at PFR of 30 L/min increased to 3.4 (2.2–5.4) s (p= 0.005) (Fig.5A, Table1). An increase in the PFR to 60 and 80 L/min did not change the Te further during the CM phase (Fig.5A, Table1). Compared with the CM mode, switching the breathing mode to HCM resulted in a significant decrease in the Te at all PFR (Fig.5B, Table1). An increase in the PFR did not change the Te further during the HCM phase (Fig.5B, Table1). The initial Ti before the study was 1.7 (1.1–1.9 s). Ti during the CM pattern and an FDO2of 100% did not change at any of the flow rates (Table1). A change in the breathing mode from CM to HCM resulted in a significant decrease in Ti at all PFR (Table1). An increase in the PFR from 30 to 60 and 80 L/min during the HCM pattern shortened the Ti (p= 0.002) (Table1).

The initial RR was 14 (12–16) min−1. The RR during the CM pattern at a flow rate of 30 L/min decreased to 11.0 (9.3–14.0) min−1(p= 0.012). An increase in the PFR from 30 to 80 L/min decreased the RR further to 10.0 (7.0–15.0) (p= 0.043) (Table1). A change in the breathing mode from CM to OM resulted in an increase in the RR at PFR of 60 and 80 L/min, which did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.058 andp= 0.059, respectively) (Table1). The RR was significantly increased during the HOM breathing pattern compared with that during the HCM breathing pattern at a flow rate of 30 L/min (Table1).

The initial mVR was 0.71 (0.58–0.85). The mVR during the CM pattern at all flow rates did not change compared with the initial mVR (Table1). Switching the breathing pattern from CM to HCM was associated with an increase in the mVR at all preset flow rates (Table1).

The VAS comfort score during the CM breathing pattern at a flow rate of 30 L/min was 8.0 (7.3–9.8) points. An increase in the PFR to 60 and 80 L/min during the CM breathing pattern resulted in a significant decrease in the subject’s comfort to 7.0 (5.3–8.8) and 6.0 (4.0–8.0) points, respectively (p< 0.001) (Fig.5C, Table1). The same dynamics of the subject’s comfort were observed for all other patterns (Table1). A change in the breathing pattern from CM to HCM and from OM to HOM did not change the subject’s comfort (Table1).

The mean subject expiratory flow (EFmean) increased as the PFR increased during the CM and HCM patterns (Table1). The HCM pattern was associated with a higher EFmean than CM at all PFR (p= 0.001) (Table1).

The VAS comfort score corresponds to the ratio of the PFR to the EFmean of a volunteer during CM: the maximum comfort of the subject was observed at a ratio close to 1:1, and the maximum discomfort was observed at a ratio of approximately 2:1 (Fig.5D, Table1).

The subjects’ answers concerning their discomfort are presented in the Supplemental material (Table S5).

The dynamics and significant differences of the measured values with the preset FDO2of 40, 60 and 80% were similar to those of the PFR increase and changes in the breathing patterns with the preset FDO2of 100% The FiO2/FDO2ratio decreased with increasing FDO2. For example, an increase in FDO2from 40 to 100% during HOM at PFR of 80 and 60 L/min resulted in a decrease in the median FiO2/FDO2ratio from 85 to 64% (Tables1–2, S1–S3; Figs. S1–S2). An increase in the PFR did not influence the measured RR with the preset FDO2of 40, 60 and 80% during all breathing patterns; RR did not differ between the CM and OM or between the HCM and HOM patterns. All data on the preset FDO2values of 40, 60, and 80% are presented in Supplemental Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively.

The increase in FDO2during the CM pattern at constant PFR decreased the FeCO2and mVR in all comparisons (Supplemental Table S4 and Figures S3–S5). The FeCO2significantly decreased with the increase in the preset FDO2also during OM, HCM, and HOM patterns at constant PFR (p< 0.05 for all comparisons). Changes in the FDO2significantly affected the mVR also during HCM pattern (p< 0.05). The VAS score decreased significantly with increasing FDO2only at the PFR of 80 L/min during the CM (Table S4, Fig. S3C), OM (p< 0.001), and HOM (p= 0.004) patterns. All other variables during stable PFR were independent of FDO2(p> 0.05 for all comparisons).

Most of the studies on respiratory physiology during HFNC therapy in healthy volunteers and patients have focused on the EEP, breathing pattern changes, and work of breathing. The heterogeneous data for these parameters could be explained by heterogeneous sites of measurements: the placement of the tip of the probe in different parts of the volunteer’s upper airways (nasopharynx, nasal cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx) or inside the mannequin. We first focused on the gas composition in the hypopharynx and the influences of the combination of the PFR, breathing pattern, and FDO2on FiO2(including oxygram shape), FeCO2, EEP, and VTe.

Data on FiO2measurements inside airways close to the trachea or inside the trachea in healthy subjects and patients with ARF are limited. Similar FiO2values ​​were obtained in healthy volunteers, models, or patients, when the catheter was placed in the hypopharynx or inside the trachea (5–6), but the FiO2values measured in the nasopharynx was lower [7].

We conducted the first study in which the resulting FiO2in the hypopharynx at different respiratory patterns, PFR, and FDO2values were evaluated. We found a very high range of FiO2within the combination of FDO2at different PFR and breathing patterns. These results may call into question the accuracy of the measurement of the ROX index and SpO2/FiO2during HFNC therapy in clinical studies, especially with respect to the OM and HOM patterns [16]. Sun YH et al. examined a lung model and observed a relationship between the PFR, FDO2, and peak inspiratory flow, in which resulting FiO2was much lower than that in our data [17].

FiO2measurements in the hypopharynx during HFNC therapy with the OM, especially the HOM breathing pattern, are challenging due to “abnormal” oxygram waveforms during inspiration. The inverted oxygram may be a consequence of the Venturi effect with air entrainment through an open mouth and collision of the expiratory and inspiratory flows. Future studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of these findings.

Bench studieshave shown an improvement in CO2clearance during HFNC therapy in the nasal cavity, pharynx, and trachea (8–10), which is more prominent with higher PFR and prolonged Te (decreased RR) [9]. Onodera Y et al. reported that CO2clearance during the OM pattern was higher than during the CM pattern, which is consistent with our data [10].

Although bench studies revealed a flow-dependent improvement in CO2clearance, the conclusions fromvolunteer studieswere not as clear. Moller W et al. confirmed their previous bench data [8] on flow-dependent CO2clearance and clearance half-times using scintigraphy [18]. In addition, other studies did not identify changes in arterial, tissue, and capillary CO2levels (PaCO2, PtCO2, or PcCO2, respectively), or FeCO2during HFNC [7,19,20]. If constant PaCO2/PtCO2/PcCO2levels could be explained by a combination of a reduced VD and a decrease in the RR during HFNC therapy and, as a consequence, stable VA, then a constant PaCO2/PtCO2/PcCO2during unchanged MV with increased VD washout and an increased VT could be explained only by an incorrect VT measurement or probable increased alveolar VD due to the CPAP-like effect with alveolar overdistension [20]. In our study, we measured FeCO2, which is close to PaCO2, and observed a decrease in FeCO2during constant CO2production, suggesting increased VA. The significant decrease in the RR with decreasing FeCO2in our study could be explained by a significant increase in the VT during HFNC therapy. We observed a pronounced effect on CO2washout, which was influenced by FiO2levels and the respiratory pattern of the subject (CM, OM, HCM, or HOM). To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare FeCO2during four different breathing patterns.

Numerousclinical studiesof hypercapnic patients have confirmed data on improved CO2washout in patients, revealing a decrease in PaCO2/PtCO2/PcCO2[21–30]. However, some studies on AHRF did not find a decrease in PaCO2/PtCO2/PcCO2, which could be explained by constant VA in these patients or increased CO2production [31,32].

High tidal volumes during HFNC may injure the lungs through lung overinflation (strain) or patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) [33,34]. VT above 9.5 mL/kg were found to be a predictor of NIV failure in a single multicentre observational study of patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemic ARF treated with NIV [35].

The VT measurement methods used during HFNC therapy in published studies are not ideal. These factors may lead to conflicting results showing the opposite direction of VT changes with an increase in the inspiratory flow rate. We subdivided the discussion of VT changes during HFNC therapy by the VT measurement method.

Data on VT measurements during HFNC therapy obtained using electrical impedance tomography [31,32,36–39] and inductive plethysmography [19,21,40] have shown various results in healthy volunteers and patients with ARF. Studies using thoracic bioimpedance (ExSpiron 2Xi, Senzime, Sweden) in healthy volunteers [20] and volumetric measurements during HFNC interruption in patients with ARF [41] showed an increase in the VT of up to 11 ml/kg IBW, which is consistent with our data.

To the best of our knowledge, a time-of-flight camera is the most accurate noninvasive method for VT measurements in nonintubated patients. A single study used this method to assess VT during noninvasive respiratory support [42]. This study revealed that an increase in the PFR and/or an increase in the subject’s respiratory drive was associated with an increase in VT to 913 (680–1166) mL. Moreover, with a PFR of 30 L/min, 50% of the subjects had a VT greater than 10 mL/kg, and 15% had a VT > 15 mL/kg; however, with a PFR of 60 L/min, 65% of the subjects had a VT greater than 10 mL/kg, 35% had a VT greater than 15 mL/kg, and 10% had a VT greater than 20 mL/kg. These results are consistent with our data.

Bench studies have shown highly heterogeneous values for EEP during the CM phase, ranging from 0–3 cm H2O [38] when measured inside a mannequin “nasopharynx” to 16 cm H2O at a PFR of 60 L/min when measured inside a lung model [10,17]. Substituting appropriate numbers from our study during the CM pattern to their equation, we obtain an EEP level equal to 14.5 cmH2O inside the lung model, which corresponds to our data. In our study, we observed a long phase of positive EEP, which contradicts the findings of bench studies that documented only a short (“peak”) EEP [17].

Volunteer studies also revealed heterogeneous data for EEP values. Most studies have measured the EEP in the nasopharynx or distal part of the nasal cavity. These studies reported concordant results: EEP levels were approximately the PFR divided by ten [38,43–45]. In contrast, two studies that measured EEP in the oropharynx [46] or the hypopharynx [7] reported higher EEP values during the CM pattern, which were close to our data but presented high variability [7]. PEEP levels also depend on the cannula size: the EEP level was higher with a 5 mm cannula than with a 4 mm or 3 mm cannula [47]. Moreover, the volunteers in the Chinese study [48] had higher PEEP levels than those in the European study did, possibly due to the anatomical features of the upper airways.

Clinical studies using EIT revealed an increase in end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) in all studies [22,32,33,37,39,48], with greater EELI at higher PFR. Surprisingly, in two clinical studies, the EEP was lower than that in volunteer studies (including our study). This difference can be explained by partial mouth opening during HFNC therapy in these patients [6,37]. Villalba DS have found no differences between tracheal and pharyngeal pressures during HFNC with different PFR during the CM and OM patterns in patients with a tracheostomy during the process of decannulation [12]. The clinical data on EEP are discussed in detail in a dedicated review [49].

In the previous studies, the WOB in healthy subjects was not significantly different at the range of PFR of 10–40 L/min but increased significantly at higher PFR or when larger cannulas were used [19,38,47]. In healthy volunteers, the WOB was higher during HFNC therapy at 40 and 60 L/min during the CM pattern than during CPAP therapy at 4 cmH2O for a single breath, also the WOB during the CM pattern was greater than that during the OM pattern [38]. In contrast, we found that about half of the volunteers preferred the CM pattern as more comfortable. In AHRF patients, dyspnea (Borg score) was less pronounced during HFNC therapy than during low-flow oxygen therapy [37] but was more pronounced if excessive PFR were used, and it was significantly higher if the PFR was 1.5 L/min per ideal body weight [48], which is comparable to our VAS data obtained at a PFR of 80 L/min in healthy volunteers.

Our study has several strengths: 1. simultaneous monitoring of capnogram, oxygram, pressure, and volume measurements and VAS comfort during HFNC therapy; 2. comparisons of three different PFR, including an unusually high flow rate of 80 L/min; 3. The use of combinations of different FDO2values and PFR to reveal the influences of these combinations on the gas composition in the hypopharynx; 4. measurements were made in the hypopharynx, close to vocal cords, which made it more reliable for clinical practice; 5. The use of different breathing patterns, including not only CM and OM but also hyperpnea during CM and OM; and 6. The calculation of the mVR at all preset combinations of flow rates, FDO2values, and breathing patterns.

The limitations of the study include the following: 1. The VT measurement technique may introduce some bias due to the Venturi effect with gas entrainment and changes in the breathing pattern during the VT measurement; we mitigated this bias by training volunteers in the optimal measuring technique and excluded subjects with abnormal oxygrams in whom the Venturi effect was evident from the analysis. 2. The results may not be fully translated into clinical practice for patients with ARF due to pathophysiological changes.

HCM, OM, and HOM breathing patterns decreased FiO2and FECO2in the hypopharynx of healthy subjects (which was more pronounced during the OM and HOM patterns). The FiO2level in the hypopharynx during the OM and HOM patterns is unpredictable at all PFR. A PFR of 60 L/min was sufficient to maintain FiO2close to FDO2during the CM and HCM patterns. HFNC within the CM and HCM provided flow-dependent CPAP-effects over a wide range and could be associated with lung hyperinflation. An excessive PFR led to discomfort.
