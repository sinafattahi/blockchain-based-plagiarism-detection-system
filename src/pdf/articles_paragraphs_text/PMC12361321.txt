Brain tumors located in the posterior cranial fossa frequently lead to hydrocephalus. However, few investigations have delineated factors predicting preoperative hydrocephalus. This study aimed to identify risk factors for hydrocephalus prior to tumor resection in the posterior cranial fossa and to develop a predictive scoring model. We reviewed 421 patients with posterior cranial fossa tumors, stratifying them into groups with (n= 160, 38%) and without (n= 261, 62%) hydrocephalus on initial neuroimaging. Demographic, radiographic, and craniometric variables were collected. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were determined. Factors that remained significant in the multivariable model were incorporated into a novel scoring system. Multiple factors were associated with preoperative hydrocephalus in univariate analysis. In the final multivariable model, increased intracranial pressure, ataxia, cognitive impairment, large tumor volume, and peritumoral vasogenic edema showed strong correlations with hydrocephalus. Pre-resection hydrocephalus in patients with posterior cranial fossa tumors was strongly associated with clinical symptoms (increased intracranial pressure, ataxia, and cognitive impairment) and radiographic findings (large tumor volume and peritumoral vasogenic edema). These results may guide early surveillance and facilitate surgical prioritization to avert severe complications in this patient population.

Posterior cranial fossa lesions are frequently encountered in neurosurgical practice, with neoplasms constituting a major subset [1]. These tumors affect a broad range of age groups [2,3]. In adults, meningiomas and schwannomas are common posterior fossa tumors [2,3], whereas pilocytic astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, ependymomas, and diffuse midline gliomas predominate in pediatric patients [2–6]. Malignant gliomas and lymphomas typically arise in the supratentorial region rather than the posterior fossa [7]. Other tumors in this region include metastases, hemangioblastomas, and glioneuronal neoplasms [8–11]. Owing to the confined space of the posterior cranial fossa, these lesions often obstruct cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, causing hydrocephalus [12].

In neurosurgical practice, hydrocephalus is a frequent complication of posterior fossa tumors, particularly in children [13–15]. It may result from impaired CSF pathways, overproduction of CSF, or a combination of both [16–20]. Tumors strongly associated with hydrocephalus include hemangioblastomas, large vestibular schwannomas, and pediatric brain tumors [21–24]. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment, as it is relatively safe, effective in reducing mass effect, and associated with favorable outcomes [25–28]. In patients with coexisting hydrocephalus, presurgical or intraoperative CSF diversion may be necessary [29–33]. Resection can often reestablish CSF flow, thus reducing the risk of persistent postoperative hydrocephalus and the need for permanent CSF diversion [34].

Although large posterior fossa tumors frequently cause hydrocephalus, some patients with small-to-medium tumors also develop this condition, suggesting additional contributing factors. Most studies have focused on risk factors for postoperative or persistent hydrocephalus, with few investigating predictors of hydrocephalus before tumor resection. This study therefore aimed to identify factors associated with pre-resection hydrocephalus in patients harboring posterior cranial fossa tumors and to develop a predictive scoring model.

This cross-sectional study was ethically approved by Institutional Review Board (certificate of approval no. Si 975/2021). All patients with tumors arising in the posterior cranial fossa, treated at our medical institute from January 2013 to December 2020, were included into the study.

Eligible patients had tumors confined to the posterior cranial fossa. Those with multifocal brain tumors, tumors involving both infratentorial and supratentorial regions, prior brain surgery, prior cranial radiation therapy or radiosurgery, or radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus before tumor diagnosis were excluded. Patients with a known history of hydrocephalus preceding brain tumor development were also excluded.

Collected data were categorized into demographic, radiographic, and craniometric factors.

Demographic factors: The demographic factors were age, sex, duration of presenting symptoms, presenting symptoms, and tumor pathology. The presenting symptoms were categorized into increased intracranial pressure (IICP) symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, deterioration of consciousness, and cranial nerve dysfunction.

Radiographic factors: Tumor volume, tumor location, involvement of posterior fossa neural structures, post-contrast tumor enhancement, peritumoral vasogenic edema, and intratumoral cystic appearance were evaluated. All radiographic data were retrieved from presurgical cranial MRIs in Synapse PACS (Fujifilm Healthcare).

Craniometric factors: Craniometric measurements included the clival angle (Boogard’s angle), the straight sinus angle, and the posterior cranial fossa volume. The clival angle was defined by the angle connecting the dorsum sellae, basion, and opisthion on mid-sagittal imaging (Fig.1A) [38]. The straight sinus angle was measured by the angle formed where the vein of Galen enters the straight sinus on mid-sagittal imaging (Fig.1B) [39].

Tumor and posterior cranial fossa volumes were quantified using 3D Slicer software [40,41] (Fig.2). Methods of 3D volumetric analysis followed published protocols [42,43]. A neurosurgeon (P.K.) performed all measurements, which were independently confirmed by a neuroradiologist (C.N.).

All data analyses were performed using PASW Statistics, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables (sex, clinical symptoms, and tumor characteristics) are presented as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables (age, duration of presenting symptoms, tumor volume, posterior cranial fossa volume, clival angle, and straight sinus angle) are reported as mean with standard deviation or median with range, depending on the normality test.

The association between each individual variable and the presence of pre-resection hydrocephalus was evaluated using Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. The independent samplest-test or Mann‒WhitneyUtest was used to compare continuous variables between the hydrocephalus and non-hydrocephalus groups. The strength of association was quantified by odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

Variables withp< 0.2 in univariate analysis were selected for further evaluation. Multiple linear regression was conducted to identify collinearity, defined as tolerance < 0.2 and variance inflation factor > 5. Parameters that met these thresholds were excluded from subsequent binary logistic regression.

Backward (Wald) selection was applied during binary logistic regression to derive the final predictive model, using a probability for removal of 0.05. Bootstrap internal validation was performed to estimate the shrinkage factor and adjust for any overestimation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AuROC).

Model performance was evaluated by discrimination and calibration. Discrimination was assessed using the AuROC, whereas calibration was examined with the Hosmer‒Lemeshow test and by comparing predicted risk probabilities with actual observed probabilities (calibration curve). A predictive scoring model was then developed based on the final multivariable logistic regression coefficients, incorporating the adjusted bootstrap internal validation.

Finally, an ROC curve was generated to determine the optimal cutoff point for predicting pre-resection hydrocephalus. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and the AuROC were reported.

A total of 421 patients were diagnosed with posterior cranial fossa tumors based on initial cranial imaging. Among them, 160 (38%) presented with hydrocephalus, while 261 (62%) did not. The median age was 53 years (range 19‒87). Males comprised 133 (31.6%) of the cohort, and 288 (68.4%) were female.

The most frequent presenting symptom was cranial nerve dysfunction (71.7%), followed by ataxia (60.8%), IICP symptom (26.8%), cognitive impairment (9%), and deterioration of consciousness (4.7%).

Schwannoma was the most common tumor (45.3%). Malignant tumors (21%) and meningiomas (20.5%) were the next most prevalent, occurring at similar frequencies.

Mean Evans’ indices were 0.33 ± 0.04 in the hydrocephalus group and 0.25 ± 0.02 in the non-hydrocephalus group, with an overall mean of 0.28 ± 0.05. Most tumors (75.1%) involved or compressed the cerebellar cortex. On post-contrast MRI, 97.9% of tumors showed contrast enhancement, and 66.8% of all tumors demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement.

Table1summarizes the univariate associations between each variable and the presence of hydrocephalus.

Demographic factors: Male sex, shorter duration of presenting symptoms, IICP symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, deterioration of consciousness, and malignancy were positively correlated with hydrocephalus. In contrast, cranial nerve dysfunction and schwannoma were inversely associated. Meningioma showed a trend toward being protective, but did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.056).

Radiographic factors: Larger tumor volume, intra-axial (brain parenchymal) location, midline position, heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and peritumoral vasogenic edema were significantly associated with hydrocephalus. Conversely, tumor involvement or compression of the cerebellar cortex was the only radiographic variable significantly protective against hydrocephalus (p= 0.019, OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38‒0.92).

Craniometric variables: Posterior cranial fossa volume, as well as the clival and straight sinus angles, did not exhibit significant associations with the development of hydrocephalus.

Table2summarizes the strength of association between individual factors and the occurrence of hydrocephalus. Notably, deterioration of consciousness showed a markedly high OR (35.04, 95% CI 4.64‒264.46). Other factors with strong associations were peritumoral vasogenic edema (OR 12.96, 95% CI 8.06‒20.84), cognitive impairment (OR 10.63, 95% CI 4.33‒26.07), IICP symptom (OR 8.84, 95% CI 5.39‒14.51), malignancy (OR 4.99, 95% CI 3.01‒8.28), and ataxia (OR 3.94, 95% CI 2.50‒6.20).

All variables with apvalue less than 0.2 in univariate testing were entered into the multivariable model. These were age, sex, duration of presenting symptoms, IICP symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, deterioration of consciousness, cranial nerve dysfunction, malignancy, schwannoma, meningioma, tumor volume, intra-axial tumor location, midline location, cerebellar cortex involvement, heterogeneous tumor enhancement, peritumoral vasogenic edema, and intratumoral cystic appearance. After collinearity testing and backward (conditional) logistic regression, seven factors remained in the final model: age, IICP symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, deterioration of consciousness, tumor volume, and peritumoral vasogenic edema. Of these seven, IICP symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, tumor volume, and peritumoral vasogenic edema were significantly associated with hydrocephalus. Age (p= 0.081) and deterioration of consciousness (p= 0.050) did not reach statistical significance. The final multivariable findings are shown in Table3. Figure3illustrates the ROC curve, with an AuROC of 0.906 (95% CI 0.878‒0.934).

A predictive scoring model was developed based on the five significant variables in the final logistic regression (four categorical factors plus tumor volume as a quantitative factor). These variables and scores were described as the follows.

Peritumoral vasogenic edema: absent = 0, present = 3.

Tumor volume: the score was calculated by tumor volume (cm3)/10 × 1.

Total score was summation of all scores, and could be expressed in decimal number.

Table4shows the scoring system, which uses an optimal cutoff score of 4 to distinguish high from low probabilities of pre-resection hydrocephalus. At this cutoff, the model demonstrated an AuROC of 0.84, with 87.5% sensitivity, 81.2% specificity, a positive predictive value of 74.1, a negative predictive value of 91.4, a positive likelihood ratio of 4.66, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.15 (Supplementary Table).

Hydrocephalus is common in patients with posterior cranial fossa tumors, especially in pediatric populations. Among children with these tumors, hydrocephalus occurs in about 73%‒100% of cases [14,44–46], compared with about 30%‒40% in adults [47–49]. Posterior fossa tumors frequently obstruct CSF flow [15]. The primary mechanism involves direct compression of CSF pathways, causing obstructive hydrocephalus [21,50–52]. Hemodynamic disturbances, such as increased vascular resistance in intracranial venous sinuses, also contribute [53]. Both intra-axial and extra-axial lesions can compress major venous sinuses and impair venous outflow, leading to hydrocephalus [54]. Although large posterior fossa tumors commonly induce hydrocephalus, some small- or medium-sized tumors also produce it. Hence, factors beyond tumor size may be relevant.

In our univariate analysis, male sex showed a higher risk of hydrocephalus (OR 1.62,p= 0.025), consistent with prior studies [17,55]. Typical neurologic symptoms, including IICP symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and altered consciousness, were also associated. These findings align with the effects of large tumor volume, vasogenic edema, and hydrocephalus itself [56]. Interestingly, cranial nerve dysfunction was more frequent in patients without hydrocephalus (OR 0.35,p< 0.001). Patients presenting with isolated cranial neuropathies, such as hearing loss or facial numbness, often seek early medical attention, facilitating diagnosis before obstructive hydrocephalus develops. A shorter presenting symptom duration (median 3 months) was linked with hydrocephalus (p= 0.044), whereas longer, more tolerable symptom courses (median 8 months) carried lower risk. Rapidly growing tumors or significant vasogenic edema, often seen in malignant neoplasms, may overwhelm intracranial compensatory mechanisms and thus cause obstructive hydrocephalus.

Malignant posterior cranial fossa tumors were strongly associated with hydrocephalus (OR 4.99,p< 0.001). Rapid tumor growth and vasogenic brain edema narrow the posterior cranial fossa, ultimately resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus. In one study of hydrocephalus management following posterior fossa tumor resection, metastasis was the most frequent malignant tumor causing preoperative hydrocephalus in adults (29.5%), whereas medulloblastoma was predominant in children [47]. By contrast, benign tumors showed a different pattern. Schwannomas were found significantly more often in patients without hydrocephalus (OR 0.44,p< 0.001), and meningiomas showed a similar, though not statistically significant, trend (OR 0.61,p= 0.057). Schwannomas and meningiomas grow slowly and gradually compress the brain or cranial nerves [57,58]. This protracted progression likely allows for intracranial hydrodynamic compensation, reducing the likelihood of hydrocephalus, even with large tumors. Moreover, patients with benign tumors often experience cranial neuropathy (such as hearing loss or facial paresthesia), prompting earlier medical attention before obstructive hydrocephalus develops.

Prior to this study, we hypothesized that steep clival and straight sinus angles might predispose individuals to hydrocephalus by reducing posterior cranial fossa volume. However, none of the craniometric variables (posterior fossa volume, clival angle, and straight sinus angle) was significantly associated with hydrocephalus. Instead, tumor volume emerged as a strong predictor in both univariate and multivariable analyses. These findings align with earlier reports showing that larger tumor volume heightens the risk of hydrocephalus before resection or radiosurgery [59–61].

Tumors located in the midline or deep regions often lead to hydrocephalus by obstructing the ventricular system, particularly the fourth ventricle. Patients with intrinsic brainstem tumors frequently develop multiple cranial nerve deficits before hydrocephalus becomes apparent. Previous studies similarly reported that midline tumors or those compressing or infiltrating the fourth ventricle are associated with persistent hydrocephalus [61–65]. Intra-axial tumors in the posterior fossa tend to be malignant (e.g., metastases and malignant gliomas), which predispose to hydrocephalus. A study by Shabo et al. of 130 patients with metastatic posterior cranial fossa tumors found that all required preoperative external ventricular drainage, highlighting the high prevalence of obstructive hydrocephalus in metastatic disease [65].

Heterogeneous tumor enhancement commonly reflects malignancy or higher tumor aggressiveness, such as metastatic lesions, malignant gliomas, medulloblastomas, ependymomas, or medium-to-large vestibular schwannomas with cystic components. These tumors frequently lead to hydrocephalus, whereas those with homogeneous enhancement, like meningiomas or very small schwannomas, are less likely to cause it. Peritumoral vasogenic brain edema was also a robust predictor of hydrocephalus in this study. It is often seen in aggressive tumors, such as glioblastomas and metastatic lesions [66–68], which readily produce hydrocephalus if located in the posterior fossa. Although intratumoral cystic changes can accelerate tumor expansion, thereby promoting hydrocephalus, they did not reach statistical significance in our univariate or multivariable analyses. Similarly, Shin et al. reported that vestibular schwannomas with large cystic components were associated with postoperative hydrocephalus [69].

In the multivariate analysis, IICP symptom, ataxia, cognitive impairment, greater tumor volume, and peritumoral vasogenic edema had significant associations with pre-resection hydrocephalus. These variables emerged as the most important predictors and were thus incorporated into the scoring model. The proposed predictive score aimed to identify patients with a great risk of hydrocephalus development before tumor resection. It may help neurosurgeons with decision-making of early surgical interventions. In patients who are at high risk, their operative schedules can be brought forward to prevent the detrimental effects of hydrocephalus.

Table5[9,14,21,44–49,59–65,67,69–103] provides a comprehensive literature review of hydrocephalus in posterior cranial fossa tumors. Most articles examined post-resection hydrocephalus or the need for CSF diversion, whereas publications focusing on pre-resection hydrocephalus were scarce. Based on this review, Table6[6,14,21,45–49,59–65,67,69,71,73,75–77,80,81,83–85,87,89–99,101,103] summarizes the risk factors or predictors of hydrocephalus and CSF diversion requirements, stratified by variable type, treatment phase, and patient age group.

Several studies, including ours, identified large tumor size as a principal factor for pre-resection hydrocephalus in adults [59–61]. In contrast, tumor size was only linked to postoperative CSF diversion in one pediatric medulloblastoma study [98]. In children, post-resection hydrocephalus or the need for CSF diversion was commonly associated with young age [14,21,46,47,63,71,73,75,81,83,85,89–92], midline tumor location [21,75,81,84], preoperative hydrocephalus [14,71,77,81,83,84,103], metastatic or disseminated disease [83,91,97,98], incomplete tumor resection [21,45,46,73,85,91–93], perioperative external ventricular drainage (EVD) [49,75,76,84,90,92,95], prolonged EVD use [21,49,73,92], intraventricular hemorrhage [89,90,97,99], and specific pathologies such as medulloblastoma [46,47,77,84,91] or ependymoma [46,75,81,84,87,94]. In adults, the principal predictors of post-resection hydrocephalus were preoperative hydrocephalus [47,49,62,67,69] and incomplete tumor resection [49,67,69,93].

The present study has several strengths. First, we included consecutive cases across the study period, excluding those with multiple brain lesions, combined infratentorial and supratentorial tumors, or preexisting hydrocephalus before tumor diagnosis. This approach reduced selection bias and removed potential confounders. Second, our relatively large sample size mitigated concerns about inadequate numbers of participants, which have limited some earlier studies. Third, we developed a practical scoring model, derived from these data, to predict the likelihood of pre-resection hydrocephalus. Fourth, an extensive literature review and concise summary of risk factors or predictors of hydrocephalus or CSF diversion were also provided.

Despite these strengths, our study design remains susceptible to bias and confounding variables. In addition, we did not validate our scoring model in a separate patient cohort, and future work should address its external validity. Nonetheless, our findings may help neurosurgeons recognize clinical and radiographic signs that precede tumor-related hydrocephalus. The proposed predictive score can be used to identify patients at high risk for hydrocephalus, thus enabling earlier intervention. It may also guide surgical prioritization to prevent the devastating outcomes of severe hydrocephalus, including permanent neurologic deficits and death [104,105].

Clinical symptoms such as IICP symptom, ataxia, and cognitive impairment, along with radiographic findings (large tumor volume and peritumoral vasogenic edema), emerged as key predictors of pre-resection hydrocephalus in patients with posterior cranial fossa tumors. These insights can raise neurosurgeons’ awareness of hydrocephalus risk and guide the identification of high-risk patients for prompt surgical intervention to avert serious neurologic sequelae.
