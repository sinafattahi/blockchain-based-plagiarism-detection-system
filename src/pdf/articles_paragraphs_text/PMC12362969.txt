The occurrence of pulmonary complications is common following major surgery, resulting in a diversity of detrimental outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of documentation examining the occurrence rate of pulmonary complications and related hazard factors following lumbar spine surgery by using a large-scale national database.

We conducted a retrospective database analysis from 2010 to 2019 by using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery were included in the study. Patient demographics, in-hospital mortality, insurance type, total charges, hospital type, length of stay in hospital (LOS), preoperative comorbidities, as well as medical and surgical complications were appraised.

In total, 932,563 lumbar spine operations were recorded in the NIS database from 2010 to 2019. The overall incidence of pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery was 3.54%. Patients with pulmonary complications after lumbar spine surgery presented prolonged LOS, higher in-hospital charges, and more preoperative complications (p < 0.001). Many preoperative comorbidities and postoperative complications were associated with pulmonary complications, which involved alcohol abuse, deficiency anemia, coagulopathy, diabetes (uncomplicated), drug abuse, metastatic cancer, psychoses, renal failure, weight loss, blood transfusion, cardiac arrest, postoperative delirium, septicemia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage/seroma/hematoma, nerve injuries and wound infection. Additionally, advanced age (≥ 75 years), number of comorbidity, type of insurance (Medicaid and Private insurance), teaching hospital, urban hospital were also associated with pulmonary complications.

The results of our study revealed a relatively low incidence of pulmonary complications subsequent to lumbar spine surgery. Investigating risk factors associated with postoperative pulmonary complications can be beneficial in ensuring proper management and mitigating the adverse effects.

Degenerative lumbar spine disease is a prevalent condition associated with aging, and its prevalence is currently increasing within the community (Noh et al.2022). Operative treatment has emerged as the criterion treatment modality for refractory conditions (Yang et al.2023; Tian et al.2014). The lumbar spine surgery rate has over tripled, not simply because of the increased incidence of degenerative disease of the lumbar vertebra, but also due to improved surgical techniques, promising efficacy, and an expanding number of hospitals and surgeons (Noh et al.2022).

Postoperative pulmonary complications are a common type of complication after lumbar spine surgery, with an estimation of the incidence ranging from 2.9% to 4.2% (Yang et al.2015). Main pulmonary complications, comprising pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory failure, and other pulmonary complications (including atelectasis, aspiration pneumonitis and Pleural effusion requiring intervention)(Malcolm et al.2020). Pulmonary complications following lumbar spinal surgery can be severe and life-threatening (Malcolm et al.2020). Notably, pulmonary complications have been demonstrated to be one of the greatest contributors to adverse prognosis of patients, resulting in a prolonged length of hospital stay, increased potential of rehospitalization, as well as elevated fatality rates (Yang et al.2015). Therefore, identifying and correcting perioperative modifiable risk factors in patients who underwent elective surgery is beneficial to further improve prognosis and reduce length of hospitalization.

Nevertheless, to date there is a paucity of published research on the occurrence rate and risk factors linked to pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery predicated on analysis of large-scale nationwide databases (Yang et al.2020a). Prior studies have been limited to single-center cohorts (< 1,000 patients), lacking national representation and the ability to stratify risk by comorbidity burden or hospital characteristics, thereby restricting generalizability. In addition, only several single-center studies have documented risk factors for pulmonary complications in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery (Yadla et al.2010; Campbell et al.2010; Gerhardt et al.2018; Altshuler et al.2021).

Consequently, the main objective of our research was to investigate the occurrence rate and risk factors related to pulmonary complications after lumbar spine surgery using a national database (Yang, et al.,2020). Using the 2010–2019 National Inpatient Sample (NIS), we analyzed 932,563 lumbar spine procedures across 47 U.S. states, substantially enhancing external validity. This study assessed the incidence of pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery, patient demographics, total charges, in-hospital mortality, LOS (Supplementary Table 1), complications, and associated risk factors (Yang et al.2020a; Shimura et al.2017). By constructing a multidimensional risk-prediction framework, the impact of high-burden comorbidities on pulmonary complications was clarified, providing an evidence-based basis for precise perioperative management.

The data source for this research was the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, which is affiliated with the healthcare cost and utilisation programme of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Huang et al.2023; Yang et al.2022; Newman et al.2018). Since 1998, this NIS database has represented currently the nation's biggest inpatient population databank of all-payer hospital admissions for the U.S. The NIS database is a collection of tiered samplings of more than one thousand different hospitals, representing roughly twenty percent of annual hospitalizations in the US (Kurtz et al.2007). The information extracted from this database was comprised of patient demographics, LOS, total costs, and procedural and diagnostic codes from International Classification of Diseases (Ninth and Tenth Revisions) Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) (Yang et al.2020a,2023; Rajaee et al.2018).

Data was extracted from the NIS database (2010 to 2019) (Huang et al.2023). Patients in accordance with ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM procedural codes of lumbar spine surgery, including lumbar spinal fusion and lumbar decompression (Supplementary Table 2) were enrolled (Yang et al.2023; Reid et al.2019; Mesregah et al.2022). Patients diagnosed with pulmonary complications were defined and selected according to ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM diagnostic coding of PE, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and other pulmonary complications (Supplementary Table 3) (Malcolm et al.2020). This study is based on NIS data from 2010 to 2019, and the exclusions were determined according to the following criteria: (1) Missing data, including the absence of key variables such as age, gender, and race; (2) Age less than 18 years (Fig.1) (Yang et al.2020a).

All recruits were initially classified as 2 cohorts depending on the occurrence of pulmonary complications. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, and race) of patients were evaluated. Outcome metrics including LOS, type of insurance, overall charges during hospitalization, and inpatient mortality were examined (Yang et al.2020a,2023). The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnostic coding were utilized to capture preoperative comorbidities which are likely to be related to pulmonary complications independently, and surgical and medical complications. (Table1) On the basis of the database of the National Statistical Institute, 29 comorbidities variables are shown in Fig.3. The medical and surgical complications involved are shown in Fig.4.

The statistical software, SPSS 27 (IBM, USA), was used to conduct data analysis. Significant differences were ascertained among the 2 groups by chi-square test (for categorical data) as well as the Wilcoxon rank examination (for continuous data). To assess the correlation between pulmonary complications and surgical complications and other medical complications, both univariate and multivariate logistic models were developed. To identify the risk factors of pulmonary complications, binary logistic regression analyses were conducted with time-stepped regression (Yang et al.2020a). All variables, comprising demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and hospital characteristics supplying by the NIS were involved in the regression analysis (Table2). False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to address multiple comparisons in the logistic regression models. Since other NIS researches employed the massive-scale sample volume, the statistically significant level of the alpha was defined byp≤ 0.001(Fineberg et al.2013).

From 2010 to 2019, there were 899,534 lumbar spine surgeries identified in the NIS database (Table2). In all, the incidence of pulmonary complications was 3.5% occurring in 33,029 patients (Table2). Analysis of annual trends revealed significant fluctuations, with incidence rising from 3.2% in 2010 to 4.1% in 2014, declining to 2.9% by 2016, then increasing steadily to 3.8% by 2019 (Fig.2).

Patients with pulmonary complications were 3 years older than that of patients without pulmonary complications (62 years vs. 59 years;p< 0.001) (Table2). Similarly, there was a significant difference in the age distribution of the two groups, with a notably higher prevalence of pulmonary complications in patients over 65 years old (p< 0.001) (Table2, Supplementary Fig.1A &B). The incidence of pulmonary complications varied regarding to gender, showing a lower incidence in women (p< 0.001) (Table2, Supplementary Fig.1C & D). White patients were less likely to experience pulmonary complications. (p < 0.001) (Table3, Supplementary Fig.2E & F &G &H). Meanwhile, statistical differences were also observed in hospital variables, with more patients suffering pulmonary complications admitted to large hospitals, teaching hospitals, and urban hospitals (Table2).

The median LOS was longer in patients with pulmonary complications than those without pulmonary complications (9 d vs. 3 d;p< 0.001) (Table2). As a result, there was a significant increase in medical costs. The total hospital charges increased by $119,948 with the presence of pulmonary complications ($191,948 vs. $72,934,p< 0.001) (Table2). At the same time, there was a lower likelihood of elective admissions for patients with pulmonary complications (58.6% vs. 85.5%;p< 0.001) (Table2). In addition, patients experiencing pulmonary complications were more likely to utilize Medicare as their primary payer than those not experiencing pulmonary complications (49.0% vs. 39.8%;p< 0.001) (Table2, Supplementary Fig.2C & D). Importantly, patients with the presence of comorbidity significantly increased the likelihood of pulmonary complications (80.2% vs. 23.0%;p< 0.001) (Table2). It is not surprising that the in-hospital mortality had an increment of 5.2% in the presence of pulmonary complications (p< 0.001) (Table2, Supplementary Fig.2E & F).

According to the results of chi-square test, the following preoperative comorbidities were associated with the development of pulmonary complications: alcohol abuse (6.3%), deficiency anemia (19.1%), chronic blood loss anemia (1.4%), congestive heart failure (9.6%), chronic pulmonary disease (25.5%), coagulopathy (11.0%), diabetes, uncomplicated (19.2%), drug abuse (4.5%), fluid and electrolyte disorders (41.2%), metastatic cancer (2.8%), other neurological disorders (10.2%), paralysis (13.8%), peripheral vascular disorders (6.2%), psychoses (5.4%), pulmonary circulation disorders (10.1%), renal failure (9.3%), solid tumor without metastasis (1.6%), valvular disease (4.8%), and weight loss (11.9%) (Fig.3, Supplementary Fig.3).

Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate and identify the risk factors associated with pulmonary complication as advanced age (≥ 75 years, OR = 1.531; 95% CI = 1.488–1.576), number of comorbidity = 1 (OR = 6.247; CI = 6.043–6.458), number of comorbidity = 2 (OR = 15.420; CI = 14.872–15.988), number of comorbidity ≥ 3 (OR = 44.080; CI = 42.686–45.518), type of insurance (medicaid, OR = 1.981; 95% CI = 1.784–2.199) (private insurance, OR = 1.896; 95% CI = 1.641–2.112) teaching hospital (OR = 1.403; 95% CI = 1.330–1.480), urban hospital (OR = 1.271; 95% CI = 1.115–1.449) (Table3), alcohol abuse (OR = 2.293; 95% CI = 2.156–2.439), deficiency anemia (OR = 2.092; 95% CI = 2.016–2.172), chronic blood loss anemia (OR = 1.809; 95% CI = 1.605–2.039), congestive heart failure (OR = 2.072; 95% CI = 1.964–2.187), chronic pulmonary disease (OR = 1.580; 95% CI = 1.532–1.630), coagulopathy (OR = 2.392; 95% CI = 2.277–2.513), diabetes, uncomplicated (OR = 1.206; 95% CI = 1.164–1.249), drug abuse (OR = 1.380; 95% CI = 1.285–1.481), fluid and electrolyte disorders (OR = 4.893; 95% CI = 4.751–5.040), metastatic cancer (OR = 1.436; 95% CI = 1.310–1.575), other neurological disorders (OR = 1.806; 95% CI = 1.724–1.893), paralysis (OR = 2.876; 95% CI = 2.755–3.002), peripheral vascular disorders (OR = 1.554; 95% CI = 1.464–1.649), psychoses (OR = 1.327; 95% CI = 1.248–1.410), pulmonary circulation disorders (OR = 14.636; 95% CI = 13.788–15.537), chronic renal failure (OR = 1.168; 95% CI = 1.108–1.231), solid tumor without metastasis (OR = 1.256; 95% CI = 1.120–1.408), valvular disease (OR = 1.462; 95% CI = 1.370–1.559), weight loss (OR = 4.830; 95% CI = 4.586–5.088) (Fig.3).

Interestingly, there were some protective factors were confirmed to be relevant with pulmonary complications, which included female gender (OR = 0.804; 95% CI = 0.765–0.846), bed size of hospital (medium, OR = 0.611; 95% CI = 0.577–0.669), elective admission (OR = 0.239; 95% CI = 0.227–0.252), and region of hospital (west, OR = 0.884; 95% CI = 0.827–0.945) (Table3) (Fig.4).

However, logistic regression analysis showed that acquired immune deficiency syndrome (p= 0.724), rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases (p= 0.120), hypertension (p= 0.002), hypothyroidism (p= 0.092), liver disease (p= 0.004), lymphoma (p= 0.066) or obesity (p= 0.054) was not associated with the incidence of pulmonary complications (Fig.3). All reportedp-values are two-sided with significance defined asp< 0.001 to account for massive sample size effects per contemporary methodological standards.

Patients with pulmonary complications tended to suffer from acute cerebrovascular disease (4.7%), acute myocardial infarction (4.6%), acute renal failure (14.8%), blood transfusion (24.9%), cardiac arrest (2.8%), continuous positive airway pressure (29.0%), deep venous thrombosis (6.7%), gastrointestinal complication (0.9%), acute heart failure (9.0%), postoperative delirium (5.4%), postoperative shock (1.2%), septicemia (12.7%), thrombocytopenia (8.2%), urinary tract infection (13.7%), hemorrhage/seroma/hematoma (5.1%), nerve injuries (5.8%) and wound infection (2.7%) than patients without pulmonary complications (p< 0.001) (Fig.4, Supplementary Fig.4).

Additionally, when multiple analyses were conducted, the following perioperative complications were associated with pulmonary complications, including acute cerebrovascular disease (OR = 5.371; 95% CI = 5.024–5.742), acute myocardial infarction (OR = 2.037; 95% CI = 1.808–2.296), acute renal failure (OR = 7.033; 95% CI = 6.759–7.319), blood transfusion (OR = 1.457; 95% CI = 1.406–1.511), cardiac arrest (OR = 2.998; 95% CI = 2.360–3.809), continuous positive airway pressure (OR = 21.175; 95% CI = 19.659–22.809), deep venous thrombosis (OR = 1.385; 95% CI = 1.255–1.528), gastrointestinal complication (OR = 1.865; 95% CI = 1.623–2.143), acute heart failure (OR = 2.284; 95% CI = 2.117–2.465), postoperative delirium (OR = 1.456; 95% CI = 1.300–1.632), septicemia (OR = 7.986; 95% CI = 4.294–14.854), thrombocytopenia (OR = 1.368; 95% CI = 1.242–1.507), urinary tract infection (OR = 3.988; 95% CI = 3.832–4.150), hemorrhage/seroma/hematoma (OR = 1.959; 95% CI = 1.756–2.186), nerve injuries (OR = 1.779; 95% CI = 1.632–1.940), and wound infection (OR = 1.681; 95% CI = 1.426–1.983) (Fig.4).

Postoperative shock (1.2%,p= 0.458) and urinary retention (8.4%,p= 0.154) were not significantly associated with pulmonary complications. In contrast, wound dehiscence/non-healing (1.5%,p= 0.005, OR = 0.709) remained significantly associated, although causality requires further investigation. (Fig.4).

Table4summarizes the top 10 strongest predictors of pulmonary complications after lumbar spine surgery. The most significant risk factor was having ≥ 3 comorbidities (OR = 44.08), followed by continuous positive airway pressure (OR = 21.18) and pulmonary circulation disorders (OR = 14.64). Other key predictors included fluid/electrolyte disorders, weight loss, paralysis, coagulopathy, alcohol abuse, deficiency anemia, and congestive heart failure (p< 0.001).

The evaluations of pulmonary complications after lumbar spine surgery across the United States are elucidated in this study. The NIS database, being the largest fully paid, publicly available inpatient database, was considered as the reflection of national trends and less affected by selection bias, hence chosen to describe the trends of pulmonary complications (Malcolm et al.2020). While multiple comparisons were not statistically adjusted in primary analyses, the dual-threshold filtering and large effect sizes enhance confidence in the reported associations. Future studies may incorporate formal correction when investigating marginal effects. On average, 3.5% of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery were complicated with respiratory failure, aspiration, pneumonia, or PE.

From the results of the current study on pulmonary complications in patients undergoing lumbar surgery, it can be seen that the annual incidence of pulmonary complications showed a fluctuating trend from 2010 to 2019 (Fig.2). It is possible that the diagnosis of pulmonary complications according to the ICD-9-CM had changed to ICD-10-CM after 2014, the definition of pulmonary complications changed accordingly (Supplementary Fig.3). This coding overhaul fundamentally altered complication definitions and documentation requirements, likely contributing to artifactual trends during the transition period. The observed rise in the occurrence of pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery prior to 2014 could potentially be due to the increased awareness of this complication among hospital coders (Anderson et al.2012). Moreover, the presence of underdeveloped anesthesia methods and medical procedures, insufficient knowledge, or even the protocols for alleviating discomfort may contribute to a higher occurrence of respiratory complications (Fineberg et al.2013; Bozic et al.2013). Subsequently, there was a growing focus on respiratory complications, which then experienced a reversal in trend starting from 2015. Potential reasons for these patterns encompass advancements in respiratory cleanliness, prevention of deep venous thrombosis, refined anesthetic and surgical approaches, optimization before surgery, and comprehensive care during the perioperative period (Malcolm et al.2020). However, the incidence showed an increasing trend from 2017 to 2019. One possible explanation for this trend is the growing number of individuals undergoing lumbar spine surgery as the population ages rather than coding artifacts, though residual coding system adaptation effects cannot be entirely excluded (Yang et al.2023).

Regarding to demographic data, individuals experiencing pulmonary complications were 3 years older compared to those unaffected by such issues. Furthermore, the elderly population were more likely to suffer pulmonary complications. Consistently, advanced age was a significant predictor for pulmonary complications, in logistic regression (Table3). A potential explanation accounting for this trend may be that the number of elderly patients requiring lumbar surgery is increasing with population aging (Bozic et al.2013), posing an additional risk for pulmonary complications (Fineberg et al.2013). Meanwhile, elderly populations are known to have a weaker immune system and more comorbidities predisposing to pulmonary complications (Raj et al.2022).

Interestingly, female gender was found to be a protective factor for pulmonary complications (Table3; Supplementary Fig.1C & D). Possible explanations for the finding that men who had undergone lumbar spine surgery were more likely to have pulmonary complications are as follows. While the exact mechanisms require further investigation, studies have suggested that estrogen may suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, and this mechanism was reported to be associated with pulmonary vascular leakage and lung injury (Raj et al.2022; Kragholm et al.2021).

The elevated total charges among patients with pulmonary complications (Table2) stem from multiple factors. Most intuitively, pulmonary complications are inherently costly and morbid (Noh et al.2022). Previous reports indicated that respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and pneumonia, had the highest attributable costs ($52,466) among complications following noncardiac surgery at a single private medical center, including cardiovascular, thromboembolism, and infectious complications (Dimick et al.2004). Additionally, prolonged length of stay (LOS) contributes significantly through supplementary expenditures for nursing care, perioperative management, rehabilitation, and diagnostic testing (Huang et al.2023; Brauer et al.2000; Demeure and Fain2007) (Table2). Patients experiencing pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery were likely to exhibit a significantly higher mortality rate. In prior research, preoperative comorbidities such as diabetes, uncomplicated solid tumor without metastasis, and chronic pulmonary disease were identified as predictive factors for mortality in patients with lung diseases (Raj et al.2022). We suggest that the deteriorated cardiopulmonary health and weakened immune function typically associated with these comorbidities contributed significantly to the increased risk. (Fig.3).

Urban or teaching hospitals was found to be associated with the incidence of pulmonary complications. This correlation may be attributed to the severity and complexity of patients'disease states, as well as the frequent occurrence of comorbid conditions.

To enhance treatment outcomes, prescreening and risk stratification are paramount in surgical practice, necessitating a thorough understanding of risk factors prior to surgery (Yang et al.2020a). Logistic regression analysis was employed to gain deeper insights into these risks. A significant finding in this study was that a higher number of preoperative comorbidities served as a critical risk factor for pulmonary complications, suggesting that poorer preoperative health status can potentially elevate the risk of postoperative adverse events (Yang et al.2023).

Notably, pulmonary circulation disorders and continuous positive airway pressure emerged as robust predictors of pulmonary complications following lumbar surgeries, presumably due to their association with compromised cardiopulmonary health and immune function (Malcolm et al.2020; Raj et al.2022). Pulmonary circulation disorders can impair lung function, predisposing patients to complications. In this paper, respiratory failure was categorized as a type of pulmonary complication, and continuous invasive ventilation represented one of the therapeutic modalities for its management. Given the non-modifiable nature of these factors, preoperative identification of patients harboring these risk factors was imperative as they were at a heightened risk for developing pulmonary complications. Recognizing high-risk patients allows clinicians to optimize pulmonary function preoperatively through targeted measures like adequate pain management, early ambulation, and respiratory muscle training, reducing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (Souza Possa et al.2014; Mans et al.2015).

Cardiac-related complications represented a significant and non-negligible challenge in the postoperative period following lumbar spine surgery. Key risk factors for pulmonary complications identified included congestive heart failure, valvular disease, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure. These cardiac complications exacerbated cardiac congestion and compromise ejection function, leading to obstructed pulmonary circulation and potentially severe pulmonary complications. Preventing pulmonary complications is therefore paramount in patients with cardiac dysfunction.

Moreover, disturbances in the circulatory system also contributed to the elevated risk of pulmonary complications. Vascular diseases, such as peripheral vascular disorders and acute cerebrovascular disease, as well as anemia types including deficiency anemia and chronic blood loss anemia, could all impact a patient's circulatory status. Additionally, issues like blood transfusion and hemorrhage/seroma/hematoma emerged as potential risks for pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery. These conditions may reflect perioperative circulatory instability, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing pulmonary complications.

Of particular concern were deep venous thrombosis and coagulation dysfunction (including coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia), which were significant risk factors for pulmonary complications. The effectiveness of interventions to prevent DVT, such as chemoprophylaxis, is therefore critical (Muthu et al.2023). Surgical trauma-induced coagulation dysfunction could not only lead to deep venous thrombosis but also precipitate various complications, including pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction. Even more alarmingly, the detachment of thrombi could directly result in pulmonary embolism, causing damage to lung tissues and further exacerbating the severity of pulmonary complications. The significant burden of these pulmonary sequelae underscores the value of preoperative risk stratification using tools like the validated GSU-Pulmonary Score prognostic model (NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Global Surgery and STARSurg Collaborative2024).

Therefore, in the clinical management of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's cardiac and circulatory status and implement effective preventive measures. This approach aimed to mitigate the risk of cardiac and circulatory-related complications, thereby reducing the occurrence of pulmonary complications and ensuring patient safety and successful recovery. Meanwhile, in clinical practice, it can be recommended that patients undergo preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation (respiratory muscle training and aerobic exercise) and early postoperative ambulation, which is conducive to better recovery.

The impact of neurological disorders on the development of postoperative pulmonary complications, specifically those arising from lumbar spine surgery, could not be ignored. In our meticulous investigation, we delved into the potential risk factors associated with these complications, encompassing various neurological conditions such as other neurological disorders, psychoses, postoperative delirium, and nerve injuries. These conditions can directly affect respiratory centers and muscle function, cause impairment, or indirectly disrupt cardiovascular homeostasis, adversely affecting lung health.

In the current study and prior literature, a significant correlation had been observed between weight loss, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Furthermore, evaluations of patients undergoing both general and vascular surgeries revealed a significantly increased risk of postoperative respiratory failure among those with substantial weight loss, corroborating the close link between weight loss and adverse respiratory events postoperatively. Additionally, our study identified diabetes (uncomplicated), chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal complications as crucial risk factors, which, in conjunction with weight loss and fluid and electrolyte disorders, may collectively contribute to the heightened risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Therefore, preoperative assessment and postoperative management should prioritize these factors to prevent and mitigate the occurrence of pulmonary complications, ensuring patient safety and smooth recovery.

Furthermore, we identified various factors, including alcohol abuse, drug abuse, septicemia, urinary tract infection, and wound infection, as potential contributors to the development of pulmonary complications. These factors were intimately linked to the diminution of immune function caused by the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms into the body, thereby heightening the likelihood of pulmonary diseases. During recovery, patients compromised immune systems are prone to pathogen invasion, which can initiate or exacerbate pulmonary complications. Consequently, a meticulous assessment and management of these potential risk factors was imperative to safeguard patients'recovery and mitigate the occurrence of pulmonary complications.

There are inherent limitations associated with utilizing NIS databases in the present study. Firstly, when performing retrospective analyses, similar to the conduct of other large database studies, discrepancies in coding and potential inaccuracies in data entry may arise (Kulkarni et al.2010). Specifically, the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding systems during the study period (post-2014) introduces potential artifacts and inconsistencies in diagnostic and procedural classification. Consequently, the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications reported in our study may represent an underestimation of the true occurrence. Secondly, as an administrative database, NIS relies on ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding, which lacks granularity (e.g., distinguishing specific types or severities within pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia or respiratory failure) and has certain limitations compared to manual chart review. Meanwhile, the NIS only captures inpatient billing data; therefore, granular intra-operative details—such as surgical approach (open, MIS, or microscopic), anesthesia technique (general, spinal, or combined), operative duration, patient BMI, smoking status, and intra-operative vital signs—are unavailable. These unmeasured variables are known independent predictors of PPC; hence, residual confounding cannot be excluded. Thirdly, the NIS database does not capture long-term outcomes beyond the index hospitalization, limiting our analysis to in-hospital events only. Additionally, the lack of information on imaging studies, laboratory tests, treatment regimens, and vaccination status may have an impact on the results (Raj et al.2022). Importantly, the observational nature of this study and these limitations preclude definitive causal inferences regarding the identified associations; they should be interpreted as risk indicators rather than proven causative factors. Despite its limitations, leveraging a comprehensive and representative national database like the NIS remains advantageous in uncovering trends and demographic insights, owing to its widespread adoption as a trusted research instrument (Malcolm et al.2020; Rapacki et al.2021). Moreover, the validity of the NIS database in precisely identifying patients undergoing specific orthopedic surgeries has been corroborated through validation studies with other databases (Rapacki et al.2021).

The study demonstrated an overall incidence rate of 3.5% for pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgery. This study identified several risk factors, including advanced age, number of comorbidity, type of insurance, teaching hospital, urban hospital, as well as a considerable number of comorbidities and complications. With regard to comorbidities, our findings indicated the presence of alcohol abuse, deficiency anemia, chronic blood loss anemia, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, coagulopathy, diabetes, uncomplicated, drug abuse, fluid and electrolyte disorders, metastatic cancer, other neurological disorders, paralysis, peripheral vascular disorders, psychoses, pulmonary circulation disorders, chronic renal failure, solid tumor without metastasis, valvular disease and weight loss, all of which are significant risk factors. Furthermore, in terms of complications, our analysis reveals that acute cerebrovascular disease, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, blood transfusion, cardiac arrest, continuous positive airway pressure, deep venous thrombosis, gastrointestinal complication, acute heart failure, postoperative delirium, septicemia, thrombocytopenia, urinary tract infection, hemorrhage/seroma/hematoma, nerve injuries, and wound infection were significantly associated with the occurrence of pulmonary complications following lumbar spine surgeries.
