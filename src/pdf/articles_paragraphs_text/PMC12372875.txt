There were errors in the originally published versions of Fig. 2C and Eq. 17 in the Research Article “Deciphering co-ion and counterion transport in polyamide desalination membranes reveals ion selectivity mechanisms” by Y. Guoet al.

• In the originally published version of Fig. 2C, the diffusion coefficient of co-ion inadvertently represented an incorrect dataset. Figure 2C has been corrected to represent the correct dataset.

• The originally published version of Eq. 17 was inadvertently a duplicate of Eq.16. Equation 17 has been corrected.

The authors’ conclusions are not affected by these corrections. The PDF and XML have been corrected.
