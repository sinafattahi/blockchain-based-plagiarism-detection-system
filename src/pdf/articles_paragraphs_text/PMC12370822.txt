This study aimed to examine the association between energy-adjusted consumption patterns of different types of bread, including whole-grain and white bread, and the risk of sarcopenia in older adults. In this cross-sectional study, sarcopenia was assessed using three tests: appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM), handgrip strength, and gait speed, in 1,325 older adults from the Birjand Longitudinal Aging Study (BLAS), conducted between September 2018 and April 2019. Bread consumption was evaluated through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Consumption patterns of whole-grain and white bread were identified via factor analysis, adjusted for energy intake, and categorized into quartiles. In total, 28% of participants had sarcopenia. The highest quartile of the white bread pattern was associated with a 56% increased risk of low ASMM (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.37,P= 0.04) and a twofold increase in the risk of low handgrip strength (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.74,P< 0.001). In contrast, higher adherence to the whole-grain bread pattern significantly reduced the risk of low handgrip strength (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.95,P= 0.02). No significant association was found between either bread pattern and gait speed. Higher whole-grain bread intake was inversely associated with sarcopenia (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.90,P= 0.01), while white bread intake increased the odds (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.37,P= 0.01). Overall, greater whole-grain bread consumption was linked to better muscle strength, whereas white bread intake was associated with weaker muscles, muscle loss, and sarcopenia in older adults. Given the cross-sectional nature of this study, further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and clarify the direction of these associations.

Bread, as a staple food, was found to influence muscle strength and the risk of sarcopenia. While bread type alone is unlikely to prevent sarcopenia, the findings suggest that it may be one of several dietary factors worth considering in the broader context of sarcopenia prevention. These results may support dietitians and general practitioners in encouraging healthier carbohydrate choices as part of a comprehensive strategy that includes adequate protein intake, physical activity, and overall dietary quality.

Sarcopenia, characterized by the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, is a pressing public health issue, particularly as the global population aged over 60 is projected to grow from 841 million in 2013 to over 2 billion by 2050 [1]. Affecting approximately 10–27% of individuals in this age group [2], sarcopenia significantly impairs functional ability and quality of life [3]. It is also a major contributor to adverse outcomes, including falls, disability, frailty, hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality [3,4]. While its etiology is complex, diet and exercise stand out as modifiable risk factors with substantial potential to influence sarcopenia progression [5]. By addressing these lifestyle risk factors, we can develop cost-effective and timely strategies to prevent and manage sarcopenia, ultimately improving health outcomes for the aging population.

While most research on sarcopenia and diet emphasizes protein sources, only a few studies have specifically examined the link between bread consumption and sarcopenia. In a study of older adults in Poland, individuals who consumed white bread and bakery products were nearly 13 times more likely to develop sarcopenia compared to those who mainly consumed whole-grain bread and bakery products [8]. On the other hand, a healthy dietary pattern that included whole-grain bread was associated with improved muscle performance in older adults in Scotland [9]. However, some studies failed to differentiate between types of bread [7]. Moreover, this relationship remains unexplored in the Iranian older adult population, whose dietary habits and characteristics may differ from those of other studied populations.

Bread is a major source of protein among the elderly [10], but its relationship with sarcopenia may involve several additional mechanisms, including serum insulin levels, blood sugar regulation, and inflammation. Whole-grain bread, rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber, may slow digestion, stabilize blood sugar levels, and support muscle protein synthesis, thereby helping to prevent muscle loss. In contrast, white bread is rapidly digested, causing sharp spikes in blood glucose and insulin levels [11,12]. Furthermore, whole-grain bread has anti-inflammatory properties due to its polyphenol content, which helps preserve muscle mass by reducing inflammation, a key factor in sarcopenia [13,14]. Conversely, refined grains in white bread can promote systemic inflammation, further exacerbating muscle loss. Therefore, the type of bread consumed may significantly influence the risk of sarcopenia in older adults.

Despite being a dietary staple worldwide, the potential impact of bread consumption on muscle health and sarcopenia remains underexplored. Considering the distinct nutritional profiles and physiological effects of whole-grain and white bread, understanding their roles in muscle preservation is essential. This study aimed to address this gap by examining the relationship between bread consumption and sarcopenia, providing valuable insights into dietary strategies for promoting healthy aging.

This cross-sectional study analyzes data from the first wave of the ongoing BLAS cohort study, conducted between October 2018 and April 2019. Using a multistage stratified cluster random sampling method, participants were recruited to represent individuals aged 60 and older living in urban areas of Birjand. Inclusion criteria required participants to be 60 years or older and residing in Birjand. Exclusions were applied to individuals who were completely bedridden, had severe cognitive impairments, Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease that hindered communication, or a life expectancy of less than six months [15]. For the current study, participants with missing data on gait speed, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) or handgrip strength were also excluded (n= 92). Finally, 1325 participants were included in the current analysis.

The criteria and tests for sarcopenia were selected based on the recommendations of EWGSOP2 [16].

Gait speed was assessed as a measure of physical performance and to evaluate stature-dependent sarcopenia risk. Participants’ maximum gait speed was measured over a distance of 15 feet (4.57 m), with the results reported in meters per second (m/s). The average gait speed was calculated from three consecutive attempts, and the mean value was used for analysis [17]. A gait speed of 0.8 m/s or lower was considered the threshold for low physical performance [16].

Handgrip strength was used as a measure of muscle strength, assessed with an electronic hand dynamometer (Saehan, Seoul, Korea). The dynamometer was adjusted to fit each participant’s hand size. Participants performed the assessment while seated, with their arms and forearms at a 90-degree angle. Handgrip strength was measured three times for each hand, with a two-minute rest between each measurement. The highest value from both hands across the six measurements was recorded [18]. For this analysis, low grip strength was defined as less than 27 kg for males and less than 16 kg for females [16].

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) was used to assess muscle quantity, measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Low muscle mass was defined as an ASMM value below 20 kg for males and below 15 kg for females [16,19].

According to the EWGSOP2, probable sarcopenia was defined by low handgrip strength. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was confirmed when low handgrip strength was accompanied by evidence of reduced muscle quality and quantity (low ASMM). Severe sarcopenia was characterized by low handgrip strength, decreased muscle mass (low ASMM), and impaired physical performance (low gait speed) [16]. The binary sarcopenia variable was constructed by combining probable sarcopenia, sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia cases.

This study used a semi-quantitative food questionnaire to assess the consumption of various food groups, including meats (red meat, poultry, fish, eggs), dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt), fruits and vegetables, legumes (lentils, peas, kidney beans, etc.), and cereal and cereal products. To minimize recall bias, a validated dietary assessment was used and trained interviewers collected the dietary data. Data on the daily and weekly frequency of food consumption, as well as portion sizes, were collected. The information was analyzed using N4 software to calculate macro- and micronutrient intake, along with daily energy consumption.

The daily consumption of various types and forms of bread was recorded, including the total daily intake of white breads (including industrial toast and baguette bread, plus traditional taftoon bread) and whole-grain breads (traditional bread including barbari and sangak), measured in grams. To assess bread intake patterns, energy adjustment was performed using the residual method. In this approach, a linear regression model was constructed for each bread type, with total energy intake (kcal/day) as the independent variable and the absolute intake of each bread type (g/day) as the dependent variable. The residuals from this model, representing the variation in bread intake not explained by total energy intake, were then saved and used as energy-adjusted values [20] (see supplementary Table 1). In this approach, the energy-adjusted intake is calculated as the residual from a regression model where energy intake (Kcal) is the independent variable and absolute dietary intake is the dependent variable. The residual represents nutrient intake that is not correlated with energy intake [21].

Factor analysis with orthogonal (Varimax) rotation was conducted to identify underlying bread consumption patterns based on responses from the food frequency questionnaire. This data reduction technique allows for grouping correlated food items (here, various types of bread) into distinct patterns that represent common consumption behaviors within the population. Prior to performing factor analysis, the suitability of the data was assessed using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, which yielded a value of 0.50, indicating moderate adequacy for factor analysis.

Two factors were extracted based on eigenvalues greater than 1.0 and examination of the scree plot. These two factors explained a combined 100% of the total variance in bread consumption, with the first factor (interpreted as the white bread pattern) accounting for 63.49% of the variance (eigenvalue = 1.27), and the second factor (whole-grain bread pattern) accounting for 36.51% of the variance (eigenvalue = 0.73). Bread items with factor loadings of ≥ |0.30| were considered significant contributors to each pattern. The white bread pattern primarily included refined bread types such as taftoon, toast and baguette, while the whole-grain bread pattern was characterized by items such as sangak and barbari.

Each participant received a factor score for both identified patterns, reflecting their degree of adherence to each bread intake pattern. These scores were then categorized into quartiles and used as exposure variables in subsequent regression analyses.

The study employed detailed questionnaires to gather data on participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, including age, gender, education, marital status, smoking habits, chronic diseases, use of medication, nutritional status, and employment status. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing participants’ weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared. Physical activity was assessed by The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) physical activity questionnaire (LAPAQ) [22]. and participants were classified as inactive (0 MET-minute/ week), low (1-600 MET-minute/ week), or moderate (601–1500 MET-minute/ week) physical activity [25]. Chronic medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension (HTN), were self-reported by the participants.

All values were presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, frequency (%) for categorical variables, and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to represent associations. The frequency of categorical variables, such as marital status and physical activity, across bread consumption groups was assessed using Chi-square test. Independent t-test was used to compare the amount of bread consumption and other demographic variables between healthy and sarcopenia groups. Normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and visual inspection of histograms. Homogeneity of variances was checked using Levene’s test. Since assumptions of normality and/or equal variances were met for all variables, log transformation was not applied. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between energy-adjusted bread consumption pattern and sarcopenia. The linearity of continuous covariates with the log odds was checked, and multicollinearity among predictors was assessed using variance inflation factors. Confounders were chosen and added to the adjusted models based on the literature review [23] and the forward approach, including age, sex, physical activity, marital status, education, diabetes mellitus, dietary protein intake, and BMI.

Data were analyzed using STATA software version 16 (StataCorp. 2019.Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC.), with a significance level set at a P-value of less than 0.05.

The general characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table1. The distribution of males (48%) and females (52%) was nearly equal among the elderly participants in this study, with a mean age of 69.73 years (SD = 7.60). The majority of participants were married (81.3%) and identified as non-smokers (93%). However, only a small fraction had pursued a university education (7.6%), and even fewer were still employed and actively working (3.2%). None of the elderly participants demonstrated a high level of physical activity. However, the majority engaged in moderate physical activity (n= 654, 49.4%) and were overweight (mean (SD) = 26.43 (5.32)). In terms of health status, 721 (55.2%) participants were affected by multiple chronic conditions, and nearly one-third (35.1%) were taking more than three medications daily.

A total of 372 participants were affected by sarcopenia. Participants with sarcopenia were significantly older (P˂ 0.001), lighter in weight (P˂ 0.001), and less educated (P˂ 0.001). There were also significant differences between the sarcopenic and healthy groups regarding multimorbidity (P= 0.02), physical activity (0.05), and marital status (P= 0.001).

Regarding the sarcopenia test scores, as expected, lower handgrip strength and ASMM were observed among the sarcopenic group (P˂ 0.001). The healthy group had a mean gait speed of 0.96 (0.43) m/s, while the sarcopenic group had a mean of 0.93 (0.35) m/s. Although no statistically significant difference was found in gait speed between the two groups (P= 0.22), even a modest difference highlights a notable contrast in the elderly’s ability to perform daily activities [24].

The mean daily calorie intake for this sample of Iranian older adults was 925.48 (SD = 274.28) Kcal, with the sarcopenic group showing a slightly lower intake (916.31 (279.96) vs. 929.00 (272.96) Kcal,P= 0.45). Carbohydrate intake was similar between the two groups (P= 0.26). However, dietary protein intake was significantly lower in the sarcopenic group (P= 0.04), while fat intake was notably higher (P= 0.05).

Overall, participants in this study consumed an average of 52.96 gr of bread daily. The intake of white bread (13.94 (12.86) gr) was lower than that of whole-grain bread (39.02 (25.92) gr). When comparing healthy versus older adults with sarcopenia, a significantly higher consumption of white bread (P= 0.04) and a lower consumption of whole-grain bread (P= 0.03) were observed in those with sarcopenia.

After creating the energy-adjusted bread consumption patterns, the scores of the three sarcopenia tests across the quartiles of white and whole-grain bread consumption patterns were compared with the results presented in Fig.1. A sinusoidal graph was drawn for whole-grain and white bread consumption patterns with ASMM and handgrip strength. However, fluctuations across quartiles were less pronounced for both whole-grain and white-bread consumption patterns in relation to gait speed. The One-way ANOVA test revealed significant differences in ASMM, gait speed, and handgrip strength across the quartiles of whole-grain and white-bread consumption patterns (AllP-values˂ 0.05).

The result of binary regression analysis is represented in Table2. The association between energy-adjusted whole-grain bread consumption patterns and ASMM did not reach the threshold for statistical significance. In contrast, the second (OR: 2.04; 95%CI: 1.36 to 3.07,P= 0.001) and fourth quartile of white-bread consumption pattern (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.03 to 2.37,P= 0.04) emerged as notable risk factors for muscle mass deterioration. This association remained significant after adding confounders to the model (OR: 2.04; 95%CI: 1.15 to 3.60,P= 0.01 And OR: 2.23; 95%CI: 1.24 to 4.02,P= 0.01 for the 2nd and 4th quartiles respectively), but became non-significant after adjusting for marital status and education.

Similar to ASMM, gait speed was significantly associated only with the white bread consumption pattern. Specifically, individuals in the second quartile of white bread intake had a 1.63-fold higher risk of impaired physical performance (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.22,P= 0.002). Adjusting for age and sex did not change this significant association (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.09,P= 0.04), but further adjustments for additional confounders resulted in the loss of significance.

Regarding handgrip strength, the whole-grain bread consumption pattern was significantly associated with a preservation of muscle strength, while the white bread consumption pattern was significantly linked to an increased risk of muscle strength loss. the association of the third and fourth quartiles of whole-grain bread pattern were significantly associated with grip strength even after adjusting for all confounders (OR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.50 to 0.98,P= 0.04 And OR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.48 to 0.95,P= 0.02 for the 3rd and 4th quartiles respectively). The fourth quartile of the white bread consumption pattern doubled the risk of muscle strength loss (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.74,P< 0.001), with this association remaining significant after adjusting for all confounders in the model (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.38,P= 0.003 in the highest quartile of the final adjusted model).

The binary variable for sarcopenia, which was created based on the results of all three tests, was assessed in relation to bread consumption patterns. The findings indicated that, whether in the crude or adjusted models, the third and fourth quartiles of whole-grain bread consumption were associated with a reduced risk of sarcopenia (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.93,P= 0.02; and OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.90,P= 0.01 for the third and fourth quartiles of the final adjusted model respectively). In contrast, the fourth quartile of white bread consumption was a significant risk factor for sarcopenia in both the crude and adjusted models (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.37,P= 0.01 for the final adjusted model).

This study investigated the relationship between energy-adjusted bread consumption patterns and sarcopenia in elderly Iranian adults. Significant differences in muscle strength were observed across quartiles of both whole-grain and white bread consumption patterns. Notably, higher whole-grain bread intake was associated with better muscle strength preservation, while white bread consumption was linked not only to lower muscle strength but also to increased risks of muscle mass deterioration and overall sarcopenia. Most of these associations remained strong even after adjustments for confounders.

Although some studies have explored the relationship between diet and sarcopenia parameters like muscle mass, handgrip strength, and gait speed, most focus on general dietary patterns or specific nutrients, such as fiber and protein. Comparing the results of this study to the existing literature is challenging due to its novel approach.

Regarding muscle mass (ASMM), evidence suggests that healthy diets, such as the Mediterranean dietary pattern, which are rich in fiber, have a positive impact on muscle mass and function [25,26]. While some studies have reported no significant association between dietary patterns characterized by bread and low muscle mass, these studies did not differentiate between white and whole-grain bread, grouping them together within the same dietary pattern [27,28].

Contradictory findings have been reported regarding handgrip strength. For instance, a cross-sectional study in the UK involving approximately 68,000 participants found a negative association between bread consumption and grip strength in men, but no association in women [29]. In contrast, another study within the same population reported a protective relationship between a prudent dietary pattern, characterized by higher whole-grain and lower white bread consumption, and grip strength in both men and women [30]. The findings of current study align more closely with the latter study. The first study did not distinguish between white and whole-grain bread, combining them in the analysis.

No significant relationship was found between gait speed and bread consumption patterns, except for the second quartile of the white bread pattern, which became non-significant after adjustment for confounders. This aligns with findings from a cross-sectional study that reported no significant association between an antioxidant dietary pattern which included bread, and gait speed in adults aged ≥ 55 years [31]. However, other studies have identified a significant positive relationship between dietary fiber intake and gait speed [32,33]. This finding may be explained by the fact that whole-grain bread has been assessed as a source of fiber, rather than total dietary fiber intake, making the results not entirely comparable to those of the mentioned studies. The yeilded non-significant results of this research may also be explained by the limited number of participants with severe sarcopenia. According to the EWGSOP2 criteria [16], gait speed is the final test for sarcopenia assessment, and in individuals with low grip strength and ASMM, a gait speed below the cut-off confirms severe sarcopenia. In the current sample, only 123 participants (9.3% of the population) exhibited such characteristics. This small subgroup size limits the ability to detect meaningful associations. Future research should investigate this relationship in larger samples of individuals with severe sarcopenia to provide more robust insights.

This study found that higher white bread intake was associated with greater odds of sarcopenia, while following a whole-grain bread intake pattern reduced the risk by approximately 63% (result for the 4th quartile). Several mechanisms explain these effects, with one key factor being the differing nutrient densities of the two types of bread. Whole-grain bread is rich in B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, etc., while white bread, made from refined grains, has lost much of its nutrient content during processing [34]. These nutrients are crucial for maintaining muscle health. For example, magnesium, the second most abundant intracellular cation, is involved in over 600 enzymatic reactions, including energy metabolism and protein synthesis [35]. B vitamins, particularly B1, B6, and B12, support nervous system health, including the nerves that control muscle movement [36]. Zinc is essential for the enzymes involved in energy metabolism required for muscle contraction and function [37]. Thus, the protective effect of whole-grain bread and the increased risk associated with white bread may be attributed to the presence of these essential nutrients.

Another mechanism to discuss is the glycemic control. Whole grain bread contains complex carbohydrates and fiber, which result in slower digestion and smoother fluctuations in blood sugar. However, refined carbohydrate in white bread causes rapid spikes and crashes in blood glucose levels. Insulin, secreted following the rise in blood glucose levels, promotes the uptake of amino acids into muscle cells, facilitating protein synthesis and muscle growth. Fluctuations in blood sugar levels can lead to insulin resistance, impairing muscle protein synthesis and increasing the risk of muscle loss [38,39]. Therefore, consuming whole-grain bread with a low glycemic index, can help maintain stable blood sugar levels, supporting muscle health.

The fiber content of whole-grain bread reduces the risk of sarcopenia through two distinct mechanisms. First, it helps reduce inflammation, which is a key contributor to muscle degradation in sarcopenia [40]. Dietary fiber is fermented by the gut microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [41]. The second mechanism involves the modulation of the gut microbiota, which plays an essential role in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly through the maintenance of amino acid homeostasis. Certain beneficial microbiome species, such asLactobacilli, enhance amino acid absorption [42,43], thereby supporting muscle health. In summary, the fiber in whole-grain bread not only has direct anti-inflammatory effects but also fosters a healthier gut microbiome, both of which contribute to the prevention of sarcopenia.

To our knowledge, no other studies have specifically examined the relationship between bread consumption patterns and sarcopenia in the elderly population. Energy-adjusted bread consumption data was utilized, which not only mitigated the confounding effects of total energy intake but also provided a more accurate representation of dietary quality. Another strength of this study is the adjustment for numerous confounding variables, which enhanced the statistical power of the findings.

This study also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. The generalizability of the current findings is limited by both the cross-sectional design of the study and the specific types of bread assessed, which reflect common consumption patterns in Iran but may differ from those in other populations. Additionally, the study focused on well-functioning, community-dwelling older adults who were capable of independently participating in the evaluations, which may have introduced selection bias. Recall bias is another potential limitation, given that we relied on a semi-quantitative FFQ to collect dietary information. Furthermore, some participants reported consuming homemade bread, but since we did not have information on the ingredients or baking methods for this type of bread, it was excluded from the analysis. In addition, the wide confidence intervals in the yielded results suggest some uncertainty, so the clinical relevance should be interpreted with caution, especially given the multifactorial nature of sarcopenia. Lastly, economic and physical factors may have influenced bread consumption patterns in the studied population. White bread is often more expensive than whole grain bread, and its texture can be more challenging for older adults to chew, which could explain the lower reported intake of white bread.

This study explored the link between energy-adjusted whole-grain and white bread consumption patterns among the geriatric population. It was observed that higher whole-grain bread consumption was associated with better muscle strength retention, while greater white bread intake was linked to decreased muscle strength, increased risk of muscle mass loss, and overall sarcopenia. We hope the insights from this study will guide simple dietary recommendations for bread, a staple food, to significantly enhance health outcomes and support healthier aging in the elderly population. Future studies should explore the underlying mechanisms between bread consumption and sarcopenia, assess the impact of other dietary patterns, and investigate the potential benefits of whole-grain bread and harms of white bread intake in larger, more diverse populations. Long-term longitudinal studies could also provide more insights into the direction of these relationships and validate the findings of the current research. Future studies should also include more diverse groups of older adults, such as those in nursing homes or with cognitive impairments, and include more detailed questions in the dietary questionnaire (e.g. regarding the homemade bread) to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment. Additionally, since the consumption of a specific type of bread may be associated with other dietary choices and an overall healthier diet that contributes to muscle health, future research could benefit from using factor analysis to derive dietary patterns and better account for these associations.
