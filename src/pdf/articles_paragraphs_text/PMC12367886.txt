Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with maternal morbidity, mortality, hospital readmissions, and significant costs to healthcare systems.

The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and maternal morbidity is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The interaction of rural residence, race, and non-medical drivers of health can create significant barriers to post-partum care in rural communities. Novel models of care, including remote blood pressure monitoring, telehealth, and application-based approaches, may offer ways to reach rural patients after hypertensive pregnancy.

There are significant opportunities to create novel multi-modal and multi-disciplinary approaches to post-partum care of HDP. Tailoring and evaluating the approach in rural communities is an important next step to improve care.

The prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal stages of pregnancy form a critical window that uniquely and collectively impacts both maternal and fetal health outcomes. In the United States, many women of childbearing age live in areas with inadequate maternal healthcare infrastructure, often referred to as “maternity care deserts” [1]. These deserts are especially common in rural areas, where they contribute to an increased risk of preventable maternal morbidity and mortality. In a 2022 report, approximately 2.2 million women of child-bearing age lived in maternity care deserts in the United States, and the numbers are likely to continue to grow [2].

Among the various maternal gestational diseases, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia (Table1), are a leading cause of maternal health complications and deaths [3]. They account for 8% of pregnancy-related deaths [4] and 31% of postpartum readmissions [5]. HDP may go undiagnosed, as well as un- or under-treated [6]. The burden of HDP on healthcare systems continues to rise, with an increased risk of readmission in women with HDP as compared to normotensive pregnancy [7]. According to the Nationwide Readmission Database from 2013 to 2014, HDP resulted in an excess of over 400,000 hospital days and inpatient care costs of $731 million as compared to normotensive pregnancies [5].

Diagnostic criteria for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy based on most recent American college of obstetrics and gynecology guidelines [3].

In women with proteinuria predating pregnancy, a significant and sustained increase in proteinuria may indicate the presence of superimposed preeclampsia.

Many innovative strategies, such as digital health [6,8] and community health resources [9], hold potential to reduce systemic inequities in rural areas and have demonstrated early positive results. In this review, we will evaluate systemic disparities in accessing care for HDP in rural communities, and highlight promising approaches directed at addressing these critical maternal health challenges.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide [10,11]. A study of Olmsted County, Minnesota residents who gave birth from 1976 to 1982 found that 7.3% of pregnancies were impacted by HDP; however, when analyzed on a per-woman basis, 15.3% of women experienced at least one episode of HDP [11]. Rates of HDP have been increasing in the modern era, in part due to older age and more comorbidities at first pregnancy [10,12,13]. Although maternal mortality has significantly declined in many developed countries over time, it remains unacceptably high in the United States, with 23.8 deaths for every 100,000 live births in 2020 [14]. While direct obstetric complications were previously the main underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths, cardiovascular deaths now account for the majority [15].

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have been identified as risk factors for multiple long-term adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) [16,17], stroke [18], and cardiomyopathy [19], as well as multiple CVD risk factors, including hypertension [20,21], hyperlipidemia, and diabetes [16,22,23]. Notably, those with preterm or recurrent preeclampsia face an even higher risk of developing CVD [16,24,25]. In an analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2014, women with HDP had a higher risk of stroke compared to those without HDP (34.5% vs. 6.9%,p< 0.0001), and there was a 2-fold higher risk in black and Hispanic women as compared to non-Hispanic, white females [26]. HDP also increase the risk of long-term kidney disease, particularly end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) [27,28]. The risk of ESKD among women with preeclampsia is 4.9 times higher compared to those with normotensive pregnancies, while those with gestational hypertension face a 3.6-fold increased risk, between 15 and 20 years after an affected pregnancy [27,29]. However, despite the high relative risk, the absolute risk of ESKD remains low at 3.7 per 100,000 women per year [29].

The post-partum period after HDP, also called the ‘fourth trimester’, is high risk for complications and mortality, including risks of peripartum cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular conditions such as congenital, ischemic, and valvular heart disease [15,30]. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 18.6% of maternal deaths occur between 1 and 6 days postpartum, 21.4% between 7 and 42 days postpartum, and 11.7% up to 365 days postpartum [30]. A significant contributor to these concerning rates is the inadequate management of HDP, which remains a leading cause of early postpartum hospital readmissions [5].

Preeclampsia, one of the most severe forms of HDP (Table1), increases the potential of early readmission by almost 4-fold [31]. In a multi-site study within the United States of nearly 30,000 post-partum individuals, age, parity, diastolic blood pressure, birthweight, preeclampsia, and mode of delivery incorporated into a model were able to predict the risk of readmission with decent discrimination (C-statistic 0.8, 95% CI 0.8–0.8), demonstrating the importance of preeclampsia in readmission risk [32]. According to the Nationwide Readmissions Database in 2013/2014, HDP were associated with a 100% increase in potentially preventable readmissions in the first 42 days after delivery [5]. The risk of heart failure and pulmonary edema in the first 60 days after delivery are increased 8-fold in patients with the most severe HDP types, such as preeclampsia [33]. A study in Maine found that 4% of people will have at least one acute care visit in the 1st year after delivery for HDP [30]. Strategies are needed to prevent readmission while maintaining patient safety after HDP.

The post-partum visit is an essential part of HDP care, but follow through is poor, with only around 50% of patients presenting to scheduled visits [34,35,36]. During a post-partum visit, the maternal physical and mental health are assessed, pregnancy-related complications are addressed, and necessary education and support are provided [36]. In a well-resourced clinic designed for follow up after HDP specifically, approximately 25% of people did not appear for post-partum care visits [37]. In 60% of cases, it was due to either maternal or fetal medical issues or readmissions, but in 40% of cases it was due to transportation barriers, the need for care of other children, or communication challenges [37]. Only 40% of women with Medicaid attend their six-week appointments after delivery [6]. Post-partum follow-ups also allow for the close monitoring of women with chronic diseases while providing contraceptive counseling and establishing continuity of care. In a qualitative study on post-partum barriers to care in rural Arizona, several key themes emerged, including structural obstacles to access, need for more comprehensive health information, importance of sustained care, and the need for social support due to financial constraints [38].

The incidence of HDP is rising in both urban and rural areas. A recent study using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Natality databases found that the age-adjusted incidence of HDPs increased in both urban and rural settings in the years 2007 to 2019 [39]. However, people living in rural areas remained 9% more likely to have HDPs than their urban counterparts [39], and were 9% more likely to have severe maternal morbidity and mortality, including stroke, pulmonary edema and heart failure [40]. Another study using U.S. Natality data from 2016 to 2018 found that the prevalence of HDP was 7.4% in rural areas compared to 6.6% in urban areas [41].

Alongside this risk in HDP incidence, is the economic strain on healthcare systems in underserved communities, leading to significant staff shortages and closure of many obstetric units, particularly in rural areas [42]. From 2010 to 2020, over 100 rural hospitals closed, drastically reducing access to care and further enhancing racial and socioeconomic disparities [42]. As a result, many women must travel long distances to receive care, and some lack reliable transportation altogether. Insurance coverage is another barrier to care. According to the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring system, collecting data from 43 states from 2016 to 2019, rural residents were more likely to be uninsured at each stage of pregnancy as compared to urban residents (12.7% vs. 9.8% in postpartum period) [43]. More than 20% of rural residents with less than a high school education, with incomes less than 138% of the federal poverty level, and who live in Medicaid non–expansion states, were also uninsured in this analysis. Until recently, Medicaid coverage for postpartum care ended 60 days after delivery for almost all enrollees, leaving economically disadvantaged women particularly vulnerable [43]. The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act allowed 47 states and DC to extend Medicaid coverage to 12 months following delivery, with only Arkansas and Wisconsin not yet adopting this approach as of March 2025 [44].

Maternal race has been associated with HDP incidence and complications. Non-Hispanic black women are more likely to begin pregnancy with chronic hypertension and develop preeclampsia compared to non-Hispanic white women [45]. The interaction of race and income can impact HDP outcomes, as well. A study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample found that while high-income white women had lower odds of in-hospital mortality and multiple other complications related to preeclampsia compared to low-income white women, the same was not true for black women, where the higher-income group did not have lower mortality or in-hospital complications from preeclampsia [46]. This may represent ‘diminishing returns’, whereby black women do not experience the same health benefits associated with having a higher income as white women, likely due to systemic factors.

Higher rates of HDP have been linked to non-medical drivers of health, also known as social determinants of health, more broadly, including lower income, education levels, and delayed prenatal care enrollment [47]. Patients with Medicaid or public insurance are more likely to experience HDP [47]. Around 50% of births in rural areas are financed by Medicaid, compared to 43% of births in urban areas [40]. Marital status may also contribute to maternal health inequities [48]. Approximately 40% of mothers in the US serve as the sole or main financial providers for their families [48]. Women in underserved communities confront particular financial difficulties that force them to choose between basic needs including housing, childcare, food, and medical care [48]. Additional factors that can impact post-partum care in lower income women include mental health issues, language barriers, limited family or community support, low health literacy, partner abuse, childcare responsibilities, and fear of legal repercussions, particularly for women who are undocumented or have histories of substance use [49]. The interaction between these non-medical drivers of health and rural residence is likely to lead to significant barriers to post-partum care after HDP (Fig.1).

The increasing availability and accessibility of digital health care services and interventions offer a chance to expand access to care [6]. These tools can help improve the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of pregnancy-related health and conditions, beyond conventional care settings [50]. In particular, remote monitoring has become a popular and efficient way to connect patients with providers and provide the necessary healthcare information, especially for those with limited health literacy [50]. While few studies [50] have specifically examined the effects of remote monitoring on rural women with HDP, existing research provides valuable insights into its feasibility and benefits in similar contexts.

Digital health has been utilized in pregnancy in a number of ways. A pilot study on remote blood pressure (BP) monitoring for prenatal management in rural Appalachia revealed high patient retention rates, early detections of severe BP elevations, and a reduction in hospital readmissions related to HDP [50]. Interestingly, women enrolled in the study still missed nearly 50% of prenatal visits during the study period. A large retrospective analysis comparing remote blood pressure BP monitoring with conventional care found that remote monitoring did not delay the diagnosis of preeclampsia, effectively maintaining diagnostic standards [51]. A randomized trial of over 400 women, comparing standard of care (follow-up for BP check within 7–10 days) and remote BP monitoring with a tablet and Bluetooth enabled BP cuff, found that the remote monitoring resulted in fewer hypertension-related readmissions compared to the controls (1 [0.5%] vs. 8 [3.7%], adjusted relative risk 0.12; 95% CI: 0.01–0.96) [8]. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention found that there was potential savings of 31 million US dollars per year due to reductions in admissions and higher quality of life [52].

The Her-HEART program is a mobile-health tool designed to educate people with HDPs and their physicians on future CVD risks and prevention strategies [53]. In a qualitative study of 20 participants using the application, several barriers to education on HDP and CVD risk in the post-partum period emerged, including the impact of traumatic birth experiences, inappropriate timing of education, and competing priorities after delivery. However, the participants reported that the Her-HEART application was an effective way to provide counselling on long-term cardiovascular risks after patients had left the hospital. Another approach to reach patients is through text messaging. Hirshberg et al. found that text reminders improved the number of women with HDP who recorded BPs within 10 days after discharge, with 92.2% remotely recording a BP with text messages vs. 43.7% with office visits only [54]. Further research is required to directly evaluate the effect of these interventions on local populations in order to develop tailored solution for the specific challenges of providing healthcare in rural areas. Improving healthcare outcomes among women in rural areas also requires addressing non-medical drivers of health, such as income, education, housing, social support, and access to nutritious food [42]. Community health workers (CHWs), who are qualified professionals with similar lived experiences, cultural values, and language, could play an important role in addressing these other factors that impact health. [55]. CHWs can act as reliable mediators, providing peer support, relevant education, and links to essential resources for women. Despite the lack of research on the particular effects of CHWs on post-partum care, a systematic analysis of 16 RCTs indicated that integrating CHWs into care teams significantly decreased emergency department visits (23%-51%), urgent care visits (60%), and hospitalizations (21%-50%) [9]. Although more studies are required to assess CHWs role in managing chronic diseases, as well as the associated costs and feasibility, their integration with other strategies could effectively address barriers and enhance access to post-partum care. Since most hospital readmissions for HDP occur during the first week after discharge, it is essential to identify at-risk women and implement appropriate management strategies during hospitalization, including scheduling timely follow-up consultations. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers exciting possibilities to enhance this process. AI models predicting preeclampsia have been developed, however many are generated at single sites and thus cannot be used across diverse settings. [32,56]. To increase robustness and enhance reliability of these models, integrating data from multiple centers is essential [32]. Finally, to facilitate the integration of AI into clinical practice, it is important to address concerns related to data privacy and security [56].

Addressing the barriers faced by women with HDP living in rural areas requires the development and assessment of an organized, interdisciplinary approach. These strategies should include identifying at-risk patients, evaluating their clinical and social needs, providing timely interventions, and preventing future complications. Continuity of care can be improved by providing BP monitors along with setting up follow-up telehealth appointments prior to discharge. Finally, integrating CHWs to the postpartum team can improve care, significantly enhancing patients’ health outcomes.
