Inguinal hernia (IH) is a common condition with a substantial health burden and emerging evidence suggests that lipid metabolism-related indicators may contribute to its risk. However, the exact role of specific lipid types in causing IH is still unclear. This study aims to investigate whether any of 179 distinct lipid species have a causal impact on IH risk using causal inference. We applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, integrating lipidomic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from 7,174 Finnish individuals with IH summary statistics from the UK Biobank (16,749 cases and 439,599 controls). Linkage disequilibrium pruning and genome-wide significance (P< 5E-8) were used to choose genetic instruments. Primary causal estimates were derived with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and further supported by weighted median (WM) and robust adjusted profile score (RAPS). We employed sensitivity tests, like Cochran’s Q for heterogeneity, MR-Egger for directional pleiotropy, Radial MR for outlier detection, and leave-one-out analysis to measure the impact of individual variants. Among 179 lipid species, 162 had valid IVs, and 94 met the criteria for causal inference. IVW analysis identified 25 lipid species with nominal significance, 24 of which were supported by WM and RAPS. Sensitivity analyses consistently provided robust evidence supporting a causal relationship between four lipid species and increased IH risk: diacylglycerol (18:1_18:1) (OR = 1.16,P= 0.005), diacylglycerol (18:1_18:2) (OR = 1.12,P= 0.006), phosphatidylinositol (18:0_20:4) (OR = 1.10,P= 1.47E-04), and triacylglycerol (54:6) (OR = 1.21,P= 0.001). Our findings provides genetic molecular evidence that four lipid species are causally linked to an increased IH susceptibility, offering novel insights into lipid-centered interventions for disease prevention and highlighting the importance of metabolic health in hernia pathogenesis.

Inguinal hernia (IH) is a prevalent gastrointestinal surgical condition with significant clinical and economic implications, often requiring surgical intervention (International2018). Globally, approximately 20 million IH repair procedures are performed annually (Estridge et al.2019). It arises from the protrusion of abdominal contents through a weakened inguinal canal and is commonly attributed to structural defects, aging, and male sex (Pilkington et al.2021). Yet, emerging evidence suggests that metabolic factors, particularly lipid dysregulation, may play a contributory role in its pathogenesis (Burcharth et al.2013; Howard et al.2022). Lipids are fundamental components of cell membranes and extracellular matrix; thus, dysregulated lipid homeostasis might impair connective tissue integrity and healing, increasing susceptibility to herniation (Ke et al.2022; Dietz et al.2021). Observational studies have linked obesity—a key metabolic disorder—to an increased risk of surgical site infections and postoperative IH development (Ke et al.2022; Dietz et al.2021; Robinson et al.2020). Notably, lipid-related indices appear to serve as more precise diagnostic markers of excessive adiposity (Robinson et al.2020). Previous studies examining metabolic influences on IH have encountered limitations. Observational analyses of obesity and body composition have yielded inconsistent results, in part because broad measures like body mass index (BMI) do not distinguish fat distribution or metabolic health (Hemberg et al.2022). For example, visceral adiposity rather than overall BMI appears more closely associated with IH risk (Hemberg et al.2022). These limitations underscore the need for more precise metabolic markers. Lipid-related indices have been proposed as better measures of adiposity and metabolic risk, but the specific lipid species contributing to IH remain unknown. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies increasingly suggest that traits linked to lipid metabolism like BMI, body fat percentage, and fat distribution play a causal role in IH risk (Li et al.2024,2023; Shi et al.2024; Xv et al.2024). However, a comprehensive lipidomic analysis to pinpoint individual lipid species involved in IH pathogenesis has not been previously reportedAdvancements in genomic and lipidomic research have significantly improved our understanding of IH pathophysiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered genetic loci linked to IH risk, suggesting a possible role for lipid metabolism in its development (Jiang et al.2021). Furthermore, beyond conventional lipid indicators such as low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the latest release of comprehensive lipidomic GWAS datasets provides a unique opportunity to investigate specific lipid species that may be implicated in IH pathogenesis (Ottensmann et al.2023). By employing genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), MR enables more reliable inference of causality between lipid metabolism and IH risk, effectively addressing limitations such as confounding and reverse causation inherent to observational designs (Zheng and Tan2024; Chen et al.2024).

To deepen understanding of how lipid metabolism relates to IH, this study applies MR analysis to investigate the causal impact of 179 lipidomic variants on IH development. By integrating large-scale, recently released lipidomic and IH GWAS datasets, we seek to identify specific lipid species that may causally modify IH risk. These findings will enhance our understanding of IH pathophysiology and may inform targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies by modulating lipid metabolism for improved clinical outcomes.

An overview of the methodological framework for the two-sample MR analysis is presented in Fig.1. This study integrates recently published lipidomic GWAS data (179 lipid species) and IH GWAS summary statistics to investigate potential causal relationships and identify lipid species that may modulate IH risk. First, genetic variants serving as IVs were identified from 179 lipidomic GWAS datasets. Following harmonization with IH GWAS data, the selected genetic variants were used in MR analysis under three key assumptions: relevance (strong association with lipid traits), independence (no relation to confounders), and exclusion restriction (no direct effect on IH except through lipids).

Lipidomic data were obtained from a cohort of 7,174 individuals from Finland, which includes 179 lipid species measured through comprehensive lipidomic profiling. The full summary statistics of these lipid traits are cataloged in the HGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog database (Lipidomic GWAS: GCST90277238 to GCST90277416 available athttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/publications/37907536)15. Detailed characteristics of these 179 lipid species are provided in TableS1. To ensure sample independence in the two-sample MR design, the IH GWAS dataset was derived from the UK Biobank, comprising 456,348 individuals of European ancestry, including 16,749 IH cases and 439,599 controls (Jiang et al.2021). The IH GWAS summary statistics were also downloaded from the GWAS Catalog (GCST90044147 available athttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/studies/GCST90044147). The datasets analyzed in this work originate from ethically approved, previously conducted studies. Given that only de-identified, publicly available summary statistics were reanalyzed, this study did not require additional ethical oversight.

To infer causality between lipid traits and IH, genetic IVs were selected from the 179 lipidomic GWAS datasets based on the following criteria: genome-wide significance (P< 5E-8) to ensure strong genetic association; linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning (r^2 < 0.001 within a 10,000 kb window) to retain independent variants; F-statistic (beta^2/SE^2) > 10 to exclude weak IVs and minimize weak instrument bias; Further LD filtering using LDlink (r= 0.1 within ± 500,000 bp) to eliminate SNPs with potential confounding effects (Zheng et al.2024). The exclusion restriction assumption requires that causal estimates remain robust in the absence of horizontal pleiotropy, which was thoroughly assessed in our subsequent sensitivity analyses. Under these stringent criteria, lipid traits that did not meet the strong MR criteria as IVs, or had fewer than three independent IVs, were excluded from further analysis to ensure the consistence of MR inferences.

Each lipid trait was analyzed via MR using TwoSampleMR (v0.5.8) in R (v4.3.1), employing the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach as the principal method for causal inference. The IVW aggregates Wald estimates across genetic instruments to obtain a meta-effect estimate of lipid traits on IH risk. To enhance the robustness of causal inference and mitigate potential pleiotropic bias, additional analyses were conducted using the Weighted Median (WM) and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods. A lipid trait was considered to have a significant causal effect if the IVW method produced a statistically significantP-value (P< 0.05) and the result was consistently supported by both WM and RAPS analyses, qualifying it for further sensitivity assessments. In this study, we applied aP-value threshold of < 0.05 for statistical significance, deliberately opting not to implement a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This decision was made to maintain the exploratory nature of our research and to avoid overlooking potential causal relationships between lipid traits and IH risk (Zheng and Tan2024). Given the binary nature of IH as an outcome, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported to quantify the effect size of lipid traits on IH risk.

To assess the stability of the MR estimates, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity among instrument-specific effects was evaluated with Cochran’s Q test, whereP< 0.05 indicates possible heterogeneous effects (suggesting that a random-effects IVW model may be more appropriate). The MR-Egger intercept test examined directional pleiotropy; a significant intercept would suggest bias from non-lipid pathways (Bowden et al.2015). A nonzero intercept (P< 0.05) would indicate potential pleiotropic bias. Additionally, a leave-one-out analysis assessed the influence of individual variants on the aggregate estimate by sequentially omitting each SNP. Radial MR-Egger (intercept) analysis was further employed to reassess MR estimates and detect potential pleiotropic outliers, providing adjusted causal estimates after outlier removal. This approach allowed for a more rigorous evaluation of whether pleiotropic variants influenced the observed causal effects (Bowden et al.2018). Any outliers detected were removed, and the MR analyses were rerun to ensure that the causal estimates were not driven by those variants. Only lipid traits that met the significance threshold across all three MR methods (IVW, WM, and RAPS) and remained robust in sensitivity analyses were considered to have a significant causal relationship with IH. All analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.2,www.r-project.org), with the following R packages: TwoSampleMR (version 0.5.11), mr.raps (version 0.4.1), and RadialMR (version 1.1).

To estimate the potential causal effects of 179 lipid species on IH, we first identified genetic IVs for these lipid traits. Based on stringent criteria ensuring strong association and independence, 162 lipid species were successfully assigned valid IVs, with F-statistics ranging from 29.79 to 1946.15, conforming no weak instrument bias (TableS2). For statistical rigor, 68 lipids with fewer than three IVs were excluded (29 lipids had fewer than one IV, and 39 had fewer than two IVs), leaving 94 lipid traits for causal inference (Fig.1). The IVW method initially identified 25 lipid species with nominal significance (P< 0.05), suggesting potential causal relationships with IH (Fig.2, Table S3). Robust sensitivity analyses using the WM and RAPS methods further supported these findings, identifying 51 and 29 significant lipid traits, respectively. Importantly, these methods collectively supported 24 lipid species, reinforcing their robust causal effects on IH (Fig.2, Tables S4–S5). These 24 lipid traits included 3 sterol esters, 2 diacylglycerols, 14 phosphatidylcholines, 2 phosphatidylinositols, and 3 triacylglycerols (Fig.3). Among them, 17 lipid species were identified as risk factors for IH (OR = 1.04–1.21), including 2 triacylglycerols, 2 phosphatidylinositols, 1 sterol ester, 8 phosphatidylcholines, and 2 diacylglycerols. Conversely, 7 lipid species, including 6 phosphatidylcholines and 1 sterol ester, exhibited protective effects against IH (OR = 0.78–0.94) (Fig.3). Notably, Triacylglycerol (54:6) emerged as the strongest IH risk factor, with an OR of 1.21 (95% CI = 1.09–1.35,P= 0.001), highlighting its potential role in IH pathophysiology (Fig.3).

To ensure the reliability of our causal estimates, we examined heterogeneity and pleiotropy across the 24 lipid traits showing significant associations. Cochran’s Q test revealed no significant heterogeneity (P> 0.05), suggesting stable and consistent SNP-specific effects. Similarly, MR-Egger intercept analysis showed no indication of directional pleiotropy, with all P-values exceeding 0.05, thereby supporting the validity of the MR findings (Table1). Additionally, we also conducted a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to evaluate whether any individual SNP unduly influenced the global causal estimates. For 20 lipid traits, at least one SNP significantly influenced the causal estimate (Supplementary Fig.1). However, four lipid traits remained unaffected by single IV removal, demonstrating robust causal associations with IH, namely diacylglycerol (18:1_18:1) (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.05–1.29,P= 0.005), diacylglycerol (18:1_18:2) (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03–1.22,P= 0.006), phosphatidylinositol (18:0_20:4) (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05–1.15,P= 1.47E-04), and triacylglycerol (54:6) (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.09–1.35,P= 0.001) (Fig.4).

To further refine these estimates and reduce potential pleiotropic bias, Radial MR analysis was employed, incorporating MR-Egger regression slopes to detect pleiotropic outliers. All Radial MR models, including IVW effect (1st), IVW Exact (FE), and IVW Exact (RE), consistently supported the significant causal relationship (Table2). Among the four robust lipid traits, three showed no outliers, whereas diacylglycerol (18:1_18:2) exhibited a potential pleiotropic outlier (rs79624003) (Fig.5). However, excluding rs79624003 in a reanalyzed Radial MR model did not alter the original significant estimate (Table2), reinforcing the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, Radial MR-Egger intercept tests provided additional support for the validity of the results, ruling out pleiotropic bias.

Overall, our MR analysis provided significant and consistent evidence supporting a causal relationship between four lipid species and increased IH risk. These findings were highly robust across multiple sensitivity analyses, confirming their reliability. No additional lipid traits demonstrated significant causal associations with IH.

Given the complex relationship between metabolic markers and hernias, this study soughts to identify specific lipid species that may play a direct role in IH pathogenesis. By integrating large-scale lipidomic and IH GWAS datasets, we identified four lipid species—diacylglycerol (18:1_18:1), diacylglycerol (18:1_18:2), phosphatidylinositol (18:0_20:4), and triacylglycerol (54:6)—that causally increase the risk of developing IH. This represents the first genetic molecular evidence implicating individual lipid molecules in hernia susceptibility, moving beyond traditional risk markers and suggesting a metabolic dysfunction contribution to the integrity of the abdominal wall. While previous studies have primarily focused on general metabolic disorders such as obesity, fat distribution, and dyslipidemia with IH risk, the specific role of lipidomic profiles has remained largely unexplored. BMI, a widely used obesity marker, has shown inconsistent associations with IH, likely due to its inability to distinguish between lean and fat mass. Aquina et al. reported that visceral obesity, rather than BMI, was significantly associated with IH, highlighting the need for better metabolic markers (Aquina et al.2015). Our results provide novel insights into the metabolic mechanisms underlying IH pathogenesis. Lipids play a crucial role in maintaining extracellular matrix integrity and cellular architecture. Disruptions in lipid homeostasis may impair collagen synthesis, fibroblast function, and tissue remodeling, leading to a weakened abdominal wall and increased hernia susceptibility (Besch et al.2018; Forghani et al.2024). IH has been linked to metabolic abnormalities in connective tissue, where lipid metabolism may contribute to structural integrity via membrane composition and signaling pathways (Besch et al.2018; Forghani et al.2024). Diacylglycerol (DAG), triacylglycerol (TAG), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) are key lipid species involved in these processes. Below, we discuss possible mechanisms by which the identified lipid species could contribute to IH pathophysiology, as well as potential clinical implications.

DAG molecules are major intermediates in lipid metabolism and intracellular signaling. They can contain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (C20:4), or be composed primarily of saturated fatty acids (Li et al.2023). DAG is a product of PI hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC) and functions as a secondary messenger in protein kinase C (PKC) activation (Ahyayauch et al.2015). Excessive PKC activation can affect cellular functions in wound healing and inflammation. If DAG levels are chronically elevated (as suggested by genetically higher DAG 18:1_18:1 and 18:1_18:2), this may lead to aberrant PKC signaling, disrupting normal repair of the abdominal wall. In support of this idea, DAG accumulation has been associated with impaired connective tissue healing in other contexts, which could translate into a propensity for hernia due to a weaker or slower healing abdominal fascia (Yoshida et al.1986). Moreover, DAG serves as a precursor for TAG biosynthesis, which could influence lipid storage and energy metabolism (Igal et al.2001; Xu et al.2018; Hardman et al.2018).

TAG is primarily composed of fatty acids such as linoleic acid (18:2), oleic acid (18:1), and palmitic acid (Gili and Alonso2004). Under ischemic conditions, TAG composition shifts, with decreased palmitic acid and increased arachidonic acid, which may be linked to inflammation and altered signaling pathways (Yoshida et al.1986). TAG accumulation has been associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure, which may contribute to IH formation (Yoshida et al.1986). Furthermore, TAG hydrolysis releases free fatty acids (FFAs), which can exacerbate chronic inflammation and weaken connective tissue structures, further predisposing individuals to IH (Gili and Alonso2004). During metabolic stress, TAG accumulation coincides with reduced membrane lipid content, suggesting a shift in lipid metabolism toward storage rather than structural maintenance (Meï2016).

PI are phospholipids integral to cell membranes and precursors to critical signaling molecules like PIP2 and PIP3. The PI species identified (18:0_20:4) contains stearic and arachidonic acid, indicating a role in inflammatory signaling (arachidonic acid is a precursor to eicosanoids). Adequate PI levels are necessary for maintaining membrane structure and for membrane signaling domains that recruit cytoskeletal proteins (Lejeune et al.2021). PI-derived signaling molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), modulate cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular adhesion (Ahyayauch et al.2015). PI depletion has been observed in ischemic tissues and may lead to impaired cell-matrix interactions, weakening the mechanical stability of the abdominal wall.

Our results highlight potential lipid biomarkers for IH risk. If validated in further studies, individuals with higher levels of the identified risk lipids (e.g., DAG 18:1_18:1, DAG 18:1_18:2, TAG 54:6, PI 18:0_20:4) could be recognized as having an elevated hernia risk, especially in contexts like pre-surgical evaluations or occupational health screenings. This could prompt more proactive measures such as weight management, targeted core-strengthening exercises, or closer monitoring for hernia development in these individuals. From a drug development standpoint, pathways involving DAG-PKC signaling or PI metabolism could be explored for potential targets to improve connective tissue resilience. Although these applications are speculative at this stage, they open interesting directions for translational research connecting metabolic health and surgical outcomes in IH.

One of the main strengths of our study is the use of MR analysis, a method less prone to bias than traditional observational designs (Wu2021). This genetic approach enabled the identification of lipid species that may directly contribute to IH pathogenesis. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy, reinforcing the robustness of our findings. These results provide a foundation for future studies exploring lipid-modifying interventions to mitigate IH risk.

However, our study has several limitations. First, despite using rigorous MR methodology, potential biases such as weak instrument bias and residual pleiotropy remain concerns. Although we addressed these issues through stringent IV selection and sensitivity analyses, they cannot be eliminated (Hu et al.2022). Second, our analysis was confined to individuals of European ancestry; genetic effects may differ in other populations, and the lipid profiles associated with IH might vary by ethnicity. Future studies should examine these relationships in more diverse cohorts to ensure generalizability (Zheng and Tan2024). Future studies should incorporate diverse cohorts to identify population-specific lipidomic risk factors. Third, our lipidomic data were derived from plasma measurements, which may not fully capture tissue-specific lipid metabolism relevant to IH. Functional studies using cellular and animal models are needed to validate the biological role of these lipid species. Finally, due to data constraints, we could not stratify IH cases by subtype (direct vs. indirect), sex, or age. It remains possible that lipid effects differ in specific subgroups or hernia subtypes, which warrants further investigation. Despite these limitations, our study provides novel evidence of a metabolic component in IH pathogenesis.

This study presents novel causal evidence linking lipid metabolism to IH susceptibility. We identified four lipid species, diacylglycerol (18:1_18:1), phosphatidylinositol (18:0_20:4), triacylglycerol (54:6), and diacylglycerol (18:1_18:2), as potential contributors to IH risk. These findings highlight a previously underappreciated metabolic dimension in IH pathogenesis and open new avenues for therapeutic development. Future research should prioritize experimental validation and explore lipid-targeted strategies for IH prevention and clinical management.
