Spiritual health interventions have increasingly been recognized for their potential to improve general health outcomes. This study undertakes a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate their effectiveness on patient health in Iran. Data were gathered from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and other relevant sources without time restriction. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 16. Analysis of 53 studies, comprising both quasi-experimental and clinical trial designs, revealed 94 reported outcomes. Significant enhancements were observed in anxiety (SMD: -1.32), hope (SMD: 2.56), quality of life (SMD: 3.48), stress (SMD: -1.57), depression (SMD: -1.57), spiritual health (SMD: 3.27), and sleep quality (SMD: -1.71), while pain control showed no significant effect (SMD: -0.64). The findings of the current study demonstrate that, despite certain limitations, interventions grounded in spiritual health can effectively enhance both physical and psychological health indicators in patients; however, due to inherent study limitations, cautious interpretation is advised. Future research should leverage advanced tools, particularly artificial intelligence, to assess outcomes objectively, reducing reliance on self-reported data. Studies should also adhere to internationally recognized guidelines to minimize bias and employ larger sample sizes to improve the robustness and generalizability of findings.

Health, deemed a fundamental entitlement for all humanity, is construed as a multidimensional construct by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the WHO, health signifies a state of holistic well-being encompassing physical, psychological, and social dimensions, transcending mere disease absence [1]. In recent years, spiritual health has garnered the attention of healthcare professionals as a pivotal facet of both individual and collective existence [2,3]. Spiritual health comprises two facets: religious health and existential health. Religious health denotes an individual’s connection with the divine or an omnipotent force. On the other sideexistential health delineates people interactions with others, the environment, and our internal linkages, affording us the capability to amalgamate diverse dimensions and make assorted choices [4–6].

Over the preceding decades, myriad studies have sought to delve into the association between religious and spiritual convictions and the improvement of physical health. The results of these studies indicate that profound religious convictions can exert a substantial and conspicuous influence on mitigating mortality, morbidity, stress, anxiety, depression, suicide, and addiction [7–9]. Earlier investigations have evidenced that spirituality can bolster patients’ resilience against mental health upheavals subsequent to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, an absence of spirituality among critically ill patients can culminate in heightened emotional anxiety, heightened pain and fatigue levels, augmented disease burden, and diminished quality of life [10–12].

Similar to global experiences, health system officials and researchers in Iran have recognized the significance and unique advantages of spiritual health interventions—such as their non-invasive nature, absence of adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and high feasibility. Concurrently, they have taken into account the sociocultural characteristics of Iranian society, including the profound influence of Islam, collectivist values, and the integral role of spirituality within the healthcare paradigm. In light of these factors, Iranian health experts have systematically developed and implemented spiritually based interventions aimed at enhancing both physical and psychological health outcomes among patients. Such initiatives align with broader international efforts to integrate holistic and culturally sensitive approaches into healthcare, while also addressing the specific needs and values of the local population. By leveraging the synergistic relationship between spiritual well-being and overall health, these interventions contribute to a more comprehensive and patient-centered model of care [13–16]. Although many studies have been disseminated in this domain, most have been conducted in confined settings with restricted sample sizes, Therefore, they fail to furnish comprehensive and lucid information for decision-makers and planners. Consequently, there exists a necessity for a methodical synthesis of these studies’ outcomes to delineate a lucid portrayal of the prevailing scenario, which can be harnessed in decision-making and strategizing. Hence, this study was undertaken to systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy of spiritual health-based interventions in augmenting patients’ health indicators in Iran.

This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2025, following the systematic review methodology described in the book “Systematic Reviews to Support Evidence-Based Medicine” which offers direction on how to conduct and interpret systematic reviews, a key element of evidence-based medicine [17] and adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Adherence to the PRISMA guidelines facilitates rigorous and transparent reporting of systematic reviews, thereby enhancing their methodological completeness, reliability, and overall utility for evidence-based decision-making [18].

The search strategy for this study was meticulously designed in collaboration with a subject-matter expert to ensure methodological rigor and comprehensiveness. To optimize the retrieval of relevant literature, the strategy focused specifically on interventions related to spiritual health, encompassing terms and concepts pertinent to this domain. An experienced academic librarian subsequently implemented the search, employing systematic techniques to navigate electronic databases, refine keyword combinations, and apply appropriate filters. Relevant information was gathered through an initial keyword search in databases included PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, along with the use of Mesh terms (see Appendix 1, Search Strategy). There were no time restrictions placed on the article search. Additionally, to ensure comprehensive coverage, manual searches were conducted in reputable journals like the Journal of Religion and Health, International Journal of Palliative Nursing, Iran Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research, and others, as well as hand searching on Google Scholar following the guidelines by Younger P. (2010) [19]. After filtering out articles with weak relevance to the study objectives, the selected primary articles were further verified through a secondary search to ensure a thorough review of the available literature. Unpublished sources (Grey literature) were also searched using databases such as the European Association for Grey Literature Exploitation (EAGLE) and Health Care Management Information Consortium (HMIC).

This study employed the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) to define criteria, including patients with physical health problems (to isolate spiritual interventions’ effects) while excluding those with mental health conditions (to avoid confounding variables). Interventions focused solely on spiritual health were included, whereas religious practices (e.g., prayer) or combined therapies were excluded to ensure specificity. Outcomes encompassed holistic health indicators (e.g., quality of life, anxiety), and only interventional studies in English/Persian were considered to maintain methodological rigor. Observational studies or tool-development research were excluded to prioritize causal evidence (Table1).

The entire process of selecting and screening articles was conducted independently by two members of the research team. Any discrepancies during the initial phase were resolved through discussionIf needed, referred to a third individual with more expertise. Initially, all article titles were examined, and those not aligned with the study objectives were excluded. Subsequently, abstracts and full texts of the articles were sequentially reviewed to identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria and having a weak association with the study objectives. EndNote X5 software was utilized for organization, reviewing titles and abstracts, and identifying duplicates. The PRISMA: 2020 flowchart was employed to report the outcomes of the selection and screening process [20].

The assessment the risk of bias in articles was carried out during the full-text screening phase by two independent assessors using the checklists of the revised JBI critical appraisal tool for evaluating the risk of bias in randomized controlled trials [21] and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies [22].These critical appraisal tools were designed to evaluate the methodological quality of a study and determine the extent to which a study has addressed potential biases in its design, conduct, and analysis. The tool for appraising quasi-experimental studies comprises 9 questions, while the tool for clinical trials includes 13 questions. These tools provide options such as “Yes”, “No”, “Unclear”, and “Not Applicable”. The final assessment score for each article was determined through consensus between the two assessors (based on the number of “yes” responses). Any discrepancies between the assessors were referred to a third assessor. In this study, articles were not excluded based on risk of bias assessment scores, and the assessment was solely conducted to inform readers about the bias status in the articles.

For data collection, an information-gathering form was manually developed using Excel software. To ensure the validity of the form, feedback was obtained from three experts in the field. For reliability confirmation, data from 5 articles were extracted as a pilot study to identify and address any deficiencies and issues in the initial form. Two individuals independently extracted data from the selected articles. The information included in the form consists of the author’s name, publication year of the article, study design (quasi-experimental or clinical trial), disease name, sample size in both intervention and control groups, mean age of individuals in both intervention and control groups, brief intervention description, number and duration of sessions (average duration was considered for cases reported as a range), questionnaires used along with their minimum and maximum scores, names of outcomes under investigation, mean and standard deviation of results in both intervention and control groups, and the effectiveness of the intervention on the investigated outcome (yes for a significant impact and no for a no significant impact). In cases where necessary information was not reported in the articles, an email was sent to the corresponding author of the articles. Two individuals independently extracted data, and in cases of ambiguity, assistance was sought from another member of the research team with more experience and knowledge.

To estimate the effectiveness of interventions, meta-analytical statistical methods (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with Hedges’ g model) and the random effects model were used. Stata software (StataCorp, version 16) was employed for conducting the meta-analysis [23]. The results were reported using Forest plots, where the size of each square represents the sample size and the lines drawn on either side of the square indicate the 95% confidence interval for each study. The I² index and Galbraith plots were used to assess the heterogeneity of study results. In this study, an I² value of less than 50% was considered low heterogeneity, an I² value between 50% and 74% was considered moderate heterogeneity, and an I² value of 75% or higher was considered high heterogeneity [24]. Subgroup analysis was conducted in certain domains based on the tools used for data collection. Meta-regression was performed based on the number and duration of sessions (minutes). Funnel plots and Egger’s regression test at a significance level of 0.1% [25] were used to assess publication bias. In cases where there was a potential for publication bias, the Trim and Fill test with the Linear estimator method was employed. Portions of the extracted data that were not eligible for meta-analysis were manually analyzed and reported using descriptive statistics (percentage, frequency, mean, etc.).

From a total of 1,486 articles identified from databases and other sources, 474 duplicates were removed. During the title and abstract screening, 874 articles were excluded. The full text of 5 articles was not available. During the full-text review, an additional 80 articles were excluded. Ultimately, 53 articles were included in the study [10,13,26–76] (Fig.1).

The information from the 53 reviewed articles is provided in Appendix 2 (Appendix 2 - Data Extraction Form). An analysis of the study types showed that approximately half were quasi-experimental studies, and the other half were clinical trials. The average age and number of participants in both the intervention and control groups were nearly identical. The most frequently studied diseases were cancers. A total of 374 spiritual health intervention sessions (with an average duration of about 73 min each) were conducted. Across all reviewed studies, 75 instruments were used to measure 94 outcomes (including repetitions). Out of the 94 outcomes examined, spiritual health interventions failed to significantly improve the desired outcome in only 7 cases, while the effects of these interventions were statistically significant in 87 cases (Table2).

The results of 11 studies with a sample size of 291 people in each intervention and control group showed that the SMD in anxiety between the two groups was − 1.32 [-2.13 to -0.51, 95% CI], which is statistically significant, indicating the effectiveness of these interventions (Fig.2). The heterogeneity test revealed high heterogeneity among the study results (I2 = 94.9%, Appendix 3-Fig A, Galbraith plot). The publication bias assessment indicated a relatively low likelihood of publication bias in this section (Publication bias-Egger test, P-value = 0.068, Z= -2.29, Appendix 4-Fig A, Funnel plot). “.

The results of eight studies, with a sample size of 337 in the intervention group and 333 in the control group, demonstrated a SMD in hope scores between the two groups of 2.56 [0.79–4.32 with 95% CI], indicating a statistically significant effect of these interventions (Fig.3). The heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial heterogeneity among the study results (I² = 98.8%) (Appendix 3, Fig B, Galbraith plot). Additionally, the assessment of publication bias indicated a relatively high probability of bias in this section (Publication bias - Egger test: P-value = 0.018, Z = 4.29) (Appendix 4, Fig B, Funnel plot). The Trim & Fill test suggested that potentially one study was unpublished due to publication bias, and incorporating the hypothetical results from this study adjusted the difference between the two groups to 2.78 [1.19–4.54 with 95% CI]. Nonetheless, the difference between the two groups remained significant, indicating that potential publication bias had minimal impact on the overall study results.

The results of seven studies, each with a sample size of 168 in both the intervention and control groups, showed a SMD in quality of life scores between the two groups of 3.48 [0.83–6.13 with 95% CI], indicating a statistically significant effect of these interventions (Fig.4). The heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial heterogeneity among the study results (I² = 98.6%) (Appendix 3, Fig C, Galbraith plot). Moreover, the publication bias assessment indicated a relatively high probability of bias in this section (Publication bias - Egger test: P-value = 0.008, Z = 3.69) (Appendix 4, Fig C, Funnel plot). The Trim & Fill test results suggested that potentially two studies were unpublished due to publication bias, and incorporating the hypothetical results from these studies adjusted the difference between the two groups to 4.67 [2.09–7.24 with 95% CI]. Nevertheless, the difference between the two groups remained significant, indicating that potential publication bias had minimal impact on the overall study results.

The results of seven studies, each with a sample size of 163 in both the intervention and control groups, demonstrated a SMD in depression scores between the two groups of -1.57 [-2.90– -0.23 with 95% CI]. This indicates a statistically significant effect of these interventions in reducing depression among patients (Fig.5). The heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial heterogeneity among the study results (I² = 96.4%) (Appendix 3, Fig D, Galbraith plot). Additionally, the publication bias assessment indicated a relatively high probability of bias in this section (Publication bias - Egger test: P-value = 0.001, Z = -3.21) (Appendix 4, Fig D, Funnel plot). The Trim & Fill test results suggested that potentially two studies were unpublished due to publication bias, and incorporating the hypothetical results from these studies adjusted the difference between the two groups to -2.19 [-3.47– -0.90 with 95% CI]. Nevertheless, the difference between the two groups remained significant, indicating that potential publication bias had minimal impact on the overall study results.

The results of five studies, each with a sample size of 198 in both the intervention and 193 in the control group, illustrated a SMD in spiritual health scores between the two groups of 3.27 [1.60–4.95 with 95% CI], indicating a statistically significant effect of these interventions in improving spiritual health among patients (Fig.6). The heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial heterogeneity among the study results (I² = 96.9%) (Appendix 3, Fig E, Galbraith plot). Additionally, the publication bias assessment indicated a relatively high probability of bias in this section (Publication bias - Egger test: P-value = 0.018, Z = 3.12) (Appendix 4, Fig E, Funnel plot). The Trim & Fill test results suggested that potentially one study was unpublished due to publication bias, and incorporating the hypothetical results from this study adjusted the difference between the two groups to 2.69 [0.90–4.48 with 95% CI]. Nevertheless, the difference between the two groups remained significant, indicating that potential publication bias had minimal impact on the overall study results.

The results of four studies, each with a sample size of 101 in both the intervention and control groups, demonstrated a SMD in stress scores between the two groups of -1.32 [-2.05– -0.60 with 95% CI], indicating a statistically significant effect of these interventions in reducing stress among patients (Fig.7). The heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial heterogeneity among the study results (I² = 81.53%) (Appendix 3, Fig F, Galbraith plot). Additionally, the publication bias assessment indicated a relatively low probability of bias in this section (Publication bias - Egger test: P-value = 0.078, Z = -1.83) (Appendix 4, Fig F, Funnel plot).

The results of four studies, each with a sample size of 154 in both the intervention and control groups, demonstrated a SMD in pain scores between the two groups of -0.64 [-1.56–0.28 with 95% CI], indicating a statistically non-significant effect of these interventions in controlling pain among patients (Fig.8). The heterogeneity assessment revealed substantial heterogeneity among the study results (I² = 92.71%) (Appendix 3, Fig G, Galbraith plot). Additionally, the publication bias assessment indicated a low probability of bias in this section (Publication bias - Egger test: P-value = 0.60, Z = -0.52) (Appendix 4, Fig G, Funnel plot).

The results of 3 studies involving a sample size of 124 participants in both intervention and control groups showed a statistically significant difference in the mean standard score of sleep quality between the two groups, -1.71 [-2 --- -1.42 with 95% CI] (Fig.9). The heterogeneity assessment indicated very low heterogeneity in the study results (I^2 = 0.00%) (Appendix 3 - Fig H, Galbraith plot). The assessment of publication bias also indicated a low likelihood of publication bias in the findings (Publication bias - Egger test (P-value = 0.64, Z = -0.46) (Appendix 4 - Fig H, funnel plot).

The meta-regression results using a random effects model based on the number of sessions of spiritual health interventions and the average duration of sessions (in minutes) indicated that these variables were significantly predictive significantly only in the domain quality of life and duration of interventions predicting hope (P< 0.05). In other domains, these variables were not significantly predictive (Table3).

The average bias assessment score for clinical trial articles was estimated at 7.23 out of 13 (median 7). In three questions related to blinding, due to the nature of interventions, the option “not applicable” was chosen for all studies, which was a significant contributing factor to lower scores in these articles. Among the major shortcomings identified in this section, inadequate reporting on how individuals were allocated to intervention and control groups, lack of transparency in data handling, and insufficient reporting on how data from participants who dropped out of the study were managed were notable. The average bias assessment score for quasi-experimental articles was estimated at 6 out of 9 (median 6). One of the major shortcomings identified in this section was the lack of reporting or analysis of data about participants who dropped out of the study. Another significant issue in quasi-experimental articles was the absence of repeated measurements. (Attachment 5 - Results of Article Bias Assessment).

In this study, 53 articles were reviewed, approximately half of which were quasi-experimental studies and the other half were clinical trials. This meta-analysis of spiritual health interventions demonstrated statistically significant improvements across multiple outcomes: anxiety (MD: -1.32, 95% CI: -2.13 to -0.51), hope (SMD: 2.56, 95% CI: 0.79–4.32), quality of life (SMD: 3.48, 95% CI: 0.83–6.13), depression (SMD: -1.57, 95% CI: -2.90 to -0.23), spiritual health (SMD: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.60–4.95), stress (SMD: -1.32, 95% CI: -2.05 to -0.60), and sleep quality (MD: -1.71, 95% CI: -2.00 to -1.42). Notably, quality of life and hope were influenced by intervention duration (p< 0.05), while pain control showed non-significant effects (SMD: -0.64, 95% CI: -1.56 to 0.28). Heterogeneity was high (I² >80% for most outcomes), but publication bias had minimal impact on significance.

As mentioned, the study results indicate a very positive impact of spiritual health interventions on improving health indicators among patients in Iran. This finding is consistent with results from various studies conducted in Iran and other countries. For instance, de Diego-Cordero et al. (2022), in their systematic review, examined the significant effects of spiritual health interventions on enhancing mental health, wellbeing, and spirituality [77]. Other studies’ results also demonstrate acceptable effectiveness of these interventions for various patient groups [78,79]. Evidence, especially from systematic review studies, indicates that spiritual health interventions are not only effective for patients but also for other population groups [80,81]. However, despite confirming the effectiveness of these interventions in texts, a concern exists in this regard regarding the cultural and religious structure of patients in Iran and how outcomes were measured, which were non-blind and self-reported by participants. One of the potential reasons for this high level of effectiveness may stems from patients’ fear of being considered culturally and religiously ignorant. Therefore, for a more accurate and realistic assessment of the effects of these interventions, it is better to use more precise and confidential methods. Another point worth mentioning is that most of the reported outcomes in studies had a mental (non-tangible) nature, and ambiguities and difficulties may have arisen in their measurement or reporting by study participants. Despite all these limitations and potential impacts, it seems that spiritual health interventions can be considered alongside other types of interventions in healthcare centers and should receive attention from policymakers and service providers. One of the disease groups that has received considerable attention from researchers is cancer patients. However, due to the diversity of diseases and the limited number of similar outcomes studied in this research, subgroup analyses based on disease type were not feasible. Nevertheless, initial investigations indicate that similar to overall results, spiritual interventions significantly improved general health indicators among cancer patients. This observation is clearly evidenced in the study by Xing L. et al. (2018), which examined the effectiveness of spiritual health interventions in cancer patients [82]. Furthermore, the findings of Oh PJ and Kim SH (2014) also confirm the (moderate) effectiveness of spiritual health interventions in enhancing health indicators among cancer patients [83]. Despite heterogeneous results across studies and significant methodological limitations in conducting these studies, it appears that due to the nature of cancer, where patients often find themselves in late stages of life or have minimal prospects for recovery, spiritual health interventions, especially in Islamic countries like Iran, can be considered as a non-invasive, low-cost, and effective intervention for these patients, attracting attention from policymakers and healthcare providers [84,85].

Although the results of spiritual health-based interventions showed a positive effect on many indicators, the results showed that the effect of these interventions on patients’ pain control was not significant. This finding aligns with the results of the systematic review study by Gonçalves JPB et al. (2017), which investigated the impact of health interventions across different groups, including patients, healthcare providers, and healthy individuals, indicating that these interventions had a limited effect on pain improvement (although meta-analysis was not performed in Gonçalves JPB et al.‘s study). One reason for this may be the limited association between pain control and spirituality, along with the nature of the target groups studied in the present research, most of whom suffer from serious and chronic illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is recommended that, alongside spiritual care and interventions, other pain control methods should also be utilized for these patient groups.

The findings of the current study demonstrate that, despite certain limitations—including the self-reported and non-objective nature of the outcomes, the relatively high risk of bias across studies, and significant heterogeneity among study results—spiritual health-based interventions can effectively enhance both physical and psychological health indicators in patients. Therefore, these interventions, especially in Islamic countries like Iran, can serve as a non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient intervention for patients, gaining attention from policymakers and healthcare providers. However, given the limitations and weaknesses present in the studies, greater caution should be exercised in interpreting and applying the results of these studies. Future studies should incorporate modern tools and technologies—particularly artificial intelligence—to measure outcomes objectively rather than relying on self-reported data. Additionally, adherence to internationally recognized guidelines in study design is recommended to minimize bias, along with increasing sample sizes to enhance the robustness and generalizability of findings.

Although this study sought to deliver comprehensive and transparent insights for decision-makers and healthcare providers—through the identification, extraction, quantitative analysis (meta-analysis and meta-regression), and rigorous interpretation of findings on spiritual health interventions and their effects on health indicators—the majority of included studies exhibited significant limitations. Readers are cautioned to weigh these constraints when interpreting and applying the present findings.

The reliance on subjective or self-reported outcomes may have been influenced by participants’ cultural or religious backgrounds. Given the religious beliefs and cultural background of most patients in Iran, they may unrealistically over-report the effects of spiritual health interventions.

Moderate to high risk of bias in most studies, compounded by the impracticality of blinding participants and intervention providers—a factor that may have introduced response bias.

Small sample sizes in most studies limit the generalizability of results.

A lack of long-term follow-up assessments, despite the potential enduring effects of spiritual interventions. Future research should prioritize longitudinal evaluations to address this gap.

The variability in diseases and interventions across studies hindered robust subgroup analyses. To improve precision, subsequent investigations should adopt more disease-specific approaches.

The lack of repeated measurements. Given the educational nature of interventions, which were mostly provided over a short period, it appears that assessing the sustainability of effects is far more critical and significant than immediate and short-term impacts.

Finally, despite exhaustive efforts, considerable heterogeneity persisted among the outcomes of the examined studies, underscoring the need for further methodological refinement in this field.

Overall, spiritual health interventions can be considered a non-invasive and cost-effective approach to improving certain health indicators in patients in Iran. However, due to methodological limitations, the results should be interpreted with caution. To enhance the rigor and reliability of future research, several methodological improvements are strongly recommended. First, modern tools and technologies—particularly artificial intelligence (AI)—should be employed to assess outcomes objectively, replacing traditional self-reporting measures whenever possible. This shift would minimize subjectivity and improve measurement accuracy. Second, researchers should prioritize objective, quantifiable outcomes over subjective measures to reduce potential biases and strengthen the validity of findings. Additionally, adherence to internationally recognized guidelines (e.g., CONSORT for clinical trials) is essential in study design to mitigate risks of bias and ensure methodological transparency. Finally, increasing sample sizes in future studies would enhance statistical power, improve generalizability, and yield more robust conclusions. Collectively, these advancements would elevate the quality of evidence and foster greater confidence in research outcomes.
