Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-established public health concern worldwide. Considering the asymptomatic nature of early-stage CKD and its importance, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD in a large-scale, population-based cohort study.

In this cross-sectional study, data collected during the enrollment phase of the Tabari Cohort Study (TCS) were utilized. Between June 2015 and November 2017, 10,255 men and women aged 35–70 years were enrolled. CKD was determined based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, utilizing serum creatinine, was used to calculate eGFR. In the present study, participants with 30 ≤ GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² were considered to have stage 3 CKD, and undiagnosed stage 3 CKD was defined as those unaware of CKD at enrollment but had an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Chi-square tests and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the data.

Out of 10,255 TCS participants, 25.6% (N= 2,630) had stage 3 CKD (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), with 98.1% (N= 2,579) being unaware of their disease. Multivariate logistic regression results showed that the risk of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD was significantly lower in mountainous residents (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13–0.73,P= 0.008) and participants with hypertension (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18–0.66,P= 0.001), diabetes (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29–0.95,P= 0.032), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23–0.82,P= 0.010) compared to urban residents and those without hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, respectively.

The present study demonstrated a substantially high prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD. Urban residency and the absence of medical history of hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease were predictive factors of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-established public health concern around the world [1,2]. The increasing prevalence of CKD can be attributed to the aging population and high prevalence of CKD-related risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension [1,3]. Findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis showed the global prevalence of CKD between 11 and 13% with the majority stage 3 [4], in Asian population it ranges between 7.0 and 34.3% [5] and in Iranian population the prevalence of CKD estimated 12.6%) (95% confidence interval, 10.2%-14.2%) [6].

Unfortunately, early stage CKD is asymptomatic; therefore, the initial diagnosis often occurs during advanced stages, when there are fewer opportunities to treat and prevent complications [2,7]. Timely diagnosis and early treatment of CKD have a pivotal role in the health care system in many respects: first, patients with CKD are at great risk of developing cardiovascular diseases; second, people with CKD are predisposed to acute kidney injury, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and has serious consequences on the quality of life and finally CKD-associated financial costs are substantial and potentially lead to higher health care resource use [7–12].

CKD encompasses the entire continuum of renal disease and can be categorized into five stages based on the eGFR level (from kidney damage with a normal or increased eGFR to kidney failure [6]. The prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD has been reported previously and it varies between 77.0% in Italy to 92.1% and 95.5% in Japan and France respectively [1].

Considering the asymptomatic nature of early stage CKD, the lack of data on undetected CKD in the healthy population, and its importance, we hypothesized that there is a substantial number of participants with CKD in the general population who are unaware of their CKD status; therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD in a large-scale population-based cohort study.

This cross-sectional study utilized data collected during the enrollment phase of the Tabari Cohort Study (TCS), a part of the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN) mega cohort. All methods were performed following relevant guidelines and regulations. The PERSIAN cohort study’s first phase recruited 180,000 Iranians aged 35–70 years from 18 geographically distinct areas in Iran. The TCS was conducted in the Mazandaran Province of Iran, located in the foothills of the Alborz mountain range, including mountainous and plain regions. The capital city of Mazandran Province (Sari) and a mountainous region (Kiasar) were selected for the TCS. Between June 2015 and November 2017, 10,255 men and women aged 35–70 years were enrolled from these regions. Further details on the TCS and PERSIAN cohort study have been explained in previously published articles [13–15].

A validated questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and biological sample collection were used to collect data from participants of the TCS.

In the case of a positive answer, the year of diagnosis and whether they were receiving treatment were queried.

All enrollees were asked to arrive in a fasting state a total of twenty-five milliliters of blood were collected from each participants to store and conduct biochemistry tests, including fasting blood glucose (FBS), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and Cr, using BT 1500 (Biotecnica, Italy). In the urban area, all samples were processed right after collection, in the cohort laboratory center. In the mountainous region, samples were transferred to the cohort laboratory center after preliminary preparation.

Urinalysis was performed to assess urine PH, specific gravity, and the presence of blood, proteins, glucose, bilirubin, nitrates, ketones, ascorbic acid, leukocytes, and microalbumin.

Qualified and trained nurses measured all the anthropometric indices. A standardized methodology was followed. Weight (kg) was measured with minimal clothing using a calibrated balance scale (SECA 755; SECA, Hamburg, Germany). To measure height (in cm), SECA 226(SECA, Hamburg, Germany) was used, and the participants were asked to face their head with arms by the side, take off shoes, and put their feet together. Waist and hip circumferences were measured based on national health and nutrition definitions [16]. Waist-to-height ratio (WHR) was calculated by dividing waist circumference by height. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.

CKD was determined based on the eGFR. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, utilizing serum creatinine was used to calculate eGFR The formula is as follows: eGFR = 186 × (SCr)-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) [17].

Participants were categorized into five groups based on the stage of renal damage and eGFR reduction using the Kidney Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQL) guidelines. Participants with an eGFR greater than 90 mL/min/1.73 m² were considered to have normal or elevated eGFR. Those with an eGFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73 m² had a mild reduction in eGFR, while participants with an eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m² were classified as having a moderate reduction in eGFR, also known as stage 3 CKD. Severe reduction in GFR included those with an eGFR between 15 and 29 mL/min/1.73 m², and renal failure was defined as having an eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

In this study, participants with a eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²were considered to have CKD, with those having a eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m² classified as stage 3 CKD. Undiagnosed stage 3 CKD included individuals who were unaware of their CKD status at enrollment but had an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Physical activity levels were assessed using a 19-item questionnaire, and metabolic equivalents of task (MET) were calculated for each listed activity. Based on MET values, participants’ physical activity levels were classified as either below or above the median value [18].

Socioeconomic status was determined using principal component analysis and categorized into five levels: poorest (1st level) to richest (5th level) [19].

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26. Data were presented as percentages, means, and standard deviations (SD). The chi-squared test was employed to compare undiagnosed CKD with demographic, clinical, para-clinical variables, and anthropometric indices. Univariate logistic regression with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to analyze the odds of undiagnosed CKD based on demographic, clinical, para-clinical variables, and anthropometric indices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to adjust for confounding effects of other variables in predicting undiagnosed CKD.

The predictive model for factors related to undiagnosed CKD included variables such as age group, sex, residential area, education level, socioeconomic status, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two multivariate modeling methods, logistic regression and bootstrapping, to account for potential confounding factors and assess the uncertainty of independent variables related to undiagnosed CKD cases.

Out of 10,255 participants in TCS, 25.9% (N= 2,653) had an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Based on CKD stage classification, 25.6% (N= 2,630) had stage 3 CKD (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m².), with 23.9% (N= 2,453) classified as stage 3a and 1.7% (N= 177) as stage 3b. Among participants with stage 3 CKD, 98.1% (N= 2,579) were unaware of their condition (Fig.1). Prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3a and stage 3b was 98.5% (2416) and 92.1% (163) respectively (P-value < 0.001).

Table1displays the demographic and clinical characteristics of participants with undiagnosed stage 3 CKD. Univariate logistic regression revealed significant associations between undiagnosed stage 3 CKD and residency, education, socioeconomic status, and physical activity. The prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD was significantly lower among participants residing in mountainous areas (95.9% vs. 98.9%;P-value < 0.001), those with no formal education (96.6% vs. 98.8%;P-value = 0.018), and those with higher physical activity levels (above the median) (97.2% vs. 98.7%;P= 0.007). Conversely, the prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD was higher among participants with higher socioeconomic status (level 5) compared to those with lower socioeconomic status (level 1) (98.9% vs. 95.9%;P= 0.002).

Table2presents the associations between anthropometric indices, lipid profiles, comorbidities, and undiagnosed stage 3 CKD using univariate logistic regression and chi-square tests. The prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD was significantly lower among participants with hypertension (96.2% vs. 99%;P< 0.001), cardiovascular disease (95.2% vs. 98.5%;P< 0.001), and diabetes (96.4% vs. 98.6%;P= 0.001) compared to those without these diseases.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with undiagnosed stage 3 CKD. Variables with a significance level below 0.25 from the chi-square test results, were included in the multivariable model (Table3). Additional variables such as age, physical activity, education, socioeconomic status, history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes were also incorporated. The results indicated that the risk of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD was significantly lower in residents of mountainous areas (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13–0.73,P= 0.008), and participants with hypertension (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18–0.66,P= 0.001), diabetes (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29–0.95,P= 0.032), and cardiovascular disease (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23–0.82,P= 0.010) compared to those residing in urban areas and those without hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, respectively.

Bootstrap results demonstrated that, in 95% of the simulations, the odds ratio remained within the estimated confidence interval, indicating the stability of the findings (Table3).

The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD and its associated factors in the Tabari Cohort Study. Our findings demonstrated a substantially high prevalence of stage 3 CKD, with over 98.1% of participants being unaware of their condition. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a higher likelihood of detecting stage 3 CKD in participants living in mountainous areas and those with hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases compared to urban residents and individuals without these conditions. However, research regarding the prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD and its related factors, particularly in low- to middle-income countries, remains limited.

A recent analysis of global CKD burden from 1990 to 2021 revealed despite a slight decline in age-standardized prevalence (-0.8%), mortality and disability-adjusted life years remain high worldwide Regions with low Socio-Demographic Index scores, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, experienced the highest burdens of CKD [20]. Additionally a systematic review estimated global CKD prevalence between 11% and 13%, with the majority being stage 3 CKD [4]. A large-scale study conducted in the European general population also reported a wide range of CKD prevalence, between 3.31% in Norway and 17.3% in northeast Germany, and the pattern remained consistent after stratification by diabetes, hypertension, and obesity status [21]. In Asian countries a recently published systematic review reported overall and advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) prevalence ranges of 7.0%-34.3% and 0.1%-17.0%, respectively, in 26 Asian countries [5]. In another study, the prevalence of stage 3 CKD in a sample of approximately 177,000 Chinese individuals older than 18 years was 2.1% (1.9–2.9) [22], and A 2009 epidemiological study conducted in 30 counties across Iran found a significantly lower stage 3 CKD prevalence of 7.8% [6], Notably, that study included participants over 14 years old, whereas our cohort comprised participants at a higher risk of developing CKD. The discrepancies observed could be attributed to regional differences in CKD prevalence and the narrower age range in our study focusing on individuals more susceptible to chronic diseases. Moreover, our study specifically determined stage 3 CKD, whereas others did not clearly define CKD stages, potentially leading to variations in reported prevalence rates.

Although our study highlights the substantial prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD, a significant limitation is the alarmingly high proportion (98%) of participants who were unaware of their condition. This finding is consistent with reports from multinational studies, indicating a global challenge in CKD detection. A study across France, Germany, Japan, and the United States found undiagnosed stage 3 CKD prevalence rates of 95.5%, 84.3%, 77.0%, and 61.6%, respectively [1]. Similarly, research in a middle-aged Japanese population reported that 5.2% of individuals with a 5.7% CKD prevalence were undiagnosed [9]. The high prevalence of stage 3 CKD, particularly undiagnosed cases, emphasizes the need for immediate action to improve disease awareness, screening, and management to reduce disease progression and minimize adverse clinical outcomes [1,11,23].

Our study identified urban residency and the absence of medical history of hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease as factors associated with undiagnosed CKD. Tangri et al. found that age, female sex, and a lack of family history of diabetes or hypertension were predictors of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD [1]. While a comprehensive literature search revealed studies assessing undiagnosed stage 3 CKD prevalence in various countries, such as the large-scale REVEAL-CKD study [2], research comparing prevalence rates in urban and mountainous regions remains limited. In our study, we hypothesize that lower undiagnosed stage 3 CKD prevalence among mountainous residents may be attributed to better access to healthcare resources and specific lifestyle factors. Rural family physician program has been implemented since 2006 in Iran [24] and findings showed that, the rural family physician has improved access to the healthcare services, although improvement in patient finding and quality of cares remains questionable [25]. In the present study most of participants from mountainous region were controlled by family physicians which might explain the lower prevalence of undiagnosed CKD in this population. Further investigation into these potential contributing factors is needed to inform targeted interventions for improving CKD detection in this population. Moreover, the higher likelihood of CKD diagnosis among participants with comorbidities could be explained by their increased health awareness and routine medical examinations. It is well documented that diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are the strongest determinants of CKD [26–28], therefore everyone with risk factors of CKD such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, family history of CKD should be educated about the benefits of early identification of the disease through appropriate interventions. This fact probably explains the likelihood of CKD diagnosis in participants with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Given the high prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD observed in our study, particularly among urban residents, we recommend implementing targeted screening strategies. Annual eGFR testing for individuals over 40 years of age—especially those residing in urban areas—could facilitate earlier detection. Importantly, our findings showed that the prevalence of undiagnosed CKD was higher among participants without hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. This suggests that current screening efforts focused primarily on patients with these comorbidities may miss a significant portion of individuals with CKD. We therefore propose expanding CKD screening to include apparently healthy adults, particularly in high-prevalence regions. Opportunistic testing during routine health checkups may also be an effective approach to improving case detection.

The large sample size and relatively wide age range of participants are notable strengths of this study. However, several limitations must be acknowledged. One of the primary limitations of the study is the absence of proteinuria assessment. Relying solely on eGFR as the primary measure of kidney function may underestimate the disease’s severity since other markers, such as proteinuria, were not assessed. Proteinuria is an essential indicator of kidney damage and a critical factor in the diagnosis and staging of CKD. According to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines [29], both eGFR and proteinuria should be considered when assessing kidney function and determining CKD risk. Consequently, the lack of proteinuria data in our study may have resulted in some degree of underestimation of CKD prevalence. Future studies should incorporate proteinuria assessment and other relevant markers to provide a more comprehensive understanding of CKD in the Tabari Cohort.

Another limitation is the study’s focus on a specific cohort from the Mazandaran province of Iran, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations or geographical locations. Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of the study provides only a snapshot of the prevalence at a specific point in time, preventing causal inferences or a thorough understanding of disease progression over time.

Considering our study findings, we recommend implementing targeted screening programs for high-risk populations, such as individuals living in urban areas or those without comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. We also propose increasing public awareness of CKD through educational campaigns and community-based initiatives emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention. Strengthening primary healthcare infrastructure and access to medical resources, particularly in remote or underserved areas, is essential.

Promoting collaboration among healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers will facilitate the development of tailored, evidence-based interventions addressing CKD detection and management challenges in different populations. By incorporating these strategies, we aim to provide practical guidance for addressing the issue of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD and improving the overall health outcomes of affected individuals.
