Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is key for low rectal cancer but raises the risk of anastomotic leakage (AL). This study examines how fluorescence laparoscopic (FL) surgery reduces AL after intersphincteric resection (ISR), especially in nCRT patients.

This real-world multicenter cohort study included 533 patients undergoing laparoscopic ISR for ultra-low rectal adenocarcinoma from January 2012 to July 2023. Patients were categorized into FL and non-FL groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used at a 1:2 ratio to adjust for baseline differences. The primary endpoint was the incidence of AL within 6 months postoperatively. Secondary endpoints included anastomotic site perfusion, intraoperative blood loss, lymph node retrieval, perioperative complications, and postoperative recovery metrics. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of nCRT status.

After PSM, 393 patients were analyzed (131 FL versus 262 non-FL). The FL group showed a significantly lower AL incidence (3.1% versus 11.5%,P= 0.005), with fewer severe symptomatic AL cases (0.8% versus 6.1%,P= 0.014). Intraoperative blood loss was reduced (45.2 ± 58.9 mL versus 65.3 ± 73.1 mL,P= 0.004), and lymph node yield was higher (21.2 ± 11.4 versus 16.6 ± 7.3,P< 0.001) in the FL group. Postoperative recovery was accelerated, with earlier return of bowel function and shorter hospital stays (9.5 ± 3.1 versus 10.7 ± 3.8 days,P= 0.012). In subgroup analyses, FL significantly reduced AL rates in patients without nCRT (1.9% versus 7.2%,P= 0.045) and demonstrated a strong trend toward reduction in AL for patients receiving nCRT (13.0% versus 35.9%,P= 0.051). FL also increased the proportion of patients achieving benchmark lymph node retrieval, including those post-nCRT.

Fluorescence-guided laparoscopic surgery reduces anastomotic leakage and improves outcomes in low rectal cancer, especially after chemoradiotherapy, by enhancing surgical precision and recovery.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) has long been recognized as a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, especially for patients with advanced or locally invasive tumors [1,2]. While this treatment modality improves oncologic outcomes, it is also associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, particularly anastomotic leakage (AL) [3,4]. The AL remains one of the most significant risk factors influencing both short-term recovery and oncological outcome in patients undergoing intersphincteric resection (ISR). Several studies have highlighted that the occurrence of AL is multifactorial, with both technical surgical factors and biological responses contributing to its onset and the blood supply at the anastomotic site as a critical factor that predisposes patients to this complication [5,6].

Amid growing clinical concerns about AL, there has been an increasing focus on strategies to promote anastomotic healing and lower leak rates, especially in the context of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), which can aggravate tissue perfusion [7,8]. Fluorescent laparoscopic (FL) surgery, employing indocyanine green (ICG), has emerged as a promising tool to enhance intraoperative decision-making by providing real-time, visual feedback on blood flow. This technique, particularly fluorescent laparoscopic angiography, has gained attention in colorectal surgery for its potential to improve the identification of crucial vascular structures and optimize anastomotic sites, ultimately reducing the risk of AL [9–11]. Nevertheless, despite its theoretical benefits, the application of FL in low rectal cancer surgery, particularly in patients undergoing nCRT, remains insufficiently explored.

Previous studies have predominantly focused on the role of FL in colorectal surgeries [12–14] without a specific emphasis on its utility in ultra-low rectal cancer after ISR or post-nCRT scenarios. Furthermore, while the potential of FL to improve the identification of blood vessels and lymph nodes has been demonstrated in various surgical contexts, its impact on reducing AL in low rectal cancer patients remains inadequately addressed in literature. This gap is particularly evident in the context of fluorescence guidance during laparoscopic ISR surgery, which is increasingly favored for its minimally invasive benefits. Moreover, few studies have evaluated the specific influence of FL in the challenging subset of patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

Above all, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether fluorescent laparoscopic (FL) surgery can reduce anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients with ultra-low rectal cancer, especially those who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Using propensity score matching (PSM), we aim to clarify the clinical benefits of fluorescence guidance in improving surgical safety, reducing blood loss, enhancing lymph node retrieval, and, ultimately, improving patient recovery and outcomes.

This real-world, multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted across three tertiary hospitals in China, including the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and its affiliated regional centers, covering a study period from January 2012 to July 2023 (Fig.1). The number of enrolled patients was approximately balanced across the centers. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of FL and non-FL groups across the centers (P> 0.05), indicating a balanced distribution of patients and no systematic bias among centers. Patients with ultra-low rectal adenocarcinoma treated with laparoscopic intersphincteric resection (ISR) were included. Eligibility criteria included: (1) histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma ≤ 5 cm from the anal verge and (2) ISR treatment. Exclusion criteria were: (1) nonadenocarcinomatous rectal malignancies, (2) combined organ resections, or (3) conversion to abdominoperineal resection.

The neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) was administered on the basis of multidisciplinary team (MDT) recommendations and prevailing clinical guidelines during the study period. Patients eligible for nCRT predominantly received long-course chemoradiotherapy, consisting of pelvic radiotherapy with a total dose of 45–50.4 Gy delivered over 25–28 fractions across 5–6 weeks, in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (e.g., capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil). Short-course radiotherapy was not routinely employed. Patients who did not undergo nCRT were either diagnosed with early stage tumors that did not require preoperative treatment or were deemed unsuitable for nCRT on the basis of individualized assessment. Preoperative tumor evaluation was conducted using MRI 8–12 weeks after nCRT. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the institutional review board.

Intraoperative tissue perfusion was assessed using a 4 K ultra-high-definition near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopic system (DPM-ENDOCAM-03 and DPM-LIGHT-03; Dipu Medical Technology, Zhuhai, China). The system employs excitation wavelengths of 785 ± 5 nm and detects fluorescence emission in the 830–900 nm range. Advanced image enhancement based on a generative adversarial network facilitated multiscale detail amplification. Surgeons had the flexibility to switch between imaging modes—true color, monochrome fluorescence, and pseudo-color merged modes—either individually or in parallel (Fig.2).

Radical rectal cancer surgery was routinely performed by senior colorectal surgeons with more than 10 years of experience and a record of managing ≥ 100 laparoscopic intersphincteric resections (LsISR). A standard total mesorectal excision (TME) was conducted with meticulous preservation of the bilateral hypogastric nerves and pelvic autonomic nerve plexus. Dissection of the intersphincteric plane between the puborectalis muscle and the internal sphincter was carried out under direct vision. The distal rectum was transected intracorporeally using a flexible linear stapler.

In cases where the distal resection margin was less than 1 cm or suspected to be positive, intraoperative frozen section pathology was routinely performed for confirmation. Anastomosis was completed by hand-sewn technique. The decision to construct a diverting stoma was based on factors such as the distance from the anastomosis to the anal verge, perfusion status of the anastomotic bowel, the patient’s preference, and the surgeon’s clinical judgment.

Intraoperative assessment of anastomotic tension was based on the clinical judgment. A tension-free anastomosis was confirmed by ensuring that the proximal bowel could be delivered into the pelvis without undue traction. When necessary, additional mesenteric mobilization or splenic flexure mobilization was performed to reduce tension prior to anastomosis construction.

In the FL group, ICG was administered exclusively via intravenous injection at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg to assess bowel perfusion and anastomotic blood supply. Perfusion assessment was conducted intracorporeally under laparoscopy using fluorescence imaging system. Following ICG injection, fluorescence distribution within the bowel was observed in real time, typically within 10–60 s, to evaluate microvascular perfusion and ensure adequate blood supply at the planned transection and anastomotic sites, without exteriorizing the bowel.

Mesenteric division was performed at the planned transection level prior to ICG injection. Perfusion was primarily assessed using the monochrome fluorescence mode to visualize the microvasculature, with the transection line determined by the visible end of arterioles. Areas showing reduced or delayed fluorescence indicated poor perfusion and necessitated further proximal resection. If required, ICG was readministered to reassess vascular integrity. Merged imaging mode was deemed less reliable owing to diffuse fluorescence in the surrounding peritoneum.

After anastomosis construction, a second dose of ICG was administered, and the anastomotic site was examined under fluorescence with an anoscope to assess perfusion integrity. Leak testing in the FL group combined ICG fluorescence assessment and underwater testing, while the control group relied solely on gross inspection of bowel viability and underwater leak testing. Decisions regarding revision of transection margins or creation of diverting stomas were based on ICG findings, bowel viability, and patient risk factors.

Anastomotic leakage (AL) was classified into three grades: Grade A (radiologic leak without symptoms or intervention), Grade B (symptomatic leak requiring nonsurgical management), and Grade C (symptomatic leak requiring surgical reintervention). Structural sequelae of AL (SSAL) included chronic complications such as stenosis, rectovaginal fistula, rectourethral fistula, and presacral sinus. All patients underwent postoperative contrast enema and flexible sigmoidoscopy for leak detection.

Data collected included patient demographics (age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes status), clinical parameters (surgical variabilities and nCRT), tumor characteristics (distance from anal verge, size, grade, and pathological stage), and laboratory indices (hemoglobin, albumin, and CEA levels). Perioperative variables, such as operative duration, blood loss, left colic artery preservation, anastomotic level, postoperative complications, and hospitalization length, were also recorded. Patients were followed up regularly (every 3 months for 2 years, biannually for 3 years, and annually thereafter), with SSAL events documented. The primary endpoint was the incidence of AL within 6 months postoperatively, with SSAL as the secondary endpoint.

Intergroup differences were assessed using chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests. Variables with aP-value < 0.10 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression models. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using a 1:2 nearest-neighbor algorithm with a caliper of 0.2 standard deviations of the logit-transformed estimated propensity score (EPS). Matching covariates included age, sex, BMI, tumor size, location and stage, preoperative therapy, anastomotic height, LCA preservation, and diverting ileostomy status. To minimize temporal bias, patients were stratified by biennial surgical periods during PSM. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for both univariate and multivariate analyses. A stepwise backward elimination method was used to identify independent predictors of AL. All statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.3) and SPSS (version 25.0), with statistical significance defined asP< 0.05.

A total of 533 patients undergoing low anterior resection were included in the study, with 402 patients in the non-FL group and 131 patients in the FL group before propensity score matching (PSM). After PSM with 1:2 ratio, 262 patients were successfully matched in the non-FL group to the 131 patients in the FL group. The demographic and clinical characteristics before and after PSM are summarized in Table1.

Prior to matching, significant differences were observed between the groups, particularly in surgical strategy. The FL group had a markedly higher rate of left colic artery (LCA) preservation compared with the non-FL group (77.1% versus 48.0%,P< 0.001; SMD = 0.630), suggesting potential selection bias in operative planning. Although not statistically significant, the non-FL group tended to include a higher proportion of patients with smaller tumors (≤ 35 mm: 53.5% versus 43.5%,P= 0.060; SMD = 0.201) and early T-stage disease (T1–2: 44.3% versus 35.1%,P= 0.081; SMD = 0.188). These imbalances could potentially confound perioperative outcome comparisons.

Following PSM, baseline characteristics between the two cohorts were well balanced across all measured variables, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) falling below the conventional threshold of 0.20, indicating adequate covariate balance. Age (59.2 ± 10.9 versus 60.6 ± 10.1 years,P= 0.411; SMD = 0.089), BMI (24.0 ± 3.0 versus 23.9 ± 3.0 kg/m2,P= 0.807; SMD = 0.026), and tumor size (38.4 ± 15.4 versus 39.0 ± 15.5 mm,P= 0.695; SMD = 0.056) were comparable between the non-FL and FL groups. Key oncological factors, including tumor stage (T3–4: 60.7% versus 64.9%,P= 0.485; SMD = 0.087) and nodal status (N+: 35.9% versus 40.5%,P= 0.439; SMD = 0.094), also showed no significant differences.

Importantly, the proportion of patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) was similar between groups (14.9% versus 17.6%,P= 0.590; SMD = 0.073), supporting a balanced distribution of treatment-related factors that could influence postoperative outcomes. Furthermore, rates of LCA preservation and diverting ileostomy, both of which may impact anastomotic integrity, were comparable after matching (P= 0.486 andP= 0.570, respectively).

These results affirm that the PSM approach effectively minimized baseline imbalances, enabling a robust comparative analysis of surgical outcomes between patients undergoing conventional surgery versus those guided by fluorescent laparoscopy.

The mean operative time was comparable between the FL and non-FL groups overall (192.1 ± 66.2 min versus 183.8 ± 62.9 min,P= 0.232), as well as within the non-nCRT (P= 0.273) and nCRT subgroups (P= 0.863). However, blood loss during surgery was significantly lower in the FL group compared with the non-FL group overall (45.2 ± 58.9 mL versus 65.3 ± 73.1 mL,P= 0.004), as well as in the non-nCRT subgroup (41.2 ± 38.2 mL versus 61.9 ± 67.0 mL,P< 0.001), suggesting a potential benefit in terms of intraoperative hemostasis with the use of fluorescence laparoscopic surgery (Table2).

The total number of lymph nodes (LNs) retrieved was significantly higher in the FL group (21.2 ± 11.4 versus 16.6 ± 7.3,P< 0.001), including among patients who did not receive nCRT (20.8 ± 11.1 versus 16.3 ± 7.0,P< 0.001). Although the difference was not statistically significant in the nCRT subgroup (P= 0.085), a trend toward higher LN retrieval was observed. Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients in the FL group met the benchmark for lymph node retrieval: ≥ 12 LNs (87.8% versus 77.5%,P= 0.014) and ≥ 25 LNs (30.5% versus 11.8%,P< 0.001). Notably, the FL group also demonstrated significantly higher retrieval of ≥ 25 LNs in the nCRT subgroup (34.8% versus 12.8%,P= 0.040).

The incidence of intraoperative bleeding, ileus, and infection did not differ significantly between the FL and non-FL groups across all strata (Table2). Specifically, intraoperative bleeding occurred in 2.3% of patients in the non-FL group and 3.1% in the FL group (P= 0.672), with similar rates observed in the non-nCRT (2.2% versus 2.2%,P= 0.852) and nCRT subgroups (7.7% versus 4.3%,P= 0.621).

Similarly, the occurrence of ileus was comparable between the FL and non-FL groups, with 3.8% of patients in the non-FL group and 4.2% in the FL group experiencing ileus (P= 0.887). This trend was consistent in the non-nCRT subgroup (2.7% versus 2.8%,P= 0.960) and the nCRT subgroup (12.8% versus 8.7%,P= 0.630). Infection rates were also similar across both groups, with 3.8% of non-FL patients and 5.3% of FL patients experiencing postoperative infections (P= 0.487). Again, there were no significant differences within the non-nCRT subgroup (3.6% versus 2.8%,P= 0.711) or the nCRT subgroup (15.4% versus 8.7%,P= 0.462).

While the differences did not reach statistical significance, the FL group consistently demonstrated lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the non-FL group, suggesting a potential trend towards reduced perioperative risks with the use of fluorescent laparoscopy.

Furthermore, the length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the FL group compared with the non-FL group (9.5 ± 3.1 days versus 10.7 ± 3.8 days,P= 0.012). This was particularly evident in non-nCRT patients (9.1 ± 3.0 days versus 10.3 ± 3.6 days,P= 0.018) and in the nCRT subgroup (10.5 ± 3.6 days versus 12.3 ± 4.1 days,P= 0.036).

Patients in the FL group exhibited significantly faster recovery (Table2). Time to first passage of gas was shorter in the FL group compared with the non-FL group (2.6 ± 0.7 days versus 2.9 ± 0.8 days,P= 0.008), with similar trends observed in the non-nCRT (P= 0.011) and nCRT subgroups (P= 0.047). The FL group also transitioned to a soft diet earlier than the non-FL group (3.8 ± 1.2 days versus 4.2 ± 1.3 days,P= 0.002), with a similar pattern noted in the non-nCRT subgroup (P= 0.022). Although the difference was not statistically significant in the nCRT subgroup (P= 0.088), a trend toward earlier diet progression was observed in the FL group.

The comparison of AL rates between the FL and non-FL groups revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of AL in the FL group (Table3). Among all patients, the overall AL rate was significantly lower in the FL group (3.1%) compared with the non-FL group (11.5%) (P= 0.005). Similarly, when considering the severity of AL, patients in the FL group exhibited a significantly lower incidence of severe symptomatic anastomotic leaks (SSAL), with only 0.8% of FL patients experiencing SSAL, compared with 6.1% in the non-FL group (P= 0.014). This underscores the advantage of fluorescence laparoscopic surgery in minimizing both the occurrence and severity of AL.

Regarding AL grade, the FL group had fewer grade A–B leaks (3.1% versus 8.4% in the non-FL group), and this difference approached statistical significance (P= 0.045). However, the incidence of grade C AL did not differ significantly between the two groups (P= 0.283), with only one case of grade C AL in the FL group (0.8%) compared with eight in the non-FL group (3.1%).

In the non-nCRT subgroup, the FL group demonstrated a significant reduction in the overall AL rate (1.9% in FL versus 7.2% in non-FL,P= 0.045), indicating that fluorescence laparoscopic surgery can reduce the incidence of AL even without the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Furthermore, although the proportion of patients with grade A–B AL was lower in the FL group (1.9% versus 6.3%), this difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.228), suggesting a trend toward reduced severity of AL in the FL group. The incidence of SSAL was also notably lower in the FL group, with no cases of SSAL compared with 4.0% in the non-FL group, though this difference was marginally nonsignificant (P= 0.079).

In the nCRT subgroup, the FL group exhibited a trend toward lower AL rates (13.0% versus 35.9% in the non-FL group), approaching statistical significance (P= 0.051). Although this difference did not reach conventional statistical significance, it suggests that fluorescence laparoscopic surgery may offer a protective effect in patients undergoing nCRT, who are typically at a higher risk for complications. The proportion of patients with grade A–B AL was lower in the FL group (8.7% versus 25.6%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.194).

In this subgroup, the FL group also had fewer cases of SSAL (4.3% versus 20.5%), although this difference was, again, not statistically significant (P= 0.170). The incidence of other complications, such as stenosis, rectovaginal fistula, and presacral sinus, was similar between the two groups, and none of these differences reached statistical significance.

The case in Fig.3demonstrates the use of multi-modal fluorescence imaging in a patient. Intraoperative color mode (Fig.3A) and merged mode (Fig.3B) showed acceptable perfusion, while monochrome fluorescence (Fig.3C) identified a 3 cm × 1 cm ischemic area near the anastomosis. Colonoscopy showed no ischemia in the colon mucosa (Fig.3D). Postoperatively, the patient developed abdominal pain and fever, with emergent colonoscopy revealing necrosis at the ischemic site (Fig.3E). On day 7, ulcers with white moss were observed (Fig.3F), and the patient was discharged on day 14. Scar formation was noted on day 30 (Fig.3G), and a rectovaginal fistula developed by day 60 (Fig.3H). This example highlights the value of multimodal fluorescence for ischemia detection and monitoring.

The results of this study highlight the potential benefits of fluorescence laparoscopic (FL) surgery in reducing the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients with low rectal cancer, particularly those undergoing intersphincteric resection (ISR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Our findings demonstrate that FL, utilizing indocyanine green (ICG) for real-time visualization of tissue perfusion, significantly lowers both the overall rate and severity of AL compared with traditional methods of assessing anastomotic integrity. What is more, the higher lymph node yield observed in the FL group may not be directly attributable to ICG fluorescence but rather to improved intraoperative visualization that facilitates precise dissection. Nonetheless, surgical variability and potential selection bias cannot be excluded. This study contributes valuable evidence to the ongoing search for strategies to optimize surgical outcomes and reduce postoperative complications in this high-risk population.

As established by numerous previous studies, nCRT is a standard preoperative treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer, aiming to downstage tumors and improve surgical resectability [15,16]. However, despite its oncologic benefits, nCRT can also compromise the blood supply to the anastomotic site, leading to a heightened risk of AL. AL, a common and serious complication in low rectal cancer surgery, is known to increase postoperative morbidity and mortality, prolong hospital stays, and detract from long-term survival. The occurrence of AL is multifactorial, involving both technical aspects of surgery and biological changes induced by preoperative treatments such as nCRT [17–20]. Thus, understanding and mitigating the risk factors for AL remain critical challenges in colorectal surgery, especially for ultra-low rectal cancers treated with ISR.

In this context, FL surgery has emerged as a promising tool to improve intraoperative decision-making and potentially reduce complications such as AL. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of ICG fluorescence to enhance the identification of vascular structures and tissue perfusion during various colorectal surgeries [21–23]. While the application of fluorescence has been explored extensively in other colorectal surgeries, its specific role in low rectal cancer, particularly in post-nCRT scenarios, remains underexplored. Our study is one of the first to focus on the potential impact of fluorescence guidance in low rectal cancer surgery following nCRT, and it provides encouraging results.

The FL surgery group in our study had significantly lower rates of AL compared with the non-FL group, with a marked reduction in both grade A–B leaks and severe symptomatic anastomotic leaks (SSAL). This suggests that FL not only enhances the identification of critical vascular structures but also aids in optimizing anastomotic sites, thereby improving tissue perfusion and reducing the risk of AL. The lower incidence of SSAL in the FL group is particularly noteworthy, as SSAL is associated with chronic complications that can severely affect patient quality of life.

Furthermore, the subgroup analysis based on nCRT treatment showed that fluorescence guidance can reduce AL even in the more challenging cohort of patients who have received preoperative chemoradiation. While the difference did not reach statistical significance in the nCRT subgroup, the trend toward reduced AL rates in the FL group (13.0% versus 35.9%) underscores the potential protective effect of fluorescence laparoscopic surgery in these patients. This is consistent with the notion that nCRT-induced alterations in blood supply may be better addressed with real-time, precise perfusion visualization. To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight that real-time perfusion assessment with fluorescence laparoscopic surgery contributes to improved outcomes in patients with high-risk low rectal cancer, especially those treated with nCRT.

In addition to its potential impact on AL, fluorescence guidance was associated with several other intraoperative and postoperative benefits. The FL group demonstrated lower blood loss, higher lymph node retrieval rates, and faster recovery times. These findings suggest that FL not only improves surgical precision but also enhances the overall quality of surgery, which may contribute to better long-term oncological outcomes. The ability to assess blood flow in real-time allows for more meticulous dissection, particularly in the critical mesenteric and anastomotic areas, which can result in less intraoperative bleeding and better lymph node retrieval. A key contribution of our work is the exploration of a dual-mode imaging strategy. While merged imaging offers significant advantages in anatomical orientation and lymphatic drainage mapping, it often encounters the challenge of background fluorescence interference. This can complicate accurate perfusion assessment, particularly in the complex pelvic environment. In our approach, utilizing a monochrome mode has proven especially effective in precisely delineating the microvascular supply to the bowel, a critical factor in ensuring anastomotic integrity. Our prior study similarly demonstrated that isolating the monochrome fluorescence signal enhances the assessment of bowel viability [24].

This retrospective study has inherent limitations. Although propensity score matching was employed to minimize baseline differences between groups, the possibility of selection bias cannot be entirely excluded. While fluorescence-guided surgery demonstrated benefits in both non-nCRT and nCRT subgroups, several results, particularly within the nCRT cohort, did not reach statistical significance. Larger prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings and to establish standardized protocols for ICG administration and fluorescence assessment. Additionally, known confounding factors such as smoking and diabetes were considered; however, other relevant variables including peripheral vascular disease and corticosteroid use were not systematically recorded and therefore not analyzed. The impact of these factors on outcomes remains unclear and should be addressed in future studies with more comprehensive data collection. Finally, long-term oncological outcomes were not evaluated owing to limited follow-up duration. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether the observed short-term improvements with fluorescence guidance translate into enhanced long-term survival and reduced recurrence.

In conclusion, fluorescence laparoscopic surgery using ICG shows considerable potential in reducing AL and improving other key surgical outcomes in patients with low rectal cancer, especially those who have undergone nCRT. The ability to assess tissue perfusion in real time provides surgeons with crucial information that can optimize anastomotic integrity and reduce postoperative complications. This technique may offer significant advantages over traditional methods, especially in high-risk populations, and warrants further investigation in future clinical trials to validate its role in improving surgical outcomes in low rectal cancer surgery.
