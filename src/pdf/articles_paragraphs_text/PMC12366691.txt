Eukaryotes have evolved defense systems to protect their genomes from invasive genetic elements. We report a fungal defense mechanism, tandem repeat–induced sexual silencing (TRISS), active during sexual stages. TRISS is a unique RNA interference (RNAi) pathway distinct from known mechanisms like quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Triggered by tandem repeats, it involves RNAi components similar to quelling but uniquely includes the MSUD-specific Argonaute Sms2. TRISS operates independently of recombination. We identified small interfering RNA sassociated with TRISS (trasiRNAs) in tandem repeats. Sms2, guided by trasiRNAs, mediates translational repression of target mRNAs and is crucial for trasiRNA biogenesis. TRISS requires the DNA methyltransferase Rid but not Rid-mediated repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Both Sms2 and Rid interact with replication protein A (RPA) to recruit the RPA-Qde1/RdRP complex, dependent on the helicase Qde3. This study reveals a potentially conserved strategy linking RIP and RNAi to silence tandem repeats during fungal sexual stages, offering insights into fungal genome defense.

TRISS, an RNAi-mediated defense mechanism, silences tandem repeats in conjunction with RIP during the sexual stages in fungi.

All living organisms face threats from invading genetic elements, such as transgenes, transposons, and viruses. These elements can repeatedly insert themselves into the genome, disrupting normal genes, causing harmful recombination, and leading to uncontrolled gene activity, which ultimately threatens the stability of the genome (1,2). To defend against these threats, most organisms have evolved advanced genome defense systems called homology-dependent gene silencing (HDGS). These systems detect and deactivate repeated sequences introduced by these parasitic genetic elements (3,4).

One of the best-studied HDGS mechanisms is RNA interference (RNAi), which is conserved across eukaryotes and protects the genome from both internal elements like transposons and external invaders like viruses (5–8). The RNAi process begins with an enzyme called Dicer, which cuts long double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules into short fragments known as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are then loaded into Argonaute (Ago) proteins. One strand of the siRNA is removed, while the other strand guides Ago to identify and destroy matching RNA molecules in the cytoplasm. In addition to silencing RNA posttranscriptionally, RNAi can also act at the transcriptional level by modifying DNA in the nucleus (9–11). Some organisms also use RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to create dsRNA from single-stranded (ss) RNA or to amplify siRNA signals, further strengthening the RNAi response (11–14).

During sexual reproduction, invading genetic elements can spread between the two genomes contributed by the parents. To prevent this, many organisms have evolved specific defense mechanisms that target and destroy these elements before they can be passed on to the next generation (15). For example, in plants, reproductive tissues produce specific siRNAs that guide DNA modifications, silencing transposons at the transcriptional level (16). In animals, a specialized RNAi pathway involving PIWI-interacting RNAs protects reproductive cells by silencing transposons, ensuring the integrity of the germline genome (17). In the yeastCryptococcus neoformans, a defense mechanism called sex-induced silencing (SIS) uses RNAi to detect and silence repeated genetic sequences during the sexual cycle (18). In the filamentous fungusNeurospora crassa, three distinct genome defense mechanisms have been found: quelling, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) (3,4,19,20).

Both quelling and MSUD use RNAi to silence harmful genetic elements. Quelling occurs during normal growth, while MSUD is active during meiosis (21). The quelling process involves proteins such as RdRP (Qde-1), Dicer enzymes (Dcl-1 and Dcl-2), Ago (Qde-2), RecQ helicase (Qde-3), and a Qde-2–interacting protein (Qip). The MSUD process consists of overlapping components from quelling (Dcl-1 and Qip), as well as MSUD-specific components such as RdRP (Sad-1), Ago (Sms-2), and helicase (Sad-3). In quelling, siRNA production requires both DNA tandem repeats and a double-strand break (DSB) (22). The putative homologous recombination (HR) intermediates of repetitive sequences are recognized by Qde-3, leading to the recruitment of Qde-1 and ssDNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) (22,23). Qde-1 exhibits RdRP and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) activities (24), producing aberrant ssRNAs (aRNAs) and then dsRNAs to activate the downstream RNAi pathway. MSUD, on the other hand, is triggered by unpaired DNA regions during meiosis. These unpaired regions produce siRNAs, which silence both matching and nonmatching copies of genes in the genome (25–27).

RIP, the first genome defense system found in eukaryotes, operates before meiosis during the sexual reproduction of filamentous ascomycetes (3,28–30). RIP introduces C-to-T mutations into repeated DNA regions, effectively disabling them (31). RIP relies on the putative DNA methyltransferase Rid (32). InN. crassa, RIP-mutated sequences can also direct trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by the histone methyltransferase Dim-5, which then leads to methylation of associated cytosines by the DNA methyltransferase Dim-2 (33). Recently, a Rid-independent pathway of RIP was found inN. crassa(34). This pathway tends to mutate the linker region between tandem repeats and requires Dim-2, Dim-5, and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). However, there is currently no known cross-talk between the RIP and RNAi mechanisms.

The filamentous fungusFusarium graminearumis a major pathogen causing Fusarium head blight, a devastating disease on cereal crops worldwide. This fungus is self-fertile and produces abundant sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) in laboratory conditions, making it an ideal model for studying genome defense mechanisms during sexual reproduction. Both RIP and MSUD have been observed inF. graminearum(35,36). In addition, a regulatory mechanism called A-to-I mRNA editing, which occurs specifically during sexual stages, has been shown to play a critical role in the sexual development of this fungus (37–43).

In this study, we describe a genome defense mechanism inF. graminearumcalled tandem repeat–induced sexual silencing (TRISS). TRISS is a distinct RNAi pathway specifically activated by tandem repeat sequences. While it shares some components with the quelling pathway, TRISS uniquely involves the MSUD-specific Ago protein FgSms2. We identified TRISS-associated siRNAs (trasiRNAs) localized within tandem repeat regions. Our research demonstrates that FgSms2, guided by trasiRNAs, is essential for both suppressing the translation of target mRNAs and facilitating the production of trasiRNAs. Furthermore, we found that FgRid is indispensable for TRISS, functioning independently of the RIP pathway. We uncovered two key mechanisms that enhance the TRISS response, both of which operate independently of traditional transitive siRNA amplification: (i) FgSms2 interacts with FgRpa1 to recruit the FgRpa1-FgQde1 complex to ssDNA in a trasiRNA-dependent manner, and (ii) FgRid interacts with FgRpa1 to similarly recruit the FgRpa1-FgQde1 complex. These interactions rely on the helicase protein FgQde3, whose recruitment to tandem repeat regions is dependent on FgRid activity. This suggests that FgQde3 may recognize specific intermediates introduced by FgRid, triggering DNA unwinding and activating the TRISS pathway. Our findings provide evidence that TRISS may represent a conserved mechanism linking the RIP and RNAi pathways to silence harmful genetic elements during sexual reproduction. This study not only advances our understanding of fungal genome defense systems but also broadens our knowledge of RNAi mechanisms in eukaryotes.

In a previous study (44), we performed complementation assays on theFgama1deletion mutant, which exhibits defects in ascospore morphology, by introducing the pFL2 plasmid containing the full-lengthFgAMA1gene. Two distinct types of transformants were observed (Fig. 1A). One group produced asci with eight spindle-shaped ascospores, resembling the wild type and indicating successful complementation. The other group produced asci with eight oval ascospores, similar to the deletion mutant, suggesting unsuccessful complementation. Notably, all transformants contained theFgAMA1gene (Fig. 1B). Subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays revealed that the complemented transformants had only one copy ofFgAMA1, while the uncomplemented transformants had multiple copies (Fig. 1C).

Colony color is shown from the reverse side forpks12and TR-PKS12. Scale bar, 20 μm. For (C) and (F), bar graphs show the mean of three technical replicates.

Although gene silencing can be caused by RIP associated with multicopy transgene repeats, the severity and consistency of the defective phenotype in each ascus suggested that RIP was not the primary cause in this case. To investigate further, we isolated 15 ascospore progeny from the uncomplemented transformants and performed Sanger sequencing to detect RIP mutations inFgAMA1. Six progeny showed no amino acid changes caused by RIP mutations inFgAMA1(Fig. 1D) despite the abnormal phenotypes observed in the isolated ascospores. These observations suggest that RIP is not the primary cause of gene silencing in the uncomplemented transformants. Similar phenomena were observed in complementation assays on the deletion mutants ofCDC2A(45) andTUB1(46) (fig. S1), indicating that the gene silencing phenomenon is not specific toFgAMA1and may be a more general phenomenon.

To explore this silencing further, we transformed a linear fragment containing the full-lengthFgAMA1gene fused with a hygromycin-resistance gene (hyg) into the wild-type strain PH-1. We expected two types of transformants: one with unlinked repeats ofFgAMA1due to random integration via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), and the other with tandem repeats ofFgAMA1at its native locus via HR (Fig. 1E). We obtained five transformants (R-FgAMA1) containing at least one additional copy ofFgAMA1(Fig. 1F), all of which displayed phenotypes similar to the deletion mutant (Fig. 1G). PCR assays confirmed that these transformants had tandemly repeatedFgAMA1at the native locus (Fig. 1H). Further analysis of eight ascospore progeny from a transformant with two tandemly repeatedFgAMA1copies revealed that five progeny showed no RIP mutations in at least one repeat (Fig. 1I), providing additional evidence that RIP was not the cause of silencing.

A similar experiment withCDC2Ayielded four transformants (R-CDC2A) (Fig. 1F), three of which exhibited deletion mutant phenotypes and tandemly repeatedCDC2A, while the fourth showed wild-type phenotypes without tandem repeats (Fig. 1, G and H). To confirm this observation, we introduced an ectopic copy ofCDC2Aat a specific locus (FG1G36140) in PH-1. The resulting transformants with unlinked repeats (UR-CDC2A) exhibited normal phenotypes (Fig. 1G). These results indicate that the silencing phenomenon is triggered by tandem repeats rather than unlinked repeats.

SinceCDC2AandFgAMA1deletion mutants exhibited defects only during sexual stages, these genes could only be used to determine whether silencing occurs during sexual development. To investigate whether silencing also occurs during vegetative stages, we examined theTUB1gene, which affects both sexual reproduction and vegetative growth when deleted (46). Transformants with tandemly repeatedTUB1at its native locus (TR-TUB1) displayed silencing phenotypes during sexual reproduction but not during vegetative growth (Fig. 1, H and J). To confirm these findings, we conducted a similar experiment withPKS12, a gene involved in pigment biosynthesis (47). While thepks12deletion mutant formed white colonies, the TR-PKS12transformants displayed the normal red-pink phenotype of the wild type (Fig. 1, H and J). These results suggest that tandem repeats trigger gene silencing specifically during the sexual stage.

Since the silencing phenotypes are observed during self-fertilization, we can rule out MSUD as the cause of the silencing. Furthermore, transformants with tandemly repeatedFgCLN2, which encodes a B-type cyclin essential for viability, exhibited normal vegetative growth but defects in crozier formation (Fig. 1, H and J). This indicates that silencing occurs premeiotically and can take place throughout sexual development, from the dikaryotic stage to ascospore differentiation. On the basis of these findings, we named this silencing phenomenon TRISS.

To investigate whether the mode of tandem-repeat formation influences TRISS, we used two additional strategies to create tandem repeats ofCDC2A. In the first strategy, HR occurred between the native gene and a linear homologous fragment, while in the second strategy, HR occurred in the linker region between the two repeats (Fig. 2A). In both cases, transformants with tandemly repeatedCDC2Adisplayed deletion mutant phenotypes, indicating that TRISS is independent of the repeat formation mode.

(B) Ascus and ascospore morphology of the transformants containing a reverse tandem repeat ofCDC2A(a), an extra copy ofCDC2Ainserted at the FG1G36140 locus in chromosome 1 ectopically expressing antisense transcripts by the RP27 promoter (b), and a tandem repeat ofCDC2Ainserted at the FG1G36140 locus (c). (C) Ascus and ascospore morphology of the transformants containing a tandem repeat ofFgAMA1with ahyg(a), a G418-resistance gene (neo) (b), and a nongene sequence (c) as the linker, respectively.

(E) Ascus and ascospore morphology of the outcrosses of WT, theFgama1andcdc2Adeletion mutants, or the transformants containing a tandem repeat ofFgAMA1(TR-FgAMA1) orCDC2A(TR-CDC2A) as the male with themat1–1-1deletion mutant labeled with H1-GFP as the female. Eight ascospores in each ascus showed 1:1 segregation for GFP signals. Diagram represents the allele locus in each outcross. DIC, differential interference contrast. Scale bar, 20 μm.

We also constructed transformants with reverse tandem repeats ofCDC2A. These transformants exhibited silencing ofCDC2A(Fig. 2B). However, transformants ectopically expressing antisense transcripts ofCDC2Afrom an extra copy inserted at the FG1G36140 locus displayed normal phenotypes (Fig. 2B). This suggests that antisense transcription alone cannot silenceCDC2A, and TRISS is independent of the orientation of tandem repeats.

To rule out the possibility that gene silencing is caused by the expression of resistance marker genes in the linker between repeats, we constructed tandemly repeatedFgAMA1with a G418-resistance gene (neo) or a nongene sequence as the linker (Fig. 2C). In both cases,FgAMA1was completely silenced, as observed in transformants with thehyglinker. Therefore, TRISS is unrelated to the linker sequence or whether it contains expressed genes.

Our results suggest that two tandem repeats are sufficient to trigger TRISS during sexual reproduction. To determine whether silencing efficiency depends on repeat length, we created constructs with direct repeats of varying lengths [1080 to 3187 base pairs (bp)] ofCDC2Aseparated by aneolinker (1433 bp) (Fig. 2D). Longer repeats (3187 and 2643 bp) induced complete silencing ofCDC2A, resulting in very few ascospores. Shorter repeats (2117 and 1613 bp) exhibited reduced silencing efficiency, with deformed or normal ascospores observed. Repeats shorter than 1109 bp did not induce silencing. These results indicate that TRISS efficiency depends on repeat length, with longer repeats being more effective.

We also investigated the effect of linker length between tandem repeats. Increasing the linker length from 1433 to 7006 bp reduced silencing efficiency (Fig. 2D). This result aligns with the observation that unlinked repeats cannot induce TRISS. Thus, both repeat length and the distance between repeats are critical factors for TRISS efficiency, with longer repeats and shorter distances enhancing silencing.

AlthoughF. graminearumis homothallic, it can undergo outcrossing. To test whether TRISS occurs during outcrossing, we crossed a TR-FgAMA1transformant (male) with a self-sterile but female-fertilemat1–1-1deletion mutant labeled with H1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) (44). For comparison, we also subjected theFgama1deletion mutant to a similar outcross to evaluate MSUD efficiency.

As expected, the outcross involving theFgama1deletion mutant resulted in asci containing ascospores with a 1:1 segregation of eight ascospores with and without GFP signals in each ascus (Fig. 2E). However, some ascospores exhibited abnormal morphologies, such as oval shapes or intermediate forms between oval and spindle-shaped, indicating that MSUD could only partially silenceFgAMA1. In contrast, during the outcrossing of the TR-FgAMA1transformant, all eight ascospores in each ascus were oval-shaped (Fig. 2E), resembling the results observed during self-fertilization. This suggests that TRISS, in combination with MSUD, achieves complete silencing of all three copies ofFgAMA1during outcrossing. Similar results were obtained when testing the TR-CDC2Atransformant, indicating that TRISS occurs in both selfing and outcrossing scenarios.

The outcrossing results also demonstrate that TRISS can function in trans. To further explore the trans silencing of the nativeCDC2Agene, we introduced a tandem repeat construct ofCDC2Aat an ectopic locus (FG1G36140) in PH-1 (Fig. 2B). The resulting transformants exhibited defects in ascospore formation, providing evidence that the nativeCDC2Agene was silenced in trans by the tandem repeat construct.

TheF. graminearumgenome encodes two Ago proteins (FgQde2 and FgSms2) and two Dicer proteins (FgDcl1 and FgDcl2) (Fig. 3A) (48,49). To determine whether TRISS depends on the RNAi machinery, we created deletion mutants for each of these four genes and transformed a linear fragment containing the full-lengthFgAMA1gene fused with theneomarker into these mutants to generate tandemly repeatedFgAMA1. We found that deletion ofFgQDE2,FgDCL1, orFgDCL2had no effect onFgAMA1silencing. However, in theFgsms2mutants containing tandemly repeatedFgAMA1, oval ascospores were no longer produced (Fig. 3B), indicating that the Ago protein FgSms2, but not FgQde2, is essential for TRISS.

(A) Comparison of the components identified in the TRISS machinery with those of two RNAi-related pathways: quelling and MSUD, which are known inN. crassa. (B) Morphology of asci and ascospores in marked strains showing the presence or absence ofFgAMA1tandem repeats (TR-FgAMA1)–induced TRISS in RNAi-related gene deletion mutants and the slicing-defectiveFgSMS2D696Amutant. Scale bar, 20 μm.

Since Dcl-1 and Dcl-2 are functionally redundant in quelling (50,51), we generated double mutants (Fgdcl1 Fgdcl2) and observed thatFgAMA1silencing was completely abolished (Fig. 3B). This indicates that FgDcl1 and FgDcl2 are functionally redundant in TRISS.

To identify additional RNAi components involved in TRISS, we created deletion mutants for other core RNAi machinery components inF. graminearum, including Qde2-interacting protein (FgQip), five RdRPs (FgQde1, FgSad1, and FgRdrp3–5), and two helicases (FgQde3 and FgSad3) (Fig. 3A) (48). Silencing ofFgAMA1was abolished in theFgqde1,Fgqde3, andFgqipmutants (Fig. 3B), suggesting that FgQde1, FgQde3, and FgQip are also required for TRISS. However, deletion ofFgSAD1,FgSAD3, andFgRDRP3–5had no effect onFgAMA1silencing. In addition, we generatedFgrdrp3 Fgrdrp4 Fgrdrp5triple mutants and confirmed that these genes are not involved in TRISS.

In conclusion, TRISS is mediated by an RNAi mechanism that uses a distinct combination of components from the RNAi machinery involved in quelling and MSUD pathways. These components include FgQde1, FgQde3, FgSms2, FgDcl1, FgDcl2, and FgQip (Fig. 3A).

To investigate whether small RNAs are generated during TRISS, we isolated small RNAs from 7-day postfertilization (dpf) perithecia of the TR-FgAMA1and TR-CDC2Atransformants, which contain tandem repeats of full-lengthFgAMA1andCDC2Aat their native loci, respectively. We then performed small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq).

Abundant small RNAs, ranging from 20 to 27 nucleotides (nt) in length, were detected in the tandem repeat regions ofFgAMA1andCDC2A, with 24 nt being the predominant size (Fig. 4, A and B). These small RNAs exhibited a strong preference for uracil (U) at the 5′ end, but no obvious biases at the 3′ end (Fig. 4Aand fig. S2). The small RNAs were derived from both sense and antisense strands of the tandem repeats (Fig. 4B), indicating that their biogenesis requires the formation of dsRNA. We refer to these small RNAs as trasiRNAs.

(A) Size distribution and normalized abundance of trasiRNAs derived from a tandem repeat of full-lengthFgAMA1(TR-FgAMA1) andCDC2A(TR-CDC2A) genes, a 2643-bpCDC2Afragment (TR-CDC2A2643), and an IGR (TR-IGR) in the wild-type background or in theFgqde1,Fgsms2, andFgSMS2D696Amutant backgrounds. All trasiRNA abundances were normalized to reads per ten million (RPTM). The 5′ base of reads is represented by different colors. (B) Distribution and count of trasiRNAs mapped to the forward (blue) and reverse (red) strands of the marked tandem repeats. The structure of tandem repeats is shown above. (C) Distribution and count of trasiRNAs from eight copies of tandemly repeated 3′ regions ofPKS12and a tandem repeat ofCDC2Awith the C terminus of the upstream copy fused to a GFP tag. Arrows indicate transcriptional start sites. Vertical dotted lines mark the transcriptional regions outside the repeat regions.

As a control, only a few small RNAs were detected in theFgAMA1andCDC2Aloci in the wild-type strain PH-1, and these lacked the 5′-U preference (fig. S3). Most of the small RNAs detected in PH-1 were sense RNAs likely resulting from mRNA degradation.

To determine whether trasiRNA production is associated with the transcription of repeated genes by native promoters, we generated transformants containing tandem repeats of an intergenic region (IGR; chr3: 5806769–5810188 bp) in situ. The IGR repeat length (3420 bp) was comparable to the lengths of theFgAMA1(3602 bp) andCDC2A(3187 bp) repeats. Abundant trasiRNAs were detected in the IGR repeat region by sRNA-seq (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that native transcription of target genes is not strictly necessary for trasiRNA production. However, the amount of trasiRNAs generated from the IGR repeat region was only 50.9 and 27.5% of that produced in the repeat regions ofFgAMA1andCDC2A, respectively. This indicates that native transcription of repeated genes can enhance trasiRNA production.

Consistent with our earlier observation that TRISS efficiency depends on repeat length, the amount of trasiRNAs produced from the 2643-bp tandem repeat of the 3′-region ofCDC2Awas nearly sevenfold lower than that from the 3187-bp tandem repeat of the full-lengthCDC2A(Fig. 4, A and B). The amount of trasiRNAs from theCDC2Arepeat (3187 bp) was higher than that from theFgAMA1repeat (3602 bp) despite its shorter length. This discrepancy may be due to differences in transcription levels during sexual development:CDC2Atranscription is higher in earlier stages but lower in later stages compared toFgAMA1(fig. S4). These findings suggest that higher transcription of tandem repeats in early sexual stages is critical for trasiRNA accumulation in later stages.

In the quelling pathway, Qde-1 generates aRNA and dsRNA molecules from tandem repetitive transgenes, which are subsequently processed into siRNAs by Dicer proteins (Dcl-1 and Dcl-2) (22). To investigate whether FgQde1 plays a similar role in trasiRNA biogenesis during TRISS, we conducted sRNA-seq analysis of perithecia from theFgqde1mutant containing theFgAMA1tandem repeat.

As expected, trasiRNAs were completely absent in the repeatedFgAMA1region in theFgqde1mutant (Fig. 4A). This result demonstrates that FgQde1 is essential for the biogenesis of trasiRNAs in TRISS, likely through its role in generating aRNA or dsRNA from tandem repeats. Unexpectedly, our study also revealed that trasiRNAs were absent in theFgsms2mutant in the repeatedFgAMA1region (Fig. 4A). This finding suggests that FgSms2, an Ago protein, plays a critical role in trasiRNA biogenesis or stability.

Previous studies have shown that mutations in the first or second Asp (D) residue of the DDH motif in Ago proteins abolish their slicer activity, without affecting their ability to bind siRNAs (52,53). To investigate the role of FgSms2 in trasiRNA production and stability, we generated slicing-defectiveFgSMS2D696Amutants. In these mutants, silencing ofFgAMA1was abolished in transformants containing tandemly repeatedFgAMA1(Fig. 3B). Furthermore, sRNA-seq analysis revealed that trasiRNAs were absent in the repeatedFgAMA1region in theFgSMS2D696Amutant (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that the slicer activity of FgSms2 is essential for trasiRNA production in TRISS. The absence of trasiRNAs in theFgsms2andFgSMS2D696Amutants is not merely involved in binding and stabilizing trasiRNAs but is directly required for their biogenesis.

In yeast, plants, and nematodes, siRNA-programmed Ago proteins can recruit RdRPs to synthesize dsRNA using the targeted RNA as a template. This dsRNA is then cleaved by Dicers into secondary siRNAs, a process known as transitivity (11–13). The critical role of FgSms2 in trasiRNA production prompted us to explore whether transitivity occurs in TRISS.

To investigate this, we generated a TR-PKS12transformant containing tandemly repeated 3′-regions ofPKS12. If transitivity were present, secondary trasiRNAs would be produced corresponding to the upstream (5′) nonrepeated regions of nativePKS12transcripts, as dsRNA would extend from the siRNA primer in the 3′-repeated regions to the 5′end of the RNA template. However, sRNA-seq analysis detected abundant trasiRNAs corresponding only to the repeated regions ofPKS12. No trasiRNAs were observed in the upstream nonrepeated regions ofPKS12in the TR-PKS12transformants (Fig. 4Cand fig. S5).

To further investigate whether secondary siRNAs could be generated downstream of a primary siRNA trigger, we created a TR-C2AGFP transformant containing a tandem repeat ofCDC2Awith the C terminus of the upstream copy fused to a GFP tag. sRNA-seq analysis did not detect trasiRNAs corresponding to the GFP region downstream of the repeated regions (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that trasiRNA-programmed FgSms2 does not trigger transitive siRNA amplification in TRISS.

To confirm the suppression of gene expression by trasiRNAs during TRISS, we performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to analyze the expression levels ofFgAMA1in transformants containing anFgAMA1tandem repeat, both with (TR-FgAMA1 Fgqde1) and without (TR-FgAMA1) deletion ofFgQDE1. As expected, in the TR-FgAMA1 Fgqde1transformant, where TRISS is disrupted, the transcript abundance ofFgAMA1was approximately twofold higher than that in the wild type, consistent with the presence of two copies ofFgAMA1(Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, in the TR-FgAMA1transformant, which exhibited complete silencing phenotypes, the transcript abundance ofFgAMA1was comparable to that in the wild type. Similar results were observed forCDC2AandTUB1in transformants containing tandem repeats of these genes (Fig. 5A).

(C) Western blots of total proteins isolated from 24-hour hyphae and 7-dpf perithecia of marked strains, showing the protein abundance of Cdc2A-GFP and Tub1. Proteins were probed with anti-GFP and anti-Tub1 antibodies, respectively. Detection with the anti-GAPDH antibody is used as an internal control for protein loading. (D) Polysome profiling of global translation efficiency and qRT-PCR assays of polysome-associatedCDC2AmRNAs in WT and the TR-C2AGFP transformant, with two independent replicates. Sucrose gradient absorbance (A260) was monitored in each fraction. Each point represents the mean of two independent replicates.

In a TR-CDC2Atransformant (#7) that exhibited complete silencing phenotypes, theCDC2Atranscript abundance was even higher than in the wild type. This suggests that transcript degradation is not the primary mechanism of TRISS. To further investigate, we used the TR-C2AGFP transformant, which contains tandem repeats ofCDC2Afused with GFP, and measured expression levels using repeat-specific primers. As a control, we generated a C2AGFP transformant containing a singleCDC2Acopy fused with GFP. We also created a TR-C2AGFPFgqde1strain by deletingFgQDE1in the TR-C2AGFP transformant (Fig. 5B).

qRT-PCR analysis revealed that during vegetative growth, the transcript abundance of both the upstream and downstreamCDC2Arepeats in the TR-C2AGFP transformant was comparable to that in the C2AGFP transformant and wild type (Fig. 5B), consistent with the absence of TRISS in hyphae. During sexual reproduction, the transcript abundance of both the upstream and downstreamCDC2Arepeats was reduced by approximately half in the TR-C2AGFP transformant. However, the total amount ofCDC2Atranscripts expressed by the TR-C2AGFP transformant remains comparable to that in the C2AGFP transformant and wild type (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that transcript cleavage occurs but is not the primary cause of TRISS-associated silencing phenotypes.

Western blot analysis provided further evidence supporting translational repression as the primary mechanism of TRISS. While the Cdc2A-GFP protein was readily detected in perithecia of the C2AGFP transformant, it was barely detectable in perithecia of the TR-C2AGFP transformant (Fig. 5C). However, the Cdc2A-GFP protein was detected in perithecia of the TR-C2AGFPFgqde1strain and in the hyphae of the TR-C2AGFP transformant. Similar results were observed for Tub1 protein expression in the TR-TUB1transformant containing tandem repeats ofTUB1(Fig. 5C).

Polysome profiling analysis revealed only a modest decrease in the amount of polysome-associatedCDC2AmRNAs in the TR-C2AGFP transformant compared to the wild type (Fig. 5D). This suggests that the base pairing of trasiRNAs with target mRNAs may cause ribosome stalling, leading to impaired translational elongation. Together, these findings indicate that TRISS is primarily driven by the translational repression of target mRNAs by trasiRNAs rather than transcript degradation.

DSB-induced HR is critical for siRNA and quelling-induced siRNA (qiRNA) biogenesis inN. crassa, as it facilitates aRNA production at tandemly inserted transgenes and ribosomal DNA loci (22). To investigate whether TRISS depends on DSB repair pathways, we examined the role of key components in these pathways (Fig. 6A).

(A) Key factors involved in the DSB checkpoint pathway and the two major DSB repair pathways: HR and NHEJ. (B) Ascus and ascospore morphology indicate the presence ofFgAMA1orFgCLN2tandem repeats (TR-FgAMA1or TR-FgCLN2)–induced TRISS in deletion mutants of DSB repair pathways, with the phenotypes of the deletion mutants as a control.

(D) Oval ascospores indicate the presence of TR-FgAMA1–induced TRISS in theFgdim2,Fghp1, andFgdim5deletion mutants. Scale bar, 20 μm.

Canonical meiotic recombination requires Spo11 to produce DSB (54). We generatedFgspo11deletion mutants containing tandem repeats ofFgAMA1and observed that the mutants produced oval ascospores (Fig. 6B), indicating that TRISS still occurs in the absence of Spo11. This suggests that TRISS does not depend on canonical meiotic recombination.

We next examined the roles of Rad51 and Rad54, which are essential components of the eukaryotic HR pathway (55). Deletion ofFgRAD54in transformants containing tandem repeats ofFgAMA1did not affect TRISS, as oval ascospores were still produced (Fig. 6B). SinceFgRAD51deletion mutants did not form ascospores, we used a “silencing the silencer” approach (27) by generating transformants with tandem repeats ofFgRAD51. IfFgRAD51was required for TRISS, it would not be efficiently self-silenced by tandem repeats. However,FgRAD51was completely silenced in the TR-FgRAD51transformants (Fig. 6B), suggesting that neitherFgRAD51norFgRAD54is required for TRISS.

We also examined TRISS occurrence in deletion mutants of other genes involved in DSB repair and checkpoint pathways, including two responsible for sensing DSBs (FgATMandFgATR) (56) and two for NHEJ (FgKU70andFgKU80) (55). As with HR mutants, TRISS was still observed in these DSB checkpoint and NHEJ mutants (Fig. 6B).

Together, these results demonstrate that TRISS does not rely on DSB repair pathways. Recombination between repeats can lead to the loss of repeats. To determine whether trasiRNAs play a role in repeat stabilization, we analyzed ascospore progeny from transformants containing tandem repeats ofFgAMA1with (TR-FgAMA1 Fgqde1) or without (TR-FgAMA1)FgQDE1deletion. PCR analysis revealed that theFgAMA1tandem repeat was stable in all progeny, regardless ofFgQDE1deletion (Fig. 6C). This indicates that tandem repeats are stable during sexual reproduction inF. graminearumand independent of trasiRNAs.

DNA cytosine methylation and H3K9 methylation are critical for siRNA production in many organisms (12,57). To investigate their role in TRISS, we analyzed mutants lacking key components of these pathways.

Deletion of the DNA methyltransferase geneFgDIM2and the HP1 geneFgHP1in TR-FgAMA1transformants did not affect TRISS. Oval ascospores were still produced in both TR-FgAMA1 Fgdim2and TR-FgAMA1 Fghp1mutants (Fig. 6D), indicating that TRISS is independent of DNA methylation mediated by FgDim2 and FgHP1.

To examine the role of H3K9 methylation, we deletedFgDIM5, which mediates H3K9me3 required for constitutive heterochromatin formation (58), in TR-FgAMA1transformants. The mutants still produced oval ascospores (Fig. 6D), indicating that H3K9me3 is not required for TRISS activation. These findings show that TRISS does not depend on DNA cytosine methylation or H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation.

Since tandem repeats induce both TRISS and RIP, we investigated whether there is cross-talk between these two processes. To investigate potential cross-talk between these processes, we analyzed the role ofFgRID, the ortholog of theN. crassa ridgene, which is crucial for RIP inF. graminearum(35).

In the TR-FgAMA1 Fgqde1strain, oval ascospores were observed in 20% of asci in 10-dpf perithecia (Fig. 7A). Deletion ofFgRIDin this strain abolished oval ascospore production (Fig. 7A), confirming that the observed oval ascospores were caused by RIP. These results indicate that RIP operates independently of FgQde1 and TRISS.

(B) Distribution and abundance of trasiRNAs in the tandem repeat regions of the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridstrain.

(D) Morphology of asci and ascospores in marked strains at indicated sexual stages (7 or 10 days). Scale bar, 20 μm.

Unexpectedly, deletion ofFgRIDin the TR-FgAMA1strain resulted in a substantial reduction in TRISS. Oval ascospores were rarely observed in 7-dpf perithecia of the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridstrain (Fig. 7A). sRNA-seq analysis revealed a limited number of trasiRNAs in the repeatedFgAMA1region in 7-dpf perithecia of the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridstrain (Fig. 7B), highlighting the critical role ofFgRIDin trasiRNA production.

The proportion of asci with oval ascospores increased in 10-dpf perithecia of the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridstrain (Fig. 7A). Sequencing of PCR products from 15 oval ascospore progeny of the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridstrain did not detect any RIP mutants in the repeatedFgAMA1regions (fig. S6), confirming that the mutant phenotype is attributed to TRISS rather than RIP. Since later-formed ascospores undergo more mitotic divisions during the dikaryotic stage (59), this suggests that the dikaryotic stage is critical for TRISS.

The putative DNA methyltransferase domain of Rid orthologs contains a conserved glutamate (E) residue in Motif VI, essential for catalytic activity (Fig. 7C) (3). To investigate the role of FgRid’s catalytic activity in TRISS, we generated a catalytically inactive mutant (FgRIDE408A) and transformed it with tandem repeats ofFgAMA1. Similar to the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridstrain, the TR-FgAMA1 FgRIDE408Astrain exhibited a low occurrence of oval ascospores in 7-dpf perithecia (Fig. 7D), indicating that the catalytic activity of FgRid is essential for TRISS.

We also identified a functional divergence site between Rid and Dim2 orthologs, where Rid orthologs have a serine (S) residue while Dim2 orthologs have a glycine (G) residue (Fig. 7C). In TR-FgAMA1 FgRIDS366Gstrains, TRISS remained intact, as oval ascospores were readily observed (Fig. 7D). However, RIP was abolished in the TR-FgAMA1 Fgqde1 FgRIDS366Gstrain as no oval ascospores were observed in its 10-dpf perithecia (Fig. 7D), indicating that the S366G mutation disrupts RIP but not TRISS. These findings demonstrate that TRISS relies on the catalytic activity of FgRid but operates independently of RIP.

InN. crassa, Qde-1 preferentially binds ssDNA via its DdRP activity and ssRNA via its RdRP activity, but it is inactivated when dsDNA is used as a template (24,60). To investigate the association of FgRid and FgQde1 with tandem repeats, we used the DamID method (61), which uses the DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) fromEscherichia colito probe DNA-protein interactions. We expressed an FgRid-Dam fusion protein in situ or Dam alone at the FG1G36140 locus in the TR-FgAMA1strain and assessed adenine-methylatedFgAMA1using digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by qPCR (DamID-qPCR) (62).

Analysis of genomic DNA from 7-dpf perithecia treated with MboI, which specifically digests unmethylated GATC sites but not methylated ones, revealed that FgRid-Dam was enriched nearly fivefold at the tandem repeat ofFgAMA1compared to Dam alone (Fig. 8A). This enrichment was not observed when the genomic DNA was treated with Sau3AI, which digests both methylated and unmethylated GATC sites, serving as a negative control. In addition, FgRid-Dam was not enriched at the IGR in the tested strains (fig. S7), providing further validation as a negative control. Using the same approach, we observed that FgQde1-Dam was also enriched at the tandem repeat region ofFgAMA1(Fig. 8B). These findings indicate that both FgRid and FgQde1 are associated with tandem repeats. Notably, deletion ofFgRIDabolished the association of FgQde1 with theFgAMA1tandem repeat as no enrichment of FgQde1-Dam was detected in the TR-FgAMA1 FgQDE1-Dam Fgridstrain (Fig. 8B). These results suggest that FgQde1 is specifically recruited to tandem repeat regions, and this recruitment is facilitated by FgRid.

Western blots of total proteins (input) and proteins eluted from anti-GFP beads (GFP-IP) were probed with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies. (H) Co-IP assays showing that interactions between FgRid and FgSms2 are independent of FgSms2. Western blots of total proteins (input) and proteins eluted from anti-GFP beads (GFP-IP) were probed with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies. (I) Interaction network among FgRid, FgQde3, FgRpa1, FgQde1, and FgSms2. Arrows indicate the direction of protein recruitment, while dotted lines represent unconfirmed interactions inF. graminearum.

Qde-3 is thought to unwind duplex DNA and DNA/RNA hybrids using its adenosine triphosphate–dependent 3′–5′ DNA helicase activity, which generates ssDNA and ssRNA templates for Qde-1 (24,63). FgQde3-Dam was also enriched at the tandem repeat region ofFgAMA1, and this association depended on the catalytic activity of FgRid but not on its RIP function. FgQde3-Dam enrichment was lost in theFgridandFgRIDE408Amutants but was still observed in theFgRIDS366Gmutants (Fig. 8, C and D). Therefore, FgRid is also critical for recruiting FgQde3 to tandem repeat regions.

To identify proteins associated with FgRid, we generated transformants expressing a C-terminal, 3×FLAG–tagged FgRid (FgRid-3×FLAG) under the control of the RP30 promoter. FgRid-3×FLAG and its interacting proteins were copurified from total protein extracts isolated from 7-dpf perithecia using anti-FLAG affinity beads, followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Among the copurified proteins, we identified FgRpa1, a homolog of the RPA subunit 1. To confirm the interaction between FgRid and FgRpa1, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments using strains expressing FgRid-3×FLAG and C-terminal GFP–tagged FgRpa1 (FgRpa1-GFP) under the RP30 promoter. SinceFgRIDcontains a premature stop codon (PSC) editing site and only expresses the full-length functional protein during sexual development after RNA editing (39), the editedFgRIDTGGallele was used in the FgRid-3×FLAG construct. Western blots confirmed that FgRpa1 interacts with FgRid in vivo (Fig. 8E).

In humans, RPA interacts with BLM and WRN, helicase homologs of Qde-3, to enhance their DNA unwinding activity (64,65). InNeurospora, RPA-1 is known to interact with both Qde-1 and Qde-3, with the interaction between Qde-1 and RPA-1 requiring Qde-3 (24). To confirm these interactions inF. graminearum, we performed Co-IP experiments using strains expressing C-terminal 3×FLAG–tagged FgRpa1 (FgRpa1-3×FLAG) along with N-terminal GFP–tagged FgQde1 (GFP-FgQde1) or FgQde3 (GFP-FgQde3). We confirmed that FgRpa1 interacts with FgQde1 (Fig. 8F). However, GFP-FgQde3 could not be detected by Western blot, making Co-IP assays for FgQde3 challenging. Despite this limitation, we demonstrated that the interaction between FgQde1 and FgRpa1 requires FgQde3 (Fig. 8F). Deletion ofFgQDE3disrupted the association of FgQde1 with theFgAMA1tandem repeat (Fig. 8G), highlighting the critical role of FgQde3 in recruiting FgQde1 to ssDNA within tandem repeats. It is likely that FgQde3 and FgRpa1 generate the ssDNA template for FgQde1 in TRISS, similar to the quelling process inNeurospora. In addition, the interaction between FgRid and FgRpa1 also requires FgQde3 (Fig. 8E), suggesting that FgQde3 mediates their interaction either through direct protein-protein interaction or by providing an interaction condition.

To investigate the role of FgSms2 in trasiRNA production, we performed mass spectrometry analysis on FgSms2–3×FLAG transformants expressing a C-terminal 3×FLAG–tagged FgSms2 in 7-dpf perithecia. FgRpa1 was identified as a copurified protein. Using strains expressing FgRpa1-GFP and N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged FgSms2 (HA-FgSms2) under the RP30 promoter, we confirmed the in vivo interaction between FgSms2 and FgRpa1 through Co-IP experiments (Fig. 8E). Furthermore, this interaction was shown to depend on FgQde3 (Fig. 8E). Since FgRid is only expressed during sexual stages due to PSC editing, the observed interaction between FgSms2 and FgRpa1 in hyphae suggests that this interaction is independent of FgRid. In addition, nativeFgSMS2expression is minimal in hyphae (fig. S8), and its overexpression did not enhance the interaction between FgRid and FgRpa1 (Fig. 8H), indicating that FgSms2 is not required for this interaction.

In summary, our findings reveal two distinct mechanisms that enhance the TRISS response, independent of traditional transitive siRNA amplification (Figs. 8Iand9). The first mechanism involves FgRid, which facilitates the recruitment of the FgRpa1-FgQde1 complex to ssDNA in tandem repeats by interacting with FgRpa1. The second mechanism involves the interaction between FgSms2 and FgRpa1, which promotes the recruitment of the FgRpa1-FgQde1 complex to ssDNA. This process is guided by trasiRNA-programmed FgSms2 to target ssRNA molecules produced in tandem repeat regions.

Tandem repeats are specifically recognized by the TRISS pathway, likely involving FgQde3, which may unwind dsDNA into ssDNA and recruit FgRpa1 and FgQde1. FgQde1 uses its DdRP and RdRP activities to first produce aRNAs and then dsRNA, thereby activating the downstream RNAi pathway. In the cytoplasm, trasiRNA-programmed FgSms2 primarily mediates translational repression of target mRNAs. In the nucleus, trasiRNA-programmed FgSms2 facilitates the recruitment of the FgRpa1-FgQde1 complex to ssDNA by targeting both the aRNA generated by FgQde1 and the native mRNA produced by RNA polymerase II in tandem repeats. In addition, FgRid in tandem repeats promotes the recruitment of the FgRpa1-FgQde1 complex to ssDNA by interacting with FgRpa1. The interactions of FgRpa1 with FgQde1, FgRid, and FgSms2 all depend on FgQde3.

Genome defense systems are critical for restricting the proliferation of selfish genetic elements and ensuring genomic stability, particularly during sexual reproduction when genomes from two distinct parental sources combine. In filamentous ascomycetes, two well-known genome defense mechanisms, RIP and MSUD, are active during the sexual cycle. RIP functions by introducing C-to-T mutations on both DNA strands of repetitive sequences in a paired manner, effectively inactivating both linked and unlinked repetitive elements within a haploid parental genome (3,19,28,31). Meanwhile, MSUD acts during meiosis by identifying unpaired DNA segments between homologous chromosomes and silencing all homologous copies posttranscriptionally through RNAi (3,21,27). The genome ofF. graminearumis characterized by a low abundance of repetitive sequences, a feature partially attributed to the activity of RIP (30,66,67). However, the efficiency of RIP inF. graminearumis substantially lower than that observed inN. crassa(32,66). Moreover, given thatF. graminearumis predominantly self-fertile and rarely outcrosses, the natural activation of MSUD is predicted to be infrequent.

In this study, we identified and characterized TRISS, an RNAi-dependent genome defense system inF. graminearum. TRISS is specifically triggered by tandem repeats and primarily functions to repress the translation of repeated genes during sexual reproduction. This mechanism operates from the dikaryotic stage through ascosporogenesis, overlapping with the stages during which both RIP and MSUD are active. Unlike MSUD, which is predominantly active during outcrossing, TRISS functions during both selfing and outcrossing. Our results indicate that TRISS operates independently of the mode of tandem-repeat formation, suggesting that it could potentially target suitable tandem repeats derived from both endogenous transposons and exogenous nucleic invaders. These findings position TRISS as an additional genome defense mechanism that may contribute to the remarkably low repeat content observed in theF. graminearumgenome.

The TRISS mechanism inF. graminearumshares notable similarities with the quelling pathway observed during vegetative growth inN. crassa. Both systems are triggered by tandem transgene repeats and use similar RNAi components, including Qde1, Qde3, Dcl1, Dcl2, and Qip (21,22). However, there are key distinctions. While Qde-2 is essential for quelling, FgSms2, an Ago protein specific to MSUD, is necessary for TRISS. Despite the conservation of these components, quelling has not been observed inF. graminearum. This is evidenced by a TR-PKS12transformant containing eight tandem repeats ofPKS12, which displayed a wild-type phenotype (Figs. 1Jand4C), indicating minimal or absent quelling activity during vegetative growth.

Another major difference between TRISS and quelling lies in their dependence on HR. While quelling requires DSB-triggered HR of repetitive sequences (22,23), TRISS does not. In addition, MSUD and recombination-independent quelling (RIQ), a recently reported quelling-associated process inN. crassa, do not rely on DSB-triggered HR but depend on Sad-6, a conserved SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeler (68–70). However, our findings indicate that FgSad6 is not required for TRISS (fig. S1). Furthermore, while Qde-2 is not involved in siRNA production during quelling and RIQ (22,53,68), FgSms2 is indispensable for siRNA production in TRISS. The discovery of TRISS unveils an RNAi pathway in filamentous ascomycetes that is distinct from established RNAi pathways.

SIS is another RNAi mechanism triggered by tandem transgene arrays, identified in both opposite-sex and unisexual reproduction in the basidiomycete yeastC. neoformans(18,71). Unlike TRISS, which is restricted to sexual stages, SIS can propagate in progeny during vegetative growth for many generations once initiated. Notably, TRISS appears to be a more efficient genome defense mechanism than SIS and quelling. A single tandem repeat is sufficient to completely silence the targeted gene in TRISS, whereas this is insufficient to trigger quelling inN. crassa(22) or SIS inC. neoformans(18,71).

While miRNAs typically repress gene expression through translational repression, siRNAs are generally known to induce mRNA cleavage (72). Recent studies in plants and animals have shown that siRNAs can also mediate translational suppression (73–77). However, genome defense mechanisms involving translational repression are rarely documented. In this study, we demonstrate that trasiRNAs inF. graminearumpredominantly mediate translational repression, providing a clear example of translational repression being used as a mechanism for genomic defense. Contrary to the traditional inference that imperfect base pairing between small RNAs and target RNAs favors translational repression (72), our results show that trasiRNAs, despite being perfectly complementary to their target RNAs, effectively mediate translational repression but are less efficient at inducing target cleavage. Our findings suggest that the base pairing between trasiRNAs and their target RNAs may cause ribosome stalling, although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. It is possible that other factors associated with the FgSms2-trasiRNA complex contribute to facilitating this translational repression.

In various organisms such as fission yeast (14),Mucor(78), nematodes (13), and plants (76), Ago-mediated slicing not only cleaves target RNAs but also initiates transitivity by recruiting RdRP to synthesize dsRNAs, which are then processed into secondary siRNAs, amplifying the RNAi response. However, our study found no evidence of transitive secondary siRNA production in the FgSms2-dependent trasiRNA pathway. This deviation from the classical model is likely attributable to Qde-1, which has both DdRP and RdRP activities (24), enabling it to independently generate aRNAs and dsRNAs without requiring transitivity. Our study demonstrates that the slicer activity of FgSms2 is crucial for trasiRNA production. Ago’s slicer activity is known to play a role in removing the passenger strand from siRNA duplexes (53,79). Our findings show that FgSms2 interacts with FgRpa1, and FgRpa1 interacts with FgQde1. This suggests that siRNAs may guide FgSms2 to complementary target mRNA or aRNA scaffolds, facilitating the recruitment of FgRpa1 and FgQde1 to ssDNA in tandemly repeated regions. This recruitment initiates aRNA and dsRNA production, amplifying the silencing signal without relying on transitive RNAi.

Previous studies have identified self-reinforcing positive feedback loops linking siRNAs to DNA cytosine and H3K9 methylation in organisms likeSchizosaccharomyces pombe,N. crassa, Arabidopsis, and mammals (12,57). However, these epigenetic marks are barely detectable inF. graminearum(35), and our results confirm that TRISS functions independently of DNA cytosine and H3K9 methylation. Given that RPA is a conserved eukaryotic ssDNA binding protein (80) and that the essential RNAi components in TRISS are conserved, at least in filamentous ascomycetes (fig. S9), the positive feedback loop involving the interaction between Sms2 and RPA might represent a conserved mechanism in these organisms.

Rid has long been recognized as a key mediator of RIP (32), but its connection to RNAi mechanisms was previously unknown. Our study revealed that FgRid plays a crucial role in TRISS, likely by recruiting the FgQde1-FgRpa1 complex to ssDNA within tandem repeats. InN. crassa, siRNAs derived from endogenous transposon relics that have undergone RIP have been detected in the vegetative stages (81). Similar to our findings for TRISS, the presence of these siRNAs depends on functional Qde-1, Qde-3, and two dicers, but not Qde-2 (81). Although siRNA production during sexual stages and the role of Sms2 were not directly assessed, an increase in siRNA production was observed in theqde-2mutant (81), possibly due to the induction ofSMS-2expression following the deletion ofQDE-2, asSMS-2is predominantly expressed during sexual stages (82). Therefore, a TRISS-like mechanism may also operate inN. crassa, although its efficiency may be less critical than inF. graminearum. Unlike inF. graminearum, theRIDgene inN. crassadoes not contain PSC-editing sites in its coding regions and can express the full-length functional protein outside sexual stages (39), which might account for the lower amount of siRNAs detected in vegetative stages. Given the conservation of both TRISS and RIP components among filamentous ascomycetes (fig. S9), it is plausible that the coupling of RIP and RNAi mechanisms to inactivate tandem repeats at both genetic and posttranscriptional levels during sexual stages is a common strategy in these organisms. This dual mechanism could provide a robust means of maintaining genomic stability by effectively silencing potentially harmful genetic elements.

RIP was found nearly four decades ago (29), yet the precise mechanism underlying the C-to-T mutations remains unresolved. Recent studies have shown that RPA can protect ssDNA from uracil DNA glycosylases (UNG), enabling C-to-T mutagenesis by allowing replicative DNA polymerases in yeast to faithfully copy uracil (U) bases formed by C-to-U Apolipoprotein B mRNA-Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like (APOBEC) deaminases (83). Our discovery of the interaction between FgRid and FgRpa1 provides insights into the Rid-mediated RIP mechanism. This interaction suggests that RPA may play a protective role by shielding T or U bases generated by Rid in ssDNA from the actions of thymine-DNA glycosylase and UNG, thereby facilitating the mutagenic process. The recruitment of FgQde3 to tandem repeat regions relies on the catalytic activity of FgRid but is independent of RIP-induced mutations. This observation suggests that FgQde3 may recognize specific intermediates generated by Rid, thereby initiating DNA unwinding in these regions.

Besides their role in RIP, Rid orthologs have been reported to be essential for sexual development in many filamentous ascomycetes (84–87). Similarly, Sms2 orthologs are critical for sexual development in various filamentous ascomycetes (49,82,88,89). However, the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate sexual development remain unclear. The catalytic activity of PaRid inPodospora anserinais essential for sexual development (87), consistent with our finding that FgRid catalytic activity is crucial for TRISS. Our observation that FgRid functions in TRISS suggests that Rid orthologs may regulate sexual development through RNAi mechanisms. Furthermore, the discovery of RPA interacting with both Sms2 and Rid offers valuable insights into their roles in fungal sexual development. Given that RPA is a multifunctional protein involved in DNA replication, repair, and other DNA-related activities (80), these interactions suggest that Sms2 and Rid may have broader roles in coordinating crucial DNA processes during sexual development, potentially linking RNAi pathways with DNA maintenance and modification.

The wild-type strain PH-1 ofF. graminearum(66), along with its derived mutants and transformants (data S1), were routinely cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25°C. For transformant selection, we added hygromycin B (H005, MDbio, China) and geneticin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to Top agar medium (0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% casamino acids, 20% sucrose, and 1.5% agar) to final concentrations of 300 and 200 μg/ml, respectively. We assayed growth rate and colony morphology on PDA plates after 3 days. We harvested conidia from 3-day-old liquid carboxymethylcellulose medium cultures inoculated with mycelial plugs at 25°C using a rotary shaker set at 175 rpm. We obtained vegetative hyphae for DNA and RNA isolation and protoplast preparation from 12- to 24-hour liquid yeast extract peptone dextrose cultures. For selfing in sexual reproduction, we pressed 5-day-old aerial hyphae grown on carrot agar plates down with 500 μl of sterile 0.1% Tween-20 and subsequently cultured them under black light at 25°C. For outcrossing, we fertilized the female strains grown on carrot agar plates with 1 ml of conidial suspension (1 × 106conidia/ml) derived from the male strains. We observed ascogenous hyphae, asci, and ascospores with an Olympus BX-51 microscope in squash mounts of perithecia 7 dpf.

We used polyethylene glycol–mediated protoplast transformation to generate various transformants ofF. graminearum. For gene deletion, we used the split-marker approach (90,91). We amplified fragments of approximately 1.0 kb upstream and downstream of the target genes and connected them to the N- and C-terminal regions of either a hygromycin-resistance marker or a recyclable marker module (92) that confers resistance to hygromycin and sensitivity to the nucleoside analog 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (floxuridine) through overlapping PCR. After transforming PH-1 protoplasts, we screened hygromycin-resistant transformants and confirmed them via PCR assays. For gene complementation, we amplified the full-length genes, along with their native promoter, and cloned them into a pFL2 vector. We confirmed the complementation construct by DNA sequencing and then transformed it into the protoplasts of the corresponding deletion mutants. We screened transformants containing the complementation constructs with geneticin and confirmed them using PCR assays.

To perform site-directed mutagenesis ofFgSMS2andFgRID, we first generated gene deletion mutants using the recyclable marker module. We then created allelic fragments with the desired mutations through overlapping PCR. We subsequently transformed the resulting fragments into protoplasts of the corresponding deletion mutants. We screened transformants for resistance to floxuridine (25 μg/ml; HY-B0097, MCE, USA) and confirmed the presence of the desired mutations by DNA sequencing. In addition, we used qPCR to ensure that no unintended integration of allelic fragments occurred in the transformants.

To generate transformants containing tandem transgenic repeats, we connected the target gene fragment (either full-length or partial) to a hygromycin (hyg)– or G418 (neo)–resistance marker through overlapping PCR. We then transformed the resulting linear fragment into protoplasts of PH-1 or specific gene deletion mutants. We screened transformants with hygromycin or G418 resistance and assayed tandem repeats by PCR with specific primer pairs. We used the split-marker approach to generate direct or reverse tandem repeats ofCDC2Aat either the native locus or the FG1G36140 locus in PH-1. We screened transformants for resistance to hygromycin or geneticin and confirmed them using PCR assays. To generate transformants ectopically expressing antisense transcripts ofCDC2Aat the FG1G36140 locus, we amplified fragments of approximately 1.0 kb upstream and downstream of the FG1G36140 gene. We then connected these fragments to the reverse complementary fragment of theCDC2Acoding region under the control of the PR27 promoter through overlapping PCR and transformed them into protoplasts of the FG1G36140 deletion mutant, where the FG1G36140 gene had been replaced by the recyclable marker module. We screened transformants for resistance to floxuridine. To generate transformants containing tandemly repeatedFgAMA1with a nongene linker, we first transformed a linear fragment containing theFgAMA1gene connected with the recyclable marker module into PH-1 protoplasts. This allowed us to obtain transformants containing tandemly repeatedFgAMA1with the recyclable marker module as the linker. We then amplified fragments corresponding to the 3′-end of the upstream repeat and the 5′-end of the downstream repeat and connected these fragments to a nontranscriptional region from the pKNT plasmid. We used the resulting linear fragment to replace the recyclable marker module in the previous transformants.

To isolate ascospore progeny from theFgama1uncomplemented strain and the TR-FgAMA1and TR-FgAMA1 Fgridtransformants, we collected ascospore cirrhi from 10-dpf perithecia under a dissecting microscope. We resuspended the cirrhi in 1 ml of sterile distilled water in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. We then spread the ascospore suspensions on 2% water agar and isolated individual oval ascospores, which were subsequently transferred onto PDA plates. To identify RIP mutations in the ascospore progeny, we extracted genomic DNA from each ascospore progeny using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. We amplified theFgAMA1gene from the isolated DNA and sequenced it using Sanger sequencing. For theFgama1uncomplemented strain, we could not distinguish which repeats ofFgAMA1were amplified. For the TR-FgAMA1and TR-FgAMA1 Fgridtransformants, we used specific primer pairs (data S2) to distinguish the upstream and downstream repeats ofFgAMA1. We visualized the Sanger sequencing traces using SnapGene Viewer 4.3 (www.snapgene.com/snapgene-viewer/) and manually checked the quality of the sequencing. We aligned the assembled high-quality sequences for each repeat to the wild-type sequence of theFgAMA1gene. We used these aligned sequences to detect RIP mutants in each ascospore progeny and analyzed their consequences on protein sequences using the Biopython package (https://biopython.org/).

We extracted genomic DNA from 24-hour hyphae using a CTAB solution. We isolated total RNA from 24-hour hyphae or 7-dpf perithecia using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen, USA). Following this, we synthesized cDNA using the First cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We then amplified the resulting cDNA products and genomic DNA by real-time PCR using the primers listed in data S2. We calculated repeat copy numbers and relative expression levels using the 2−ΔΔCTmethod, with theGzUBHgene serving as the internal control.

We ground samples from 24-hour vegetative hyphae or 7-dpf perithecia into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and homogenized them in protein extraction buffer. We then centrifuged the samples for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at 4°C, heating the supernatants for 5 min in boiling water. Next, we separated the supernatants on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred the proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. We performed Western blot assays to analyze the samples using specific antibodies, including anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290), anti-Tub1 (93), and anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Sangon Biotech, D1100160200). We used detection with the anti-GAPDH antibody as the loading control.

For sRNA-seq analysis, we isolated total RNA from 7-dpf perithecia using the TRIzol Reagent kit (Invitrogen, USA) and quantified it with the Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). We assessed RNA quality and integrity using the Experion RNA Standard Sense kit (Bio-Rad, USA), ensuring that all RNA samples had an RNA quality index ≥8. We prepared the sRNA library using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically, we ligated 1 μg of total RNA from each sample to specific adapters, reverse transcribed it, and amplified it to obtain a population of double-stranded cDNAs. During PCR amplification, we used barcode-tagged primer pairs to uniquely tag each sample. We then size-selected the resulting cDNAs on a 6% PAGE gel, excised the gel band corresponding to the target fragments, ethanol-precipitated them, and eluted them in ultrapure water. We evaluated the libraries for quality using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, USA). Last, we carried out sequencing reactions using the MiSeq instrument (Illumina, USA) in 50-bp single-end read mode at Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Tianjin, China), obtaining at least 10 million reads for each library. The information regarding the sRNA-seq data generated in this study has been listed in table S1.

We obtained the reference genome and annotation files ofF. graminearumPH-1 from FgBase (http://fgbase.wheatscab.com/) (94). We aligned sRNA-seq reads to the tandem repeats and the PH-1 genome using HISAT2 v2.2.1 (95). We analyzed detailed information on aligned reads using bioawk (https://github.com/lh3/bioawk) and samtools (http://htslib.org/). The length distribution and base preference were visualized using the matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) and seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/) packages. Using bioawk, we filtered reads of 20 to 27 nt with a 5′ preferred U. We obtained BAM files of aligned reads using samtools and converted them to BigWig coverage files with deeptools2 (https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/). We parsed the BigWig coverage files using the pyBigWig Python package (https://github.com/deeptools/pyBigWig) and plotted the sRNA coverage using the matplotlib package.

We isolated genomic DNA from 24-hour hyphae and 7-dpf perithecia using a CTAB solution. For each sample, we digested 1 μg of genomic DNA from the strain expressing a Dam or Dam fusion with 1 μl of MboI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ER0811) for 16 hours in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. We then analyzed the digested samples by qPCR. To normalize the DNA content, we amplified a DNA fragment without GATC sites. We also amplified DNA fragments containing GATC sites to determine whether they were cut by MboI. We calculated the enrichment of the Dam fusion protein on target DNA using the 2−ΔΔCTmethod by comparing the cycle threshold (Ct) values of each sample with that of the control (Dam only protein). As a negative control, we treated samples with Sau3AI as described above.

We froze samples from 7-dpf perithecia in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection. We ground the tissue samples into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and added an equal volume of the tissue powder from each sample to an equal volume of lysis buffer, which contained 100 mM KCl, 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium acetate (pH 7), 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (BME), cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), and a protease inhibitor cocktail including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1:100), leupeptin (1:1000), pepstatin (1:1000), and dithiothreitol (1:1000). We centrifuged the lysates at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. We measured the absorbance at 260 nm of the supernatant using a NanoDrop Microvolume Spectrophotometer and obtained 500 μl of lysate with the same optical density (20 OD260nm) for each sample. From each sample, we used 50 μl of lysate as input, while the remaining lysate was loaded onto a 10 to 50% sucrose gradient buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, and SUPERase•In (10 U/ml).

We centrifuged the sucrose gradients at 35,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4°C using a SW41Ti rotor in a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge. After ultracentrifugation, polysomal RNAs distributed along the sucrose gradient according to their different sedimentation coefficients and were separated using a gradient fractionator system (BioComp Instruments). We collected fractions containing monosomes to the heaviest polysomes and subjected them to RNA isolation using TRIzol followed by qPCR. We also isolated RNA from input lysates using TRIzol followed by qPCR. We normalized the polysome distributions ofCDC2AmRNA levels against their own input mRNA levels and calculatedCDC2Aexpression in each polysomal fraction as a percentage of its expression in total RNA.

To assess the interaction of FgRid and FgSms2 with FgRpa1 using a Co-IP assay, we first created the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridand TR-FgAMA1 Fgsms2strains. This was accomplished by deleting theFgRIDandFgSMS2genes in the TR-FgAMA1strain, respectively, using a recyclable marker module. We PCR amplified approximately 1 kb of the upstream and downstream regions ofFgRIDandFgSMS2and linked them to theFgRID-3×FLAG and HA-FgSMS2fusion constructs, respectively, under the control of the RP30 promoter through overlapping PCR. We then transformed these PCR products into the protoplasts of the TR-FgAMA1 Fgridand TR-FgAMA1 Fgsms2strains. We screened transformants ofFgRID-3×FLAG TR-FgAMA1and HA-FgSMS2TR-FgAMA1using floxuridine (25 μg/ml; HY-B0097, MCE, USA). Using a similar method, we sequentially generated the HA-FgSMS2 FgRID-3×FLAG TR-FgAMA1and HA-FgSMS2 FgRID-3×FLAG TR-FgAMA1 Fgqde3strains in theFgRID-3×FLAG TR-FgAMA1background. In each strain, we created theFgRRA1-GFP construct by inserting the GFP sequence before the stop codon of theFgRPA1gene using a hygromycin resistance marker.

To investigate the interaction between FgQde1 and FgRpa1 in the Co-IP assay, we constructed theFgRPA1–3×FLAG fusion construct under the control of its native promoter and the GFP-FgQDE1fusion construct under the control of the RP27 promoter by inserting their respective sequences into the pKNTF and pDL2 vectors. We then cotransformed these constructs into both the wild type and theFgqde3mutant strains, selecting transformants with hygromycin and G418 resistance.

For each strain, we extracted total proteins from 24-hour hyphae. We incubated the supernatant containing the target protein with anti-GFP affinity beads (Smart-lifesciences, SA070001) and subsequently eluted the proteins. We performed Western blots on both the total proteins and the proteins eluted from the anti-GFP affinity beads, using anti-FLAG (F31651, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290), anti-HA (AE008, Abclonal), and anti-GAPDH antibodies for detection.
