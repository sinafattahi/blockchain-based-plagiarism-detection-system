Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis predominantly affecting children under 5 years of age. To prevent the development of cardiac aneurysms and their associated adverse outcomes, such as coronary artery dissection with subsequent bleeding, early recognition and treatment are of utmost importance. The classic early symptoms of KD include fever, conjunctival congestion, cracked lips, and others. However, these symptoms are not exclusive to KD and can also be observed in a variety of infectious diseases. Peeling of the skin on the hands, feet, fingers, and around the anus typically becomes evident around ten days after the onset of the disease or even later. Once complications occur, treatment may be ineffective. Hence, early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential to control disease progression, prevent further exacerbation of complications, and promote rapid lesion recovery.

A 3-year-old boy initially presented solely with sever cough symptoms, followed by fever, which are typical manifestations of a respiratory illness. Additionally, conjunctival hemorrhage developed during the course of the illness. Laboratory tests showed significant elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Despite anti-infective treatment with ceftriaxone, the condition did not improve. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD). Immediately after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin, the patient’s fever and cough symptoms subsided within the next two days. Cardiac ultrasonography at the time of discharge indicated that the coronary artery had healed. At the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, the patient was in good general health.

It is uncommon for a patient with Kawasaki disease (KD) to initially present with a severe cough as the predominant symptom, especially in the absence of other classic clinical features and with poor response to anti-infective therapy. Therefore, in such cases, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD) and promptly conduct coronary artery evaluations to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis that commonly affects children between 6 months and 5 years of age. Although it is generally self-limiting, untreated KD may result in coronary artery dilation and the formation of coronary artery aneurysms. KD can be classified into two types: complete Kawasaki disease (CKD, also referred to as typical or classic KD) and incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD, also referred to as atypical KD). While the diagnosis of CKD is typically straightforward due to its well-defined clinical features, diagnosing IKD remains challenging. In clinical practice, children with IKD may be misdiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis due to atypical or nonspecific presentations. Symptoms may appear later than expected, manifest in an unusual sequence, or mimic other conditions, thereby complicating timely recognition.

In this report, we present a case of a 3-year-old boy who initially presented with a persistent cough and was ultimately diagnosed with IKD—an uncommon initial manifestation of KD. This case highlights the importance of recognizing atypical presentations and underscores the need for increased clinical vigilance to ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis of KD.

A 3-year-old Han Chinese boy was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at Baoding No. 1 Central Hospital with a chief complaint of a severe cough lasting four days. He had an unremarkable past medical history, with normal findings at birth and no significant family history. On the second day of illness, he developed a fever characterized by three febrile peaks, with a maximum temperature of 39.8 °C, accompanied by chills. The fever responded to oral ibuprofen, and no further temperature elevations were observed over the subsequent two days. During the course of the illness, the patient did not exhibit respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, seizures, or rash. Laboratory investigations performed at a local hospital revealed the following: white blood cell count (WBC) = 15.52 × 10⁹/L with 60.7% neutrophils and 32.7% lymphocytes; hemoglobin (Hb) = 135 g/L; platelet count (PLT) = 425 × 10⁹/L; serum amyloid A (SAA) = 61.42 mg/L; and C-reactive protein (CRP) = 219 mg/L. A nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient had been treated with intravenous azithromycin for three days at the local hospital, but showed no clinical improvement.

On the fourth day of illness, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. A comprehensive medical examination was conducted upon admission. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature 39 °C, pulse 138 beats per minute, respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 107/68 mmHg. Physical examination revealed pharyngeal congestion and coarse breath sounds with rales auscultated in both lungs. Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs, and heart sounds were regular and clear. The abdomen was soft, with no palpable hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds were normal. Neurological examination showed no abnormalities.

Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) was 12.9 × 10⁹/L with 56.3% neutrophils and 36.8% lymphocytes; hemoglobin (Hb) was 115 g/L; platelet count (PLT) was 483 × 10⁹/L; serum amyloid A (SAA) was significantly elevated at 300.00 mg/L; C-reactive protein (CRP) was 148.96 mg/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 85 mm/h; interleukin-6 (IL-6) was 111.40 pg/mL. Liver function tests revealed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 12.70 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 23.10 U/L, total bilirubin of 4.60 μmol/L, direct bilirubin of 1.60 μmol/L, albumin of 38.30 g/L, and total bile acids of 4.68 μmol/L. Electrolyte analysis showed a blood sodium concentration of 138.80 mmol/L. Coagulation studies showed a D-dimer level of 0.91 mg/L, prothrombin time of 13.20 s, and activated partial thromboplastin time of 27.80 s. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Screening for infectious diseases, including hepatitis A, B, and C, syphilis, and HIV, yielded negative results. Viral nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus was also negative. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from sputum or blood cultures. A chest X-ray demonstrated signs consistent with bronchitis and peripulmonary inflammation. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and received intravenous ceftriaxone and ambroxol for three days.

Subsequently, the patient developed bilateral conjunctival injection, accompanied by desquamation of the fingers and toes, along with persistent fever and cough. On the fourth day after admission, repeat laboratory evaluations were performed. Results showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.77 × 10⁹/L, neutrophils 44.60%, lymphocytes 45.80%, red blood cell count (RBC) 4.19 × 1012/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 110 g/L, platelet count (PLT) 638 × 10⁹/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 79.39 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 130 mm/h, and procalcitonin (PCT) 0.01 ng/mL (reference range: 0.00–0.25 ng/mL) (Table1).Chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig.1) revealed bilateral pulmonary inflammation and multiple axillary lymph node enlargements. Cervical ultrasound demonstrated multiple bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies. Echocardiography showed that the inner diameter of the left coronary artery at its origin was 2.53 mm, with mild tricuspid regurgitation and overall preserved cardiac function. The Z-score for the proximal left main coronary artery (LMCA) diameter was 0.96 (Fig.2).

Based on clinical signs and laboratory findings—including fever lasting more than five days, bilateral conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, desquamation of the digits, CRP of 148.96 mg/L (≥ 40 mg/L), ESR of 130 mm/h (≥ 30 mm/h), PLT 638 × 10⁹/L (≥ 450 × 10⁹/L), Hb 108 g/L (≤ 112 g/L), WBC 15.52 × 10⁹/L (≥ 15 × 10⁹/L), and poor response to antibiotics—the patient met the 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) diagnostic criteria for incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD) [1]. Consequently, the diagnosis was revised to IKD, and the treatment regimen was modified accordingly. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 1 g/kg/day for two days and aspirin at 33 mg/kg/day for five days.

On the sixth day of hospitalization, perianal erythema with mild desquamation was noted. By the seventh day, the patient’s fever resolved, and his cough showed significant improvement. However, on the eighth day, erythematous rashes appeared on the neck and persisted for two days. On the ninth day, repeat blood tests revealed WBC 4.94 × 10⁹/L, neutrophils 15.60%, lymphocytes 76.90%, RBC 4.08 × 1012/L, Hb 108 g/L, PLT 461 × 10⁹/L, CRP 5.90 mg/L, ESR 120 mm/h, and PCT 0.05 ng/mL (Table1). In view of the marked clinical and laboratory improvement, the aspirin dose was reduced to 5 mg/kg/day. On the eleventh day of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed no abnormalities in the coronary artery diameter, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. At a follow-up visit approximately two weeks post-discharge, the child had fully recovered, with no evidence of coronary artery dilation on echocardiography. No recurrence or complications were observed at the one-month and three-month follow-up evaluations (Fig.2).

The traditional diagnostic criteria for KD include fever lasting more than five days, along with at least four of the following five clinical features: oral mucosal changes, polymorphous rash, changes in the peripheral extremities, bilateral non-purulent conjunctival injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. According to the revised Japanese diagnostic guidelines for Kawasaki disease (6th edition) [2], the requirement for a minimum duration of fever has been removed from the diagnostic criteria. CKD can be readily diagnosed when all characteristic clinical manifestations are present. However, IKD, characterized by partial or atypical presentation of symptoms, often poses diagnostic challenges. Many patients with IKD are misdiagnosed with conditions such as sepsis and consequently receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Delayed diagnosis and management can contribute to disease progression, significantly increasing the risk of coronary artery complications, including ischemic cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [3]. The incidence of IKD is rising, and early recognition and timely treatment are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing cardiovascular morbidity in affected children [4].

Data from a nationwide survey in Japan revealed that among the six classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease (KD), including fever, 71% of children with IKD exhibited four of these typical features, 23% had three, and only 6% presented with one or two. Fever, perianal flushing (with skin peeling), and membranous desquamation at the fingertips and toes during the convalescent phase were the most frequently observed manifestations in IKD patients [5]. Previous studies have reported that rash [6], cervical lymphadenopathy, abdominal symptoms [7], and conjunctival injection may precede the classic mucocutaneous features of KD. However, it is rare for KD to initially present with cough as the primary symptom. In this case, we report a child with IKD whose initial manifestation was severe cough—a presentation even less commonly observed.

According to the literature, cough occurs in approximately 40.5% of KD patients, most commonly during the acute phase. Only a small subset experience cough as the presenting symptom, and it is more frequently seen in infants [8]. Although rare, severe cough can mislead clinicians, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. To better understand the clinical characteristics of IKD with respiratory involvement, we reviewed six previously reported pediatric cases aged between 2 months and 9 years, with a predominance of female patients (Table2). Maddi et al. described a 23-month-old girl with KD who presented with fever, bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection, red lips, a truncal rash, irritability, and cough. Chest radiography revealed consolidation in the right middle lobe. Although echocardiography showed no coronary artery involvement, the patient was diagnosed with IKD and responded well to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin therapy, with fever resolution and gradual improvement in pulmonary symptoms [8]. The remaining five cases exhibited pulmonary involvement, but in these instances, cough developed during the disease course rather than as an initial symptom [9–11].

Pulmonary complications in KD are rare and can include bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia [11], parenchymal infiltrates [8], pulmonary atelectasis, pleural effusion [12], pleuritis [10], pulmonary aneurysms [13], and nodules [9]. In our patient, initial radiologic findings indicated bronchitis and perihilar inflammation. Lung involvement in KD may result from systemic vasculitis leading to increased vascular permeability and perivascular edema.

In a study by Shibuya et al., autopsy findings in 20 of 34 KD patients (59%) demonstrated evidence of panvasculitis in the lungs. During the acute phase of KD, an intense inflammatory response occurs, characterized by abnormal activation of immune cells and the release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). These mediators damage vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, contributing to vasculitis. Additionally, elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide during the acute stage may increase vascular permeability [14]. Given our patient’s presentation, it is plausible that his cough was related to pulmonary vasculitis [15–17].

The variability of initial clinical presentations in KD complicates its diagnosis. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for bronchiolitis that is refractory to initial intravenous antibiotic therapy, as it may represent an early manifestation of KD. Atypical symptoms such as cough may precede the classic mucocutaneous signs of the disease. In clinical practice, the presence of vasculitic symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings—such as elevated ESR, CRP, or thrombocytosis during the second week of illness—should raise clinical suspicion for KD and prompt its inclusion in the differential diagnosis. Early administration of IVIG can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications, including coronary artery abnormalities, shock, and mortality.

Serial echocardiographic evaluations of coronary artery dimensions demonstrated minimal variation, with the left coronary artery diameter decreasing from 2.5 mm to 2.1 mm. Given the inherent limitations of echocardiographic measurements, repeated blinded assessments were performed by several experienced sonographers to reduce measurement bias. To further adjust for somatic growth and inter-observer variability, coronary artery dimensions were recalculated using body surface area (BSA)-adjusted Z-scores based on the Dallaire formula [18]. The left coronary artery Z-score was 0.96 on hospital day 4 and subsequently decreased to −0.21 by day 11, remaining stable at −0.21 at the 1-month follow-up. These Z-scores were consistently within the normal range (|Z-score|< 2.0), findings which are consistent with the absence of significant coronary artery involvement in this patient. Continued monitoring remains essential given the potential for late-onset complications.

KD can result in serious complications, yet diagnosis remains challenging because current diagnostic criteria do not capture all affected children. Many patients display additional signs not included in the official criteria, such as severe cough. This case highlights that clinicians should be aware of the possibility of KD in children presenting with persistent, severe cough unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, especially if accompanied by other suggestive features such as conjunctival injection or periungual desquamation.
