Pseudopregnancy is a luteal phase syndrome characterized by symptoms of late pregnancy and/or early postpartum periods. This phenomenon is observed in various species, including rats, rabbits and dogs, and arises due to hormonal alterations. Due to the significant side effects of current treatment regimens, there is a growing need for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. In this context, various plants and natural compounds have been investigated for their potential to modulate hormonal balance, offering a promising avenue for the treatment of pseudopregnancy.Artemisia absinthiumL., a medicinal plant traditionally utilized as an emmenagogue and abortifacient, is known for its regulatory effect on the dopaminergic system. The study aimed to assess whetherA. absinthiumtreatment could restore oestrous cyclicity in pseudopregnant rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced through the administration of a pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin in female rats. The essential oil ofA. absinthiumwas administered orally at doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg once daily for 10 days, with bromocriptine as a reference treatment. The results indicated that the 25 mg/kg dose ofA. absinthiumessential oil exhibited beneficial effects in the pseudopregnancy model. Gas chromatography analysis revealed that the major components of the essential oil includedcis‐chrysanthenyl acetate (17.8%), sabinyl acetate (11.6%), terpinen‐4‐ol (6.2%), caryophyllene oxide (5.5%) and (E)‐nuciferol (5.5%). These findings suggest thatA. absinthiumessential oil may present a promising therapeutic option for the management of pseudopregnancy.

This study investigated the therapeutic effects ofArtemisia absinthiumessential oil in a rat model of pseudopregnancy. Oral administration of the essential oil, particularly at 25 mg/kg, significantly alleviated pseudopregnancy symptoms, demonstrating comparable efficacy to bromocriptine. GC analysis identifiedcis‐chrysanthenyl acetate and sabinyl acetate as major constituents, suggesting thatA. absinthiummay offer a promising natural alternative for pseudopregnancy management.

Pseudopregnancy is a luteal phase syndrome that shows clinical signs typical of late pregnancy and/or early postpartum periods despite the absence of pregnancy. This syndrome is characterized by physiological and behavioural effects. Clinically, enlarged mammary glands and lactation can be observed due to increased prolactin levels. In addition to these findings, maternal behaviour occurs during this period (da Silva et al.2021; Gobello2021; Falceto et al.2024). Prolactin levels have been reported to remain elevated for up to 14 days during pseudopregnancy in rats (Freeman et al.2000; Bertram et al.2006; Goldman et al.2007; Kennett and McKee2012; Cora et al.2015). However, the potential effects of increased prolactin on maternal behaviour in pseudopregnant rats have not yet been investigated. Diagnosis of pseudopregnancy syndrome is verified by clinical and ultrasonographic examinations. This syndrome is confirmed by the absence of the foetus in the ultrasonographic examination. In addition to these findings, the increase in serum prolactin levels also supports the diagnosis of pseudopregnancy (Tsutsui et al.2007; Gary and England2019). If pseudopregnancy is not managed, it may result in mastitis, mammary dermatitis or the development of mammary tumours. As a consequence of this, the cost and duration of the treatment of these cases may increase (Gobello2021; Cuellar et al.2024).

The treatment procedures, such as prolactin inhibitors, including dopamine agonists (bromocriptine and cabergoline), serotonin antagonists (metergoline) and progestins, are used to eliminate the behavioural and clinical symptoms (Gobello2001a; Root et al.2018; Papich2021). Although progestins were once widely used for the treatment of pseudopregnancy in dogs, their effectiveness is limited, as pseudopregnancy often recurs after treatment ends. Moreover, the use of progestins can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and may increase the risk of pyometra (Root et al.2018; Gobello2021). Bromocriptine (vomiting, anorexia and depression) and metergoline (anxiety, aggressiveness and hyperexcitation) can cause serious side effects (Singh et al.2018; Gobello2021). Additionally, these drugs have a short half‐life (Gobello2021). Although cabergoline is safer than other agents, it is expensive (Root et al.2018; Gobello2021). Due to the adverse effects of the current medical treatment regimens in pseudopregnancy, new medical strategies should be developed. Recent studies have suggested that vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may modulate prolactin secretion, and its use has been investigated for the management of pseudopregnancy‐related symptoms (da Silva et al.2021; Santos et al.2024). Natural resources and medicinal plants are of great importance in treating human and animal diseases. In the literature,PulsatillaMill. (Ranunculaceae),FerulaL. (Apiaceae),UrticaL. (Urticaceae),ThujaL. (Cupressaceae) species andMatricaria chamomillaL. (Asteraceae) were reported to be effective for the treatment of pseudopregnancy (Aslan et al.2004; Özyurtlu and Alaçam2005; Madrewar and Glencross2014).

Artemisia absinthiumL. (wormwood) is an important aromatic and medicinal plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family, used as an emmenagogue and to induce abortus in traditional medicine (Baytop1999; Judžentienė2016). The essential oil ofA. absinthiumhas high concentrations of terpenes and a wide range of biological activities. It is used as an antimicrobial, antiseptic, anthelmintic, anti‐inflammatory, antidepressant, anti‐cold, carminative, choleretic, digestive and stimulant (Watson and Preedy; Goud and Swamy2015; Nguyen and Németh2016). Several studies have shown thatA. absinthiumhas a regulatory effect on the dopaminergic system (Sansar and Gamrani2013; Zeraati et al.2014; Basiri et al.2017; Rashidi et al.2021; El‐Bakry et al.2024). In our previous study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of petroleum ether, dichloromethane and methanol extracts ofA. absinthiumon the pseudopregnancy model. Among the extracts tested, the petroleum ether extract demonstrated a positive effect, indicating that nonpolar compounds may have a beneficial impact on pseudopregnancy (Demirel et al.2018). Consequently, the present study seeks to assess the potential activity ofA. absinthiumessential oil, which is rich in nonpolar and volatile compounds. The present study aimed not only to evaluate the endocrine and morphological alterations induced by pseudopregnancy but also to investigate whetherA. absinthiumtreatment could promote the resumption of regular oestrous cyclicity in affected animals. This is also the first article to describe the effects ofA. absinthiumessential oil in the treatment of pseudopregnancy in rats.

The aerial parts ofA. absinthiumL. were collected from Konya (located between Taşkent and Ermenek, Türkiye; GPS coordinates: 36°48′43″ N, 32°50′49″ E, elevation: 1392 m) on 7 July 2019. The plant was identified by Prof. Dr. Evren Yıldıztugay (Faculty of Science, Selçuk University, Konya, Türkiye), and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Department of Biology, Selçuk University (GZ‐1928). The plant material was shade‐dried for 10 days at room temperature and then ground using a laboratory mill. The powdered plant samples were subsequently stored in a dark environment at room temperature.

The essential oil was obtained using the hydro‐distillation method. A total of 100 g of dried plant material was distilled in a Clevenger‐type apparatus for 5 h. The essential oil was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the resulting oil was stored in an amber vial at +4°C until further analysis.

The composition of the essential oil was characterized using gas chromatography‐flame ionization detector (GC‐FID) and GC–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). GC–MS analysis was conducted with an Agilent 5975 GC–MS system coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. The chemical components were separated on an HP‐Innowax column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm film thickness). Additional analytical parameters were previously reported in our earlier publication (Ak et al.2021).

The retention index (RI) was calculated through co‐injection with a homologous series ofn‐alkanes (C8–C30) under identical experimental conditions. The identification of components was made based on the RI values, as well as the comparison of mass spectra with those in the literature and databases, such as NIST 05 and Wiley 8th Edition.

Thirty‐six healthy, 29‐day‐old female Sprague–Dawley rats (weighing 70–75 g) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center at Gazi University (Ankara, Türkiye). Pseudopregnancy can be experimentally induced in immature rats through hormonal administration, as their ovaries predominantly contain antral follicles and lack corpora lutea (CLs). The combined use of pregnant serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and hCG allows for controlled luteal development and has been widely used for this purpose (Kolena et al.1997; Bar‐Ami et al.2006; Demirel et al.2018). In this study, pseudopregnancy was successfully induced in immature rats using this hormonal protocol. The rats were quarantined for 1 week and housed in polysulphone cages with aspen shavings for bedding, under controlled conditions of 21–24°C, 45%–55% humidity and a 12‐h light/12‐h dark cycle, at the Laboratory Animals Breeding and Experimental Research Unit of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University. During the experimental period, all animals were provided with a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum. The rats were maintained according to the guidelines outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

A flowchart illustrating the experimental procedure is provided in Figure1. The rats were randomly assigned to six groups, with each group consisting of six rats, as follows: sham (S) group, control (C) group, reference (R) group and three distinct treatment groups [T‐1 (12.5 mg/kg), T‐2 (25 mg/kg) and T‐3 (50 mg/kg)] treated withA. absinthiumessential oil. Rats in the sham group received a subcutaneous injection of 0.9% NaCl. To establish the pseudopregnancy model, the 29‐day‐old rats were administered a single subcutaneous injection of 50 IU PMSG (Chronogest, Intervet, Türkiye). Three days following the PMSG injection, the 32‐day‐old rats were given a single subcutaneous dose of 20 IU hCG (Choragon, Erkim, Türkiye) (Bar‐Ami et al.2006). The day of the hCG injection was designated as Day 0 of pseudopregnancy.

The oestrous stage of the rats was monitored throughout the experimental procedure. Vaginal smear samples were collected from all rats on Days 0, 5 and 10 following hCG administration. The stages of the oestrous cycle were classified as proestrus (characterized by oval and nucleated epithelial cells), oestrus (characterized by irregularly shaped cornified epithelial cells), metestrus (characterized by fragmented cornified epithelial cells and smaller, darker stained leukocytes) and dioestrus (characterized by nucleated epithelial cells with a predominance of leukocytes) (Cora et al.2015).

The test materials were administered immediately following the hCG injection and continued for a duration of 10 days. The essential oil ofA. absinthiumwas prepared in a 2% Tween 80 aqueous solution (Abdollahi et al.2003; Abidi et al.2018). A 2% Tween 80 aqueous solution (2 mL per os) was given to the sham and control groups. Bromocriptine (Parlodel, Meda Pharma, Türkiye) was administered to the reference group at a dose of 3 mg/kg per os. The treatment groups received doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg ofA. absinthiumessential oil in the 2% Tween 80 aqueous solution, respectively.

On the 10th day of the treatment protocol, all rats were euthanized by exsanguination under general anaesthesia (10 mg/kg, i.p. xylazine hydrochloride and 80 mg/kg, i.p. ketamine hydrochloride). Uterine volume was estimated by measuring the length, width and height with a micrometre and applying the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid (π/6 × length × width × height). The uterine and ovarian tissues were excised and weighed using a precision scale. Additionally, the mammary chains were bilaterally dissected and weighed.

The mammary, uterine and ovarian tissues were immediately placed in a 10% neutral formaldehyde solution for 48 h. A pathologist grossed the samples to obtain appropriate tissue slices, which were then rinsed with 0.9% saline solution. The tissue samples were placed in cassettes and processed using an automated tissue processor. Subsequently, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 5 µm‐thick slices. The slides were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined blindly under a light microscope. Mammary alveolar developments, as well as uterine and ovarian tissues, were evaluated microscopically. The endometrial glands were counted, and the thickness of the myometrium was measured (five slides for each animal with five sections per slide) (Stewart et al.2011). Additionally, the stage of the oestrous cycle was determined on the basis of the histological appearance of the uterine tissue (Dixon et al.2014). The numbers of CL, regressed CL and tertiary follicles were counted in the ovarian tissues to assess ovarian follicular activity. Their numbers were counted at 7‐section intervals (whole ovaries were sectioned, resulting in at least 50 sections per ovary), and the number of various developmental follicles was multiplied by 7 to get an assessment of the total number of follicles per ovary (Gaytán et al.2014). Mammary alveolar development was scored under ×10 magnification as follows: −: no alveoli; +: 5–10 alveoli; ++: 10–50 alveoli and +++: more than 50 alveoli (Demirel et al.2018).

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. The data are shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of differences between groups. The results were considered statistically significant atp< 0.05.

GC–MS analysis identified a total of 60 compounds in the tested essential oil, as listed in Table1. The identified compounds accounted for 90.5% of the total composition. The major constituent wascis‐chrysanthenyl acetate (17.8%), followed by sabinyl acetate (11.6%), terpinen‐4‐ol (6.2%), caryophyllene oxide (5.5%) and (E)‐nuciferol (5.5%).

The cytological evaluation was conducted according to the classification described in Section 2. Vaginal smear samples obtained before the induction of the pseudopregnancy model indicated that the mean duration of the oestrous cycle was 4–5 days in all rats. This regular cycle was maintained throughout the experimental period in the S group. However, in the other groups, all animals except the T‐2 group were found to be in the luteal (metestrus–dioestrus) phase of the oestrous cycle following hormone administration on the fifth day of the treatment protocol. One animal in the T‐2 group was determined to be in proestrus, and two animals were in oestrous on the fifth day of treatment. On the 10th day of treatment, although the oestrous cycle was ongoing in the treatment groups, it was noted that all animals in the C group were in dioestrus (Figure2).

In the C group, nucleated epithelial cells characteristic of the luteal phase continued to be observed throughout the experimental period. In the treatment groups, irregularly shaped cornified squamous epithelial cells began to appear at the end of the procedure. Vaginal cytology during the oestrous stage is characterized by a predominance of superficial cells, particularly irregularly shaped cornified squamous epithelial cells. Thus, it was demonstrated that the oestrous cycle had resumed in these rats. These cellular alterations in the vaginal mucosal layer were similar across all treatment groups (Figure3).

The macroscopic appearance of the uterine horns and ovaries is presented in Figure4. No pathological alterations were observed in the uterine horns and ovaries of the S group. On the contrary, both uterine horns were enlarged in the C group compared to the other groups. Treatment withA. artemisiaessential oil resulted in better macroscopic recovery compared to the C group. Although the mean uterine volume in the C group (267.90 ± 7.19 mm3) was higher than those in the treatment groups (R: 257.40 ± 6.31 mm3; T‐1: 251.20 ± 12.82 mm3; T‐2: 251.20 ± 0.00 mm3and T‐3: 259.10 ± 7.85 mm3), the difference was not statistically significant (Table2).

Ovarian weights were significantly different in S (0.07 ± 0.00 g,p< 0.001) and T‐2 (0.12 ± 0.01 g,p< 0.05) groups when compared to the C group (0.22 ± 0.04 g). Among the treatment groups, the greatest reduction in ovarian weight was observed in the T‐2 group. Although uterine weights were lower in the treatment groups, the differences were not statistically significant (p> 0.05) (Table2).

Due to pseudopregnancy induction, mammary gland enlargement was observed in the C group. However, mammary gland development in the treatment groups, particularly in the T‐2 group, was lower than in the C group (Figure5). No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of mammary gland weight (p> 0.05). Nevertheless, the highest values were recorded in the control group, whereas the lowest were observed in the T‐2 group (Table2).

Microscopic findings of the ovarian, uterine and mammary tissues are summarized in Table3. A significant difference was observed in the total CL count (p< 0.05). The total CL count was found to be the lowest in the S (4.67 ± 1.09) and T‐3 (9.33 ± 2.01) groups, and the highest in the C group (24.17 ± 6.27). No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the number of regressed CL (p> 0.05); however, the highest number of regressed CL was observed in the reference group (R) (3.33 ± 1.12) and treatment group 1 (T‐1) (3.50 ± 0.76), with the lowest count in the S group (1.00 ± 0.26). Mucosal plica in the epithelium of the endometrium was notably present in the C and T‐1 groups. In these groups, the endometrial epithelium exhibited hyperplastic changes, and the endometrial glands were observed to be significantly enlarged. All rats in the S group were in the follicular phase, whereas the luteal phase was detected in all animals in the C group. Both follicular and luteal phases were observed in the treatment and reference groups. No significant difference was noted in the number of endometrial glands (p> 0.05). The least alveolar development was observed in the R and T‐2 groups. Histopathological images of the ovarian, uterine and mammary tissues are presented in Figures6,7and8, respectively.

Pseudopregnancy is not a disease but a syndrome characterized by pregnancy‐like symptoms. Although the condition often resolves spontaneously without the need for medical intervention, its effects on mammary tissue may persist, potentially leading to mastitis, mammary dermatitis or even breast cancer. Therefore, maintaining hormonal balance is essential in the treatment of pseudopregnancy. Various pharmacological agents have been utilized for its management, including anti‐prolactins, oestrogens, progestogens, serotonin agonists and dopamine agonists. The primary mechanism regulating prolactin secretion in pseudopregnancy involves the activation of dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus, which suppresses prolactin release. The use of ergot alkaloids (e.g., bromocriptine and cabergoline), which act as dopaminergic agonists on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis, underscores the role of prolactin in the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome. Progestins have been found to be ineffective in fully treating pseudopregnancy and are associated with a high recurrence rate. Moreover, their use is limited due to a wide range of serious side effects, making them unsuitable for pseudopregnancy treatment. In recent years, medical therapies have primarily focused on dopamine agonists and serotonin antagonists, with dopamine agonists being the preferred option due to their longer duration of action and minimal side effects. Notably, prolactin secretion is regulated by multiple neurotransmitters and hormones, further emphasizing the complexity of its modulation (Gobello et al.2001b; Gobello2006; Ramsey2017; Root et al.2018).

Previous studies have demonstrated that pseudopregnancy in experimental animals can be induced through various methods, including mating with vasectomized males, artificial mechanical stimulation of the vaginal–cervical region (Garrels et al.2018; Wake et al.2023) or administration of exogenous hormones in rats (Bar‐Ami et al.2006; Eyster2012; Demirel et al.2018). Mechanical stimulation has been shown to trigger bi‐daily surges of prolactin, which subsequently promote ovarian progesterone secretion, leading to the establishment of pseudopregnancy without actual copulation (Poletini et al.2012; Stump et al.2014). This hormonally sustained dioestrus phase typically lasts for approximately 10–12 days (Stump et al.2014). Alternatively, pseudopregnancy can be induced hormonally in immature rats, whose ovaries primarily consist of a relatively homogeneous population of follicles, predominantly antral follicles (40%–50%) and lack CLs. This model utilizes PMSG and hCG administration to initiate and regulate luteal activity (Kolena et al.1997; Bar‐Ami et al.2006; Demirel et al.2018). In the current study, pseudopregnancy was established in immature rats via hormonal induction using PMSG and hCG.

The primary regulatory mechanism of prolactin secretion involves the activation of prolactin‐inhibiting dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus. Bromocriptine and cabergoline reduce prolactin secretion due to their strong dopamine D2‐receptor agonist activity. Similarly, serotonin antagonists indirectly inhibit prolactin secretion by stimulating endogenous dopamine release. Although dopamine agonists selectively suppress prolactin secretion, they are costly medications (Gobello et al.2001a,2006; Ramsey2017; Root et al.2018).

Given the high cost and adverse effects associated with current pharmacological treatments for pseudopregnancy, alternative medical approaches are being explored, with natural products emerging as promising candidates. Several medicinal plants, includingPulsatilla alpinasubsp.apiifolia(Scop.) Nyman,Ferula asafoetidaH.Karst.,Urtica dioicaL.,Thuja orientalisL. andM. chamomillaL., were reported to be effective in pseudopregnancy (Özyurtlu and Alaçam2005). Previous studies have demonstrated the dopaminergic effects of these plants (Martin et al.1988; Park et al.2014; Bharath Kumar et al.2017; Bisht et al.2017; Kabiri et al.2019), suggesting that their beneficial effects on pseudopregnancy may be attributed to this mechanism. Similarly, the dopaminergic activity ofA. absinthiumL. has been reported in previous studies (Kharoubi et al.2010; Zeraati et al.2014). Building on this knowledge, our previous study investigated the therapeutic effects of differentA. absinthiumextracts on pseudopregnant rats (Demirel et al.2018). Petroleum ether, dichloromethane and methanol extracts were administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 10 days. The results demonstrated that the petroleum ether extract exerted a modulatory effect on hormonal and histological changes associated with pseudopregnancy.

GC–MS analysis revealed that among the volatile compounds,cis‐chrysanthenyl acetate and β‐thujone were the major constituents in the most bioactive petroleum ether extract (Demirel et al.2018). Consistently, the phytochemical analysis of the present study identifiedcis‐chrysanthenyl acetate as the predominant compound, accounting for 17.8% of the total composition. Additionally, sabinyl acetate, terpinen‐4‐ol, caryophyllene oxide and (E)‐nuciferol were identified as other major constituents. These findings align with previous studies, which have reported the presence ofcis‐epoxyocimene,cis‐chrysanthenyl acetate, bornyl acetate, eucalyptol, myrcene, linalool, neryl butanoate, sabinene,trans‐sabinyl acetate,trans‐thujone, as well as α‐ and β‐thujone in the essential oil ofA. absinthium(Pino et al.1997; Orav et al.2006; Rezaeinodehi and Khangholi2008; Judzentiene and Budiene2010; Bailen et al.2013; Dhen et al.2014; Julio et al.2015; Batiha et al.2020; Jiang et al.2021).

In agreement with our findings,cis‐chrysanthenyl acetate has been reported as the major constituent in the essential oil ofA. absinthium. Sharopov et al. (2012) analysed threeA. absinthiumsamples from two different locations and found thatcis‐chrysanthenyl acetate (17.9%) was the main component in one of the samples. Similarly, Bailen et al. (2013) reported a high concentration ofcis‐chrysanthenyl acetate in the essential oil ofA. absinthiumgrown under various environmental conditions. Comparable results were also documented by Judzentiene and Budiene (2010), Julio et al. (2015) and Obistioiu et al. (2014). However, other studies have identified chamazulene, bornyl acetate, neryl butanoate and sabinene as the dominant compounds in the essential oil ofA. absinthiumfrom different geographical regions (Pino et al.1997; Sharopov2012; Msaada et al.2015). These variations in chemical composition can be attributed to differences in climatic conditions (rainfall, temperature and sunlight), geographical factors (altitude and soil composition) and the timing of harvest.

Thujone, a psychoactive compound, is known to induce hallucinations and enhance dopaminergic activity. Medicinal plants containing thujone have been traditionally used as abortifacients, contraceptives and uterotonics, as well as for the treatment of amenorrhoea and uterine carcinomas (Dhiman et al.2012). However, prolonged use ofA. absinthiumessential oil may be toxic, leading to neurological disorders such as insomnia, convulsions and hallucinations. Judzentiene et al. (2012) investigated the toxicity ofA. absinthiumessential oil in relation to its chemical composition. Their findings indicated that the most toxic essential oils were those with high concentrations oftrans‐sabinyl acetate and thujone, whereas samples containing an equivalent amount of sabinyl acetate but lacking thujone exhibited significantly lower toxicity. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has classified α‐ and β‐thujone as potentially hazardous compounds inA. absinthium. However, previous studies have suggested that α‐ and β‐thujone concentrations ranging from 0% to 70.6% do not cause adverse effects (Szopa et al.2020). In the present study, the β‐thujone content of the essential oil was determined to be 0.1%.

The findings of this study indicate thatA. absinthiumessential oil, administered at a dose of 25 mg/kg, exerted beneficial effects in the pseudopregnancy model in rats, leading to the return of cyclicity. This was evidenced by a reduction in uterine volume as well as decreases in the weights of the uterine, ovarian and mammary tissues compared to the control group, effects that are consistent with the follicular phase of the cycle. In addition,A. absinthiumessential oil, indirectly via modulation of the oestrous cycle, induced histological alterations in the ovarian and mammary tissues in the treatment groups.

The normal oestrous cycle in rats lasts between 4 and 5 days and consists of four distinct stages: proestrus (12 h), oestrous (12 h), metestrus (21 h) and dioestrus (57 h) (Paccola et al.2013; Cora et al.2015). In pseudopregnancy, following ovulation, the dioestrus phase is prolonged by 13–18 days, during which the CLs become persistent and continue to secrete progesterone (Abd‐Elkareem2017; Anderson and Musah2013). During the initial days of pseudopregnancy, the progesterone‐dominant phase resembles that of gestation, with the CL being regulated by prolactin secretion. The nocturnal surge of prolactin plays a key role in stimulating the neuroendocrine pathway in pseudopregnant rats (Terkel1988). These alterations in the oestrous cycle can be assessed through vaginal cytology (Cora et al.2015). Pseudopregnancy is characterized by an irregular oestrous cycle, in which the nucleated epithelial cells of the dioestrus phase persist for an extended period (Stump et al.2014; Demirel et al.2018).

In the present study, vaginal cytology was evaluated on Days 0, 5 and 10 of the treatment protocol in pseudopregnant rats. Throughout the experimental period, nucleated epithelial cells characteristic of the dioestrus phase were consistently observed in all rats of the C group. In the treatment groups, however, irregularly shaped cornified squamous epithelial cells were detected at the end of the experiment, suggesting the initiation of the oestrous cycle. These cytological findings were similar across all treatment groups. Consequently, it was concluded that vaginal cytology alone was not a decisive factor in determining the effects ofA. absinthiumessential oil on pseudopregnancy.

Although embryo implantation does not occur in cases of pseudopregnancy, histomorphological changes are observed in the uterine tissue (Abd‐Elkareem2017). These changes include nonspecific trauma‐related decidual cell differentiation, as well as hyperaemia and oedema in the uterine tissue, particularly evident during the mid‐stage of pseudopregnancy (Peel et al.1979; Anderson and Musah2013). The elevation of plasma progesterone levels results in mucosal plica formation, glandular development, epithelial proliferation and thickening of the uterine wall. Characteristic findings of the late stage of pseudopregnancy include epithelial proliferation, crypt formation, increased mucosal plica and glandular hypertrophy (Albers et al.2015; Abd‐Elkareem2017).

In this study, the number of CLs was significantly higher in the C group compared to the treatment groups. Consistent with previous studies, increased mucosal plica and glandular hypertrophy in the endometrium were notably observed in both the C and treatment group one (T‐1). Mucosal plica was also present in some cases within the other treatment groups. The previous research has indicated that mammary epithelial cell proliferation occurs during the metestrus stage, as seen in pseudopregnant females (Hvid et al.2012). In the current study, mammary gland, alveolar and ductal developments were significantly enhanced in the C and T‐1 groups, whereas mammary tissue recovery was noted in the T‐2 and R groups. Overall, a dose of 25 mg/kg ofA. absinthiumessential oil was determined to be effective on uterine and mammary tissue in pseudopregnant rats.

A limitation of this study is the potential effect of natural puberty maturation, as the animals started the experiment in pre‐puberty. Therefore, some of the observed changes may reflect not only the effects of the experimental intervention but also normal developmental hormonal changes associated with puberty. Future clinical studies are needed to clarify these interactions and confirm the applicability of the findings to reproductive physiology.

The 25 mg/kg dose ofA. absinthiumessential oil was found to be effective in improving the pseudopregnancy model induced in rats. The outcome of the phytochemical analysis has shown thatA. absinthiumessential oil, which is rich incis‐chrysanthenyl acetate, sabinyl acetate, terpinen‐4‐ol, caryophyllene oxide and (E)‐nuciferol, displayed therapeutic activity in terms of improving mammary development. Future studies are recommended to focus on elucidating the mechanisms at the hormonal (progesterone and prolactin), cellular and molecular levels to help further validate and expand the potential applications ofA. absinthiumessential oil in veterinary medicine.
