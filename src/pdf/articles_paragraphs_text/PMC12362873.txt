Toxoplasma gondiiis a globally widespread zoonotic parasite, infecting nearly one-third of the human population, often leading to chronic, latent infections. Among the emerging layers of gene regulation, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) has emerged as a pivotal post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotes. Despite its growing recognition in various species, the epitranscriptomic landscape of m5C in the tachyzoite stage ofT. gondiiremains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we performed the first comprehensive m5C methylation profiling across three majorT. gondiigenotypes—RH (type I), ME49 (type II), and VEG (type III).

The comparative m5C methylation analysis was carried out using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Differentially m5C-methylated genes (DMMGs) were functionally annotated via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. By combining methylation and transcriptomic data, we uncovered strain-specific correlations between m5C modifications and gene expression. Additionally, expression and methylation patterns of potential regulators identified via BLASTP searches were examined. Statistical analyses were determined by one-way ANOVA.

Our analysis revealed a total of 5129, 4968, and 4577 m5C-methylated genes in RH, ME49, and VEG tachyzoites, respectively, with methylation predominantly enriched in the coding sequences. Comparative analysis across different strains uncovered 1710, 1131, and 784 DMMGs in RH versus ME49, RH versus VEG, and ME49 versus VEG, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted key biological processes, including catalytic activity, transport, phospholipid metabolism and transcription regulation. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis identified critical m5C-regulated processes such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, DNA replication, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Virulence-associated secretory effectors exhibited hypermethylation in more virulent strains, such as GRA39 and ROP35. Additionally, several putative m5C regulators displayed genotype-specific or conserved expression and methylation patterns.

This study presents the first m5C epitranscriptomic atlas ofT. gondiitachyzoites, revealing both conserved and genotype-specific mRNA modification networks. These insights significantly increased the understanding of the regulatory role of m5C inT. gondiipathogenesis and open promising avenues for the development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed at combating zoonotic toxoplasmosis.

Toxoplasma gondiiis a zoonotic protozoan parasite infecting almost all warm-blooded animals and humans [1]. It is estimated that nearly one-third of the global population harbors chronicT. gondiiinfections, primarily acquired through the ingestion of contaminated water or food containing tissue cysts or oocysts [2]. While most infections remain asymptomatic, immunocompromised individuals face a heightened risk of life-threatening toxoplasmosis due to the reactivation and proliferation of tachyzoites from latent tissue cysts [3]. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests a potential link between chronicT. gondiiinfection and the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders in humans, including schizophrenia and other mental health conditions [2–4]. Beyond its impact on human health,T. gondiiis a major etiological agent of pregnancy loss and congenital abnormalities in livestock species such as sheep, goats, and swine, causing substantial economic losses to the global livestock industry [1].

Genetic characterization ofT. gondiiisolates from wildlife using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis has identified three predominant clonal lineages—types I, II, and III—each exhibiting distinct virulence profiles in murine models [5]. Type I strains, such as RH, are highly virulent, causing 100% mortality in mice with as few as one tachyzoite [5–7]. In contrast, type II (ME49) strain shows intermediate virulence depending on mouse strain, while type III (VEG) strains are considered avirulent [5–7]. These genotypes also display distinct geographic distributions, with types I–III prevalent in North America and Europe, and more genetically diverse, non-archetypal strains dominating in South America, Asia, and Africa [5,8,9]. Among these, type II strains are most frequently associated with human toxoplasmosis cases [10]. The RH (type I), ME49 (type II), and VEG (type III) strains serve as key reference models for experimental studies. However, the molecular mechanisms driving their distinct virulence remain incompletely understood, highlighting the need for further exploration of their genetic and epitranscriptomic features.

RNA modifications constitute a critical regulatory layer in gene expression and translation, influencing processes such as RNA stability, processing, macromolecular interactions, and translation efficiency [11–13]. These modifications occur across diverse RNA species, including messenger RNA (mRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [11,14–16]. To date, more than 100 distinct RNA modifications have been identified, with key modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), and N7-methylguanosine (m7G) playing fundamental roles in cellular regulation [11,12,17]. Emerging research highlights the importance of dynamic RNA modifications in parasite pathogenesis, affecting virulence, replication, developmental transitions, and host–pathogen interactions [11].

Among these, m5C, characterized by methylation at the fifth carbon position of cytosine, has been observed across diverse RNA species, including mRNA, rRNA, tRNA and ncRNAs [14,18]. In mRNA, m5C modifications are differentially distributed in the coding sequence (CDS), 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR), and 5′UTR, with distinct functional consequences on gene expression in various biological processes across species [14]. For instance, m5C modification within CDS of mRNA stabilizes spermine oxidase mRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [19], while enhancing the translation efficiency of quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 in non-small-cell lung cancer [20]. m5C modification in the 5′UTR of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 upregulates its expression by enhancing mRNA stability rather than influencing its translation [21]. Modification in the 3′UTR stabilizes mRNA [22–24], and promotes protein translation level by influencing translation termination or interacting with RNA binding proteins [25–27]. In tRNAs, the modification stabilizes the secondary structure, impacting translation accuracy and efficiency [14].

The dynamic regulation of m5C involves a complex interplay of catalytic enzymes, including “writers” (methyltransferases) depositing the modification, “readers” (methylation-binding proteins) recognizing it, and “erasers” (demethylases) removing it [11,14,15]. This regulatory interplay governs critical molecular functions such as mRNA export, RNA stability, translation, and long-distance RNA transport [14]. In eukaryotes, the m5C methyltransferase NOL1/NOP2/SUN domain family member 2 (NSUN2) and the reader protein Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) have been implicated in oncogenic transcriptional regulation [18,28–30]. Moreover, NSUN1 has been shown to play a role in HIV-1 transcription and replication [31]. In protozoan parasites, m5C regulatory mechanisms also control essential developmental processes. For instance,Plasmodium falciparumemploys PfNSUN2 for mRNA stability and PfDNMT2 for tRNA cytosine methylation, both of which are crucial for sexual differentiation [32,33]. Additionally, m5C modification is involved in regulating the stress response, mitochondrial activity, nerve and brain development, gametogenesis, and embryogenesis [14]. Given these fundamental roles of m5C in cellular regulation, this modification could also play a pivotal role inT. gondiipathogenesis, particularly in processes such as tachyzoite proliferation, immune evasion, differentiation and the maintenance of latent infection.

Despite these advances, a systematic characterization of m5C modification patterns inT. gondiiremains unexplored, particularly with respect to lineage-specific epitranscriptomic variations. To address this gap, we performed comparative m5C profiling of intracellular tachyzoites from the RH, ME49, and VEG reference strains using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), alongside transcriptome profiling. This study not only expands our understanding of the epitranscriptomic landscape inT. gondii, but also provides valuable insights into conserved and strain-specific RNA modification pathways, which may serve as potential targets for anti-Toxoplasmainterventions.

We used threeT. gondiistrains: RH (type I), ME49 (type II), and VEG (type III). These strains were maintained in confluent monolayer of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells (ATCC SCRC-1041), as previously described [34]. HFFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Suzhou, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia), 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.2, Solarbio, Beijing, China), and penicillin–streptomycin solution (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, Solarbio, Beijing, China). The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2[34–36]. For infection, HFF monolayers were infected with tachyzoites and incubated for 40 h. After the incubation period, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, then scraped and centrifuged at 2500 ×gfor 10 min. The resulting cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. Three biological replicates perT. gondiigenotype were processed for subsequent methylome and transcriptome profiling, as previously described [37].

As depicted in the experimental workflow (Fig.1), total RNA was extracted fromT. gondiitachyzoites of the RH, ME49, and VEG genotypes using TRIzol®Reagent (Invitrogen, Carilsbad, CA, USA). RNA concentration was quantified with a NanoDrop™(ND-1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and RNA integrity was assessed through denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was then removed using the GenSeq®rRNA Removal Kit (GenSeq Inc., Shanghai, China) [38]. The RNA samples were divided into two aliquots: one was used as the input RNA control for transcriptome profiling, and the other was subjected to m5C methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (m5C-MeRIP-Seq). Both sequencing workflows were conducted by Cloudseq Inc (Shanghai, China). For m5C-MeRIP-Seq, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using the GenSeq m5C MeRIP Kit (GenSeq Inc., Shanghai, China) [39]. Briefly, rRNA-depleted samples were fragmented to ~ 200 nt using RNA fragmentation reagents, then incubated with protein A/G beads conjugated to anti-m5C antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 4 h at 4 ℃ with rotation. After incubation, the antibody-RNA complexes were sequentially washed and then eluted in nuclease-free water. RNA from both the IP and input groups was then converted into sequencing libraries using the GenSeq®Low Input Whole RNA Library Prep Kit (GenSeq Inc., Shanghai, China). Library quality was evaluated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, California, USA), and the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Both m5C-MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments were conducted in three biological replicates.

Raw sequencing reads were first quality-checked using a Q30 threshold. Low-quality reads were removed with Cutadapt R 1.18 (Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden) [40], and the remaining high-quality reads were aligned to theT. gondiiME49 reference genome (ToxoDB;https://toxodb.org) using HISAT2 R 2.2.1 (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA) [41]. Since host RNA was not depleted prior to sequencing, the total RNA included both parasite- and host-derived transcripts. To minimize host RNA interference, only reads that uniquely mapped to theT. gondiigenome were retained for downstream analyses. Methylation-enriched regions (i.e., methylation peaks) within mRNA were identified using MACS R 1.4.2 (Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, USA) applying a significance threshold ofPvalue ≤ 10⁻5and a fold enrichment ≥ 2. IP samples were treated as the experimental groups, while matched input samples served as controls [42]. Differential methylation between groups were assessed using diffReps R 1.55.6 (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA), with the same significance thresholds [43]. Motif analysis was performed using DREME R 5.3.0 (University of Queensland & University of Washington, Brisbane, Australia/Seattle, USA).

Transcriptomic profiling was performed using edgeR package R 4.2.1 (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with aQvalue (adjustedPvalue) ≤ 0.05, absolute log2fold change (FC) ≥ 1 and uniquely mapped reads to theT. gondiigenome. Functional annotation of differentially methylated m5C genes (DMMGs) was conducted using the topGO package R. 2.42.0 (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland), which revealed significant Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment (P≤ 0.05). The top five terms from each GO category were visualized. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments analysis of DMMGs was performed using the KEGG database (https://genome.jp/kegg/) [44], with pathways exhibiting aPvalue ≤ 0.05 considered statistically significant.

To validate the multi-omics results from m5C-MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis, RT-qPCR and MeRIP-qPCR assays were performed on both input and IP samples. RT-qPCR was conducted using a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously [38]. Actin (TGME49_209030) was used as the endogenous normalization control. The relative expression of DEGs was quantified using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method (2−ΔΔCt), where the first ΔCt represents the difference in Ct values between the target gene and the reference (housekeeping) gene, and the second ΔΔCt represents the difference of ΔCt between two comparedT. gondiistrains. m5C methylation levels in IP samples were calculated relative to input baselines using the following formula: %(IP/Input) = 2[Ct(input)−Ct(IP)]× DF × 100, where DF denotes dilution factor [38]. Primer sequences for validation are provided in Additional file1: Table S1 and Additional file2: Table S2.

All experiments were conducted in independent biological triplicate with continuous variable data presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differentially methylated mRNA sites were identified using diffReps with stringent thresholds (Pvalue ≤ 10⁻5and fold enrichment ≥ 2). Inter-group differences in expression and methylation validation experiments were assessed by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using GraphPad Prism R 10.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA), with statistical significance set atP≤ 0.05. Significance levels are denotes as ****P≤ 0.0001, ***P≤ 0.001, **P≤ 0.01, *P≤ 0.05 and NS (not significant) forP> 0.05.

A total of 8034 genes were identified inT. gondiitachyzoites, with 7480 genes conserved across all lineages. Of these, 88, 95, and 75 genes were uniquely present in RH, ME49, and VEG strains, respectively (Fig.2A). m5C-MeRIP analysis revealed m5C methylation peaks in 6087 genes, of which 3669 genes were consistently methylated across all tachyzoite lineages (Fig.2B). Further comparative analysis identified 637, 357, and 255 methylated genes shared between the RH-ME49, RH-VEG, and ME49-VEG strain pairs, respectively. Additionally, 466, 407, and 296 genes exhibited lineage-specific methylation in the RH, ME49, and VEG strains (Fig.2B). Chromosomal mapping revealed a predominant m5C deposition on the X chromosome across allT. gondiitachyzoites (Additional file3: Figure S1A–C). Analysis of m5C peak distribution across genes showed that most genes harbored 1–3 m5C peaks (Additional file3: Figure S1D–F). Importantly, methylation patterns exhibited striking conservation, with the highest enrichment observed in the CDS region (Fig.2C). Specifically, in RH tachyzoites, 90.3% of m5C peaks were located within the CDS, while 3.5% and 6.2% were found in the 3′UTR and 5′UTR, respectively (Fig.2D). This pattern was consistent across the ME49 and VEG strains (Fig.2E, F). Additionally, multiple m5C sequence motifs were identified, with the top three motifs for each lineage ofT. gondiitachyzoites illustrated in Fig.2G–I.

Comparative methylome analysis identified 2595 differentially methylated m5C peaks across 1710 genes in the RH versus ME49 tachyzoite comparison. Of these, 1362 peaks were hypomethylated in 846 genes, while 1233 peaks were hypermethylated in 864 genes in RH relative to ME49 (Fig.3A–C; Additional file4: Table S3). In the RH versus VEG comparison, 1524 differential m5C methylation peaks were detected in 1131 genes, with a marked predominance of hypermethylation—1473 peaks—compared to only 51 hypomethylated peaks (Fig.3A, B, D; Additional file4: Table S3). Similarly, the ME49 versus VEG comparison revealed a clear hypermethylation bias, with 990 significantly hypermethylated peaks in 773 genes, while only 12 peaks were hypomethylated in 11 genes (Fig.3A, B, E; Additional file4: Table S3). Chromosomal mapping revealed a conserved pattern of differential m5C peak distribution across all comparisons (Additional file3: Figure S2, A–C). In all comparisons, DMMGs containing 1–3 m5C peaks were the most prevalent (Additional file3: Figure S2, D–F).

GO enrichment analysis was performed to annotate the functional roles of DMMGs, revealing distinct epigenetic regulatory patterns across the strain comparisons. In the RH versus ME49 comparison, hypermethylated genes were predominantly enriched in molecular functions (MF) related to energy metabolism, including ATP-dependent activity, GTPase, and small GTPase binding. Cellular components (CC) were mainly localized to the nuclear envelope and protein complexes, while biological processes (BP) were involved in protein trafficking, such as protein import into the nucleus and the establishment of protein localization (Fig.4A; Additional file5: Table S4). In contrast, hypomethylated genes in RH versus ME49 exhibited a clear focus on transcriptional regulation, particularly in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription regulation and phospholipid metabolism. These processes included positive regulation of transcription, cellular response to oxygen-containing compounds, macromolecule biosynthesis regulation, and phospholipid biosynthesis (Fig.4B; Additional file5: Table S4). Cellular component analysis revealed that hypomethylated genes were predominantly localized to intracellular vesicular compartments (Fig.4B; Additional file5: Table S4). Molecular function annotations indicated a dual role of these genes in transcriptional regulation and catalytic activity (Fig.4B; Additional file5: Table S4).

In the RH versus VEG comparison, hypermethylated genes were enriched in molecular functions related to energy metabolism, including ATP-dependent activity, nucleoside-triphosphatase regulation, and ATP hydrolysis. These genes were primarily localized to RNA processing organelles (e.g., prespliceosome) and protein processing organelles (e.g., Golgi apparatus) within the cellular component category (Fig.4C; Additional file5: Table S4). Interestingly, protein trafficking pathways were similarly enriched in both RH versus VEG and RH versus ME49 comparisons (Fig.4C; Additional file5: Table S4). Conversely, hypomethylated genes in RH versus VEG were predominantly enriched in transferase activity, as well as developmental processes such as anatomical structure development and multicellular organism development. Additionally, these genes were involved in DNA damage response signaling, particularly through p53 class mediators (Fig.4D; Additional file5: Table S4). Phospholipid metabolic processes were also markedly enriched in hypomethylated genes, a trend shared with the hypomethylated profiles in the RH versus ME49 comparison (Fig.4D; Additional file5: Table S4).

In the ME49 versus VEG comparison, hypermethylation events pointed to DNA-centric regulatory mechanisms, with molecular functions enriched in sequence-specific DNA binding, ATP-dependent catalytic activity (Fig.4E; Additional file5: Table S4). Additionally, hypermethylated genes in this comparison were enriched in nuclear chromosome-related cellular components (Fig.4E; Additional file5: Table S4). The biological process enrichment for hypermethylated genes in ME49 versus VEG also aligned with organizational and localization processes observed in the other strain comparisons (Fig.4E; Additional file5: Table S4). The biological process enrichment for hypermethylated genes in ME49 versus VEG also aligned with organizational and localization processes observed in the other strain comparisons (Fig.4E; Additional file5: Table S4).

KEGG pathway analysis of DMMGs revealed both conserved and strain-specific regulatory patterns. In the RH versus ME49 comparison, hypermethylated genes were predominantly enriched in pathways related to nucleocytoplasmic transport, mRNA surveillance, and DNA replication. In contrast, hypomethylated genes were associated with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (Fig.5A, B; Additional file6: Table S5). Interestingly, spliceosome pathway enrichment was observed in both hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in this comparison (Fig.5A, B; Additional file6: Table S5). In the RH versus VEG comparison, hypermethylated genes were enriched in pathways associated with DNA replication, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Unique enrichment for hypomethylated genes was observed in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis pathway (Fig.5C, D; Additional file6: Table S5). In the ME49 versus VEG comparison, hypermethylated genes were particularly enriched in pathways related to nucleotide and phosphonate metabolism, as well as endocytosis. The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling pathway, which was enriched in hypomethylated genes in the RH versus ME49 analysis, was also observed in this comparison (Fig.5E; Additional file6: Table S5).

RNA-Seq identified 1256 DEGs in the RH versus ME49 comparison, with 571 downregulated and 685 upregulated genes (Fig.6A; Additional file7: Table S6; Additional file3: Figure S3A). The conjoint analysis of m5C-MeRIP and RNA-Seq data uncovered 262 peaks exhibiting concurrent changes in both methylation and expression. These were categorized as follows: 37 hypermethylated and upregulated (hyper-up) peaks, 34 hypermethylated and downregulated (hyper-down) peaks, 6 hypomethylated and upregulated (hypo-up) peaks, and 185 hypomethylated and downregulated (hypo-down) peaks (Fig.6B; Additional file8: Table S7). Remarkably, 43.0% of DEGs with differential methylation displayed multiple methylation peaks. This included three downregulated kinases (TGME49_266010, TGME49_288440, TGME49_218400) with more than six peaks, and three HECT-domain ubiquitin-transferases (upregulated TGME49_270580 and downregulated TGME49_280660, TGME49_209000) with over three differential methylation peaks (Additional file8: Table S7).

In the RH versus VEG comparison, RNA-Seq analysis identified 1338 DEGs, with 621 downregulated and 717 upregulated genes (Fig.6A; Additional file7: Table S6; Additional file3: Figure S3B). The conjoint analysis identified 75 hypermethylated and upregulated peaks (hyper-up), 46 hypermethylated and downregulated peaks (hyper-down), and 7 hypomethylated and downregulated peaks (hypo-down) (Fig.6C; Additional file8: Table S7). Interestingly, multi-peak methylation was observed in 31.0% of the methylation-associated DEGs. This included two hyper-up DEGs (TGME49_255290 and TGME49_244700) with five methylation peaks, and two downregulated genes (TGME49_280660 and TGME49_301400) with more than three methylation peaks (Additional file8: Table S7).

In the ME49 versus VEG comparison, transcriptomic profiling identified 441 downregulated and 411 upregulated DEGs (Fig.6A; Additional file7: Table S6; Additional file3: Figure S3C). Among the 852 DEGs, we identified 101 loci where methylation and expression co-varied, including 95 hypermethylated and upregulated peaks (hyper-up), 5 hypermethylated and downregulated peaks (hyper-down), and 1 hypomethylated and upregulated peak (hypo-up) (Fig.6D; Additional file8: Table S7). Interestingly, 28.8% of DEGs with significant methylation changes displayed multiple differential peaks. These included upregulated and hypermethylated genes such as the NEK kinase (TGME49_218400), phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase (TGME49_266010), and two hypothetical proteins (TGME49_225090 and TGME49_268220), all of which exhibited more than five differential peaks (Additional file8: Table S7). Additionally, genes such as the apicomplexan monocarboxylate transporter 2 (AMT2, TGME49_297245), which plays a critical role inT. gondiivirulence [45], as well as two major facilitator superfamily transporters (TGME49_268020 and TGME49_319740), exhibited a positive correlation between methylation and expression in the ME49 versus VEG comparison (Additional file8: Table S7). The integrated analysis of m5C methylation and transcriptional profiles revealed significant associations between methylation changes and gene expression acrossT. gondiistrains (Additional file3: Figure S4).

To validate the m5C-MeRIP data, we randomly selected two m5C sites from each of three candidate genes (TGME49_223480, TGME49_271010, and TGME49_261022) for methylation site verification using m5C-MeRIP-qPCR (Fig.7). The results confirmed the differential methylation of these sites in mRNAs, with patterns that were consistent with the m5C-MeRIP data (Fig.7A–F). Additionally, RT-qPCR analysis further corroborated the transcriptional profiles of these genes (Fig.7G–I).

Distinct lineages ofT. gondii(type I, II and III) exhibit significant differences in virulence [6]. Previous genetic and CRISPR-based screens have identified key virulence-associated effectors, including secreted rhoptry proteins (ROPs), dense granule proteins (GRAs) and microneme proteins (MICs), such as ROP5, ROP18, GRA16 and GRA45 [6,46–48]. To investigate the m5C methylation and expression patterns of those effectors, we focused on differentially methylated or expressed ROPs, GRAs and MICs, based on their predicted localization, as determined by hyperplexed Localization of Organelle Proteins by Isotopic Tagging (hyperLOPIT) (Fig.8; Additional file9: Table S8 and Additional file10: Table S9) [49].

m5C methylation analysis revealed hypermethylation of most GRAs, ROPs, and MICs across all three strain comparisons (Fig.8A–C; Additional file9: Table S8), although strain-specific virulence factors did not show differential methylation. In the RH versus ME49 comparison, 41 differentially methylated peaks (25 hypermethylated and 16 hypomethylated) were detected across 26 genes, including 12 GRAs, 3 MICs, and 11 ROPs (Fig.8A). In the RH versus VEG comparison, all 33 differential peaks across 25 secretory effector genes were hypermethylated (Fig.8B). Similarly, in the ME49 versus VEG comparison, all 11 secretory effector genes showed hypermethylation (Fig.8C). These differentially methylated genes include known virulence factors, such as ROP35 [50], GRA39 [51], GRA47 [36,52], TGME49_266410, and TGME49_315910 [53], suggesting a strong role for m5C methylation in regulating virulence. Based on our findings, specific candidate genes such as GRA39, ROP35, and GRA47, which have been implicated inT. gondiivirulence, exhibited robust differential m5C methylation patterns that may influence their molecular functions. These findings highlight the potential involvement of m5C methylation in regulating key virulence factors.

Transcriptome comparisons of virulence-related genes revealed differential expression of several virulence-related genes. Interestingly, GRA17 [54,55], GRA23 [54,55], GRA72 [56,57] and TEEGR [58] were significantly upregulated in the RH strain compared to ME49 or VEG (Fig.8D–F, Additional file10: Table S9). ROP18, which is absent in the type III lineage [59], was upregulated in both the RH versus VEG and ME49 versus VEG comparisons (Fig.8D–F). Conjoint analysis of methylation and expression data revealed co-varying patterns for genes such as TGME49_208070 (a putative MIC), MIC12, and TGME49_301480 (a putative GRA).

Dynamic regulatory elements of RNA m5C modification have been identified in various species, including methyltransferases (NSUN1–NSUN6, TRM4A, the “writer”), the demethylase ALKBK1 (the “eraser”), and binding proteins such as Aly/REF export factor (ALYREF) and YBX1 (the “readers”) [14,60]. However, the regulatory landscape of m5C modification inT. gondiiremains largely uncharacterized, with current knowledge mainly focused on DNA methyltransferases [61]. In our analysis, we identified several candidate genes inT. gondiihomologous to known m5C regulators. Many of these genes exhibited negative phenotype scores in genome-wide CRISPR screens, suggesting their essential roles in tachyzoite invasion and proliferation [62].

To investigate the expression patterns of potential m5C regulators, we analyzed RNA-Seq data. Two reader homologs (TGME49_267470 and TGME49_272440) were upregulated in the RH and ME49 strains compared to the VEG strain. However, TGME49_320600 (a potential reader) exhibited the highest expression in RH tachyzoites, surpassing both the ME49 and VEG strains (Fig.9A; Additional file11: Table S10). An eraser homolog (TGME49_259140) was upregulated in the RH versus VEG comparison, although no significant expression differences were observed in the RH versus ME49, and ME49 versus VEG comparisons (Fig.9A; Additional file11: Table S10). Interestingly, a potential m5C writer (TGME49_222340) was downregulated in both RH and VEG tachyzoites compared to ME49 tachyzoites.

We next examined the m5C methylation status of these candidate regulators to understand the relationship between their expression and methylation patterns. This epitranscriptomic analysis identified 10 potential regulators with differential methylation, including seven homologs of the reader ALYREF (TGME49_227850, TGME49_292200, TGME49_320100, TGME49_268200, TGME49_321360, TGME49_270880, TGME49_305850) and two potential writers (TGME49_235160 and TGME49_213970, homologs of TRM4A and NSUN1, respectively), along with DNMTb (TGME49_243610) (Fig.9B; Additional file12: Table S11). Interestingly, multi-peak modifications (i.e., more than one methylation peak per gene) were common among these differentially methylated candidates (Fig.9B). Two potential readers (TGME49_292200 and TGME49_320100) exhibited more than three methylation peaks in allT. gondiistrains and were hypermethylated in RH tachyzoites compared to both ME49 and VEG strains (Fig.9B). Interestingly, bidirectional methylation (i.e., the co-occurrence of hyper- and hypo-methylated sites) was observed in the potential reader (TGME49_320100) and the potential writer (TGME49_243610) during the RH versus ME49 comparison (Fig.9B). However, no putative regulator exhibited both differential expression and methylation in a coordinated manner, highlighting the complexity of m5C regulation.

In addition to the differentially expressed or methylated m5C regulatory candidates, we also observed conserved expression and methylation patterns across the threeT. gondiitachyzoite lineages. This included ALYREF homologs (TGME49_224580, TGME49_318690, TGME49_268200 and TGME49_283740), eukaryotic NSUN homologs (TGME49_294440), and DNMTb homologs (TGME49_227660), all of which exhibited conserved expression patterns (Additional file11: Table S10). Furthermore, m5C-methylated ALYREF homologs (TGME49_294670, TGME49_306600, TGME49_289560, and TGME49_224580) showed no significant difference in m5C methylation across theT. gondiitachyzoite strains (Additional file4: Table S3). Interestingly, all these potential regulators had negative knockout fitness scores [62].

RNA modifications, particularly m5C methylation, are crucial regulators of gene expression and cellular processes across diverse organisms [11,14]. While two functional DNA methyltransferases, TgDNMTa and TgDNMTb, have been well-characterized inT. gondii[61], the role of m5C in regulating the parasite’s pathobiology remains underexplored—particularly in terms of its epitranscriptomic landscape. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive mapping of mRNA m5C modifications across three distinctT. gondiilineages (RH, ME49, and VEG) using an integrated approach combining m5C-MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. Our aim was to unravel the intricate regulatory networks linking methylation to gene expression, with particular focus on its implications for virulence and potential therapeutic targets. The robustness of our findings was validated through both MeRIP-qPCR (for methylation) and RT-qPCR (for expression) assays, ensuring the reliability of our results.

The positional distribution of m5C peaks and their associated sequence motifs are key determinants for understanding RNA methylation mechanisms. Our methylome profiling revealed that m5C modifications inT. gondiitachyzoites are predominantly concentrated in the CDS regions. This pattern mirrors findings inArabidopsis thalianaandEimeria tremella[38,63] but distinct from that observed inOryza sativa[64]. Interestingly, the most common m5C motifs identified in all threeT. gondiilineages were UGSAK (S = G or C, K = G or U) and GAMGVMG (M = A or C, V = A, C, or G). These motifs are distinct from those reported inA. thalianaandE. tremella, highlighting both conserved and lineage-specific variations in RNA methylation [38,63]. This suggests that m5C methylation may play a role in the adaptation ofT. gondiiacross different species, further emphasizing the diversity of epitranscriptomic regulation in eukaryotes.

Our methylome profiling revealed widespread m5C methylation inT. gondiitachyzoites, with 59.0–66.2% of total transcripts exhibiting methylation peaks, some containing ≥ 10 methylation sites. Functional annotation of DMMGs across the threeT. gondiilineages highlighted enrichment in GO terms related to molecular functions such as binding and catalytic activity, cellular components associated with vesicles and membranes, and biological processes including transport, localization, and transcriptional regulation. While this study primarily focused on mRNA m5C methylation, it did not explore tRNA and other RNA methylation in detail. Previous research has emphasized the significance of tRNA modifications inT. gondii[17], but tRNA m5C methylation was outside the scope of the present study. A more in-depth analysis of tRNA m5C methylation will be an essential focus in our future work, as it will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complete landscape of m5C regulation across various RNA species.

KEGG pathway analysis further highlighted nucleocytoplasmic transport, DNA replication, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling as key pathways regulated by m5C-methylation. A comparison withPlasmodiumrevealed a similar methylation-mediated regulation of nucleic acid metabolism, chromatin organization, and nucleoside transport during the asexual stage [32]. Collectively, these findings suggest that m5C-mediated epitranscriptomic regulation inT. gondiimay influence enzyme-driven processes by modulating catalytic domains and chromatin remodelers. This, in turn, could contribute to phenotypic divergence across differentT. gondiilineages.

Integrated analysis of the epitranscriptome and transcriptome revealed numerous DEGs that co-occurred with differential m5C methylation. Interestingly, three HECT domain-containing proteins (TGME49_270580, TGME49_280660, and TGME49_209000), which belong to the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase family and contain multiple methylation sites, exhibited both differential methylation and expression in the RH versus ME49 comparison. E3 ubiquitin ligases, essential for protein degradation and cellular regulation [65,66], were found to be influenced by m5C methylation. This further links m5C modification to crucial processes underlying parasite development and virulence. These findings suggest that phenotypic variations observed amongT. gondiilineages may be shaped by m5C-regulated ubiquitination pathways.

Secretory proteins, including GRAs, ROPs, and MICs, are central virulence factors inT. gondii, helping the parasite evade host immunity [6]. The virulence determinant ROP18, highly expressed in type I and II strains but absent in type III, forms a complex with ROP5 to phosphorylate immunity-related GTPase 6 (Irga6). This process, facilitated by GRA7, prevents the binding of immune-related GTPases (IRGs) to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), thus avoiding vacuole destruction and promoting tachyzoite survival [67]. ROP35, essential for in vivo cyst burden [50], were hypermethylated in the RH versus ME49 and RH versus VEG comparisons, suggesting m5C modification may play a role in chronic infection. Compared to less virulent strains, more virulent strains exhibit hypermethylation in secretory effectors, such as the dense granule proteins GRA39 [51], GRA47 [36,52], TGME49_266410, and TGME49_315910 [53], suggesting a correlation between m5C methylation and increased virulence inT. gondii.

Transcriptional analysis further revealed differential expression of known virulence effectors, including ROP18, GRA17, GRA72, and TEEGR, across the strains. Interestingly, while these known virulence factors did not exhibit co-varying patterns of expression and methylation, certain other genes such as TGME49_208070 (a putative MIC), MIC12, and TGME49_301480 (a putative GRA) displayed significant changes in both methylation and expression. These observations prompt further research to determine whether these methylation-expression patterns are directly associated with strain-specific virulence. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that differential m5C methylation of key effector genes, such as GRA39 and GRA47, plays a crucial role in regulating their molecular functions (e.g., nutrients uptake) and influencing virulence traits across differentT. gondiilineages. Functional validation studies, such as gene knockouts or CRISPR-based editing, will be critical to establish a definitive link between m5C methylation and pathogenicity.

Our analysis also revealed that AMT2, a gene involved in isoprenoid and fatty acid biosynthesis and known for its role inT. gondiivirulence in mice [45], was hypomethylated in the RH versus ME49 comparison, despite showing no significant expression changes. In contrast, two major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters (TGME49_268020 and TGME49_319740), exhibited a positive correlation between methylation and expression in the ME49 versus VEG comparison. This suggests that m5C methylation may play a role in regulating nutrient transport, contributing to strain-specific phenotypic differences. Importantly, the identification of conserved methylated mRNAs acrossT. gondiilineages highlights the potential of targeting these modifications in the development of new anti-parasitic therapeutics.

m5C methylation is tightly regulated by a network of “writers,” “readers,” and “erasers” [11,14,15]. Over ten RNA m5C methyltransferases (writers) have been identified, including members of the NSUN family, tRNA-specific methyltransferases like TRDMT, and DNMTb [11,14,15]. Both NSUN2 and TRM4B are known to exhibit mRNA methyltransferase activity across eukaryotes [63,64,68,69]. In apicomplexan parasites, the functions of several m5C writers have been characterized, including Pf-NSUN2, Pf-DNMT2, TgDNMTa, and TgDNMTb [32,33,61]. PyNSUN2, an ortholog of Pf-NSUN2 inPlasmodium yoelii, stabilizes mRNA transcripts and regulates gametocyte development via m5C-mediated mechanisms [32]. In our study, TGME49_222340 was differentially expressed, which is a homolog of NSUN1–NSUN6 and TRM4A, identified using BLASTp searches in the ToxoDB database (https://toxodb.org). Given the role of PyNSUN2 inPlasmodiumgametocyte development, TGME49_222340 may similarly regulate life-cycle transitions inT. gondii. Furthermore, three other putative methyltransferases—TGME49_235160 (homologous to TRM4A), TGME49_213970 (NSUN1), and TGME49_243610 (DNMTb)—exhibited differential methylation patterns acrossT. gondiilineages, suggesting their involvement in regulating epitranscriptomic differences and lineage-specific phenotypes.

m5C demethylation is facilitated by ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins and AlkB homologues (ALKBH) in mammalian cells [70–73]. InArabidopsis, ALKBH6 plays a key role in regulating stress responses by binding to m5C-modified RNAs during germination and seedling growth [74]. Through comparative genomic analysis, we identified TGME49_259140 as a homolog of ALKBH6, which exhibited differential expression between the RH and VEG strains. CRISPR screening data from ToxoDB provided a knockout fitness score of − 1.59 for this gene [62], highlighting its potential importance for tachyzoite proliferation. These findings suggest that TGME49_259140 may be involved in epitranscriptomic regulation under stress conditions; however, further experimental validation is required to confirm its role in RNA demethylation.

Readers recognize m5C-modified RNA and regulate various downstream processes, including splicing, localization, translation, stability, and degradation [15]. In mammals, the reader protein ALYREF selectively binds m5C-methylated mRNAs to facilitate their export [75], while YBX1 plays a role in stabilizing maternal mRNAs and coordinating processes, such as early embryogenesis in zebrafish [76], autophagy [77], and hematopoietic stem cell expansion [78,79]. InT. gondii, we identified two YBX1 homologs (TGME49_320600 and TGME49_267470) and one ALYREF homolog (TGME49_272440), all of which exhibited differential expression across strains. Additionally, seven potential ALYREF-like readers showed strain-specific differences in m5C methylation, suggesting that these proteins may interact with m5C-modified transcripts and contribute to phenotypic diversity betweenT. gondiistrains. Several potential m5C regulatory factors exhibited conserved expression or methylation acrossT. gondiitachyzoites, including readers (TGME49_224580, TGME49_318690, TGME49_268200, and TGME49_283740) and writers (TGME49_227660). Interestingly, their negative knockout fitness scores indicate essential roles inT. gondiisurvival, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets.

While this study provides a comprehensive m5C epitranscriptomic landscape inT. gondii, several limitations should be noted. First, this study was restricted to mRNA type and the tachyzoite stage. Expanding to other RNA species (e.g., tRNAs, lncRNAs) and other developmental stages (bradyzoites, sporozoites) would offer a more complete understanding of m5C dynamics inT. gondii. Second, although we identified differentially methylated genes and potential regulators, the functional consequences of these modifications, particularly in virulence-associated mRNAs, require experimental validation through approaches like site-directed mutagenesis or methylation inhibition assays to establish direct mechanistic links. Third, technical limitations in m5C detection methods may have affected data sensitivity, suggesting the need for orthogonal validation using emerging technologies like nanopore sequencing. These considerations highlight important directions for future research to fully elucidate the regulatory roles of m5C in parasite biology.

Our study provides a comprehensive characterization of the m5C epitranscriptome inT. gondiitachyzoites of the three major clonal lineages, uncovering both conserved and strain-specific methylation patterns that may contribute to strain-specific phenotypic variations. Through integrated MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analyses, we identified differentially methylated and expressed genes that likely play pivotal roles in parasite virulence and adaptation. Our findings suggest that lineage-specific m5C regulators may drive differential pathogenicity, while conserved regulatory factors may be essential forT. gondiiinfection, positioning them as potential targets for vaccine development or therapeutic intervention. Future research should focus on functional validation of candidate regulators using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and site-directed mutagenesis of conserved m5C sites in virulence-related mRNAs to establish direct links between methylation and pathogenicity.
