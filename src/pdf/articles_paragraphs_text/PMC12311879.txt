Neuroblastoma (NB) is a prevalent malignant tumour affecting children. Due to its insidious onset, malignant nature and poor prognosis, the absence of effective treatments presents a significant challenge, profoundly impacting children and their families. Children embody the core and hope of a family, and when faced with sudden adversity, parents often undergo psychological crises marked by anxiety, depression and severe emotional distress. Fortunately, XXX Hospital serves as a testing ground for novel domestic medications, offering not only therapy but also instilling hope in children with NB and their families. Among these medications, naxitamab (hu3F8) has shown promising efficacy in treating NB. This qualitative study aims to investigate the psychological experiences of caregivers of children with NB undergoing naxitamab treatment at a hospital in China, a specialized institution. Subsequently, tailored psychological support for caregivers will be considered based on the findings.

Employing phenomenological research techniques, we conducted face‐to‐face semistructured interviews with 14 caregivers of children diagnosed with NB. Colaizzi's seven‐step analysis method was employed to analyse the interview data.

The psychological experiences of caregivers of children with NB were categorized into three main themes and 11 subthemes: the pretreatment stage (challenges during diagnosis, shock and collapse upon diagnosis and persistent pursuit of hope); the in‐treatment stage (treatment‐related worries and fears, significant financial strain, renewed hope and expectations during treatment and reliance on medical staff for trust and hope); and the posttreatment stage (changes in perspectives following treatment, rethinking expectations for children, anticipating the development of novel therapeutic agents and expectations regarding financial support).

Caregivers of children undergoing naxitamab treatment for NB encounter diverse psychological challenges throughout different stages. It is crucial for clinical medical professionals to provide tailored psychological support to both children and their families during various stages of treatment.

The XXX Hospital has initiated the clinical utilization of naxitamab (hu3F8) for the treatment of NB, a condition associated with a high mortality rate.

Family caregivers of children with NB reported three primary themes and 11 subthemes regarding their psychological experiences during the treatment.

During the pretreatment phase, participants articulated the challenges associated with diagnosis, as well as the uncertainties and emotional distress that ensued following a diagnosis.

During the course of treatment, they articulated their concerns and anxieties regarding the therapeutic process, substantial financial burden, expectations and aspirations for the treatment.

Following the completion of treatment, there were observed shifts in perspectives, re‐evaluation of expectations for offspring, anticipation of innovative therapies and consideration of societal norms.

Neuroblastoma (NB) is a prevalent malignant tumour affecting children and is the most common solid tumour in the peripheral nervous system within this age group (Nakagawara et al.2018). Currently, the treatment approach primarily encompasses a combination of surgical intervention, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Chung et al.2021). However, due to the tumour's heterogeneous biology and diverse clinical manifestations, achieving a standardized therapeutic regimen remains challenging (Wang and Li2018). Research findings suggest that relapse or refractory disease occurs in approximately 50% of high‐risk NB cases (Heczey et al.2023). Characterized by a subtle onset and frequently systemic metastases at diagnosis, NB rapidly progresses, emerging as a leading cause of mortality in children under the age of 5, with a 5‐year survival rate below 15% (Khan et al.2021). Given its insidious onset, malignant nature and grim prognosis, the absence of effective treatments presents a significant challenge, profoundly impacting affected children and their families.

Children embody the core and aspirations of a family, and when parents face sudden adversity, they often undergo psychological crises marked by anxiety, depression and severe emotional distress (Landry‐Dattée et al.2016). Despite advancements in technologies such as haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy and targeted therapy, significant challenges persist. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a consensus among multiple centres and disciplines regarding diagnosis and treatment, while concurrently conducting multicentre clinical trials aimed at enhancing the survival rate of children affected by NB (CCCG2022).

The XXX Hospital is an accredited medical institution specializing in cell and gene therapy (Qionghai Municipal People's Government Website2015). It manages nationwide cell therapy programs and conducts innovative research in domestic medications, medical devices, biotechnology and related fields. Notably, the hospital has initiated the clinical implementation of naxitamab (hu3F8), a licensed medication composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets ganglioside (GD2), particularly in the domain of rare paediatric diseases (Kushner et al.2018). Naxitamab operates by selectively binding to the GD2 antigen present on the surface of tumour cells, thereby triggering antibody‐mediated cytotoxicity and activating the complement system to efficiently eliminate malignant cells (Ahmed and Cheung2014). Considering the abundance of GD2 antigen on the surface of tumour cells, such as those found in NB, small cell lung cancer and melanoma, naxitamab presents itself as a targeted therapeutic option for these malignancies (Kushner et al.2018). The administration of naxitamab via intravenous infusion therapy is specifically targeted at children with relapsed or refractory high‐risk NB who exhibit partial remission, minor remission or stable disease. This treatment approach has demonstrated promising efficacy (Markham2021).

Due to the concealment and significant heterogeneity of NB, it greatly increases the difficulty of diagnosis. Currently, the diagnosis of NB in China is based on pathological diagnosis (CCCG2022). Typically, the diagnostic process for NB in China is divided into two stages. For children with initial examination results that are negative, it is recommended that parents return to the initial diagnosis department. Based on the child's actual condition, further diagnosis, treatment and follow‐up should be conducted. On the other hand, if one or more test results are positive, it is advised to refer the child to a paediatric oncology specialist for further examination to confirm or rule out NB. Once NB has been ruled out, oncologists should proceed with diagnosing other potential malignant diseases or confirm the absence of malignancy (Ma et al.2018).

Family caregivers play an indispensable and pivotal role in ensuring the well‐being of children, as their emotional state directly impacts the quality of care provided (Hensler et al.2013). Currently, there is a scarcity of research examining the psychological experiences of caregivers of children with NB, both before and after treatment, in China. While there has been significant research on caregiver well‐being in paediatric oncology (Bakula et al.2019; Kearney et al.2015; Pai and Kazak2006), many of these studies were conducted in the United States, where access to clinical trials and medical care differs significantly. Regional cultural influences lead to variations in the care experiences of family caregivers for children with cancer. With the profound influence of the family concept in China, the sense of familial duty often subjects these caregivers to physical, psychological and social pressures. Currently, the ‘people‐oriented’ concept of humanistic care (Yang et al.2021), ‘decision‐making sharing’ and ‘responsible care ethics’ (He et al.2022) have been advocated in the family psychosocial support for children with cancer in China. In each stage of treatment for children with NB, it is essential to have a deeper understanding of caregiver needs to provide multidimensional and comprehensive support, encompassing physiological, psychological, educational and other aspects. Therefore, it is essential to provide a comprehensive description of the typical processes involved in diagnosis and treatment in China, as well as the standard psychosocial support offered to caregivers of children with NB in that context. In addition, it is necessary for medical professionals to understand the emotional journey of these caregivers throughout various stages of treatment and provide standard psychosocial support and care. Accordingly, this study aims to explore the psychological experiences of caregivers who are providing care for NB children undergoing naxitamab treatment in China during various stages of treatment. This will provide insights for developing appropriate psychological support strategies.

All children undergoing treatment with naxitamab require a minimum of four and a maximum of 10 courses, each lasting approximately 5 to 10 days. The treatment regimen involving naxitamab is divided into three distinct phases: the pretreatment phase (prior to initiating naxitamab therapy), the midtreatment phase (during the administration of naxitamab) and the posttreatment phase (following the completion of the naxitamab course). We initially developed an interview outline tailored to the various stages of treatment. This interview outline was based on domestic and international literature (Kim et al.2022; Mattisson et al.2019; Li et al.2023) and refined through collaborative consultation with experts in paediatric oncology from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University, who assisted in developing the interview framework. Initially, three caregivers responsible for children with NB were selected for preliminary interviews, which were subsequently refined to establish the final version. The primary interview outline is presented in Table1.

A purposive sampling method was employed to select caregivers of children with NB who received naxitamab treatment at a specialized medical institution in China between January and October 2023 as the research subjects. Inclusion criteria included caregivers whose children met the diagnostic criteria for NB disease (Brodeur et al.1993), were immediate family members responsible for primary caregiving, capable of accurately expressing their caregiving experience and voluntarily participated in this study. The sample size was determined by data saturation, at which point no new themes emerged. This study has been approved by the hospital ethics committee (Approval No. XXX), and informed consent forms were signed by all research participants.

The research objectives, interview content and confidentiality principles were explained to the participants. Before the interview, the researcher and participant mutually agreed on a convenient time and location, ensuring a quiet and uninterrupted environment, whether in the ward or an interview room. Face‐to‐face interviews were conducted while the entire process was recorded using an audio device, with the interviewer listening attentively. Simultaneously, the researcher documented the participant's responses, observed emotional fluctuations and maintained accurate records. Each interview session adhered to a time limit of 30 to 40 min.

During the interview, parents were encouraged to provide comprehensive descriptions of their emotions, experiences and thoughts to gather rich and nuanced qualitative data. Subsequently, the recorded data was transcribed into text within 24 h by the interviewer. The Colaizzi seven‐step analysis method was utilized for data analysis (Colaizzi1978). The coding process was conducted as follows: (1) Preliminary transcription and organization. The process involved transcribing the interview recordings into written text, followed by an initial organization phase aimed at eliminating irrelevant information. This ensured that detailed descriptions and parents' emotional responses regarding each stage of the treatment were preserved. (2) Open coding. Following the organization of the written materials, open coding was performed to identify key terms, phrases and sentences pertinent to the child's treatment process, thereby establishing an initial code library. (3) Axial coding. In an open coding approach, similar codes were aggregated to create higher‐level themes. These themes encapsulate the shared emotions and experiences of parents at various stages of treatment. (4) Selective coding. Building upon the axial coding, this process further distilled the most representative themes that emerged as the core findings of the study. These themes encapsulated and reflected the primary psychological changes experienced by parents throughout the treatment process.

Two members of the research team, one, a graduate student, and the other, a nurse with over 10 years of clinical experience, meticulously reviewed the materials. They conducted an in‐depth analysis of the interview content and identified recurring themes, extracting relevant issues concerning NB patients one by one. In cases of disagreement, a third member of the research team facilitated discussion to finalize the results. Finally, we presented the interview materials and findings to the caregivers, who unanimously affirmed that our results accurately reflected their intended expressions.

A total of 14 parents of children with NB were interviewed in this study. In total, there were 29 caregivers of children treated with naxitamab at this hospital, consisting of 23 females and 6 males; 25 with a university degree and 4 without; 22 who were employed and 7 who were not; 20 high‐income earners and 9 low‐income earners. Of the 14 caregivers involved in this study, 11 were female (78.6%), and 3 were male (21.4%); 12 held a university degree (85.7%), while 2 did not (14.3%); 10 were employed (71.4%), and 4 were not (28.6%); 10 were high‐income earners (71.4%), and 4 were low‐income earners (28.6%). The distribution of gender, education, occupation and annual household income of our sample was consistent with the population treated with naxitamab at this hospital. However, due to a high level of educational attainment and income, the sample may not be fully representative of the larger Chinese population. Sequentially, labelled as P1 to P14 to ensure interviewee privacy, the characteristics of both the children and their caregivers are presented in Tables2and3.

The psychological experiences of caregivers of children undergoing naxitamab treatment were synthesized, leading to the identification of three overarching themes and 11 subthemes.

The diagnostic journey for NB is fraught with difficulties due to its insidious onset and diverse clinical manifestations. During interviews, more than half of the parents recounted their children experiencing recurrent fevers in the early stages, which were challenging to detect and often led to misdiagnosis. Seeking clarity in diagnosis, they embarked on prolonged journeys to major hospitals, resulting in delays in NB diagnosis and treatment. For instance, P1 expressed, ‘Initially, our child exhibited fever symptoms, leading us to believe it was a common respiratory infection. However, the fevers persisted and were repeatedly misdiagnosed’. Similarly, P3 shared, ‘Intermittent fever symptoms were treated with antibiotics, each time presumed to be a respiratory infection’. P4 recalled, ‘Initially, our child experienced leg pain and lameness, accompanied by mild fever during hospitalization. After discharge, symptoms of diarrhea and recurrent fever emerged, prompting further investigation. We hope to get a definitive diagnosis’. P5 noted, ‘Despite the absence of symptoms, noticeable discoloration on the face and lips indicated an underlying health issue’.

Upon learning of their child's NB diagnosis, parents expressed profound shock and a reluctance to accept the reality. Unfamiliar with the disease, they found it challenging to comprehend and were deeply shaken by the rapid progression and classification as a high‐risk type, which dealt a heavy blow to the entire family. P4 lamented, ‘I was completely unfamiliar with this disease, and hearing the diagnosis was incredibly distressing. I couldn't contain my tears. Why us? How could our young child be afflicted with such an illness’? Similarly, P2 recalled, ‘The diagnosis came as a complete shock since we had never encountered this disease before. As parents, we were utterly devastated during those initial days’. P1 reflected, ‘The doctor's confirmation of a stage 4 high‐risk diagnosis left me feeling utterly despondent. It was a devastating blow’. P7 added, ‘The news left me in a state of profound depression, particularly upon learning about the low cure rate from the doctor. I never imagined my child would face such a dire prognosis’. P9 revealed, ‘I was on the verge of collapse. From the moment of diagnosis until now, life has been incredibly challenging. This disease was completely unfamiliar to me’.

In their quest for medical treatment for their children, parents exhibited unwavering determination and explored various avenues to acquire information and seek treatment options related to NB. Despite encountering limitations in access and information, they remained steadfast in their pursuit of any glimmer of hope. P6 recounted, ‘Following the diagnosis, I turned to the internet to gather information about patients with similar conditions. Despite warnings against relying on Baidu for medical advice, we sought to understand the disease better. It wasn't until around the fifth treatment session post‐surgery that we encountered another parent who informed us about the 3F8 treatment, which came with favorable policies’. P1 shared, ‘Initially unaware of this disease. In order to understand this disease as soon as possible, I extensively researched the disease to explore potential treatment methods. I just want to find a way to cure my child, even if there's some hope’. P8 confessed, ‘Lucky we didn't give up. I had little understanding of immunity until our fifth chemotherapy session in Beijing’.

Parents of children undergoing naxitamab treatment expressed apprehensions due to their limited understanding of the new medication. They harboured worries about potential side effects, the likelihood of harm to their children, the efficacy of the treatment and concerns about the possible exacerbation of their child's condition. P6 admitted, ‘I felt genuinely anxious during the initial administration of the medication. Hearing accounts from other patients, some of whom experienced severe reactions, intensified my concerns’. P7 shared, ‘Initially, I harbored some apprehension, having not yet experienced the treatment firsthand. Later, I heard about severe reactions in some children, which heightened my fears, even necessitating rescue measures’. P10 pondered, ‘I grappled with uncertainty regarding the medication's effectiveness and its impact on my child's well‐being. Would the desired results manifest? Such uncertainties plagued my thoughts’. P12 reflected, ‘I felt burdened by uncertainty regarding my child's response to treatment and its potential repercussions. Given my child's unfavorable reaction, I feared that a lack of substantial response might compromise treatment efficacy. Conversely, I worried that severe reactions would overwhelm him’.

In families facing malignant tumours, the parents' suffering was exacerbated by the significant financial burden. Many parents interviewed reported having to borrow money and mortgage assets, such as their houses and vehicles, to cover the high costs of their children's treatment. P4 recounted, ‘Following our child's diagnosis, we resorted to selling our cars and houses, while our business continued to operate’. Similarly, P6 lamented, ‘Considering our limited financial resources, we borrowed 100,000 RMB from the company, mortgaged our house, and also sold our car’. P8 disclosed, ‘We find ourselves heavily indebted, with both my husband and I resorting to borrowing money’. P10 shared, ‘My income proved insufficient, leading me to sell my house. Financial strain is currently our greatest challenge’.

Amidst the anguish of witnessing their children endure the physical and emotional toll of illness, surgery and chemotherapy, some parents found solace in the prospect of better treatments. Learning about new medications available in China ignited a spark of hope within them. The introduction of new medications in China has sparked hope among parents. Many have expressed gratitude for the benefits derived from the 3F8 treatment and hold high expectations for subsequent interventions. P1 expressed, ‘Prior to our arrival here, the possibility seemed unimaginable. It has truly been a revelation for us. Seeking treatment here feels like the best option for our children. We believe that their chances of recovery have significantly improved. The hospital has provided us with newfound hope, offering access to the latest medications. Witnessing my child's gradual recovery after taking this medication fills me with hope for their future’. P10 shared, ‘Compared to 1418, the administration of 3F8 is relatively shorter and more convenient. Initially apprehensive about potential adverse reactions, my worries eased after witnessing manageable responses following the initial treatment. Despite initial reservations, I am now convinced of the worthiness of our journey here. It feels as though fate has guided us to this point, offering salvation for our child’. P5 reflected, ‘When faced with the choice between 3F8 and 1418, the shorter treatment duration of 3F8 influenced my decision. Fortunately, our experience with 3F8 treatment has been positive, with subsequent examinations indicating effective eradication of residual disease. I am deeply grateful for the benefits of 3F8 medication. We owe immense gratitude to the developers of 3F8 for its substantial benefits to our children’. P6 explained, ‘The cost was an important part of why I chose the 3F8 treatment. Now that the immune therapy and radiotherapy are done, we're feeling hopeful and excited about life after treatment’.

During the interviews, several parents expressed a deep sense of belonging and trust in the medical staff, attributing this to the supportive therapeutic environment and the diligent care provided by the medical team. P1 remarked, ‘Since our child began treatment here, her spirits have noticeably lifted. It's safe to say that this has been the happiest period for her in the nearly two years of treatment’. P2 shared, ‘Upon my arrival, many of my anxieties dissipated. The doctors and nurses exude warmth and approachability. Language barriers are effortlessly overcome, and they readily address our queries, instilling confidence in us. In particular, parents are allowed to stay with their children and access medical assistance whenever needed’. P4 observed, ‘The nurses and doctors here are incredibly kind‐hearted, dispelling any notion of a cold hospital environment’. P10 expressed, ‘Every member of the medical staff feels like family. At times, their care even surpasses my own maternal instincts’. P12 added, ‘I feel more at ease here, thanks to the patient and thorough responses provided by all of you’.

A child's serious illness imposes a significant emotional toll on parents. Initially, those interviewed had difficulty accepting the diagnosis, but overcame this by gradually learning to cope with the numerous challenges of caring for their children. They adopted a more serene approach, focusing on living in the present moment. P10 reflected, ‘As we gain more experience, acceptance becomes less arduous. Our family now embraces the idea of preparing for the worst while striving to cherish each day. Maintaining a positive outlook helps us navigate through life's ups and downs’. P2 admitted, ‘Initially, I couldn't fathom the idea of a potential relapse, but I've come to terms with it. We've heard advice from foreign experts suggesting we view this disease as a chronic illness. Accepting this reality has brought some solace’. P9 shared, ‘Initially, worry consumed me, affecting my appetite, but as I took on the role of caregiver, I gradually learned to find moments of respite. I've come to realize the importance of self‐care. Only by prioritizing my well‐being can I muster the energy needed to care for my child’. P7 emphasized, ‘Knowing our child's condition, we cherish each day spent together as if it were our last. Adopting this mindset helps us maintain stability amidst future challenges, fostering a sense of equilibrium’.

Upon accepting their children's NB diagnosis, parents underwent a profound re‐evaluation of life's priorities and adjusted their expectations accordingly. For most, their utmost desire is for their children to lead healthy and secure lives. P5 explained, ‘Since our child fell ill, our expectations for him have become more modest. Now, as long as he remains alive, healthy, and content, we consider it a blessing. Previously, academic achievements were of greater importance, but now, as long as he possesses basic literacy skills and gains some knowledge, we're satisfied’. P6 echoed similar sentiments, stating, ‘All I wish for is his continued health and freedom from relapse. I harbor no other ambitions’. P9 emphasized, ‘Our sole concern is his well‐being. Initially, our only wish was for his survival. While he may not excel academically or physically compared to others, it holds little significance in the grand scheme of things’. P12 concurred, asserting, ‘As long as he experiences a healthy and joyful upbringing, academic or entrepreneurial achievements are irrelevant’.

Given the scarcity of reports on the cure rates and efficacy of new medications in China, parents express a pressing need for more clinical trials to validate their effectiveness. During interviews, when discussing their apprehensions about using novel medications on their children, most parents conveyed a sense of readiness to explore these options. Their paramount concern was providing their children with a chance to survive and extend their lives, fostering anticipation for the development of improved pharmaceuticals. P1 articulated, ‘Beyond the efforts of doctors and nurses, I'm aware of pharmaceutical companies and researchers tirelessly developing newer medications. Their relentless pursuit offers hope for more treatment modalities. I yearn for additional avenues to aid in these children's treatment and foster sustained remission. Swift deployment of newer medications is imperative’. Similarly, P5 expressed, ‘I eagerly await the discovery of a miracle medication to prevent relapses. The sooner it's researched and made available, the better’. P9 voiced, ‘I yearn for the emergence of new medications and vaccines that can extend his period of being illness‐free by several years. We are eager to explore alternative treatments’.

Parents often experience significant financial strain when supporting their children through illness. Hampered by limited access to resources and varying local policies, some parents have expressed a desire for financial assistance from multiple sources. P8 lamented, ‘We urgently require support, yet the application process poses significant challenges. Our lives are isolated, and we lack access to online resources or practical solutions. Although charity organizations provide reimbursement, my husband's applications are still pending. Our local policies are strict, denying us the financial aid we desperately need. It's extremely disheartening. My husband is overwhelmed by the bureaucratic obstacles’. P6 underscored, ‘My immediate concern is securing financial assistance’. P7 added, ‘Before returning home, I urged my husband to explore avenues with organizations like the Red Cross to seek potential assistance’.

This study underscored the varied psychological journeys undertaken by caregivers of children with NB at different stages of treatment. In the pretreatment phase, caregivers struggled with a lack of understanding of the disease and the emotional upheaval resulting from the challenge of identifying symptoms during diagnosis, consistent with the findings of Schwartz‐Attias et al. (2023). All 14 caregivers interviewed initially harboured doubts and resistance towards the disease, consistent with the results reported by Li et al. (2023). NB not only causes varying degrees of psychological trauma to the affected children and their families but also easily triggers post‐traumatic stress disorder, thereby inducing a psychological crisis that threatens the mental health of both the children and their family members (Mattisson et al.2019). Research indicates that following a child's cancer diagnosis, parents often express a longing for hope and emphasize the difficulty of maintaining hope during such challenging times (Zelcer et al.2010). The parents in this study demonstrated a persistent hope and determination, continuing to seek treatment for their children and refusing to surrender to any possibility of defeat. In the middle stage of treatment, as their children were administered new medication, caregivers found solace in the promise of these treatments but also grappled with worries, fears and ambivalence. Some caregivers expressed optimism about the prospect of new medications, offering renewed hope for their children's survival. Yet, they also faced the dual burden of financial and psychological strains, compounded by the pain of surgeries and chemotherapy. These challenges are consistent with the findings of various studies (Haileselassie et al.2019; Nemati et al.2018), highlighting the significant stress experienced by parents during prolonged and costly treatments. In the posttreatment phase, following enduring care and various hardships, caregivers experienced a gradual shift in perspective. They began to reassess their expectations for their children, recognizing the fundamental aspects of life's meaning and learning to cherish the present. Many caregivers not only altered their mindset but also gained clarity on their priorities, aligning with findings from Wu et al. (2018). It is crucial that children diagnosed with cancer, along with their parents, receive early and ongoing assessments of their mental health needs. Facilitating access to appropriate interventions for both parents and child patients is essential to optimize the well‐being of the parent, child and family unit (Kearney et al.2015). Consequently, healthcare professionals should attentively monitor the psychological changes and challenges faced by caregivers at each treatment stage, offering tailored support and guidance to help families navigate this arduous journey.

The psychological dynamics of caregivers undergo changes throughout the entire course of their child's illness, warranting attention from clinical medical staff towards their reactions and characteristics at different treatment stages. In interviews, 14 caregivers from various parts of the country initially expressed unfamiliarity with the treatment prospects of the hospital. There was a high demand for diverse information, particularly acute during the early diagnosis phase, due to constraints and difficulties in obtaining necessary information effectively, aligning with Deribe et al.'s (2023) findings. Moreover, studies have indicated that caregivers of children with cancer from distant areas face greater risks and challenges compared to local caregivers. Particularly, during the initial stages of diagnosis, these caregivers experience sudden psychological impacts and a reliance on external support. They must utilize personal resources to identify professional medical institutions through various channels and seek medical opportunities for their children (Long and Marsland2011). Therefore, it is essential for the pertinent governmental agencies to partner with diverse medical institutions to leverage the internet in creating a consultation platform for children with NB, such as ‘NB Care Group’ or ‘NB Care Home’. This initiative is designed to promote the exchange of platforms and information, ensuring timely updates on advancements in medication treatments.

Families with cancer patients should be provided with psychoeducation, information and anticipatory guidance related to disease, treatment, acute and long‐term effects, hospitalization, procedures and psychosocial adaptation (Thompson and Young‐Saleme2015). Moreover, due to the subtle onset and varied clinical presentations of NB, which lack specific characteristics, clinical healthcare providers, especially those in primary medical settings, must improve their diagnostic skills and understanding of the disease. Early identification and referral of children with suspected NB are crucial to prevent diagnostic delays and to provide affected families with timely decision‐making options (NICE2023). Furthermore, community health departments should strengthen awareness campaigns for families, employing platforms like WeChat groups, brochures and public accounts to disseminate information and improve public understanding of NB.

The study revealed that most caregivers exhibited a positive psychological state following treatment, indicating their gradual growth amidst the challenges of caring for ill children. They gradually accepted the children's illness while maintaining hope for potential treatments. Some experts suggest that this positive mindset can build an immune mechanism, counteracting negative emotions and enhancing stress resilience, a finding supported by some scholars (Schwartz‐Attias et al.2023; Madan et al.2019). Consequently, medical staff should monitor caregivers' psychological shifts following treatment. Encouragement should be given to those exhibiting positive changes to maintain their optimistic outlook and improve psychological adaptability. Understanding the underlying reasons is crucial for caregivers who continue to grapple with negative emotions. Professional training, respectful communication and collaboration among medical and psychosocial providers, patients and families, as well as access to and the sharing of relevant reports between healthcare providers, are key to the successful delivery of quality psychosocial services (Jones et al.2018). Tailored measures should be devised to address these root causes, with collaboration among hospitals, families and society being essential. Continuous support, timely information provision and gradual nurturing of a positive mindset are essential for caregivers to maintain good care of the children, promoting their recovery, prognosis and overall quality of life.

Effective social support can alleviate the psychological strain experienced by children and their families (Adelman et al.2014). Achieving this goal requires concerted efforts from relevant authorities and society at large. Primarily, raising public awareness about NB in children and combating societal discrimination against families affected by NB is paramount. Emphasizing the significance of early detection and treatment in improving cure rates and facilitating early screening for affected children lays the groundwork. Secondly, governmental entities should prioritize support for this vulnerable group, aiding families in accessing various forms of financial assistance and social welfare. As social workers encounter most newly diagnosed children and their families, conducting a psychosocial assessment that considers pre‐existing financial burdens alongside the known hardships of cancer treatment provides a reasonably comprehensive overview of the families' financial needs throughout the cancer journey (Jones et al.2018). Caregivers participating in this study came from various regions. Typically, caring for a child with cancer often necessitates time spent in the hospital away from home and work, emphasizing the significant need for support due to limited resources. Nevertheless, the current insurance system in China predominantly links insurance coverage to household registration and occupation, providing limited options and services (Huang and Liu2018). This underscores the importance of adjusting policies for relevant departments, increasing the proportion of medical insurance coverage and alleviating the financial burden on families with children. Additionally, caregivers have expressed a pressing need for advancements in new medication research and development, indicating a continuous need for ongoing clinical trials and research efforts. It is crucial for the medical system to allocate more resources to scientific research to accelerate key breakthroughs in this field. This includes enhancing the survival rates of children with NB, reducing recurrence rates and ultimately saving more lives. Lastly, enhancing societal support for families affected by NB requires recognizing the significance of compassionate care and professional assistance from medical personnel.

A limitation of this study is its exclusive focus on caregivers of NB children undergoing naxitamab treatment at a professional medical institution in China, not covering other countries. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to other regions. Additionally, the study employed a retrospective recall method, which required caregivers to recollect their past experiences, some of which occurred many years ago. This could introduce potential recall bias. Consequently, it is essential to conduct prospective studies in future research. This study found that 85.7% of the respondents held a bachelor's degree or higher. While it offers valuable insights, further exploration is needed to include caregivers from various educational backgrounds. Such research could extend the scope of interviews and expand the participant pool to encompass a broader geographical area and demographic characteristics, thereby yielding more comprehensive and consistent results.

Caregivers of children diagnosed with NB face a range of psychological challenges throughout various stages of treatment. It is essential for healthcare professionals to prioritize the identification of caregivers' psychological changes and needs at each stage, thereby providing tailored support and interventions as appropriate. Moreover, all sectors of society should increase their attention to these vulnerable groups and extend care and support to them.
