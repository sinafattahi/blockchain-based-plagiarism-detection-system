The combination of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has become a widely used approach for resuscitating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiac arrest (CA). Nonetheless, limited research has focused on predicting in-hospital mortality in affected patients. This study aims to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality and develop a clinical prediction model for these patients.

Clinical presentations of AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO at two hospitals in Zhengzhou were evaluated. Patients were stratified based on their survival status at discharge. A comprehensive analysis, which included univariate logistic regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate logistic regression, was conducted to identify predictors and develop a nomogram for in-hospital mortality. The nomogram's predictive performance was subsequently compared to that of existing models.

The study included 139 patients, of whom 84 died during hospitalization. Using factors such as age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, lactic acid levels, and serum creatinine, a nomogram model was developed. The model demonstrated good predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.826 (95% CI 0.757–0.894) in the training dataset and 0.783 (95% CI 0.706–0.859) in the internal validation dataset, indicating high accuracy and stability. Clinical decision curve analysis confirmed the model’s utility, particularly for risk thresholds above 20%, outperforming existing models.

This study identified independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO and developed a clinically applicable prediction model.

Cardiovascular disease continues to be the primary cause of death around the world. In 2021, it accounted for approximately 19.91 million deaths globally, representing a 21.56% increase since 2010 [1]. Characterized by symptoms like chest pain, tightness, and palpitations, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the primary cause of mortality in cardiovascular diseases, with severe cases potentially leading to cardiac arrest (CA). AMI patients with CA are at a significantly increased risk of mortality during their hospital stay compared to those without CA [2,3]. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become a highly effective therapeutic approach for managing AMI [4,5]. The treatment of AMI patients with CA typically involves cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) followed by PCI. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a type of mechanical support that can temporarily take over the heart's pumping function and facilitate effective respiration. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing mortality among AMI patients with CA who do not respond to conventional CPR, although overall mortality remains high [6–8]. Currently, few widely recognized domestic or international tools exist for risk prediction and benefit assessment in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO. Three relevant risk prediction models have been developed: the SAVE score [9], ENCOURAGE score [10], and AMI-ECMO score [11]. However, these models are limited by significant heterogeneity in study populations, incomplete variable selection, and complex calculations, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy across different patient groups. Among the existing models, the SAVE model was developed for patients with cardiogenic shock (CS), excluding those who underwent extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), and is considered complex. The ENCOURAGE model does not incorporate angiographic data, such as the location of the culprit vessel. Additionally, the AMI-ECMO model does not consider lactate levels, hemodynamic indices, and other relevant parameters across the entire study cohort. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a predictive model for in-hospital mortality in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO. The motivation for conducting this study was to identify predictive factors for in-hospital mortality in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO and to develop a nomogram model. The model is designed to help clinicians rapidly identify high-risk patients during VA-ECMO application, thereby avoiding long-term ineffective treatment with VA-ECMO for patients with extremely poor prognoses.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted on AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Zhengzhou Central Hospital between January 2019 and June 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for AMI [12]; (2) patients who experience in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) undergoing ECPR; and (3) patients who underwent PCI supported by VA-ECMO during hospitalization. The following were grounds for exclusion: (1) incomplete case data and (2) patients with irreversible brain death or multiple organ failure. The final study cohort comprised 139 AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO. Figure1presents a flowchart outlining the case selection and study process.

The following data were retrospectively gathered from the hospital's electronic medical records, encompassing variables like age, gender, body mass index, medical history, lab results, and angiographic findings. All variables were recorded to capture the most adverse values within a 6-h window prior to initiating VA-ECMO, except for the culprit vessel, the number of vascular lesions, and the post-procedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade. Three previously validated mortality prediction models for patients undergoing VA-ECMO, namely the SAVE score, ENCOURAGE score, and AMI-ECMO score, were calculated and used to assess their predictive efficacy compared with the nomogram model developed in this study. The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality.

ECPR is the rapid application of VA-ECMO to provide circulatory support in CA patients who are unable to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following CPR. The management of ECPR in the study was performed by members of the center's VA-ECMO team. The VA-ECMO team assessed the indications for ECPR and communicated with the patient's family about the treatment plan, as well as performing VA-ECMO pre-boarding preparations. After 10 min of continuous, high-quality CPR without ROSC, ECPR was initiated after the family signed an informed consent form. The VA-ECMO system comprises several key components, including a centrifugal pump, an oxygenator, and a heparin-coated catheter (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany). For all patients, arterial catheters of 15–17 French gauge and venous catheters of 19–21 French gauge were employed. These catheters were inserted via the femoral artery and femoral vein, respectively, with the side branches of the arterial catheters typically retained to maintain blood supply to the lower extremities on the catheterized side. The initial flow rate of VA-ECMO was established at 4.0–5.0 L/min. Heparin anticoagulation was administered based on coagulation test results throughout the duration of VA-ECMO support. Concurrently, the flow rate was adjusted as necessary in response to the patient's oxygen saturation levels and hemodynamic status.

Establishment of VA-ECMO: all patients received treatment using the VA-ECMO mode. The VA-ECMO team members placed cannulas to establish femoral artery and vein routes under sterile conditions.

Criteria for VA-ECMO initiation: in accordance with institutional experience, if a patient experiences IHCA, VA-ECMO should be initiated immediately when CPR has been performed for 10 min without ROSC.

Criteria for VA-ECMO withdrawal: in accordance with established guidelines and institutional experience, pre-withdrawal consideration from VA-ECMO can be made when the following criteria are met: (1) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 25%, left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (LVOT VTI) > 0.12 m/s, and tissue Doppler lateral mitral annulus peak systolic velocity ≥ 6 cm/s; and (2) VA-ECMO flow is sustained at 2–2.5 L/min while administering one to two low-dose positive inotropic and vasoconstrictive agents. At an VA-ECMO flow rate of 2 to 2.5 L/min, the following physiological parameters should be achieved: a pulse pressure difference > 10 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg, and a central venous oxygen saturation ≥ 65% or mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥ 60% [13,14]. Following pre-withdrawal from VA-ECMO, formal withdrawal may be considered once the patient's parameters have stabilized for 6 h.

Continuous variables are reported as median (interquartile range) or mean ± standard deviation, while categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparisons of medians, the Student's t-test for comparisons of means, and the Chi-square test for assessing differences in categorical variables between groups. The sample size for logistic regression analysis is determined using the EPV (events per variable) method, and it is generally recommended that the EPV be at least 10 [15]. In this study, there are five covariates in the logistic regression, and 126 samples are needed by calculating the sample size according to the EPV. Therefore, the number of participants included in the logistic regression (n= 139) is sufficient. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each variable in the logistic regression analysis were determined. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.1).

To reduce the dimensionality of the findings and identify the most significant risk factor predictors, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method [16] was used to select variables with ap-value under 0.1 from the univariate logistic regression analysis. The feature variables with nonzero coefficients from the LASSO model were then used to identify the final predictive variables (age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, lactic acid, and serum creatinine) and develop a predictive model through multivariable logistic regression analysis [17,18]. The predictive model was visualized using a nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [19] and the calibration curve [20] were employed to evaluate the nomogram's predictive accuracy and discriminatory ability. Moreover, the nomogram's clinical utility was evaluated through decision curve analysis (DCA) [21]. Bootstrapping with 500 iterations was used for internal validation. The nomogram's predictive performance was assessed in comparison with the SAVE score, ENCOURAGE score, and AMI-ECMO score. A two-tailedp-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Among the 139 AMI patients with CA who underwent PCI supported by VA-ECMO, 84 (60.4%) did not survive the hospital stay, while 55 (39.6%) survived. Table1summarizes the baseline characteristics of the patients. Compared to survivors, non-survivors tended to be older and had a higher incidence of current smoking, as well as elevated levels of serum creatinine, PCO2, lactic acid, international normalized ratio, ENCOURAGE score, and AMI-ECMO score. In contrast, they exhibited lower levels of HCO3-, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and SAVE score. Besides, significant differences were observed in the distribution of culprit vessels and the number of vascular lesions between the survivor and non-survivor groups (p< 0.05).

Univariate logistic regression analysis identified eight variables as statistically significant (p< 0.05), as shown in Table2. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, ap-value threshold of 0.1 was applied, leading to the selection of 13 variables for further evaluation. LASSO regression analysis was then performed, identifying six key predictors: age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, number of vascular lesions, lactic acid, and serum creatinine (Fig.2). These six predictors were then analyzed using multivariable logistic regression with forward and backward stepwise regression, ultimately identifying five independent predictors for the final predictive model, as shown in Table3. A covariance diagnostic was performed on the logistic regression results to evaluate potential multicollinearity. The variance inflation factor (VIF) for each predictor was found to be below 2, indicating no multicollinearity (Table3).

A nomogram was used to visualize the predictive model (Fig.3A). The model demonstrated strong discriminatory ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.826 (95% CI 0.757–0.894) and an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI 0.706–0.859) under 500 bootstrap internal validations (Fig.3B and C). Using the Youden index, we determined the best cutoff value to be 0.604, which resulted in a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 76.4% (Fig.3B). The Hosmer–Lemeshow test (χ2= 4.973,p= 0.761) demonstrated a strong match between predicted and actual probabilities, validating the model's calibration. Furthermore, the bias-corrected curves in the calibration plots closely aligned with the diagonal line under 500 bootstrap validations, further supporting adequate calibration (Fig.3D). Decision curve analysis indicated that the model provides clinical benefit when the predicted risk of in-hospital mortality exceeds 20% (Fig.3E).

Compared to the SAVE, ENCOURAGE, and AMI-ECMO scores, our nomogram demonstrated superior discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility within this study population. Analysis of the ROC curves revealed the following AUC values: nomogram, 0.826 (95% CI 0.757–0.894); SAVE score, 0.693 (95% CI 0.607–0.779); ENCOURAGE score, 0.649 (95% CI 0.555–0.744); and AMI-ECMO score, 0.626 (95% CI 0.531–0.720) (Fig.4A). The DeLong test [19] showed that pairwise comparisons of the ROC curves between the nomogram and each of the three model scores were statistically significant (p< 0.05) (Table S1). According to the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, thep-values for the nomogram, SAVE score, ENCOURAGE score, and AMI-ECMO score were 0.761, 0.174, 0.167, and 0.648, respectively, suggesting a good fit for all four predictive models (p> 0.05) (Table S2). The Brier scores for the nomogram, SAVE score, ENCOURAGE score, and AMI-ECMO score were 0.167 (95% CI 0.134–0.200), 0.211 (95% CI 0.185–0.238), 0.218 (95% CI 0.191–0.244), and 0.227 (95% CI 0.204–0.250), respectively. The nomogram exhibited the lowest Brier score, indicating superior predictive accuracy compared to the other three model scores (Fig.4B and Table S2). The DCA results demonstrated that the net benefit of using the nomogram to predict patient survival probability surpassed that of the SAVE score, ENCOURAGE score, and AMI-ECMO score when the threshold probability exceeded 20% (Fig.4C).

Herein, several factors were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality among AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO. These factors, including age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, lactic acid, and serum creatinine, were used to develop a nomogram. Importantly, our nomogram demonstrated good discriminatory ability for predicting in-hospital mortality and outperformed established predictive models in accuracy. The model is designed to help clinicians rapidly identify high-risk patients during VA-ECMO application, thereby avoiding long-term ineffective treatment with VA-ECMO for patients with extremely poor prognoses. This approach can reduce the consumption of medical resources, minimize patient suffering caused by treatment-related complications, and alleviate the financial burden on patients'families.

In recent years, VA-ECMO has become a common tool for resuscitating AMI patients with CA, demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing mortality rates within this population [6–8]. While VA-ECMO offers potential benefits, it remains an expensive and high-risk intervention, with a considerable likelihood that patients undergoing this treatment may ultimately face a fatal outcome, leading to significant losses for patients and their families [22]. As a result, the decision to initiate and continue VA-ECMO should be made by experts after a thorough risk–benefit assessment. Several studies have previously identified independent predictors of in-hospital mortality among AMI patients receiving VA-ECMO support [23–30]. In the current study, independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified as age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, lactic acid, and serum creatinine. These findings support previous research on poor patient prognosis. Moreover, three representative predictive models for forecasting in-hospital mortality in AMI patients supported by VA-ECMO have been developed in prior studies: the SAVE score [9], ENCOURAGE score [10], and AMI-ECMO score [11]. Nonetheless, the practical application of these prediction models in AMI patients is limited by several factors. The SAVE model was initially developed for CS patients, excluding ECPR, and is therefore not directly applicable to the patient population in this study. Additionally, its complexity further limits its utility in emergency settings. The ENCOURAGE model, designed for AMI patients undergoing VA-ECMO support, does not incorporate angiographic data, such as the location of the culprit vessel, which is crucial for therapeutic decision-making in AMI. Furthermore, some study populations within this model exhibit low lactate levels and mild AMI severity, which may compromise its predictive accuracy for AMI patients with CA. Meanwhile, the AMI-ECMO model does not consider lactate levels, hemodynamic indices, and other relevant parameters across the entire study cohort. The exclusion of data from several key studies further limits the model's ability to accurately predict outcomes for a diverse range of AMI patients. As a result, we developed and analyzed a predictive model specifically designed to forecast in-hospital mortality in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO. A comparative analysis with the SAVE, ENCOURAGE, and AMI-ECMO models demonstrated that the prediction model developed in this study exhibited superior discriminative ability and clinical utility for in-hospital mortality in this patient population.

Nonetheless, the present study has several limitations. Firstly, it was a multicenter retrospective study, and only internal validation of the predictive model was performed, with no external validation. A multicenter prospective study with external validation should be conducted to ascertain our results. Secondly, due to a high number of missing no-flow time (collapse to CPR initiation), low-flow time (CPR duration before VA-ECMO cannulation), initial rhythm, and VA-ECMO placement complication data during patient data collection, these were not included as variables. A prospective study could address this by ensuring the availability of such information for later analysis. Lastly, despite the multicenter patient selection, selection bias may still be present, limiting our results'generalizability.

Herein, various factors were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients with CA undergoing PCI supported by VA-ECMO. These factors, including age, current smoking, left main culprit vessel, lactic acid, and serum creatinine, were used to create a simple and feasible nomogram. This newly developed nomogram can assist clinicians in quickly identifying high-risk patients during VA-ECMO application, thereby avoiding long-term ineffective treatment with VA-ECMO for patients with extremely poor prognoses.
