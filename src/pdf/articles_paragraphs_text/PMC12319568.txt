Bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) is a virus of the genusAphthovirus, familyPicornaviridae. BRAV has recently attracted interest as a causative agent in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). However, only a few PCR systems, designed based on the limited genome information, are available to detect BRAV. Therefore, we aimed to construct a new reverse transcription‐PCR (RT‐PCR) system for the broad detection of BRAV and compared its sensitivity and specificity with two existing real‐time RT‐PCR systems. Initially, we designed a new primer pair targeting the highly conserved 3Dpolregion. The detection limit of RT‐PCR using the primers against strain H‐1 was 10−2TCID50/mL, and the system was able to detect gene amounts equivalent to those detectable by existing systems. Moreover, the new system could detect synthetic DNA referring to the emerging BRAV3 strain NSWL8. The new RT‐PCR system did not show cross‐reactivity against non‐BRAV BRDC‐related viruses or taxonomically related viruses. To assess the validity of the new RT‐PCR system for analysing clinical samples, nasal swabs, conjunctival swabs, and lung homogenates were collected from dairy and beef cattle in the field from 2019 to 2023 in Japan. Among the 125 clinical samples, the new RT‐PCR detected BRAV from 15 samples, a higher number than two existing real‐time RT‐PCR systems, which identified only two and six positives. In conclusion, this RT‐PCR system was demonstrated to detect currently circulating BRAVs in a highly sensitive and broad manner.

Bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) is an unenveloped, spherical, single‐stranded RNA virus of the familyPicornaviridae, genusAphthovirus(Hollister et al.2008). BRAV is taxonomically classified into BRAV1 and BRAV2. Moreover, a virus that could be classified as BRAV3 was also recently detected (Brito et al.2023). BRAV was first isolated from the nasal discharge of a calf with rhinitis in Germany in 1962 (Bögel and Bohm1962) and attracted attention as a virus causing respiratory disease. Since that discovery, BRAV was actively researched until the 1980s, with reports of its isolation in multiple countries including Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Sudan (Eisa1980, Ide and Darbyshire1969, Mohanty and Lillie1968, Persechi1974, Yamashita et al.1985). However, as BRAVs were found to have relatively low virulence, could be isolated from healthy cattle, and could cause subclinical infections in experimental infections, little research has been reported in recent decades (Ide and Darbyshire1972, Mohanty et al.1969).

However, in the 2010s, BRAV attracted renewed attention due to the development of sequencing technology which made it possible to comprehensively analyse the genes of microorganisms. This revealed that cattle affected by bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) had a higher prevalence of BRAV than healthy cattle (Ng et al.2015, Zhang et al.2019). BRDC has caused significant economic losses worldwide (Griffin1997, Sasaki et al.2022). However, even though controlling BRDC is a critical task in the livestock industry and understanding BRAV is a key factor in achieving this task, only a few PCR systems have been established. Given that BRAV is a mutation‐prone RNA virus that can recombine with itself (Rai et al.2016), the finding that field strains have genetically diversified is not surprising. In fact, recent reports indicate the presence of several mutations in the BRAV gene (Zhou et al.2023). Therefore, in this study, we designed a new primer pair to develop a new PCR system which can detect broad BRAVs by targeting the highly conserved region of the 3Dpol(Rai et al.2016). We then verified the new system's sensitivity, specificity, and ability to detect broad BRAVs in comparison with two existing real‐time RT‐PCR systems by testing the detection limit for two BRAVs, reactivity to BRDC‐related viruses and taxonomically related viruses, and detection rate of BRAV from field samples.

The viruses used in this study are listed in Table1. To determine detection limits, we used H‐1 and NSWL8 strains (Brito et al.2023, Yamashita et al.1985). H‐1 was isolated from nasal swab specimens of cattle with acute respiratory disease in Japan in 1984. The tissue‐cultured infectious dose (TCID50) of the H‐1 was determined using MDBK cells in accordance with the Reed–Muench method. NSWL8 was detected from nasal swab specimens of cattle in Australia in 2019 by metagenomic sequencing and is taxonomically distinct from H‐1 as BRAV3. For NSWL8, because the virus was unavailable, we used synthetic DNA referencing the genome deposited in GenBank (accession number:OP020173.1). The DNA sequence refers to the bases of genes 5960 to 6311, which covers the amplification area of the new primer pair. To evaluate the specificity of the new RT‐PCR system, we used the following viruses known to cause BRDC: bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) strain 758, bovine adeno virus 7 (BAdV7) strain Fukuroi, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) strain NMK7, bovine parainfluenza 3 virus (BPIV3) strain BN‐1, bovine corona virus (BCV) strain Mebus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 (BVDV1) strain Nose, bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 2 (BVDV2) strain KZ‐91CP, and influenza virus type D (IDV) strain D/bovine/Yamagata/10710/2016. Additionally, viruses belonging to the genusAphthovirus, bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV), and foot‐and‐mouth disease virus (FMDV) were also used for specificity evaluation. These included BRBV strain EC11 and FMDV strains O/JPN/2000, O/JPN/2010, O/TUR/5/2009, O/TAI/2011, A/TAI/46‐1/2015, A/IRN/1/2016, Asia1/TUR/49/2011, SAT1/KEN/117/2009, SAT2/SAU/6/2000, and SAT3/ZIM/3/83.

Note: Nucleic acid extraction was not conducted for bovine rhinitis A virus 3, since synthetic DNA served as the template for the assay.

A total of 97 nasal swabs, 6 conjunctival swabs, and 22 lung homogenates were collected from 46 dairy cattle and 79 beef cattle in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, between 2019 and 2023. The collection was irrespective of respiratory symptoms in the animals. The swabs were taken by swabbing the left and right nasal cavities or conjunctiva using sterile cotton swabs (Men‐tip, JCB Industry Limited, Tokyo, Japan). On collection, the samples were transported to the laboratory under refrigeration. A culture medium was prepared using Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (D‐MEM)/Ham's F‐12 with phenol red, HEPES and sodium pyruvate (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 750 mg/mL NaHCO3, 600 mg/mL L‐glutamine, 1000 U/mL penicillin, 1000 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B. On arrival at the laboratory, the swabs were placed into 2 mL of prepared culture medium and mixed thoroughly using a vortex mixer. The mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. Sterilisation was achieved by filtration using a 0.45 µm pore size syringe filter (Millex‐HV Syringe Filter Unit, 0.45 µm, PVDF, 33 mm, gamma sterilised, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Lungs were obtained from cadavers, cut well with scissors, and suspended in the same culture medium at a concentration of 10% wt/vol. The homogenates underwent centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min and filtration using the same process as the swab samples.

Nucleic acids from viruses were extracted from supernatants of cultured cells using either a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit or High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) as indicated in Table1in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleic acid extracted from H‐1 of 102TCID50/mL was diluted tenfold in serial steps up to 105times with PCR‐grade water. For NSWL3, the synthesised DNA with 109copies/µL was serially diluted 10 times down to 101copies/µL with PCR‐grade water. Nucleic acids from clinical samples were extracted using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics) in accordance with the manufacturer's manual.

To identify highly conserved genetic regions, eight BRAV genomes (accession number: Sd‐1:NC_038303.1, BSRI4:KP264974.1, H‐1:JN936206.1, 140032‐1:KP236129.1, BS16‐2:KU159362.1, MexB15:KU159363.1, RS3X:KT948520.1, USII/02:KU159364.1) were aligned using MEGA‐11 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Subsequently, a new primer pair targeting highly conserved regions within the 3Dpolgene (Table2), 6550–6570 F/6782–6801 R, was designed utilising Primer‐BLAST. The primer sequences are shown in Table3. The estimated size of the RT‐PCR product was 252 bp.

RT‐PCR using the new primer pair was conducted with the SuperScript III One‐Step RT‐PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Waltham, Mass., United States) and the T100 Thermal Cycler (BIO RAD, Hercules, Calif., United States). PCR conditions of the new system were as follows: 55°C for 30 min for reverse transcription, initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, extension at 68°C for 16 s, and a final extension at 68°C for 5 min, with a final hold at 4°C. The reagent composition was as follows: 2× Reaction Mix 12.5 µL, forward and reverse primers (10 µm) 0.5 µL each, SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix 1 µL, PCR‐grade water 9.25 µL, and template DNA/RNA 1.25 µL. For FMDV, the reaction volume was 10 µL with the same ratio of reagent compositions. The PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide (Figure1).

PCR products obtained from field clinical samples using the new RT‐PCR system were purified using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean‐up (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). The purified products were then sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass., United States) with the new primers. The sequencing reaction was performed using a MiniAmp (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as follows: 96°C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 96°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 1 min. Sequencing products were purified using CleanSEQ (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, Ind., United States), and the nucleotide sequences of the purified products were determined using a 3500 Genetic Analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Two existing quantitative RT‐PCR systems, referred to as existing systems A and B in this paper, were designed by Hause et al. (2015) and Kishimoto et al. (2017), respectively. Primers/probes used in existing system A were as follows: forward primer: 5’‐CTT TTC GGT GTG ATT GGC AG‐3’, reverse primer: 5’‐GAA ATC TAT CAG GGC AGG TCT G‐3’, and probe: 5’‐FAM‐CGG CAG TCC AGG TCC AGT GT‐TAMRA‐3’. Probe quencher was changed from Iowa Black, which is costly and less readily available, to TAMRA, which is widely accessible from various suppliers. Primers/probes used in existing system B were as follows: forward primer: 5’‐CAC CTG AAC TAT GGA CTT GG ‐3’, reverse primer: 5’‐CAC GGC CTC AAT CAT CTG‐3’, and probe: 5’‐FAM‐GAC GTG GAC TGG CAC CAG TTT GC‐TAMRA‐3’. These reactions were conducted using AgPath‐ID One‐Step RT‐PCR Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, Mass., United States) and the 7500 Fast Real‐Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Reaction conditions for the two systems were as follows: 45°C for 10 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 45 s. Reagent composition for the two systems was as follows: 2× RT‑PCR Buffer 12.5 µL, forward and reverse primer (10 µm) 2.25 µL each, probe 0.6 µL, 25× RT‑PCR Enzyme Mix 1.0 µL, PCR‐grade water 5.15 µL, and template DNA/RNA 1.25 µL. The results were analysed using 7500 software v.2.0.6 (Applied Biosystems).

RT‐PCR was performed in the new and existing systems using serially diluted nucleic acids extracted from H‐1. The assay was performed in triplicate, and positivity for one sample was considered to indicate that the PCR system could detect the sample. The index of the detection limit was expressed as TCID50/mL (Table4). Detection limits of the new system and existing system B for H‐1 were 10−2TCID50/mL, which were lower than the detection limits required for virus titration. Existing system A could not detect samples with a titre below 100TCID50/mL. Also, the process used to determine the detection limit of NSWL8 was almost identical to that for the assay for H‐1 described above, except that the index of the detection limit was expressed as copies/µL. For NSWL8, the detection limit of the new system was 104copies/µL (Table5).

RT‐PCR was performed using nucleic acids extracted from supernatants of cells infected with non‐BRAV BRDC‐related viruses—BHV1, BAdV7, BRSV, BPIV3, BCV, BVDV1, BVDV2, and IDV—in the new and existing systems. A non‐specific reaction was considered to occur if nonspecific gene amplification was observed, regardless of amplicon size or Ct value. Regarding results, no non‐specific reaction against viruses causing BRDC was observed with any of the systems. Additionally, RT‐PCR was performed using nucleic acids extracted from the taxonomically related viruses BRBV and FMDVs in the new system. Results showed that the new system did not show a non‐specific reaction against BRBV or FMDVs.

RT‐PCR was performed with the new and existing systems using nucleic acids extracted from clinical samples collected in the field. The results are shown in Table6and Figure2. The detection rate of the new system was 12% (15/125), versus detection rates of existing system A and B of 1.6% (2/125) and 4.8% (6/125), respectively. None of the samples detected by the existing systems were not detected by the new system.

To confirm the correct amplification of BRAV gene fragments using the new RT‐PCR system, the nucleotide sequences of the 15 PCR products from the clinical samples were determined. The 211 bp of the amplified region (corresponding to positions 6571 to 6781 of the Sd‐1 strain (accession number:NC_038303.1)), excluding the primer target sites were queried using Nucleotide BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), which revealed that the sequences were closely related to the BRAV1 USII/02 strain (accession number:KU159364.1), with a 93.36% to 96.20% identity rate.

In this study, we developed a new RT‐PCR system to detect the BRAV gene and compared its sensitivity and specificity with existing systems. The new system was more sensitive than the existing system, as it could detect BRAVs that could not be detected by viral titration and more field BRAVs. Further, the new system showed no non‐specific reactions against viruses, including BRDC‐related viruses and taxonomically related viruses, similar to the existing systems for the viruses utilised in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the new system provides broad detection of BRAVs currently circulating in the field and is helpful for further investigation of BRAV.

As mentioned above, BRAVs are genetically diversified and have limited highly conserved regions. Nevertheless, the new system was relatively successful in targeting these highly conserved regions. The method used in this study, conventional RT‐PCR, requires matching two primers to the conserved region, whereas real‐time RT‐PCR is even more challenging as it also requires matching of probes. This is considered one of the reasons for the superior performance of the new system. However, real‐time RT‐PCR using a 5'‐nuclease assay is highly specific, offers high throughput due to its lack of requirement for gel electrophoresis, and facilitates quantification. The primers developed in this study can be utilised to develop new real‐time RT‐PCR assays with the above advantages after verifying the genetic information from the currently circulating BRAVs.

Although the analysis of additional BRAVs in the field is desirable, it is most commonly detected in Japan by isolation using BK cells (Ministry of Agriculture2024). This method poses challenges, however: BK cells are primary cultured cells, making it difficult to maintain stable quality; the virus titer obtained is relatively low; and the testing process is time‐consuming, lasting from several days to weeks. Furthermore, confirmation of virus isolation has traditionally relied on observing cytopathic effects (CPE) and fluorescence assays of cultured cells. These have limitations, however, including, respectively, the inability to detect strains that cause low CPE, like H‐1, and the need to stock BRAV‐specific antibodies for each serotype. In contrast, use of our new RT‐PCR system as a screening test prior to virus isolation will provide results within a few hours, reducing the number of specimens requiring subsequent virus isolation. In addition, use of our RT‐PCR system to confirm virus isolation should allow the detection of more BRAV strains regardless of their ability to cause CPE or their antigenicity. This suggests the potential for reducing test costs and improving accuracy. Overall, the introduction of this RT‐PCR system promises to improve BRAV detection and diagnostic efficiency. We plan to conduct viral isolation using samples positive with the new system and analyse the characteristics and genetic information of the isolated virus.

We developed a new conventional RT‐PCR system which can detect a broader range of BRAV than the existing real‐time PCR systems. The new system helps diagnose BRDC and facilitates further investigation of BRAV, which has been little studied until recently. The new system can be a useful tool in the elucidation of BRAV, for which many aspects remain unresolved.
