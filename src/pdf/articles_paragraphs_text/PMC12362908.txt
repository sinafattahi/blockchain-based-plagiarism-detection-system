Phacoemulsification is the most widely performed cataract surgery and a key indicator of surgical competency for ophthalmologists. This study applies cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis to a large national dataset to identify the number of cases required for trainees to reach proficiency, with the goal of enhancing training standards and ensuring patient safety.

This retrospective study focuses on the phacoemulsification performed at the healthcare centres under the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. The study used data from the web-based Cataract Surgery Registry. The target group consisted of provisional surgeons who completed the training programme between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. As posterior capsular rupture (PCR) is the most common complication in phacoemulsification, it is widely accepted as a competency benchmark. The study utilised CUSUM analysis to assess the occurrence of PCR for consecutive cases. The average CUSUM scores of all surgeons were plotted to generate a graph. The point at which the learning curve levels off was determined by employing a polynomial graph in Microsoft Excel.

Our result was based on the phacoemulsification cases performed by a cohort of 230 provisional surgeons. By aggregating the CUSUM scores of all participating surgeons, we observed that the graph representing the learning curve reached a plateau after 75 cases.

The learning curve was constructed using the CUSUM score, and surgeons required at least 75 cases to achieve competency in phacoemulsification.

Our study analysed phacoemulsification cases in 230 surgeons under supervision. We found that the learning curve plateaued after 75 cases, indicating that provisional surgeons need a minimum of 75 cases to attain proficiency in phacoemulsification.

CUSUM is widely recognised as the established method for assessing proficiency in phacoemulsification surgery. Numerous studies have attempted to identify the threshold of competence using CUSUM; however, their findings were constrained by small sample sizes. Consequently, our objective was to employ CUSUM analysis on our comprehensive registry data to establish a benchmark derived from a significantly larger study cohort.

In Malaysia, provisional surgeons are required to perform 50 phacoemulsification surgeries in six months. However, evidence suggests that at least 75 cases may be needed for competence, raising concerns that some provisional surgeons may begin independent practice before achieving proficiency, potentially affecting patient outcomes.

The findings of this study have the potential to either confirm or challenge the existing practice. By establishing that a minimum of 75 cases is necessary to achieve competence, it becomes imperative to provide provisional surgeons with additional opportunities to reach this level of proficiency before granting them independent surgical privileges. Our study has the implication of challenging the existing practice with the aim of enhancing the quality of healthcare.

Advancements in medical technology have rendered conventional skill assessments, such as logbooks and supervisor reports, outdated. These methods often rely on subjective evaluations and lack real-time indicators for when intervention is needed. Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) analysis, first described by Page in 1954, provides an objective way to monitor performance over time [1]. It was later adapted in the medical field to assess doctors'performance during surgeries and interventional procedures in various disciplines [2–5]. This objective analysis has been used to determine the learning curve in multiple skills, such as intubation, colonoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [6–8]. Therefore, we adopted CUSUM analysis to determine the phacoemulsification learning curve.

In ophthalmology, CUSUM has been used to track surgeons'proficiency in cataract surgeries, detect glaucoma progression, and monitor post-operative complications [9–11]. Since 2007, CUSUM analyses have been utilised in Malaysia to assess the competency of ophthalmic surgeons, particularly in phacoemulsification, the most common cataract surgery technique. By tracking outcomes such as posterior capsular rupture (PCR), CUSUM enables both proficiency monitoring for novice surgeons and continuous quality audits for experienced surgeons. This method provides a more objective alternative to traditional skill evaluations, focusing on motor skills as well as clinical judgement.

CUSUM works by plotting the cumulative sum of deviations from a target or expected outcome. In the context of surgery, such as phacoemulsification, the target outcome is the successful completion of the procedure without complications, like PCR. The goal is to track how a surgeon’s performance compares to this target over a series of procedures.

The Cataract Surgery Registry (CSR), part of Malaysia’s National Eye Database (NED), has been collecting cataract surgery data since 2002. The information about each cataract surgery is entered into CSR, including patients' pre-operative records, intraoperative records, and post-operative outcomes. It transitioned to a web-based system in 2007, ensuring data validity through standardisation, regular audits, and secure access.

Surgeons in Malaysia undergo a four-year ophthalmology training programme with a six-month provisional period, during which they are required to complete at least 50 phacoemulsification cases. However, given the importance of this surgery, there is a need to determine whether this threshold is sufficient for ensuring competency.

Cataract is the leading cause of blindness globally and the second cause of moderate and severe visual impairment among people 50 years and older [12]. In Malaysia, the phacoemulsification rate increased from 39.7% in 2002 to 92.3% in 2018 [13]. The increase signifies the importance of mastering phacoemulsification among novice surgeons. In 2018, provisional surgeons performed 4.9% (2,512) of the 51,209 phacoemulsification surgeries, with a 3.0% rate of PCR. In contrast, fully-fledged specialists performed 46,389 surgeries with a lower PCR rate of 1.4%. This data indicates that provisional surgeons face a higher risk of complications, which decreases as they gain experience and overcome the learning curve.

Numerous studies have examined the learning curve for phacoemulsification among surgeons [14–18], but there is still no consensus on the minimum number of cases required to achieve competency. Recent studies on small study sizes have been done to determine the point of competency using CUSUM [19–21]. These studies found that trainees needed at least 28–41 cases to achieve competency in phacoemulsification. However, their findings were limited by the small study size, ranging from 3 to 20 trainees.

This study aims to use CUSUM analysis on a larger dataset to determine the minimum number of cases required to achieve competency in phacoemulsification, addressing the current gap in surgical training benchmarks.

This retrospective registry study analysed phacoemulsification cases performed by provisional surgeons registered with the Cataract Surgery Registry (CSR) between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. The study adhered to ethical standards, including the 1954 Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Medical Research and Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Health (NMRR-21–1342-58,653). Informed consent was not required as the data were anonymised. It did not involve patient intervention or the use of human tissue samples. All surgeons who completed their training programme during the study period were included, except those with incomplete data. The analysis focused on phacoemulsification surgeries conducted during their six-month provisional period.

PCR was selected as the surgical outcome indicator, as it is one of the most common and serious complications of phacoemulsification, significantly impacting visual outcomes and requiring further interventions. Monitoring PCR rates is essential for ensuring patient safety and successful surgeries. Unlike more subjective assessments, the occurrence of PCR can be precisely tracked, making it an ideal indicator for evaluating a surgeon's technical skills during the learning process. Occurrence of PCR also accurately reflects a surgeon's technical skills, including motor coordination and decision-making under pressure. Its consistent use in previous studies makes it a reliable benchmark for assessing competence in cataract surgery across training programmes in different countries.

where C=case; n=number of procedures (in chronological, consecutive order); Xn=outcome measure for the nth procedure. For a binary outcome, Xn=0 (success), Xn=1(failure). Xn is standardised for continuous measurement with a zero mean and unit standard deviation (SD). k=reference value (a prespecified standard of performance defined in terms of acceptable and unacceptable failure rate).

At the start, CUSUM scores C0= 0. At the nth procedure, Xn is the outcome measure for the nth procedure. Performance with an acceptable outcome or absence of PCR has a negative score, and the chart will be either flat or slope downwards. Performance with an unacceptable outcome or presence of PCR has a positive score, and the CUSUM chart will slope upwards.

Figure1shows examples of the CUSUM graph of four provisional surgeons during their work period. The first three surgeons were able to achieve flattening of the curve, while the fourth surgeon had frequent PCRs. This shows that the fourth surgeon has not achieved competency. In our study, the CUSUM score for each surgeon following each attempt is summed up to plot a learning curve graph which represents the average learning curve of all the surgeons.

The learning curve is a graphical representation that shows the relationship between performance and experience over time. The learning curve typically starts with a steep incline as the surgeon acquires the necessary skills and knowledge to perform the procedure effectively. As the surgeon gains more experience and practice, the slope of the learning curve becomes less steep, indicating a higher level of proficiency. Eventually, the curve plateaus, indicating that the surgeon has achieved mastery of the procedure. The learning curve can be used to monitor and evaluate a surgeon's progress and performance during the learning process and identify improvement opportunities.

CUSUM charts for individual surgeons are accessible via unique logins within the National Eye Database (NED), enabling real-time performance monitoring.

All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive data were expressed in percentages for categorical variables.

The CUSUM score for each surgeon was calculated at each attempt, and the mean of all surgeons' scores was plotted to represent the overall learning curve. Finally, the point of flattening of the learning curve is determined using a polynomial graph in Microsoft Excel. The point at which the curve plateaus indicates that the surgeon has achieved mastery of the procedure.

A total of 234 surgeons completed the training programme between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. Four surgeons were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 230 surgeons in the final analysis. During the six-month provisional period, these surgeons collectively performed 18,378 phacoemulsification procedures.

The average CUSUM score at each surgical attempt is presented in Table1. These scores were used to plot the learning curve. The CUSUM learning curve(Fig.2)revealed that the curve plateaued after approximately 75 cases. The point at which the curve plateaus indicates that the surgeon has achieved mastery of the procedure. Hence, on average, the surgeons took 75 cases to achieve competency in phacoemulsification.

The demographic backgrounds of the surgeons are summarised in Table2. Female surgeons were the majority, consisting of 70.9% of overall surgeons. Majority of the surgeons were Chinese (48.7%), followed by Malay (34.8%), Indian (16.1%), and other ethnicities (0.4%). The distribution of surgeons in three different universities was relatively equal. Surgeons received ophthalmology residency training programmes at the National University of Malaysia (33.9%), University of Malaya (31.3%), and Science University of Malaysia (34.8%).

CUSUM analysis is well accepted as an objective method of clinical assessment in various disciplines in the medical field. It has a graphical presentation of surgical performance over time. CUSUM is particularly useful in evaluating the learning curve for procedures like phacoemulsification, which requires repeated practice to achieve consistent and successful outcomes. As a bimanual technique performed under an operating microscope, phacoemulsification presents a steep learning curve, demanding precise coordination between the eyes, hands, and foot controls—making it a challenging skill to develop and refine [22].

Our study found that, on average, trainees required 75 phacoemulsification cases to reach surgical competency. This threshold is higher than in previous studies (Table3), which reported 28–41 cases, possibly due to their smaller sample sizes.

International benchmarks support the notion that more cases lead to better surgical proficiency. In 2007, the United States Accreditation's Council for Graduate Medical Education increased the minimum requirement from 45 to 86 phacoemulsification among surgeons [23]. In the United Kingdom, surgeons must complete 50 independent cases within the first two years of training and 350 cases over seven years to be eligible to apply for a consultant post [24]. On top of that, a study on operative time and complication rates in the Philippines concluded that the minimum number of 50 phacoemulsification cases is insufficient for achieving surgeon competency [25]. These findings highlight that, although exact thresholds may differ across training systems, more surgical cases are generally linked to improved competency and safer patient outcomes.

These findings support our study’s recommendation that a minimum of 75 phacoemulsification cases should be required to achieve surgical proficiency, as it aligns with the broader understanding that more extensive experience leads to better surgical skills and outcomes. By drawing parallels between these international benchmarks and the proposed 75 cases requirement, the study underscores the rationale for setting this number as a reasonable and evidence-based threshold for achieving competency in phacoemulsification. These findings should prompt a change from the current practice of requiring 50 cases to ensure a higher standard of competency and patient safety. Surgeons who struggle to follow the learning curve should receive early intervention, possibly through closer monitoring or reviewing of surgical recordings.

The learning curve of phacoemulsification is steep. As a result, trainees are prone to more complications and require longer surgery time. Trainees must understand the principle of the phacoemulsification machine and the operating microscope before operating on patients. To reduce surgery complications, trainees should also perform simulated surgeries on simulators or in the wet lab, depending on availability. They are encouraged to review the operating video for self-evaluation and peer sharing.

Gaining proficiency in phacoemulsification surgery requires a holistic understanding of the technical, cognitive, and interpersonal skills required for successful surgical outcomes. A proficient phacoemulsification surgeon demonstrates mastery in surgical technique and excels in decision-making, patient communication, and ethical practice. Continuous learning, adaptability, and collaboration are essential attributes that ensure a surgeon maintains proficiency throughout their career. As the field of ophthalmology continues to evolve, these characteristics will remain central to defining and maintaining surgical excellence.

Our study has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. The 230 surgeons included in the study had diverse experiences and training backgrounds, coming from various universities and hospitals. We began tracking the CUSUM score after the surgeons had completed four years of their training programme and were operating under supervision, reflecting the current practice of requiring a minimum of 50 cases during the provisional period. Starting the analysis earlier in the training program is challenging due to the variation in surgical exposure and institutional training differences. However, it's important to note that all trainees received sufficient training and supervision during the provisional period before being considered competent surgeons. While this approach may lead to a potential underestimation of the full training curve, it accurately represents the current training practices in Malaysia. In summary, although this method is a limitation, it provides a realistic depiction of the training trends in the country.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the current benchmark of 50 cases for provisional surgeons in Malaysia may be inadequate because competency is more consistently achieved after 75 cases. Raising the requirement would improve training quality, enhance patient safety, and ensure surgeons are better prepared for independent practice.
