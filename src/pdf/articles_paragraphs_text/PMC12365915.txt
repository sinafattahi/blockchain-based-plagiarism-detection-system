To evaluate and compare the predictive performance of Padua and Caprini scores for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment in individuals aged ≥ 90 years.

A cross‐sectional study was conducted among 511 nonagenarians in Rugao, China. Participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessments including both Padua and Caprini risk scoring. VTE events were monitored through the follow‐up period. The predictive efficacy of both scoring systems was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and risk factors were evaluated through multivariate logistic regression.

During follow‐up, 31 participants (6.07%) developed VTE. The VTE group demonstrated significantly higher mean Padua scores (4.97 ± 2.21 vs. 4.11 ± 2.45,p= 0.0463), Caprini scores (6.39 ± 2.42 vs. 5.02 ± 2.39,p= 0.0044), and D‐dimer levels (median 2.79 vs. 1.31 mg/L,p= 0.0133) compared to the non‐VTE group. Both scoring systems showed moderate predictive capability, with the Padua score achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.625 (95% CI: 0.533–0.717) and the Caprini score showing an AUC of 0.679 (95% CI: 0.590–0.768). Optimal cutoff values were 3.5 points for the Padua score (sensitivity 80.65%, specificity 50.42%) and 4.5 points for the Caprini score (sensitivity 77.42%, specificity 51.46%). Multivariate analysis identified atrial fibrillation (OR 4.130, 95% CI: 1.667–9.673,p= 0.001) and elevated Caprini score (OR 1.310, 95% CI: 1.073–1.582,p= 0.006) as significant independent risk factors for VTE. Interestingly, hypertension showed an unexpected protective association with VTE risk (OR 0.400, 95% CI: 0.162–0.907,p= 0.035).

While both Padua and Caprini scores demonstrate moderate predictive value for VTE risk in nonagenarians, their accuracy suggests the need for age‐specific refinement.

This cross‐sectional study compared the predictive performance of Padua and Caprini scores for VTE risk assessment in 511 individuals aged > 90 years from Rugao, China. ROC curve analysis revealed moderate predictive capability for both scores. The findings suggest a need for age‐specific refinement of VTE risk assessment tools and highlight the importance of considering cardiovascular comorbidities in this population.

The global demographic landscape is experiencing an unprecedented shift, with a remarkable increase in the population of individuals aged ≥ 90 years (Partridge et al.2018). This growing demographic segment presents unique challenges to healthcare systems worldwide, as these individuals often exhibit complex physiological changes, multiple comorbidities, and distinct healthcare needs that require specialized attention and management strategies (Daniels et al.2024). Among the various health concerns affecting this population, venous thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), stands out as a particularly significant threat, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality rates (Deschamps et al.2023; Aggarwal et al.2024).

The risk of VTE in advanced age is amplified by several age‐related factors. These include alterations in hemostatic balance, reduced mobility, increased prevalence of chronic conditions, and changes in vascular integrity (Gregson et al.2019). The combination of these factors creates a complex risk profile that differs significantly from younger populations, necessitating careful consideration in both assessment and management approaches. The challenge lies not only in identifying those at risk but also in implementing appropriate preventive measures without increasing other age‐related complications.

Current clinical practice relies heavily on standardized risk assessment tools, with the Padua score being one of the most widely implemented systems (Barbar et al.2010). This score incorporates 11 distinct clinical and demographic factors, including active cancer, previous VTE, reduced mobility, and advanced age, to generate a comprehensive risk assessment (Hayssen et al.2024). While numerous studies have validated its effectiveness in various clinical settings and patient populations (Pandor et al.2021), the application of the Padua score in individuals aged ≥ 90 years presents unique challenges and considerations (Hou et al.2024). The physiological and clinical characteristics of this age group may influence the score's predictive accuracy in ways that have not been fully explored or understood.

The majority of research validating VTE risk assessment tools has been conducted in Western populations (Häfliger et al.2024), creating a significant knowledge gap regarding their applicability and effectiveness in other ethnic groups, particularly in Chinese elderly populations. This geographic and demographic disparity in validation studies raises important questions about the universal applicability of these risk assessment tools and whether they need modification for different populations.

The complexity of VTE risk assessment in the very elderly is further compounded by several factors. First, the physiological changes associated with extreme age may alter the traditional risk factor relationships established in younger populations (Caprini2005). Second, the presence of multiple comorbidities, which is common in this age group, may create intricate interactions that affect VTE risk in ways not captured by current assessment tools (Kahn et al.2012). Third, the balance between thrombotic and bleeding risks becomes increasingly delicate with advancing age, making risk stratification particularly crucial for appropriate prophylaxis decisions. Our study specifically addresses these complexities by providing comparative data on two major risk assessment tools in a well‐defined nonagenarian population, offering insights into their relative performance and limitations in this challenging clinical context.

The Caprini score, while primarily designed for surgical patients (Caprini2005), has demonstrated robust predictive performance across diverse surgical populations with AUC values typically ranging from 0.65 to 0.78. Recent studies have expanded its application to medical patients, showing comparable or superior performance to the Padua score in certain clinical settings (Hayssen et al.2024). However, its validation in very elderly populations, particularly those aged ≥ 90 years, remains limited, with most validation studies conducted in younger cohorts. The comparison between these scoring systems in the very elderly population remains an area requiring further investigation, particularly given the unique characteristics and needs of this age group. Understanding the relative performance of these tools in individuals aged ≥ 90 years could provide valuable insights for improving risk assessment strategies.

Considering this, our study aims to assess the Padua score's predictive value for VTE in ≥ 90‐year‐old via comprehensive analysis. We also compared Padua and Caprini scores to evaluate their performance and determine the better tool for VTE risk assessment in this age group. This research seeks to fill the knowledge gap in VTE risk assessment for the very elderly and offer evidence‐based clinical guidance. The results may enhance VTE risk prediction accuracy and improve preventive strategies for this vulnerable population.

A cross‐sectional study was conducted in Rugao City, Jiangsu Province, by the Department of Geriatrics, Rugao Boai Hospital, in collaboration with the Rugao Community Health Center, targeting individuals aged ≥ 90 years. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥ 90 years; (2) completion of both Padua and Caprini score assessments; (3) availability of diagnostic imaging for VTE evaluation, including lower limb venous ultrasonography or CT pulmonary angiography, following established clinical guidelines (Lim et al.2018; Expert Group on Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Vascular Disease, Chinese Thoracic Society, Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Vascular Disease Working Group, Chinese Association of Chest Physicians2024); and (4) ability to provide informed consent either directly or through legal representatives.

The exclusion criteria comprised: (1) inability to cooperate with required examinations due to severe cognitive impairment or physical disability; (2) death from non‐VTE‐related causes during the study period; (3) preexisting anticoagulant therapy before study enrollment; and (4) incomplete medical records that would preclude comprehensive analysis.

Data collection involved home visits for questionnaire surveys, health examinations, and retrieval of medical records from March 2022 to December 2022. After applying these criteria, 511 eligible participants were included in the final analysis. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Rugao Boai Hospital (approval number: 2021‐K002‐01).

Clinical data were systematically collected through multiple sources: (1) Home visit questionnaires provided demographic information (age, gender), functional status assessments, current symptoms, and medication usage; (2) Community health records contributed historical medical information including documented comorbidities and previous hospitalizations; (3) Medical visit records supplied recent clinical assessments, laboratory results, and diagnostic imaging reports. The collected information encompassed demographic data including age and gender, documentation of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic bronchitis and COPD, active cancer, fractures, pulmonary infections, and Alzheimer's disease. Laboratory parameters, particularly coagulation‐related tests including D‐dimer levels, were also collected. Both Padua and Caprini risk assessments were performed for each participant based on the collected data.

VTE diagnoses were established based on a combination of clinical symptoms including unexplained limb swelling, pain, or dyspnea, physical examination findings, and diagnostic imaging results. Imaging modalities included lower limb venous ultrasonography and CT pulmonary angiography. All diagnoses adhered to the Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention of Pulmonary Thromboembolism (Lim et al.2018; Expert Group on Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Vascular Disease, Chinese Thoracic Society, Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Vascular Disease Working Group, Chinese Association of Chest Physicians2024). Specific diagnostic criteria included: (1) For DVT: positive compression ultrasonography showing noncompressible venous segments, or CT/MR venography demonstrating intraluminal filling defects; (2) For PE: positive CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) showing intraluminal filling defects in pulmonary arteries, or high‐probability ventilation‐perfusion scan findings; (3) Clinical probability was assessed using Wells score, and D‐dimer levels were considered in conjunction with imaging results. All imaging studies were independently reviewed by two qualified radiologists, with discrepancies resolved by consensus review with a third senior radiologist. The accuracy of VTE diagnoses was verified through expert radiological and clinical review.

Both Padua and Caprini scores were calculated for each participant. The Padua score evaluates VTE risk based on established clinical risk factors (Barbar et al.2010; Hayssen et al.2024), with a total score of ≥ 4 indicating high risk. The Caprini score was also assessed following standard scoring criteria (Wang et al.2018). These assessments were performed independently by two trained clinicians, with any discrepancies resolved through discussion with a senior physician.

The follow‐up protocol was structured as follows: (1) Scheduled community health visits every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter; (2) Systematic review of updated medical records from all healthcare providers every 2 months; (3) Monthly telephone interviews with participants or family members to assess for new symptoms; (4) Immediate evaluation for any reported symptoms suggestive of VTE (limb swelling, pain, dyspnea, chest pain). Data collected during follow‐up included: new clinical symptoms, hospitalization records, emergency department visits, new diagnoses, medication changes, and all imaging studies performed. Any VTE events were documented and verified using standardized diagnostic criteria within 48 h of reporting. All participants were followed for a minimum of 12 months from enrollment, with a median follow‐up duration of 14.5 months (range: 12–18 months). Follow‐up assessments were conducted at 3‐month intervals during the first year, with additional evaluations prompted by any clinical symptoms suggestive of VTE. Any VTE events were documented and verified using standardized diagnostic criteria. Follow‐up assessments were conducted by trained healthcare professionals who were blinded to the initial risk scores to minimize potential bias.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 23.0) and R statistical software. Continuous variables were assessed for normal distribution and presented as mean ± standard deviation (x̄±s) or median (interquartile range) [M(Q1, Q3)] as appropriate. Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages [n(%)]. Comparative analyses utilized independentt‐tests or Mann–WhitneyUtests for continuous variables and chi‐square tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. The predictive efficacy of both Padua and Caprini scores was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, with the DeLong test employed to compare the areas under the ROC curves. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for VTE. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05 for all analyses.

A total of 511 elderly individuals aged ≥ 90 years from Rugao met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The study population had a median age of 92.2 years [90.9, 94.0], with 246 males (48.14%) and 265 females (51.86%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (226 cases, 44.23%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (217 cases, 42.47%), coronary heart disease (194 cases, 37.96%), and fractures (62 cases, 12.13%). Other conditions included atrial fibrillation (57 cases, 11.15%), diabetes mellitus (54 cases, 10.57%), malignancy (53 cases, 10.37%), pneumonia (23 cases, 4.50%), and Alzheimer's disease (10 cases, 1.96%). The D‐dimer levels showed considerable variation across the cohort, with a median of 1.33 mg/L [0.76, 3.01] and a range from 0.17 to 108.14 mg/L. The baseline characteristics are detailed in Table1.

During the follow‐up period, 31 participants (6.07%) developed VTE, while 480 participants (93.93%) remained VTE‐free. Comparison of clinical parameters between VTE and non‐VTE groups revealed several significant differences. The VTE group showed higher mean Padua scores (4.97 ± 2.21 vs. 4.11 ± 2.45,p= 0.0463) and Caprini scores (6.39 ± 2.42 vs. 5.02 ± 2.39,p= 0.0044). D‐dimer levels were significantly higher in the VTE group (median 2.79 vs. 1.31 mg/L,p= 0.0133). Age distribution was similar between groups (VTE: 92.9 ± 2.28 years vs. non‐VTE: 92.84 ± 2.49 years,p= 0.889). Detailed comparisons are presented in Table2.

ROC curve analysis demonstrated moderate predictive capability for both scoring systems. The Padua score showed an AUC of 0.625 (95% CI: 0.533–0.717). At the optimal cutoff value of 3.5 points, sensitivity was 80.65% and specificity was 50.42%. The Caprini score demonstrated marginally better discrimination with an AUC of 0.679 (95% CI: 0.590–0.768). Its optimal cutoff value was 4.5 points, yielding a sensitivity of 77.42% and specificity of 51.46%. The DeLong test comparing the two ROC curves showed no statistically significant difference (p= 0.2611, difference in AUC = −0.054, 95% CI: −0.148 to 0.040). These results are illustrated in Figure1.

Logistic regression analysis identified several independent predictors of VTE development. Atrial fibrillation emerged as the strongest risk factor (OR 4.130, 95% CI: 1.667–9.673,p= 0.0014), followed by the Caprini score (OR 1.310 per point increase, 95% CI: 1.073–1.582,p= 0.0060). Interestingly, hypertension showed an inverse association with VTE risk (OR 0.400, 95% CI: 0.162–0.907,p= 0.0352). Age (OR 0.943, 95% CI: 0.794–1.097,p= 0.476), gender (female OR 1.061, 95% CI: 0.498–2.291,p= 0.878), D‐dimer levels (OR 0.972, 95% CI: 0.892–1.017,p= 0.390), and Padua score (OR 0.983, 95% CI: 0.810–1.197,p= 0.866) did not show significant associations with VTE risk in the multivariate model. The complete regression results are presented in Table3.

Our comprehensive analysis of 511 nonagenarians revealed several key findings regarding VTE risk assessment in this population. We observed a VTE incidence of 6.07%, with both Padua and Caprini scores demonstrating moderate predictive capability (AUCs of 0.625 and 0.679, respectively). Notably, atrial fibrillation emerged as the strongest independent risk factor (OR 4.130), while the Caprini score showed superior predictive value compared to the Padua score in multivariate analysis. These findings provide important insights into VTE risk stratification challenges in very elderly populations.

The relatively high incidence of VTE in our study population (6.07%) underscores the significant burden of this condition in the very elderly (Wang et al.2018). This rate is notably higher than previously reported figures in Asian populations (Lee et al.2017), highlighting the particular vulnerability of individuals aged ≥ 90 years to thrombotic events. The complex interplay of age‐related physiological changes, multiple comorbidities, and reduced mobility likely contributes to this increased risk profile.

A key finding of our study is the moderate predictive performance of both scoring systems. The Padua score, while widely used in medical patients (Kahn et al.2012), demonstrated limited discrimination with an AUC of 0.625 (95% CI: 0.533–0.717). At its optimal cutoff value of 3.5, the sensitivity of 80.65% was achieved at the cost of relatively low specificity (50.42%). The Caprini score showed marginally better performance with an AUC of 0.679 (95% CI: 0.590–0.768), though this difference did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.2611). These findings suggest that both scoring systems, while providing some predictive value, may not fully capture the unique risk factors present in very elderly populations.

Our multivariate analysis revealed several noteworthy associations. Atrial fibrillation emerged as the strongest independent risk factor (OR 4.130, 95% CI: 1.667–9.673), suggesting a potentially important role in VTE risk assessment that may be underappreciated in current scoring systems. The Caprini score showed a significant association with VTE risk (OR 1.310 per point increase), while the Padua score did not maintain statistical significance in the multivariate model. These findings align with previous studies suggesting that the Caprini score may offer better risk discrimination in certain populations (Hayssen et al.2022).

Interestingly, our analysis revealed an unexpected inverse association between hypertension and VTE risk (OR 0.400, 95% CI: 0.162–0.907). This finding warrants further investigation, as it may reflect complex interactions between cardiovascular conditions and their treatments in very elderly individuals. It also highlights the potential limitations of applying risk assessment tools developed in younger populations to those aged ≥ 90 years (Maynard et al.2013).

The limitations of current risk assessment tools in this age group may be attributed to several factors. First, both the Padua and Caprini scores assign only modest weight to advanced age, potentially underestimating its impact in nonagenarians (Aleman et al.2014). Second, these tools may not adequately account for the cumulative effect of multiple chronic conditions, which is particularly relevant in this population (Pastori et al.2023). The high prevalence of comorbidities in our cohort—including COPD (42.47%), coronary heart disease (37.96%), and various other conditions—creates complex risk interactions that may not be captured by current scoring systems.

Recent research has suggested the potential value of incorporating additional biomarkers into VTE risk assessment (Yuan et al.2023). While our study included D‐dimer levels, which showed significant differences between VTE and non‐VTE groups in univariate analysis, this parameter did not maintain statistical significance in the multivariate model. This suggests that the relationship between traditional biomarkers and VTE risk may also differ in very elderly populations.

The strengths of our study include its focus on a well‐defined age group, comprehensive assessment of multiple risk factors, and detailed follow‐up. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, while our sample of 511 participants is substantial for this age group, the relatively low VTE event rate (6.07%,n= 31) may have limited statistical power to detect weaker associations or smaller effect sizes, particularly in subgroup analyses where the number of events becomes even smaller. Second, the single‐center design may affect the generalizability of our findings. Finally, the observational nature of the study precludes causal inference regarding the identified associations.

Looking forward, our findings suggest several potential areas for improvement in VTE risk assessment for very elderly individuals. Future research should consider developing age‐specific modifications to existing scoring systems or creating new tools that better reflect the unique risk factors and physiological changes present in this population (Wu et al.2023; Gao et al.2023). Additionally, the strong association between atrial fibrillation and VTE risk suggests that greater attention to cardiovascular comorbidities may be warranted in risk assessment strategies.

This study demonstrates that while both Padua and Caprini scores provide moderate predictive value for VTE risk in nonagenarians, their accuracy suggests the need for age‐specific refinement of current risk assessment tools. Key findings include both scoring systems showing suboptimal discrimination (AUCs 0.625–0.679) in individuals aged ≥ 90 years, atrial fibrillation representing a critical and potentially underappreciated risk factor in this population, the Caprini score demonstrating marginally better predictive performance than the Padua score, and current risk assessment tools potentially not fully capturing the unique physiological and clinical characteristics of very elderly patients. These findings highlight the need for developing age‐specific VTE risk assessment strategies and emphasize the importance of considering cardiovascular comorbidities, particularly atrial fibrillation, in clinical decision‐making for nonagenarians, with future research focusing on creating or modifying risk assessment tools specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of this growing population.
