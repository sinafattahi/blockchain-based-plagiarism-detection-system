Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with insulin resistance (IR) increasingly recognized as a key contributor. The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), a surrogate marker of insulin sensitivity, has been proposed as a predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in T1DM. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between eGDR and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted through March 6, 2025, to identify studies reporting multivariable-adjusted risk estimates linking eGDR with cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with T1DM. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using random-effects models with the Paule–Mandel method and Knapp–Hartung adjustment. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore potential effect modifiers, and leave-one-out (LOO) sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings.

Sixteen studies comprising 29,075 individuals with T1DM were included. Higher eGDR was significantly associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality, with hazard ratios per unit increase of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.87; I² = 63%) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.86; I² = 0%), respectively. Lower eGDR was also associated with increased risk of CAD (low vs. high eGDR: HR 3.61; 95% CI: 2.83–4.62; I² = 0%). Subgroup analyses suggested a stronger protective association between eGDR and MACE among older individuals (≥ 40 years), those with BMI < 25 kg/m², and those with longer diabetes duration (≥ 20 years). LOO sensitivity analyses showed that CAD was the only outcome influenced by exclusion of the largest study.

Lower eGDR is consistently associated with increased risk of MACE, CAD, and all-cause mortality in individuals with T1DM. These findings support the utility of eGDR as a practical, non-invasive marker for cardiovascular risk stratification in this high-risk population.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), significantly contributing to the global burden of disease [1]. The incidence of CVD is significantly higher and occurs at a younger age in individuals with T1DM, with women being disproportionately affected compared to men [2]. Among patients with early-onset T1DM, this risk is even more pronounced [3]. Age-adjusted data show that the relative risk of CVD in T1DM is 4 to 10 times greater than in non-diabetic individuals, with cardiovascular events typically occurring 10 to 15 years earlier [1,2].

Insulin resistance (IR) in T1DM is increasingly recognized and often results from the interplay between genetic predisposition, obesity, and lifestyle-related factors [4]. Although T1DM is primarily an autoimmune condition, IR frequently develops in affected individuals, especially those with excess adiposity and poor metabolic control [4]. Mechanistically, IR in T1DM is driven by the accumulation of free fatty acids and bioactive lipids which impair insulin signaling pathways—particularly in skeletal muscle, the primary site of insulin-mediated glucose uptake [5,6]. Furthermore, oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation—often associated with adipose tissue expansion—worsen insulin signaling and contribute to the progression of IR in this population [7]. Mechanistic studies suggest that IR accelerates cardiovascular risk through multiple biological pathways, including endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic disturbances, and inappropriate activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) [8]. Observational data consistently indicate that individuals with T1DM with insulin resistance face a markedly elevated risk of various cardiovascular complications [9,10].

Direct assessment of insulin sensitivity through the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp remains the gold standard [11,12]; however, its technical complexity, high cost, and invasiveness limit its widespread applicability in clinical and research settings. Consequently, surrogate measures such as the estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) have been developed to provide a practical, non-invasive estimate of insulin sensitivity based on routinely collected clinical variables, including waist-to-hip ratio (WH), hypertension status, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). eGDR has shown a strong correlation with clamp-derived insulin sensitivity, particularly within T1DM populations [11]. Although insulin resistance has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, few studies have quantitatively examined how eGDR relates to specific cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 1 diabetes [9,13,14]. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate this association in the T1DM population.

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [15]. The protocol was prospectively registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD420251039582) [16].

We comprehensively searched four online international databases -PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane- on March 6, 2025, by employing predetermined search syntax. The syntax utilizes the keywords and controlled vocabulary terms related to “estimated glucose disposal rate” AND “cardiovascular outcomes”. Specifically, MeSH terms were used for PubMed, Emtree terms for Embase, and free-text keywords were applied for Scopus. The syntax was tailored for each database to maximize accurate and comprehensive retrieval of relevant studies. No limitation according to language and type of study was applied during the search process. The detailed syntax is available in supplementary material. To ensure that all related studies were included, we also did backward and forward citation searching.

This systematic review and meta-analysis included all peer-reviewed papers investigating the correlation between eGDR and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Studies were eligible if they reported effect sizes as risk estimates (e.g., hazard ratio, odds ratio, or relative risk). Studies were excluded if they were conducted on populations without type 1 diabetes, didn’t report any cardiovascular outcome, didn’t report the association between eGDR and cardiovascular outcomes in risk estimates (such as hazard ratio, odds ratio, or relative risk), and were reviews, case-reports, case-series, congress abstracts, non-English studies, and animal studies.

Studies identified through the systematic search of databases were imported into online reference managers, Rayyan [17] and EndNote 21 [18], for screening and duplicate removal. Following this step, a two-stage screening process was performed. In the initial stage, the titles and abstracts of each article were independently reviewed by two researchers. In the second stage, the full texts of previously selected articles were screened by two independent researchers, following the same approach to obtain eligible papers. Any conflict between researchers at either stage was resolved through discussion or referral to a third reviewer.

Two researchers independently extracted relevant data from all eligible studies using a pre-designed, standardized Google spreadsheet. Extracted information included: [1] study characteristics—first author’s name, year of publication, country, and study design; [2] population characteristics—population definition, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, follow-up duration, sex distribution, mean age, age at type 1 diabetes diagnosis, diabetes duration, BMI, prevalence of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and [3] cardiovascular outcomes—including the specific outcomes reported and the definitions used within each study.

To evaluate the quality of the included studies, two researchers separately reviewed them using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool [19]. The ROBINS-E is a structured and comprehensive tool that is specifically designed to assess the risk of bias in observational studies reporting the association between non-randomized exposures and outcomes. This tool employs signaling questions to systematically evaluate seven potential domains of bias, including confounding, measurement of exposure, participant selection, post-exposure interventions, missing data, outcome measurement, and selection of the reported result. It’s noteworthy that ROBINS-E, as a novel risk-of-bias assessment approach, significantly improves transparency in reporting the potential sources of bias across exposure-outcome research. The third researcher settled inconsistencies. The quality of the evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology [20].

The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was the association between eGDR and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with type 1 diabetes. MACE definitions were accepted as reported by each study and were not reclassified. Secondary outcomes included the associations of eGDR with all-cause mortality, coronary artery disease (CAD) incidence, and subclinical atherosclerosis.

The eGDR (expressed in mg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) was calculated using four previously validated equations: (1) eGDR = 24.31 − (12.22 × WH) − (3.29 × HT) − (0.57 × HbA1c); (2) eGDR = 24.4 − (12.97 × WH) − (3.39 × HT) − (0.60 × HbA1c); (3) eGDR = 21.158 − (0.09 × WC) − (3.407 × HT) − (0.551 × HbA1c); (4) eGDR = 19.02 − (0.22 × BMI) − (3.26 × HT) − (0.61 × HbA1c). In these equations, WH denotes waist-to-hip ratio, WC is waist circumference, BMI is body mass index (kg/m²), HT indicates history of hypertension (coded as 0 = no, 1 = yes), and HbA1c is glycated hemoglobin (%). Hypertension was defined as a self-reported or physician-diagnosed condition, blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg, or current treatment with antihypertensive medications.

A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of eGDR with the specified outcomes. The Paule–Mandel method was used to estimate the between-study variance (τ²), and the Knapp–Hartung adjustment was applied to compute the confidence intervals for the pooled estimates. In studies where time-to-event data were not available, odds ratios (ORs) were used as approximations for HRs [21]. This decision was based on the primary aim of our study, which was to evaluate the association between eGDR and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 1 diabetes—not to assess its prognostic value. Accordingly, we did not interpret or utilize time-to-event components in our analysis or conclusions. As such, both HRs and ORs were treated as measures of association, and not as time-dependent risk estimates. Only fully adjusted risk estimates from multivariable models were included.

Studies reported HRs in varying formats, including comparisons between categorized eGDR levels (e.g., highest vs. lowest quartile), per-unit increases, or per-standard deviation (SD) increases in eGDR. To allow direct comparison of study-specific estimates, HRs reported for categorical exposures were recalculated to reflect per-unit increases using dose-response meta-analysis based on the method proposed by Greenland and Longnecker [22–24]. This approach utilized available data on the number of events and participants in each eGDR category, along with the adjusted HRs and corresponding 95% CIs. These transformations assumed a normally distributed exposure and a log-linear relationship between eGDR and the outcome [25,26].

To identify potential sources of heterogeneity and assess subgroup effects for the primary outcome, subgroup analyses were performed by stratifying studies based on sample size (< 1,000 vs. ≥1,000), mean age (≥ 40 vs. <40 years), mean duration of diabetes (≤ 20 vs. >20 years), and mean BMI (< 25 vs. ≥25 kg/m²). Additionally, meta-regression analyses were conducted using study-level variables, including mean age, male percentage, mean duration of diabetes, mean HDL cholesterol (mg/dL), and mean BMI. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic. To evaluate the robustness of the pooled estimates, sensitivity analyses were performed using a leave-one-out (LOO) approach, whereby each study was sequentially removed and the meta-analysis repeated to assess its influence on the overall results.

To evaluate the potential non-linear association between eGDR and the risk of cardiovascular events, we conducted a dose–response meta-analysis with restricted cubic splines (RCS) for the primary outcome. This analysis included studies that reported effect estimates across multiple eGDR categories and provided sufficient data to estimate dose–response trends. The RCS model was compared against a simple linear model using a likelihood ratio test to assess the presence of non-linearity.

All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.4.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and RStudio (version 2024.09.0 + 375, Posit PBC, Boston, MA, United States) [27,28]. All reported P values were two-sided, with values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.

The systematic search yielded a total of 2703 articles from four major electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. After removing 656 duplicate records, 2,047 unique citations remained. Title and abstract screening resulted in the exclusion of 1,734 articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria. The full texts of 313 articles were subsequently assessed in detail, of which 300 were excluded based on predefined criteria. In addition, three eligible studies were identified through citation searching. Ultimately, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis [10,13]29–42]. The study selection process is illustrated in Fig.1.

The included studies span a publication period from 2003 to 2025 and were conducted in various regions, with most originating from Europe (n= 10) [10,13,30–34,37,40,41], followed by North American regions, with studies conducted in the United States (n= 5) [35,36,38,39,42] and Mexico (n= 1) [29]. The aggregate sample size across all studies was 29,075 individuals, with sample sizes ranging from 45 to 1750 per study. The mean age across participants was 35.42 years, and the mean duration of T1DM among participants was 20.11 years. With respect to methodological design, the dataset comprised predominantly cohort investigations (n= 10) [10,30–32–34,36,38,39,41,42], followed by cross-sectional studies (n= 5) [13,29,31,35,40]. One study represented a secondary analysis derived from a randomized controlled trial [37]. Table1summarizes the key characteristics of the sixteen included studies.

Of the total studies assessed, seven [13,31,34–38] were judged to have “some concerns,” primarily attributed to limitations in domain 1 (bias due to confounding) and domain 6 (bias arising from measurement of the outcome). One study [40] was classified as having a “High” risk of bias, also predominantly due to concerns related to confounding (domain 1). The remaining studies [10,29,30,32,33,39,41,42] were deemed to carry a “low” risk of bias across all domains (Supplementary Fig.1).

A total of nine studies investigated the association between eGDR and the risk of MACE in individuals with T1DM. Pooled multivariable-adjusted HRs demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship, indicating that each unit increase in eGDR was associated with a reduced risk of MACE (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.72–0.87;p< 0.001) (Fig.2). Moderate heterogeneity was observed across studies (I² = 63%). Sensitivity analysis using a LOO approach confirmed the robustness of the findings, with no single study disproportionately influencing the overall effect estimate (Supplementary Fig.2.1).

Subgroup analyses suggested trends that may inform future research, though some strata may be underpowered and should be interpreted with caution. Among individuals aged ≥ 40 years, higher eGDR values were significantly associated with lower MACE risk (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72–0.91), while the association in younger participants (< 40 years) did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59–1.00) (Fig.3A).

When stratified by BMI, the association appeared stronger in individuals with BMI < 25 (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.57–0.99), compared to those with BMI ≥ 25 (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.81–0.91). While both groups demonstrated statistically significant associations, the difference in effect size should be interpreted with caution, particularly given the non-significant test for subgroup differences (p= 0.11) (Fig.3B).

In analyses based on diabetes duration, participants with ≥ 20 years of diabetes showed a significant inverse association (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66–0.94), while the association among those with a shorter duration was weaker and not statistically significant (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.64–1.02). This may suggest a heightened cardioprotective impact of insulin sensitivity in individuals with longstanding disease (Fig.4A).

Study size also appeared to influence findings. Studies with fewer than 1,000 participants demonstrated a significant association (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67–0.89), while larger studies (≥ 1,000 participants) did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.65–1.06) (Fig.4B). However, tests for subgroup differences were non-significant across all analyses, and these comparisons should be viewed as exploratory.

Finally, meta-regression analyses revealed that variability in key baseline characteristics—including mean age, sex distribution, average diabetes duration, HDL cholesterol levels, and BMI—did not significantly modify the observed association between eGDR and MACE risk (Supplementary Table2; Supplementary Figs.2.2–2.6). Given that fewer than ten studies reported this outcome, formal assessment of publication bias was not performed, as such analyses (e.g., funnel plots and Egger’s test) are considered unreliable with small study numbers.

The non-linearity test showed a non-significant result (p= 0.948), indicating no evidence of deviation from a linear relationship. This supports the use of a linear model to describe the association between eGDR and MACE.

The association between eGDR and CAD in individuals with T1DM was evaluated across three independent studies. Pooled hazard ratios, adjusted for relevant confounders, demonstrated a significantly elevated risk of CAD among participants with lower eGDR levels compared to those with higher eGDR values (HR: 3.61; 95% CI: 2.83–4.62;p< 0.001) (Fig.5). No heterogeneity was observed between studies (I² = 0%), indicating a high degree of consistency in effect estimates. However, LOO sensitivity analysis revealed that the exclusion of the study by Mutter et al. [30] substantially altered the pooled estimate, resulting in a non-significant association. This suggests that the overall finding may have been disproportionately influenced by that single study (Supplementary Fig.3). Meta-regression and publication bias assessments were not conducted for this outcome due to the limited number of included studies.

Five studies evaluated the association between eGDR and all-cause mortality among individuals with T1DM. Meta-analysis of multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios revealed a significant inverse association, indicating that each unit increase in eGDR was associated with a reduced risk of death from any cause (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.82–0.86;p< 0.001) (Fig.6). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity across the included studies (I² = 0%), suggesting highly consistent findings. LOO sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results, as the exclusion of any single study did not materially affect the overall effect estimate (Supplementary Fig.4). Meta-regression and publication bias analyses were not performed because the number of eligible studies was insufficient for reliable inference.

Two studies investigated the relationship between eGDR and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals with T1DM. The pooled analysis did not reveal a statistically significant difference in atherosclerotic burden between individuals with high versus low eGDR (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 0.10–38.24; I² = 0%;p= 0.65) (Supplementary Fig.5). Although the overall meta-analysis was non-significant, findings from individual studies varied. The study by Karamanakos et al. [13] identified a significant association, with lower eGDR levels linked to a substantially increased risk of subclinical atherosclerosis (HR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.06–6.31). Conversely, Sánchez-García et al. [29] observed a similar trend, though the result did not reach statistical significance (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 0.74–3.55).

These findings suggest a possible, though inconclusive, link between reduced insulin sensitivity and early atherosclerotic changes in T1DM, highlighting the need for larger, better-powered studies to clarify this association. Due to the small number of studies, meta-regression and assessment of publication bias were not feasible for this outcome.

The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The certainty was rated high for the primary outcome of MACE, as well as for CAD incidence and all-cause mortality, reflecting strong consistency, directness, and precision across the included studies. In contrast, the certainty of evidence for subclinical atherosclerosis was rated as low, primarily due to serious imprecision and inconsistency across the two available studies. Full details of the GRADE assessment for all outcomes are provided in Supplementary Table5.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize current evidence on the association between eGDR and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with T1DM. The findings demonstrate a consistent inverse association between eGDR and MACE, CAD, and all-cause mortality. These results suggest that reduced insulin sensitivity, as captured by lower eGDR values, may be an important determinant of cardiovascular risk in individuals with T1DM. The association remained stable across diverse populations, methodological designs, and participant characteristics, highlighting the potential of eGDR as a clinically useful marker for cardiovascular risk stratification in this population.

Accumulating evidence suggests that eGDR may serve as a clinically useful risk stratification tool in individuals with T1DM, given its consistent association with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality across multiple observational studies [32,43,44]. Consistent with this growing body of literature, the current meta-analysis demonstrates a consistent inverse association between eGDR and both MACE and all-cause mortality, reinforcing the role of reduced insulin sensitivity as a key determinant of adverse long-term outcomes in T1DM. Although moderate heterogeneity was present in studies assessing MACE, leave-one-out sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of this relationship across diverse populations and study designs. In contrast, the association between eGDR and all-cause mortality was notably consistent, with no observed heterogeneity and effect estimates that remained stable across multiple robustness analyses, indicating a highly reproducible and clinically relevant association. These findings align with and expand upon prior studies indicating that lower eGDR values predict higher cardiovascular risk and mortality in T1DM, independent of traditional risk factors and other insulin resistance–related variables [45–48]. Compared to other surrogate markers of insulin resistance—such as the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Triglyceride-Glucose Index with Waist Circumference (TyG-WC), and Metabolic Score for Insulin Resistance (METS-IR), which have demonstrated associations with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality— eGDR may provide a more tailored and clinically relevant measure of cardio-metabolic risk [49,50]. This advantage likely stems from its integrative formulation, incorporating both clinical (waist circumference, blood pressure status) and biochemical (HbA1c) markers, thereby providing a more physiologically relevant reflection of insulin sensitivity [51,52]. Furthermore, unlike indices reliant solely on fasting parameters or lipid profiles, eGDR has shown consistent prognostic validity across both clinical endpoints [11,53]. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential of eGDR as a clinically accessible and robust tool for stratifying cardio-metabolic risk in individuals with T1DM.

Beyond its association with broader cardiovascular outcomes, eGDR also demonstrated a significant inverse association with the risk of CAD in individuals with T1DM [54,55]. Although all three included studies reported statistically significant associations in the same direction, a sensitivity analysis showed that excluding the largest study (Mutter et al.) [54] substantially widened the confidence interval and rendered the result non-significant. The remaining studies continued to show estimates in the same direction, but with less statistical precision. The influence of the Mutter et al. study is partly attributable to its larger sample size and inclusion of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a population with elevated baseline cardiovascular risk that may have contributed to the strength of the observed association. While no between-study heterogeneity was detected (I² = 0%), the small number of included studies—all observational—limits the certainty of this finding. Taken together, these results suggest a potentially important link between lower eGDR and increased CAD risk, though further research is needed to confirm this relationship in broader T1DM populations.

Evidence for an association between eGDR and subclinical atherosclerosis remains limited and inconclusive. Only two studies have investigated this relationship, each using a different vascular imaging modality. Karamanakos et al. assessed arterial stiffness through carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) [13], while Sánchez-García et al. evaluated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis [56]. Both studies reported an inverse association between eGDR and subclinical atherosclerosis, although neither result reached statistical significance. The pooled estimate was also non-significant, with no observed heterogeneity. While the direction of the association was consistent across studies, the wide confidence intervals and variation in imaging methods and endpoint definitions contribute to uncertainty. Further research using standardized measures and larger sample sizes is needed to clarify whether eGDR is associated with subclinical vascular disease. The observed association between eGDR and CAD may be partly explained by several hypothesized mechanisms through which insulin resistance contributes to atherogenesis, including impaired metabolic flexibility, endothelial dysfunction due to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, increased pro-coagulant activity, platelet aggregation, low-grade inflammation, altered macrophage function, and autonomic imbalance [37,57,58]. Given that eGDR incorporates clinical and metabolic indicators reflective of IR, lower values may reflect a greater burden of these pathophysiologic disturbances, contributing to heightened risk of both clinical and potentially subclinical vascular disease in individuals with T1DM [59,60].

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the number of eligible studies was limited, particularly for analyses related to CAD and subclinical atherosclerosis, which may affect the generalizability and precision of the pooled estimates. Second, all included studies were observational, which introduces the risk of residual confounding and limits the ability to infer causality. Third, there was heterogeneity in how eGDR was calculated and which covariates were adjusted for across studies, which may have introduced variability in effect estimates. Fourth, the absence of individual patient data (IPD) precluded standardized covariate adjustment across studies. Fifth, the eGDR thresholds used to define exposure categories were not standardized, limiting our ability to define consistent clinical risk categories. Finally, the limited ethnic and geographic diversity of study populations may restrict the applicability of findings to broader global populations.

The clinical implications of this meta-analysis are substantial, highlighting the value of the eGDR as a practical and non-invasive surrogate marker of IR in individuals with T1DM. As eGDR is calculated from routinely collected clinical parameters, it serves as a cost-effective tool for cardiovascular risk stratification in both clinical and research settings. Integrating eGDR into standard cardiovascular risk assessments could enable earlier identification of high-risk individuals and support more tailored prevention strategies. Clinicians should consider routine monitoring of eGDR, in addition to glycemic control and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Future prospective studies are warranted to validate the predictive utility of eGDR and to determine whether improving insulin sensitivity can translate into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular risk among individuals with T1DM.

Lower eGDR is consistently associated with increased risks of MACE, CAD, and all-cause mortality in individuals with T1DM, reinforcing its value as a surrogate marker of insulin resistance and cardiovascular vulnerability. Integration of eGDR into clinical practice could enhance risk stratification and inform preventive strategies aimed at mitigating the burden of cardiovascular disease in T1DM.
