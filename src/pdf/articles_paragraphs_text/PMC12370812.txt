Human scabies is an arthropod-borne disease considered a public health problem in some countries worldwide, and its incidence is increasing with rising temperatures in various regions. This is a descriptive cross-sectional retrospective study conducted from 2016 to 2024. Disease data were obtained from the Center for Disease Control of Ardabil University of Medical Sciences. Geographically weighted regression, kriging, and inverse distance weighting were used to investigate spatial correlation and model the disease by ArcMap GIS 10.8.2 software. The prevalence of scabies has increased from 6 per 100,000 people in 2016 to 13.22 in 2024. High-risk areas for the disease detected in the central region have a standard deviation of 1.5–2.5% higher than other regions of the province; this region is considered a critical hotspot for scabies with 84.66% of cases being female and 15.34% male (P< 0.05). The more than doubling of the disease prevalence in Ardabil province and the dispersion of the disease in various regions, especially the central regions, should be considered by health officials in Ardabil province.

Human scabies is one of the most significant neglected tropical diseases worldwide (M.2009). It is a skin disease, also known as 7-year itch or Norwegian scabies (Colloff and Spiekma1992). The most common clinical symptoms include scaling and severe itching especially at night, scratch wounds, thickened skin, skin rashes, and neurological symptoms (Khoobdel and A.-H.S., Hanafi-Bojd AA, Bakhshi H, Jafari A, Moradi M.2022). The causative agent is a mite from the Sarcoptidae family, which causes disease in humans or animals by burrowing under the skin and feeding on lymphatic fluids beneath the skin (El-Moamly2021). Two species from this family,Sarcoptes scabiei(Linneaus, 1758) andNotoedres cati(Hering, 1838), are better known as skin ectoparasites (Nazari and Azizi2014; Lassa et al.2011). TheseS. scabieifeed on lymphatic fluids beneath the skin and burrow (create tunnels) as they move (Christe et al.2007). They also lay eggs under the skin. Although their lifespan is about 4 to 6 weeks, the disease persists after the mite’s death due to the eggs laid along the Sarcoptes’ path (Delaš Aždajić et al.2022). The eggs hatch within a maximum of 72 h, and the new Sarcoptes begin to burrow under the skin, reproduce, and cause itching for the host (Zhang et al.2020). Scabies can affect people of all ages, genders, and races, regardless of their socioeconomic status. The causative agent of the disease can be transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person through prolonged contact. Itching typically begins 2–3 weeks after infection. It is more commonly observed in densely populated areas. The prevalence rate is high in children, and it is also recognized as a sexually transmitted disease (Khoobdel and A.-H.S., Hanafi-Bojd AA, Bakhshi H, Jafari A, Moradi M.2022). Scabies have a global distribution, with approximately 300 million cases reported worldwide each year. The global prevalence rate of the disease varies widely, ranging from 0.2 to 72% (Nair, et al.2016; Dhimal2018). In Iran, the prevalence rate among school children is reported to be between 2 and 7.5% (Mason et al.2016; Bartosik et al.2020). Climatic variables and climate change are significant factors influencing the global prevalence of scabies (Delie et al.2024). The life cycle ofS. scabieiis entirely dependent on climatic variables, and with the migration of animal and bird hosts, this arthropod is also transferred to new geographical areas, thereby contributing to the spread of the disease (Seyedi Arani et al.2016). Consequently, this study investigates the impact of climate change on the distribution and prevalence of human scabies in northwestern Iran.

Ardabil province is located in northwestern Iran, comprising 12 counties with a population of 1,270,420. It has a mountainous climate with very cold winters and mild summers. The northern regions have lower altitudes, while the central and southern regions have higher elevations above sea level (Fig.1).

This is a descriptive cross-sectional retrospective study conducted in northwestern Iran from January 2016 to December 2024. Disease data were obtained from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) of Ardabil University of Medical Sciences. The positive cases of scabies were confirmed after referral to the reference central laboratory of the CDC using microscopic method. For the diagnosis of scabies, a skin scraping is performed from the suspected area. The tissue sample is then examined microscopically to directly confirm the presence of the scabies mite. The samples were identified using validated diagnostic keys (M.2009; Colloff and Spiekma1992).

Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to investigate spatial correlation and model the disease. In this model, location-dependent effects were examined in regression modeling. For spatial autocorrelation analysis, the variables of disease, location of disease occurrence, and time based on month and year were used. High-risk and hot-spot areas for scabies were estimated using interpolation analysis, with two methods: kriging and inverse distance weighting (IDW). ArcMap GIS 10.8.2 software was used for map production and analyses.

During this study, 802 patients were identified over 9 years. The prevalence of scabies has increased from 6 per 100,000 people in 2016 to 13.22 in 2024. Of this number, cumulatively, 411 cases were diagnosed with classic scabies and 391 cases with Norwegian scabies. The highest frequency of the disease was in the year 2023 with 27.6%, while the lowest was in the year 2020 with 3.9% (Fig.2). The temporal trend of disease prevalence indicates that the outbreak cases have been increasing in the last 9 years. The seasonal trend of the disease shows that most cases occurred during the spring and autumn, while the incidence was lower in winter. The highest distribution of the disease was in the counties of Germi (39.02972°N 48.08028°E), Namin (38.42627°N 48.482288°E), and Sarin (39.145530°N 48.07284°E), with 24.4%, 17.6%, and 11.6%, respectively (Fig.2). There is a significant difference in disease incidence between females and men, with 84.66% of cases being female and 15.34% male. Additionally, there is a significant difference in disease occurrence by location, with 515 (64.21%) residing in urban areas and 287 cases (35.79%) in rural areas. Seven hundred forty-two patients (92.52%) were treated using a 1% permethrin, 1% shampoo, and cream, and they are followed up according to national protocol until complete treatment (Table1).

Interpolation results using both IDW and kriging methods indicate a very large high-risk area located between the three regions of Ardabil, Sarein, and Nir. The risk of contracting and spreading scabies in this area is significantly higher than in other regions, and its extent stretches further towards the southern regions of Ardabil province (Fig.3). To assess the accuracy of the interpolation, cross-validation was employed, during which each data point was temporarily removed, and its value was estimated using the remaining points. The estimated value was then compared to the actual value, and this process was repeated for all points.

The results of geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis show that high-risk areas for the disease in the Sarein region have a standard deviation of 1.5–2.5% higher than other regions of the province (P< 0.05), and this region is considered a critical hotspot for scabies with a very high prevalence rate. The predictors used in this model included the independent variables of patients’ gender and the year of disease occurrence, based on the dependent variable of the disease occurrence location, which was classified as urban or rural.

The disease trend analysis also indicates that the central regions towards the south of the province are classified as high-risk areas with an upward trend in the disease, while the central regions towards the north of the province are classified as low-trend areas for scabies (Fig.4).

Human scabies, a neglected tropical disease, has been increasingly reported across Iran, with its geographical spread expanding to new areas. Our study found that the disease prevalence more than doubled, affecting multiple regions of the province. Additionally, scabies was significantly more common in women, consistent with other studies reporting higher ectoparasitic infestations among females (Khoobdel and A.-H.S., Hanafi-Bojd AA, Bakhshi H, Jafari A, Moradi M.2022; El-Moamly2021; Nazari and Azizi2014; Lassa et al.2011; Christe et al.2007).

The prevalence of the disease in the study area, like other parts of the world and Iran, is increasing, and this could be of great importance in the future for different countries in terms of the burden of the disease and the problems caused by it (Delaš Aždajić et al.2022; Zhang et al.2020). The prevalence of disease in urban areas was higher than in rural areas. However, in India, disease cases were high in rural areas (Nair, et al.2016). In western Iran, disease cases were also high in rural areas, which is inconsistent with the results of our study (Nazari and Azizi2014). Likely, the lifestyle, climate, and customs/culture of the studied communities differ (Dhimal2018). One of the most important biases in this study can be attributed to the varying access to healthcare services across different urban areas, cultural and social factors, differences in health awareness and education, as well as population density and living conditions.

Scabies were reported more frequently in individuals under 18 years of age in this study. Similar studies also found a higher incidence of the disease among school-aged children (Delaš Aždajić et al.2022; Mason et al.2016). This disease, like other ectoparasitic diseases such as pediculosis, is more prevalent in communities including schools, barracks, dormitories, and prisons (Bartosik et al.2020; Delie et al.2024). A disease hot spot has been identified in the center of Ardabil province, located among three counties. According to an unpublished report from the Health Deputy of Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, the geographical distribution has become very widespread, and our study also confirmed this. Other studies indicate that scabies in humans are expanding in Iran, with several factors such as rising temperatures, decreased rainfall, and relative humidity having a significant impact (Seyedi Arani et al.2016; Enbiale and Ayalew2018; Mnati et al.2020).

The prevalence of scabies in Ardabil province is higher in the spring and autumn, which have moderate weather, compared to other seasons. In contrast, other studies indicate that cases are more common in the cold seasons of the year (Hay et al.2012). This discrepancy may be attributed to the mountainous and cold climate of Ardabil province, which experiences extremely cold winters and mild, temperate springs and autumns. Another factor that can influence the prevalence of scabies in Ardabil province seasonally is rainfall, as the amount of precipitation is higher in the spring and autumn. A study conducted in Gambia has also confirmed the correlation between rainfall and the prevalence of this disease (Armitage et al.2019). In this study, we observed a wide distribution of human scabies in Ardabil province, northwestern Iran. Based on numerous studies worldwide, the prevalence of this disease and other pathogenic ectoparasites is strongly associated with climate change (Ajith et al.2020; Heath2021). In Ardabil province, the central regions also exhibited high levels of infestation, with significantly higher disease prevalence, compared to other areas. Other factors that contribute to the spread of scabies including increased precipitation during certain seasons, such as spring and autumn, can elevate scabies incidence by creating favorable environmental conditions for mite survival and spread (Mounsey et al.2008Feb1). The mountainous and cold climate of regions like Ardabil, with extremely cold winters and mild springs and autumns, influences seasonal disease patterns differently, compared to other areas (Romani et al.2015Dec10). Although not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, other studies highlight that crowded living environments, poor hygiene, and socioeconomic factors significantly contribute to scabies transmission globally (Engelman et al.2019Jul6).

The increasing trend of human scabies in Ardabil province, with its prevalence more than doubling, raises a public health alarm, indicating that this disease requires special attention from health authorities. Identifying a large area as a hotspot helps in implementing precise prevention and control planning in that region. It is necessary to re-educate the health and medical staff of these areas, as well as the residents. Arthropod-borne diseases and their relationship to climate change in Iran and other regions should be thoroughly investigated, and climate variables and seasonal changes must be considered in control and prevention programs. It is recommended that a structured educational program be implemented in high-risk areas by healthcare centers. Additionally, awareness should be raised to encourage all suspected cases of scabies to seek diagnosis and treatment at healthcare facilities.

The primary limitation of this study was that it only included patients who sought treatment at health centers, hospitals, and clinics. Individuals who did not seek formal medical care, relied on traditional healers, or engaged in self-treatment were not captured in this study.
