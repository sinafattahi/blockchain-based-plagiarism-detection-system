Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common neuropathy affecting the upper limbs. Carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery effectively alleviates symptoms; however, patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes post-surgery can vary significantly. This study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict post-CTR patient satisfaction and outcomes, serving as a preoperative screening tool.

Data from 303 participants diagnosed with CTS who underwent minimally invasive open carpal tunnel release (CTR) under local anesthesia were analyzed. These participants were referred to our center between January 2015 and July 2023. Outcomes evaluated included symptom severity and functional status, measured using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), as well as patient satisfaction post-CTR. Based on BCTQ scores, patients were categorized into desirable and undesirable groups: for the symptom severity scale (SSS), scores of 11–24 were classified as desirable, while scores of 25–55 were classified as undesirable; for the functional status scale (FSS), scores of 8–16 were considered desirable, and scores of 17–40 as undesirable. Four machine learning algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)—were used to predict these outcomes. The models’ performance was assessed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC).

The mean participant age was 50.8 years (± 7.76), with 76.2% female. Among the cohort, 207 patients (68%) reported satisfaction post-surgery, and 212 (70%) achieved desirable SSS outcomes. Additionally, 249 patients (82.2%) attained desirable FSS outcomes. The RF model identified grip strength, age, BMI, electrophysiological results, and symptom duration as key factors influencing clinical outcomes and satisfaction. The RF model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting patient satisfaction at 0.901 (95% CI: 0.869, 0.933), followed by SVM at 0.876 (95% CI: 0.844, 0.908), GBM at 0.872 (95% CI: 0.840, 0.904), and k-NN at 0.859 (95% CI: 0.826, 0.892). Additionally, RF demonstrated excellent sensitivity of 0.852 (95% CI: 0.817, 0.887), specificity of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.909, 0.973), and AUC of 0.894 (95% CI: 0.860, 0.927) for patient satisfaction.Regarding SSS prediction, SVM achieved the greatest accuracy of 0.892 (95% CI: 0.859, 0.925), sensitivity of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.790, 0.858), specificity of 0.961 (95% CI: 0.948, 0.974), and AUC of 0.894 (95% CI: 0.860, 0.927).For FSS prediction, RF achieved the highest accuracy of 0.933 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.945), with k-NN following at 0.890 (95% CI: 0.854, 0.925), GBM at 0.870 (95% CI: 0.837, 0.903), and SVM at 0.802 (95% CI: 0.769, 0.835). RF also recorded the best sensitivity of 0.901 (95% CI: 0.889, 0.913), specificity of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.969), and AUC of 0.932 (95% CI: 0.920, 0.944) for FSS predictions.

The strong performance of these machine learning models underscores their potential to complement clinical judgment by providing insights into expected surgical outcomes. Such tools could assist in personalized patient counseling and help reduce unnecessary surgeries.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy affecting the upper extremities, with a prevalence estimated at approximately 2.7–5.8% among adults [1,2]. It manifests as pain, numbness, tingling, or paresthesia primarily affecting the thumb, index, and middle fingers, leading to significant discomfort and functional impairment [3]. The initial management of CTS primarily involves conservative, non-surgical interventions, such as wrist splinting, physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, and ergonomic modifications [4,5]. When these measures fail to produce satisfactory symptom relief, surgical intervention—specifically, carpal tunnel release (CTR)—becomes the definitive treatment to decompress the median nerve.

Management options for CTS include open release, endoscopic release, and minimally invasive techniques, each with respective advantages and limitations [6]. Open CTR is widely regarded for its safety profile and effectiveness, but it can be associated with postoperative pain, scarring, and longer recovery times. Endoscopic methods may reduce recovery duration but require specialized skills and equipment, with a higher risk of nerve injury in certain cases [7,8]. Despite the generally favorable outcomes of CTR, not all patients experience complete symptom resolution, and some face prolonged recovery periods or persistent dissatisfaction, emphasizing the importance of preoperative prognostication.

Traditionally, clinicians rely on their experience and basic clinical parameters to estimate the likelihood of favorable surgical outcomes. However, such approaches often oversimplify the complex interplay of factors influencing recovery, leading to variability in results. Accurately predicting individual patient outcomes remains a challenge, yet it is essential for patient counseling, personalized treatment planning, and resource allocation. Recent advances in predictive analytics, particularly machine learning (ML), offer promising avenues to refine outcome prediction in CTS.

ML techniques are increasingly recognized for their ability to handle complex, nonlinear relationships and multi-factor interactions that conventional statistical models may overlook [9,10]. These methods can analyze large datasets to uncover hidden patterns, identify key predictive features, and improve the accuracy of outcome predictions. Several recent studies have demonstrated the potential advantages of ML over traditional regression models in various medical fields, including orthopedics and neurology [11–14]. However, their application specifically within CTS research remains limited. Existing studies often employ simple statistical models, such as logistic regression, which may fail to capture the intricate relationships among demographic, clinical, and electrophysiological variables influencing surgical success and patient satisfaction [15–17].

Merits and demerits of ML in CTS management include its ability to enhance predictive accuracy, identify novel risk factors, and facilitate personalized care [18]. Nevertheless, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and the need for large datasets for training remain. Additionally, some ML models act as “black boxes,” making it difficult for clinicians to understand how specific variables influence predictions, which could hinder clinical adoption.

Given these considerations, there is a clear need to evaluate the effectiveness of different ML algorithms in predicting post-CTR outcomes and patient satisfaction. While previous research has explored various factors affecting surgical results, limited efforts have been made to compare multiple ML models concurrently and determine the most accurate and clinically useful approach.

To evaluate the predictive performance of four supervised ML algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)—in assessing clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction after CTR.

To identify and rank significant variables influencing these outcomes, with RF providing insights into variable importance.

This retrospective study analyzed data from patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) who were referred for carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery at our center between January 2015 and July 2023. A total of 303 patients were included based on specific criteria: participants had to be over 18 years old, have a minimum disease duration of six months, and have previously failed medical management. Patients were excluded if they had a history of previous wrist surgery or trauma, diabetic neuropathy, or bilateral CTS. This study adheres to the STROBE guidelines, ensuring rigorous observational research standards and providing valuable insights applicable to clinicians, researchers, and patients seeking optimized, personalized care in the management of CTS.

Patient satisfaction was assessed using a self-reported nominal scale ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 indicated very low satisfaction and 10 represented very high satisfaction. Scores of 1–7 were categorized as “undesirable satisfaction,” while 8–10 were considered “desirable” [23]. All postoperative BCTQ scores and satisfaction ratings were collected at the final follow-up visit, which was consistently scheduled at the 6th postoperative month.

Potential preoperative predictors of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction post-CTR included: age, body mass index (BMI), grip strength (measured with a Jamar dynamometer), sex, symptom duration, electrophysiological findings, the affected side, thenar muscle atrophy, smoking status, hypothyroidism, specific provocative hand tests (e.g., Phalen’s sign, Tinel’s sign, Durkan’s test), and EMG abnormalities. All patients underwent minimally invasive open CTR under local anesthesia.

Given the relatively small sample size (n= 303), particular attention was paid to minimizing the risk of model overfitting and enhancing generalizability. To address this, we implemented k-fold cross-validation (with k = 10) during model training to ensure stable performance estimates across different data splits. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning was conducted via grid search within each training fold. Regularization techniques inherent to the SVM (e.g., cost parameter) and tree-based models (e.g., limiting tree depth, minimum samples per leaf) were applied to reduce complexity. These validation strategies aimed to produce models that generalize well to unseen data. Reporting of performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC) was based on the holdout test set comprising 30% of the data, further supporting the reliability of the findings.

Descriptive statistics were reported as means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and as counts and percentages for categorical variables. Univariate relationships between predictors and outcomes (including patient satisfaction post-CTR) were assessed using independent t-tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables, with statistical significance set at the 0.05 level.

Certain outcome variables, particularly the Functional Status Scale (FSS), exhibited notable class imbalance (e.g., 82.2% classified as desirable). To mitigate the potential impact of this imbalance on model performance, we employed stratified sampling during the train-test split to preserve class distribution. Additionally, for algorithms sensitive to class imbalance, such as k-NN and SVM, we applied techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) within the training set. This ensured that minority class patterns were adequately represented during model training. We also monitored performance metrics beyond overall accuracy, such as sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, to assess the impact of imbalance. The inclusion of these methods helped improve the models’ ability to generalize across both majority and minority outcome groups.

Following this preliminary analysis, machine learning (ML) methods—specifically Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—were applied to predict outcomes and satisfaction. The RF model was additionally utilized to ascertain the importance of various predictors. All statistical analyses and ML model implementations were conducted using R software version 4.0.3. The “randomForest” package was used for the RF model, the “gbm” package for GBM, the “e1071” package for SVM, and the “caret” package for performance calculations.

To prevent data leakage and ensure methodological rigor, all data preprocessing and feature selection steps were performed exclusively within the training folds during k-fold cross-validation. This included any scaling, imputation, or balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE). By confining these operations to the training set in each fold, we avoided information leakage into the validation data. No feature selection or transformation was applied to the entire dataset prior to model training or evaluation. This approach preserved the integrity of the model assessment process and ensured more realistic estimates of generalization performance.

Random Forest (RF), introduced by Berryman in 2001, is a widely recognized and effective machine learning algorithm. It functions as an ensemble classifier composed of numerous decision trees. The final class prediction for an individual (either desirable or undesirable) is derived by aggregating the predictions from all constituent decision trees. Typically, 500 trees are used to achieve optimal results. RF also employs the Gini importance index to determine the relevance of variables, which measures the increase in impurity associated with each predictor. This index enables the ranking of variables based on their impact on outcomes and patient satisfaction post-CTR [24,25].

Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is a boosting technique built upon decision trees, which has shown significant advancements in areas such as predictive modeling and disease diagnosis within healthcare. In this study, GBM was employed to forecast outcomes by sequentially training weak learners to construct a more robust model, combining individual predictions with appropriate weights. GBM specifically targets the residual errors of previous models to minimize discrepancies between actual and predicted values [13,26,27].

Introduced by Vapnik et al. in 1990, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. SVM classifies individuals into distinct classes (desirable or undesirable) by constructing optimal hyperplanes. When data from two classes cannot be linearly separated, kernel functions are utilized to project the data into a higher-dimensional space for effective classification. Among various kernel functions, the radial basis function (RBF) was selected for this study [28,29].

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification. It operates by determining a variable parameter,k, which indicates the number of nearest neighbors to consider. The k-NN approach identifies the closest data points in the training dataset relative to a query point based on distance. Subsequently, a majority vote among these nearest neighbors determines the final classification for the query. The optimal value ofkwas determined through grid search, considering options of 3, 5, 7, and 9 [12,30].

To assess the effectiveness of the machine learning models, the total sample of subjects was divided into two sets: a training set and a testing set, with a ratio of 70:30. The training set was used to build and train the models, while the testing set served to evaluate the models’ performance. The effectiveness of these machine learning methods was measured using various criteria, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC).

The study included 303 patients. The mean age of participants was 50.83 years (± 7.76), with a significant majority being women (76.2%). Post-surgery, 207 patients (68%) reported satisfaction, 212 (70%) achieved desirable Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) outcomes, and 249 (82.2%) were categorized as having desirable Functional Status Scale (FSS) outcomes.

Analysis of the data revealed that the mean age of patients reporting undesirable satisfaction was 53.18 years (± 7.19), which was statistically higher than that of the satisfied group (49.74 years ± 7.79), withP< 0.001. The mean age difference was 3.44 years (95% CI: 1.84–5.04).

Additionally, patients with desirable satisfaction demonstrated significantly greater grip strength (mean: 28.39 ± 2.78) compared to those with undesirable satisfaction (mean: 21.48 ± 6.26), withP< 0.001. The mean difference was 6.91 kg (95% CI: 4.86–8.96).

Table2highlights significant associations between qualitative variables and outcomes. SSS showed a significant relationship with symptom duration (P= 0.027, 95% CI for difference: 0.25–4.15 months), electrophysiological severity (P< 0.001), and thenar muscle atrophy (P= 0.003). Furthermore, significant associations were found between symptom duration (P= 0.001, 95% CI: 1.7–7.9 days) and thenar muscle atrophy (P= 0.002).

Other qualitative factors such as gender, involved side, smoking status, hypothyroidism, Phalen’s sign, Tinel’s sign, Durkan’s test, and EMG abnormalities did not show statistically significant univariate associations with satisfaction, SSS, or FSS at the 0.05 level.

According to the Random Forest (RF) model, key factors influencing patient satisfaction after CTR included grip strength, age, body mass index (BMI), electrophysiological measures, and symptom duration. For predicting FSS, age, BMI, grip strength, symptom duration, and electrophysiological measurements also emerged as significant factors. Similarly, for SSS, age, BMI, grip strength, symptom duration, and electrophysiological measures were identified as key predictors.

The predictive performance of the RF, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) models was assessed for SSS, FSS, and patient satisfaction post-CTR, as detailed in Table3.

For predicting patient satisfaction, the RF model exhibited the highest accuracy (0.901, 95% CI: 0.872–0.930), followed by SVM (0.876, 95% CI: 0.844–0.908), GBM (0.872, 95% CI: 0.839–0.905), and k-NN (0.859, 95% CI: 0.826–0.892). RF also demonstrated excellent sensitivity (0.852, 95% CI: 0.820–0.884), specificity (0.941, 95% CI: 0.919–0.963), and AUC (0.894, 95% CI: 0.860–0.928) for satisfaction prediction.

Regarding SSS prediction, the SVM model outperformed the others, achieving the highest accuracy (0.892, 95% CI: 0.859–0.925), sensitivity (0.824, 95% CI: 0.790–0.858), specificity (0.961, 95% CI: 0.948–0.974), and AUC (0.894, 95% CI: 0.860–0.927).

For FSS prediction, the RF model led in accuracy at 0.933 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.945), followed by k-NN at 0.890 (95% CI: 0.854, 0.925), GBM at 0.870 (95% CI: 0.837, 0.903), and SVM at 0.802 (95% CI: 0.769, 0.835). The RF model also achieved the highest sensitivity of 0.901 (95% CI: 0.889, 0.913), specificity of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.969), and AUC of 0.932 (95% CI: 0.920, 0.944) for FSS predictions.

These findings are consistent with and extend previous research [11,12]. For instance, Bae et al. reported that stronger preoperative grip strength was positively correlated with patient satisfaction after CTR, an observation mirrored in our results where grip strength ranked highest in importance across all predictive models [31]. Similarly, age was identified as a significant predictor of postoperative outcomes, in agreement with the findings of Hansen and Larsen, who noted that advanced age may be associated with delayed recovery and poorer nerve regeneration capacity [31,32]. Moreover, BMI and electrophysiological severity have been previously linked to recovery trajectories after CTR. Our results corroborate Allen et al.’s findings that higher BMI is associated with poorer outcomes and extend the work of Alimohammadi et al. by quantifying the predictive value of electrophysiological severity using ML methods [32,33].

A plausible explanation for the observed relationships lies in the multifactorial pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome. Chronic compression of the median nerve can lead to muscle atrophy and diminished nerve conduction, which may be less reversible in older individuals or those with more severe electrophysiological impairments. Similarly, grip strength likely reflects both nerve integrity and muscular reserve, making it a meaningful surrogate for functional outcome prediction [10,12,32].

This retrospective study provides a comprehensive evaluation of postoperative outcomes following carpal tunnel release (CTR) in a large and well-characterized cohort. While previous studies have examined predictors of CTR success, our findings offer distinct insights by integrating clinical variables with machine learning (ML) models to enhance prediction accuracy and identify nuanced relationships between patient characteristics and outcomes.

This retrospective analysis of 303 patients undergoing carpal tunnel release (CTR) provides meaningful insights into postoperative outcomes, highlighting key predictors of patient satisfaction, symptom severity, and functional improvement. The findings emphasize both clinical and demographic factors that can influence recovery, and also demonstrate the potential of machine learning (ML) models to predict surgical outcomes with high accuracy.

This study evaluated the predictive performance of four supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—in forecasting clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction following carpal tunnel release (CTR). Among these, the RF model consistently outperformed the others in predicting postoperative satisfaction and functional recovery, while SVM excelled in forecasting symptom severity. Key predictive features across all models included grip strength, age, BMI, electrophysiological severity, and symptom duration.

Several clinical variables emerged as significant predictors of postoperative outcomes. Older age was strongly associated with lower satisfaction, aligning with prior studies linking age with delayed nerve recovery and reduced neuroplasticity [11,12]. Importantly, even a modest mean age difference of 3.4 years between satisfied and dissatisfied patients was statistically and clinically significant, suggesting that small age variations may substantially affect perceived recovery, even within a relatively narrow age range [31,32].

Grip strength emerged as the most robust and consistent predictor across all outcomes—patient satisfaction, functional status (FSS), and symptom severity (SSS). The mean difference in grip strength between satisfied and dissatisfied patients was 6.91 kg (P< 0.001), highlighting its central role not only as a marker of motor recovery but also as a strong surrogate for surgical success. While previous studies have noted its value, few have emphasized it as a dominant determinant of satisfaction post-CTR. This insight points to the potential utility of grip-strength–oriented rehabilitation in maximizing postoperative outcomes and satisfaction [32,33].

Interestingly, BMI showed no significant association with outcomes, contradicting some earlier literature suggesting obesity as a risk factor for suboptimal CTR outcomes [5,6]. This divergence may reflect differences in study populations, outcome definitions, or confounding factors. Additionally, several traditional clinical signs—Phalen’s, Tinel’s, Durkan’s—as well as factors such as smoking, hypothyroidism, gender, and laterality, were not significantly associated with postoperative outcomes. This supports a shift toward more objective and quantifiable predictors over subjective or examiner-dependent signs in outcome forecasting [6,8,10].

A novel contribution of this study is the elevation of grip strength from a routine clinical measurement to a central predictor of surgical success and satisfaction. This finding advocates for incorporating grip strength more prominently into preoperative assessments and postoperative rehabilitation protocols.

Moreover, our results highlight a nuanced insight: symptom duration significantly influenced functional and symptom outcomes but not satisfaction. This indicates that patients may report satisfaction despite persistent symptoms, as long as key functions are restored. Such complexity suggests that psychological, social, or occupational factors may mediate the relationship between clinical improvement and patient satisfaction, warranting further exploration [14,15,21].

The finding that electrophysiological severity was predictive of symptom and functional outcomes but not satisfaction echoes this theme—objective disease burden may not always align with subjective benefit. These discrepancies underscore the need to realign outcome measures with what matters most to patients—functionality, autonomy, and perceived improvement [13,15,23].

Another significant innovation in this study is the application of ML models to predict surgical outcomes. The RF model achieved impressive metrics—accuracy up to 93.3%, sensitivity of 90.1%, and specificity of 96.0%—highlighting its potential for integration into clinical workflows. SVM performed best for SSS, suggesting that different aspects of recovery (subjective symptom burden vs. functional capability) may benefit from distinct predictive strategies.

Unlike conventional regression models, ML algorithms like RF and GBM captured complex, non-linear interactions among clinical variables. This enabled the discovery of patterns—such as the overriding importance of grip strength or the limited role of BMI—that might be missed by traditional approaches. These models also allow for real-time, individualized risk stratification, presenting a viable path toward precision medicine in surgical care [19,20,23].

The RF model’s robustness can be attributed to its ensemble learning approach, which aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees trained on bootstrap samples, integrating feature importance measures and reducing variance [17]. Its capacity to handle high-dimensional data and complex, nonlinear relationships makes it particularly suited for biomedical datasets where interactions between variables are common. In our models, grip strength emerged as the most influential predictor—ranking highest in feature importance—consistent with prior biomechanical and neurophysiological studies indicating that muscular strength post-CTR correlates with both objective recovery and subjective satisfaction [10,12].

The SVM model, utilizing a radial basis function kernel, demonstrated exceptional performance specifically in predicting symptom severity (SSS), with an accuracy of 89.2%, sensitivity of 82.4%, and specificity of 96.1%. The SVM’s ability to find optimal hyperplanes in transformed feature spaces allows it to effectively delineate the complex decision boundary between patients with mild versus severe residual symptoms, especially when the feature space includes electrophysiological and demographic variables [13,16].

GBM and k-NN, while performing adequately, lagged slightly behind RF and SVM, likely due to their relative limitations in capturing complex feature interactions or sensitivity to parameter tuning. Particularly, the k-NN’s reliance on local neighborhood information may be less effective in high-dimensional space or with imbalanced classes, despite its simplicity and interpretability [11,13,18].

Preoperative Optimization: Grip strength and functional metrics should be prioritized in assessments to guide both surgical candidacy and rehabilitation planning.

Timely Intervention: Early CTR, particularly before the onset of muscle atrophy and prolonged symptom duration, may enhance functional recovery.

Patient-Centered Care: Given the disconnect between objective severity and subjective satisfaction, preoperative counseling should address functional expectations and psychological readiness.

Technology Integration: ML models can be embedded into electronic health records to provide data-driven, patient-specific outcome predictions, enhancing shared decision-making.

A key strength of this study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of multiple ML models and the inclusion of both objective clinical measures (e.g., electrophysiology, grip strength) and patient-reported outcomes. This dual approach enhances the applicability of the findings to real-world clinical settings.

This study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, the relatively small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings and increase the risk of overfitting, where models perform well on training data but poorly on unseen cases. A larger dataset would better capture the heterogeneity of clinical presentations and enhance model robustness. Second, the retrospective design precludes the assessment of causal relationships and long-term outcomes, including sustained patient satisfaction following surgery. Lastly, although several machine learning algorithms were evaluated, the study did not explore more advanced or ensemble techniques that may offer improved predictive accuracy, particularly in the presence of larger datasets. These limitations underscore the need for future prospective studies involving larger and more diverse patient populations to validate and build upon the current results. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that ML models, particularly RF, can serve as valuable tools in preoperative counseling and individualized risk stratification for patients undergoing CTR. By identifying patients at higher risk of suboptimal outcomes, clinicians can better manage expectations, optimize modifiable risk factors (e.g., BMI, grip strength), and potentially defer surgery when the predicted benefit is low.

This study evaluated the performance of four supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes following carpal tunnel release (CTR). Among the models tested, the random forest (RF) algorithm consistently achieved the highest accuracy across all outcome measures, including the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), Functional Status Scale (FSS), and overall patient satisfaction. The most influential predictors identified by the RF model were grip strength, age, BMI, symptom duration, and electrophysiological severity. These findings suggest that ML models—particularly RF—can effectively support preoperative assessment by identifying patients who are more likely to experience favorable outcomes. While the results are promising, they should be interpreted within the context of the study’s retrospective design and sample size, and further validation in larger, prospective cohorts is warranted.
