In plants, autophagy is a conserved recycling system essential for development and stress responses by targeting cellular components for massive degradation in the vacuole. Our previous work suggested that autophagy contributes to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) stress responses by modulating NADPH-oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis; however, the molecular link between extracellular ROS and autophagy remains unknown. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify components involved in autophagy, using the central autophagy component ATG8e as a bait. We identified MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX/PERFORIN-LIKE 2 (MACP2) as an interactor of ATG8e via its the ATG8-interacting motif and confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays.MACP2-overexpressing lines showed enhanced sensitivity to nutritional starvation, accelerated leaf senescence, and increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, resembling the phenotypes ofatgmutants defective in autophagy. Conversely,macp2knockouts exhibited diminished starvation-induced H2O2accumulation and attenuated autophagosome formation and fully suppressed the starvation-hypersensitive phenotypes of theatg5-1mutant. In particular, MACP2 was degraded through the autophagy machinery during prolonged starvation, suggesting a feedback regulatory mechanism for maintaining MACP2 homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MACP2 acts as a key regulator in autophagy induction by controlling influx of extracellular H2O2in Arabidopsis.

In plants, autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that modulates responses to environmental stresses and development cues by targeting intracellular components for degradation (Bassham et al.2006; Huang et al.2019; Qi et al.2021;2023). The hallmark of autophagy is the formation of a double-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome, which facilitates the degradation of enclosed cargoes through the resident acid hydrolases of vacuoles (Liu & Bassham2012; Zhuang et al.2018; Qi et al.2021;2023). Several autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) have been shown to play indispensable roles at different stages of autophagosome formation via the assembly of four protein complexes: the ATG1–ATG13 protein kinase complex, the ATG6–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, the ATG9 membrane delivery complex, and the ATG5–ATG12 and ATG8–phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) complexes (Li & Vierstra2012; Qi et al.2021;2023; Huang & Guo2024). Among ATGs, the ubiquitin-like conjugation protein ATG8 is a key regulator in mediating selective recruitment of cargoes to the autophagosome (Kellner et al.2017). During selective autophagy, receptors interact with ATG8 through specific ATG8-interacting motif (AIM) or LIR-interacting motifs, characterized by the consensus amino acid sequence W/F/Y-X-X-L/I/V (Liu & Bassham2012; Marshall et al.2019; Acheampong et al.2020). Upon autophagy induction, ATG8 also interacts with several ATGs, such as ATG1 (Nakatogawa et al.2012), ATG4s (Yoshimoto et al.2004), ATG6, and ATG7 (Kaufmann et al.2014; Kaufmann & Wollert2014), for either cargo recruitment or self-maintenance.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are pivotal signaling molecules during plant interactions with their environment (Mittler et al.2022). As they are by-products of cellular metabolic pathways, the reactivity of ROS is a double-edged sword; at low levels, ROS function as key secondary messengers to maintain plant growth and development, while the excessive accumulation of ROS poses a substantial threat to cellular macromolecules by causing their irreversible oxidation (Halliwell2007; Castro et al.2021). Moreover, ROS production in different subcellular compartments, including the apoplast and intracellular organelles, initiates specific oxidative signaling pathways in plant cells (Castro et al.2021).

Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy modulates cellular ROS homeostasisin planta(Chen et al.2015a; Huang et al.2019; Qi et al.2021). ROS accumulation inside cells is responsible for the oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, or even organelles, which activates autophagy for their clearance (Xiong et al.2007; Qi et al.2021). In particular, autophagy distinguishes itself by its capacity to eliminate entire mitochondria and peroxisomes, two ROS-generating organelles, thereby limiting intracellular ROS production (Zhou et al.2022). By contrast, apoplastic ROS are primarily produced by plasma membrane–localized flavin-containing NADPH oxidases, with the NADPH oxidases RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) and RBOHF being major players in apoplast ROS production (Castro et al.2021). Previous studies have suggested that RBOHs are required in the leaves and roots of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants for autophagosome biogenesis in response to hypoxia and for plant tolerance to submergence or waterlogging (Chen et al.2015a; Guan et al.2019). Thus, apoplastic ROS likely contribute to the regulation of stress responses through the functionality of autophagy. However, the molecular link between extracellular ROS and autophagy induction is still unknown.

Members of the MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX AND PERFORIN (MACP) family are major regulators during pathogen infections and the microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity in a variety of organisms (Rosado et al.2008; Fukunaga et al.2017). A signature motif, comprising the sequence Y/S-G-T/S–H-X7-G-G (X), has been identified in MACPFs from animals and plants (Ni & Gilbert2017; Yu et al.2020; Chen et al.2021; Holmes et al.2021). Upon their oligomerization, MACPFs play key roles in animal development and immunity by forming pores in cellular membranes (Lukoyanova et al.2016; Moreno-Hagelsieb et al.2017). However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of plant MACPFs are poorly understood. In Arabidopsis, four genes encode proteins with a conserved MACPF motif:CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVATED CELL DEATH 1(CAD1),NECROTIC SPOTTED LESION 1(NSL1),MACP1, andMACP2(Yu et al.2020; Zhang et al.2022). Among these genes, mutation ofCAD1orNSL1constitutively activates plant defense responses and leads to programmed cell death in a salicylic acid-(SA) dependent manner (Morita-Yamamuro et al.2005; Noutoshi et al.2006; Tsutsui et al.2006; Asada et al.2011; Fukunaga et al.2017; Chen et al.2021). MACP2 regulates programmed cell death and participates in bacterial pathogen resistance and necrotrophic fungal pathogen susceptibility (Zhang et al.2022). These observations suggest that MACPFs are likely key factors in regulating plant defense signaling.

In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to uncover the ATG8-interaction network and identified MACP2 as a potential ATG8 interactor in Arabidopsis. We determined that MACP2 modulates extracellular H2O2-induced autophagosome biogenesis in response to carbon or nitrogen starvation. Under long-term starvation, however, the MACP2–ATG8 association led to MACP2 degradation via autophagy, revealing a maintenance mechanism for MACP2 protein abundance during prolonged nutritional starvation in plant cells.

Previous work suggested that during plant stress responses, autophagy acts as a protective mechanism to maintain the cellular ROS homeostasis (Chen et al.2015a; Guan et al.2019). To investigate the molecular link between plant autophagy and stress-induced ROS accumulation, we screened for interactors of ATG8e by conducting a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified 15 candidate interacting proteins with functions related to the categories of protein kinase, protein transport family, and decarboxylase, to name a few (Table1). Among the 15 candidates, we noticed the H2O2-scavenging enzyme CATALASE 3 (CAT3) (Zou et al.2015) and a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) from subgroup VI_A2 participating in plant growth and morphogenesis (Valkai et al.2020). We also obtained ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM MORPHOLOGY 2 (ERMO2), a Sec23/Sec24 transport family protein involved in endoplasmic reticulum–to–Golgi trafficking (Qu et al.2014), confirming the connection between autophagy and endomembrane systems (Xia et al.2020). In particular, the protein MACP2 caught our attention because it regulates programmed cell death and participates in bacterial pathogen resistance and necrotrophic fungal pathogen susceptibility (Zhang et al.2022). Moreover,MACP2is widely expressed in various plant tissues and its transcript levels are upregulated in response to several biotic and abiotic stresses (Yu et al.2020). Thus, we chose MACP2 to explore the significance of its association with ATG8.

To explore the potential relationship between MACP2 and ATG8, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of MACP2 and related proteins and examined its protein structure and sequence. In Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa), MACP members clustered into three groups based on the phylogenetic tree topology (Fig.1a). Among them, MACP2 is closely related to NSL1 in the second group of the MACP family. A comparison of the MACP2 sequence to those of EXO70Ds (Acheampong et al.2020) revealed a characteristic xLIR (G132–L137) domain, representing the primary ATG8-interacting motif (AIM), located within the MACPF domain of MACP2 and NSL1, as determined by the iLIR database (Fig.1b, Fig. S1). Moreover, structural predictions confirmed the presence of an xLIR domain within a β-pleated sheet in MACP2 and an α-helix in NSL1 (Fig.1c, Fig. S1). By contrast, the other two MACPs of Arabidopsis, MACP1 and CAD1, lacked this AIM (Fig. S1).

To test the interaction between MACP2 and ATG8ein planta, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. To this end, we co-transfected mesophyll protoplasts prepared from wild-type Arabidopsis plants with the constructsMACP2-HA(encoding MACP2 with a HA tag) andFLAG-eGFP-ATG8e(encoding a fusion between the green fluorescent protein [eGFP] and ATG8e, together with a FLAG tag) and incubated the transfected cells in darkness for 16 h. When we precipitated ATG8e with anti-FLAG antibodies, we detected MACP2-HA among the immunoprecipitated proteins. To determine the dependence of MACP2-ATG8e interaction on the AIM domain of MACP2, we generated a point mutant form of MACP2 in which the conserved Phe-134 (F134) and Leu-137 (L137) residues were changed to Ala (MACP2F134A, L137A, M1) to disrupt the AIM domain. As expected, when we co-transfected the constructsMACP2 M1-HAandFLAG-eGFP-ATG8ein protoplast cells, FLAG-eGFP-ATG8e did not co-precipitate with MACP2 M1-HA (Fig.1d). As negative controls, FLAG-eGFP did not co-precipitate with MACP2-HA and MACP2 M1-HA (Fig.1d).

Similarly, BiFC assays showed that after incubation in continuous light for 12 h, protoplasts co-transfected withMACP2-nYFPandcYFP-ATG8edemonstrated reconstitution of functional YFP at the plasma membrane, indicative of the MACP2–ATG8e interaction (Fig.1e). By contrast, co-transfection ofMACP2 M1-nYFPandcYFP-ATG8efailed to produce an intact YFP signal (Fig.1e). Furthermore, after treatment with the autophagy inducer benzo [1,2,3] thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH, salicylic acid agonist) and the inhibitor of vacuole-type ATPase concanamycin A (ConA), which inhibits the degradation of autophagic bodies, leading to their accumulation (Chen et al.2015a; Qi et al.2017;2023), we observed the accumulation of YFP signal in punctate structures (Fig.1e). As controls, thenYFP+cYFP-ATG8eandMACP2-nYFP+cYFPcombinations did not yield any YFP signal (Fig.1e). Taken together, these results suggest that MACP2 interacts with ATG8 through its AIM in vivo.

Previous studies have indicated that the autophagic degradation of chloroplasts occurs during natural premature leaf senescence and in response to nitrogen or carbon deprivation (Wada et al.2009; Avila-Ospina et al.2014; Qi et al.2017;2023). Conversely, autophagy-defective mutants are characterized by premature leaf senescence and hypersensitivity to nutrient deprivation (Hanaoka et al.2002; Chung et al.2010; Qi et al.2017). Given that MACP2 interacts with ATG8e, we sought genetic evidence to support the potential role ofMACP2in autophagy. Accordingly, we obtained previously published knockout mutants (macp2-1andmacp2-2) and overexpression lines (MACP2-OEs) forMACP2(Zhang et al.2022) for phenotypic analysis. 4-week-old wild-type,macp2, andMACP2-OE plants did not exhibit leaf senescence phenotypes when grown under normal conditions in a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod (Fig.2a). Notably, the cotyledons and several true leaves ofMACP2-OE plants turned yellow in 5-week-old plants, while those in wild-type andmacp2plants remained green (middle image; Fig.2a). Moreover, 6-week-oldmacp2andMACP2-OE plants displayed delayed and accelerated senescence, respectively, of their true leaves compared to those of wild-type plants (bottom image, Fig.2a). We confirmed the above findings by measuring the relative chlorophyll contents of all genotypes and we observed no difference in the chlorophyll contents of 4-week-old plants, while those of 6-week-oldmacp2mutants were significantly higher than that of the wild type. Similarly, the chlorophyll contents of 5- and 6-week-oldMACP2-OE lines were significantly lower than in the wild type at the corresponding stage (Fig.2b).

To more directly assess the involvement of MACP2 in the autophagy pathway, we subjected the wild type, themacp2mutants, and theMACP2-OE lines to carbon or nitrogen starvation by transfer into constant darkness or to nitrogen-free growth medium, respectively. We observed that 4-week-oldmacp2andMACP2-OE lines transferred to constant darkness for 7 d displayed enhanced and attenuated resistance, respectively, to fixed carbon starvation compared to wild type (Fig.2c). In agreement, the chlorophyll contents of themacp2andMACP2-OE lines were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than that of wild-type plants upon carbon starvation (Fig.2d). As with carbon starvation, 7-d-oldmacp2andMACP2-OE seedlings displayed increased and decreased tolerance of nitrogen deprivation, respectively, relative to the wild type when transferred to nitrogen-free Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium for 5 d (Fig.2e). Again, we confirmed these results by measuring the relative chlorophyll contents of all genotypes (Fig.2f). Together, these results suggest that MACP2 is likely a positive regulator of autophagy in plants.

Autophagy has previously been shown to be essential for the disposal of damaged organelles and the maintenance of cellular ROS homeostasis in plants under stress conditions; these responses are controlled by the SA signaling pathway (Liu & Bassham2012; Chen et al.2015a; Guo et al.2021). Given that SA and ROS accumulate in Arabidopsisatgmutants (Yoshimoto et al.2009), we measured the endogenous contents for SA and SA glycoside (SAG) of 4-, 5-, and 6-week-old wild-type,macp2, andMACP2-OE plants grown under normal conditions. We observed few significant differences in SA and SAG contents among 4-week-old wild-type,macp2, andMACP2-OE plants (Fig.3a). However, in 5- and 6-week-old plants, the SA and SAG contents inmacp2andMACP2-OE plants were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than those in the wild type (Fig.3a).

To investigate the correlation between SA and the leaf senescence phenotype ofmacp2andMACP2-OE plants, we assessed the transcript levels of senescence-associated genes and of SA-associated defense-responsive genes. Consistent with the senescence phenotypes, we detected a significant upregulation in the transcript levels of the senescence-associated genesSENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE13(SAG13),SAG29,SAG113, andSENESCENCE4(SEN4), as well as of the defense genesPATHOGENESIS-RELATED1(PR1),PR5,SULFURTRANSFERASE1(ST1),ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE2(EDR2) andWRKY53in theMACP2-OE lines compared to the wild type (Fig.3b). By contrast, the transcript levels ofSAG113,PR1, andEDR2were lower in the 6-week-oldmacp2lines than in the wild type (Fig.3b).

To explore the regulation of MACP2-mediated leaf senescence by SA signaling, we obtained theMACP2-OEpad4(OEpad4) andMACP2-OEeds1(OEeds1) lines (Zhang et al.2022) for phenotypic analysis. Compared to wild-type,eds1, andpad4plants, the accelerated natural senescence (Fig.3c) and starvation hypersensitivity (Fig.3e, Fig. S2a) phenotypes seen inMACP2-OE (OE-1) were attenuated by theeds1andpad4mutations in the OEeds1and OEpad4lines, which was also reflected in the relative chlorophyll contents of these genotypes (Fig.3d, f, Fig. S2b). Thus, the accelerated aging senescence seen inMACP2-OE plants is dependent on the SA pathway.

To examine a possible association between the senescence phenotypes and ROS levels inmacp2andMACP2-OE lines, we measured the total hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the plants of all genotypes plants during senescence and nutritional starvation using an Amplex Red-based fluorescence assay. The 5- and 6-week-oldMACP2-OE plants exhibited significantly higher H2O2levels than the wild type, while 6-week-oldmacp2mutant plants displayed significantly lower H2O2levels when grown under normal conditions (Fig.4a). Following 7 d of carbon or nitrogen starvation,macp2andMACP2-OE plants exhibited significantly lower and higher H2O2levels, respectively, than the wild type (Fig.4b, c), suggesting that MACP2 may be involved in maintaining cellular ROS homeostasis in response to senescence and nutrient starvation.

To examine whether the phenotypes of nutrient starvation inmacp2mutants were associated with intracellular ROS contents, we measured H2O2levels in the roots of 7-d-oldpHyPertransgenic lines in wild type andmacp2backgrounds (WTpHyPer,macp2 pHyPer) upon carbon starvation. HyPer is a genetically H2O2-specific biosensor to be nicely correlated with intracellular H2O2changes by determining the ratio of fluorescent signals at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm relative to that at 405 nm (Hernández-Barrera et al.2013; Shi et al.2022; Krüger et al.2021). As shown in Fig.4, we observed that the ratio of fluorescent signals was enhanced after carbon starvation in the roots of wild type (Fig.4d, e). Moreover, we showed that the ratio of fluorescent signals inmacp2was substantially lower than that of wild type before and after carbon starvation (Fig.4d, e), indicating that the mutation ofMACP2in plants inhibits the influx of H2O2in plant cells.

In plant cells, the excess ROS activates the production of antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH), to eliminate ROS-induced damage and maintain cellular homeostasis (Sharma et al.2012; Yuan et al.2017). Given that elevated levels of H2O2were detected inMACP2-OE plants under nutritional starvation stress, we further investigated the effects of GSH application on the sensitivity of carbon-deficient treatment in wild-type,MACP2-OE, andatg5-1seedlings. Under normal growth conditions (CK), theMACP2-OE (OE-1 and OE-2), andatg5-1seedlings exhibited little morphological changes from that of wild type with or without 500 μM GSH application for 12 d. However, the increased sensitivities ofMACP2-OE plants to the carbon starvation (C −) were completely rescued by supplying GSH in carbon-free solid half-strength MS growth medium (Fig. S3a). As a control, the hyper-sensitive phenotypes ofatg5-1mutant were also partly restored by 500 μM GSH application (Fig. S3a). These findings were further confirmed by measuring the relative chlorophyll contents of all genotypes, which showed thatMACP2-OE (OE-1, OE-2) andatg5-1plants accumulated significantly less chlorophylls than the wild type upon carbon starvation. With comparison, we did not observe the difference between wild type andMACP2-OE lines upon starvation with GSH supplied (Fig. S3b).

Given that MACP2 is important for plant senescence and susceptibility to nutrient starvation, we investigated the genetic relationship between MACP2 and the autophagy pathway. To this end, we generated twomacp2 atg5(macp2-1 atg5-1andmacp2-2 atg5-1) double mutants by crossing eachmacp2mutant toatg5-1. As shown in Fig.5a, compared to wild type, themacp2mutants had delayed leaf senescence, while theatg5-1mutants showed an accelerated leaf senescence phenotype, confirming previous findings (Liu & Bassham2012). Importantly, themacp2 atg5double mutants displayed a partial rescue of the accelerated senescence phenotype seen inatg5-1, with fewer yellow leaves thanatg5-1at both 5 and 6 weeks (Fig.5a). We confirmed this observation by quantification of relative chlorophyll contents. Themacp2 atg5double mutants accumulated significantly more chlorophyll thanatg5-1, with levels comparable to that of the wild type in 6-week-old plants (Fig.5b). Similarly, theatg5-1mutant was hypersensitive to carbon or nitrogen starvation (Fig.5c, Fig. S4a), as previously reported (Liu & Bassham2012). However, 4-week-oldmacp2 atg5plants displayed enhanced tolerance of starvation, with more non-senescing green leaves, resembling themacp2mutants (Fig.5c, Fig. S4a). We confirmed these results by determining relative chlorophyll contents (Fig.5d, Fig. S4b).

Several autophagy-deficient mutants includingatg5-1were shown to constitutively accumulate ROS, which contributes to the age- and starvation-dependent promotion of leaf senescence in these mutants (Yoshimoto et al.2009). Since themacp2mutants accumulate lower ROS levels in response to starvation (Fig.4b, c), we speculated that the recovery of the senescence phenotypes seen inatg5-1bymacp2may be related to H2O2contents. To test this possibility, we examined the H2O2contents in wild-type,macp2,atg5-1andmacp2 atg5plants during natural senescence and upon nutrient starvation. Compared to theatg5-1mutant, H2O2levels were significantly lower in 5- and 6-week-oldmacp2 atg5double mutant plants experiencing natural senescence (Fig.5e), as inmacp2 atg5double mutant plants under fixed carbon starvation for 7 d (Fig.5f). These results support the idea that the phenotypes observed in themacp2 atg5double mutants are due to their reduced ROS production. These findings indicate that MACP2 may regulate autophagy by modulating ROS dynamics in response to age- and starvation-mediated senescence.

To further explore the involvement of MACP2 in regulating autophagy, we crossed themacp2-1mutant andMACP2-OE line to a transgenic line expressingeGFP-ATG8e, which is widely used as an autophagosome marker (Xiao et al.2010; Chen et al.2015a), to generate themacp2-1eGFP-ATG8eandMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8elines. We subjected theeGFP-ATG8e(eGFP-ATG8ein the wild-type background), andmacp2-1eGFP-ATG8eandMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8elines to normal growth conditions or to constant darkness in the presence or absence of 1 μM ConA for 16 h. An examination of fluorescence patterns by confocal microscopy suggested that in the absence of ConA treatment, the numbers of eGFP-ATG8e-labeled autophagic puncta in the root cells ofeGFP-ATG8eandmacp2-1 eGFP-ATG8elines were comparable regardless of fixed carbon starvation (Fig.6a, b). Upon 12-h carbon starvation, however, the numbers of autophagic puncta in the root cells ofMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8ewas significantly increased than that ofeGFP-ATG8ecells (Fig.6a, b). Moreover, the puncta in theeGFP-ATG8eline were markedly increased upon carbon starvation in the presence of ConA (C − + ConA; Fig.6a, b). Notably, starvation-induced autophagic puncta accumulated in the root cells ofmacp2-1 eGFP-ATG8eandMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8ewere significantly lower and higher, respectively, than that ofeGFP-ATG8ewith ConA application (Fig.6a, b). As an independent method to measure autophagic flux, we employed the release of free eGFP to monitor the degradation of the eGFP-ATG8e reporter into the vacuole by autophagy (Qi et al.2017;2023). Consistent with the above confocal microscopy results, the ratio of free eGFP/eGFP-ATG8e following carbon starvation was lower inmacp2-1 eGFP-ATG8eand higher inMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8eseedlings, compared to theeGFP-ATG8eline (Fig.6c), indicating that MACP2 is required for the starvation-induced formation of autophagosomes in Arabidopsis.

Given that MACP2 influences the production of autophagosomes in plant responses to nutritional starvation, we further investigate the potential role of MACP2 in modulating ROS-induced autophagy biogenesis. To this end, we subjected theeGFP-ATG8e,macp2-1eGFP-ATG8e, andMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8elines to half-strength MS liquid medium with 100 μM H2O2and SA agonist BTH (benzo [1,2,3] thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester) for the indicated times and then observed by confocal microscopy. We suggested that both treatments induced the formation of eGFP-ATG8e-labbled autophagic puncta significantly compared to the control in WT background (Fig. S5a-d), confirming previous findings (Xiong et al.2007; Yoshimoto et al.2009; He et al.2023). Moreover, we showed that compared to the WT plants, themacp2-1mutant andMACP2-OE accumulated significant less or more autophagic puncta in response to either H2O2or BTH (Fig. S5a-d).

To verify the link between MACP2 and autophagy, we determined the subcellular localization of MACP2 in transgenic lines expressingMACP2-YFP(Zhang et al.2022). Confocal microscopy showed that under normal growth conditions, the MACP2-YFP fusion predominantly localized at the plasma membrane in the root cells of 7-d-old seedlings (Fig.7a). However, when the seedlings were transferred to constant darkness (C −) or subjected to nitrogen starvation treatment (N −) for 12 h, fluorescent signals for MACP2-YFP appeared to accumulate as vesicles in the cytoplasm (Fig.7a-c). In theYFPcontrol line, we detected YFP signals in the cytoplasm and the nucleus under both normal growth conditions and nutrition starvation (C‒ and N −; Fig.7a).

To determine the nature of the punctate MACP2-YFP signals, we tested the colocalization of MACP2 with the autophagosome marker ATG8. To this end, we generated aMACP2-YFP mCherry-ATG8fdouble transgenic line by crossingMACP2-YFPwithmCherry-ATG8fencoding a fusion between the red fluorescent protein mCherry and ATG8f (Xia et al.2020). Indeed, the starvation-induced punctate dots of MACP2-YFP primarily colocalized with mCherry-ATG8f in the root cells of 7-d-old seedlings upon 12 h of carbon or nitrogen starvation in the presence of ConA (Fig.7b, Fig. S6), suggesting that MACP2 associates with starvation-induced autophagosomesin planta.

To explore the potential regulatory mechanism linking autophagy and MACP2, we assayed the stability of MACP2 by using 7-d-oldpUBQ10:MACP2-FLAGtransgenic seedlings (Fig. S7). Immunoblot analysis revealed the accumulation of MACP2-FLAG for the first 24 h following transfer to constant darkness, followed by a marked drop in abundance after 48 h of darkness (Fig.7d), indicating that MACP2 itself is degraded under long-term stress exposure. When we repeated the experiment in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or ConA, which inhibits the degradation of autophagic bodies (Qi et al.2017,2023; Xia et al.2020), we discovered that the application of ConA, but not MG132, suppresses the degradation of MACP2 during darkness for 48 h (Fig.7d). To verify this finding, we transfected theMACP2-HAconstruct into Arabidopsis protoplasts isolated from the wild type, the autophagy mutantatg5-1, and the dual ATG8/Ubiquitin receptor mutantrpn10-1defective in REGULATORY PARTICLE NON-ATPASE 10 function (Smalle et al.2003; Marshall et al.2015). We then incubated all protoplasts for up to 6 h in the presence of the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; Nazio et al.2016;2017). A protein stability assay revealed that MACP2-HA accumulated during the first 4 h of CHX treatment, but decreased after 6 h in continuous darkness in wild-type protoplasts (Fig.7e). However, this degradation of MACP2-HA was substantially attenuated in theatg5-1andrpn10-1mutants under the same conditions (Fig.7e), indicating that the autophagy pathway mediates the degradation of MACP2 under darkness. Furthermore, we investigated the protein abundance of MACP2 and MACP2F134A,L137Avariant (MACP2 M1) in wild-type andatg8eArabidopsis protoplasts under darkness for up to 8 h in the presence of CHX. Immunoblot analysis showed the degradation of MACP2-HA was faster inatg8ethan in wild type. By contrast, the protein abundance of MACP2 M1-HA showed no difference in wild type andatg8e(Fig. S8). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that autophagy regulates MACP2 protein stability during darkness starvation exposure.

In plants, autophagy is a degradation pathway that recycles damaged or unwanted cell materials and other macromolecules during development or upon exposure to abiotic and biotic stress (Liu & Bassham2012; Signorelli et al.2019). Increasing evidence demonstrates that autophagy and ROS are interconnected; that is, ROS can induce autophagy, and autophagy in turn contributes to lowering excessive ROS accumulation (Signorelli et al.2019; Zhou et al.2022). ROS are important early signaling molecules in plant responses to environmental stresses, but excess ROS may cause severe damage to cellular components. Under these circumstances, autophagy is a key mechanism by which ROS levels are kept under control during plant stress responses, possibly by modulating the degradation of ROS-generating organelles (Signorelli et al.2019; Castro et al.2021). However, how ROS, and particularly extracellular H2O2, induce autophagy remains largely unknown to date.

In this study, we present several lines of evidence to support the idea that the membrane attack complex and perforin family protein MACP2 functions as a key regulator of autophagy induction by controlling the influx of extracellular H2O2in Arabidopsis. First, MACP2 interacted with ATG8e via its conserved AIM in vivo and translocated from the plasma membrane to autophagosomes in response to nutrient starvation (Fig.1,7). Second, knockout ofMACP2(macp2) enhanced plant tolerance to nutrient starvation and delayed leaf senescence. Conversely,MACP2-overexpressing lines (MACP2-OEs) showed increased sensitivity to nutrient starvation and accelerated leaf senescence (Fig.2,3, and5). Third,macp2andMACP2-OEs lines showed significantly lower or higher SA and H2O2levels, respectively, than wild-type plants during natural age-dependent senescence or in response to nutrient starvation in an SA-dependent manner (Fig.3,4). Fourth, upon nutrient starvation, autophagosome formation was compromised inmacp2compared to wild type (Fig.6). Finally, MACP2 was degraded through the autophagy machinery during prolonged nutrient starvation (Fig.7). Thus, our findings demonstrate that MACP2 is involved in autophagy induction by mediating the influx of extracellular ROS, whereas MACP2 itself is feedback regulated by autophagy to control a proper cellular ROS balance.

In animal cells, MACPFs form oligomeric rings in target membranes during cell development and immunity (Lukoyanova et al.2016; Moreno-Hagelsieb et al.2017). We recently suggested that in plants,MACP2is widely expressed in various plant tissues, and its expression is upregulated in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (Yu et al.2020). Consistent with this notion, recent findings indicate that MACP2 induces programmed cell death essential for plant susceptibility to bacterial and necrotrophic fungal pathogens (Zhang et al.2022). Moreover, our findings revealed that the conserved residues in the AIM of MACP2 link its function to autophagy induction by interacting with ATG8 (Fig.1), suggesting that MACP2 is likely an important upstream regulator of the autophagy pathway involved in diverse stresses responses in plants.

Autophagy is crucial for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, acting as a quality control mechanism under both normal and stress conditions in plant cells (Qi et al.2023). Previous studies have shown that H2O2and the ROS-producing agent methylviologen (MV) trigger autophagy, the transcript level ofAtATG18aincreased after MV treatment in wild-type seedlings (Scherz-Shouval et al.2007; Shin et al.2009; Xiong et al.2007; Signorelli et al.2019; Lin et al.2021). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and animal cells, ROS activate autophagy by directly regulating the stability of ATG4 protein (Scherz-Shouval et al.2007; Essick & Flora2010; Lin et al.2021). Therefore, we conceive that ROS-induced autophagy in plants may be mediated through either transcriptional upregulation of core autophagy-related genes, such asAtATG18a, or post-translational regulation of ATG proteins stability, as observed in yeast and animals, although the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In Arabidopsis, most autophagy-defective mutants display conventional phenotypes with ROS accumulation, early leaf senescence, and increased sensitivity to nutrient deprivation (Liu & Bassham2012; Signorelli et al.2019). Similarly, we observed thatmacp2mutants displayed enhanced tolerance of nutrient starvation and delayed leaf senescence with lower ROS accumulation. By contrast, theMACP2-OE lines displayed increased sensitivity to nutrient starvation and accelerated leaf senescence with higher ROS accumulation (Fig.2–4), suggesting that MACP2 is likely a positive regulator in ROS production in planta. It is worthy to note that like theMACP2-OE lines, theatgmutants also displayed accelerated senescence phenotypes (Hanaoka et al.2002; Yoshimoto et al.2009; Qi et al.2017), which is likely due to their cellular accumulation of ROS (Signorelli et al.2019), supporting that ROS is a double-edged sword in autophagy induction and plant tolerance to starvation. Notably, the accelerated natural and starvation-induced senescence phenotypes ofatg5-1were partially rescued by mutation ofMACP2, which was also correlated with ROS levelsin planta(Fig.5), suggesting that the cellular ROS level is a key determinant factor for induction of the accelerated senescence phenotypes in both theMACP2-OE lines andatg5-1mutants. Consistent with this notion, the knockout ofMACP2blocks the intracellular ROS accumulation upon starvation or during senescence, which therefore attenuates its enhanced senescent phenotypes.

RBOHD and RBOHF are two major NADPH oxidases localizing at the plasma membrane to catalyze the production of apoplastic ROS in plant cells (Castro et al.2021). We and other groups have previously observed that in Arabidopsis, the autophagosome-like structures decrease in therbohd,rbohf, andrbohd rbohfmutants in comparison to the wild type under hypoxia stress (Chen et al.2015a; Guan et al.2019), supporting the role of RBOH-generated ROS in inducing autophagy in plant cells. Given thatmacp2accumulates less H2O2than the wild type under natural senescence and nutrient starvation conditions (Fig.4), it is likely that the diminished H2O2influx in themacp2mutant contributes to its rescue of theatg5-1phenotypes (Fig.5e, f). Previous works suggest that membrane attack complex (MAC) allows the free passage of water, ions (e.g. Ca2+), and/or other molecules, including small proteins across membranes to induce cell death (Morgan1989; Bakopoulos et al.2019). We speculate that, in response to environmental cues, MACP2 forms a homo- or hetero-polymer at the plasma membrane to mediate influx of extracellular ROS, which act as signals to stimulate the initiation of autophagosome formation. Consistent with our findings, a recently study shows that the mitochondrial GSDMD (pore-forming protein gasdermin D) protein mediates pore formation to release mitochondrial ROS across the membrane (Weindel et al.2022). Thus, it is likely that the pore-forming proteins play an important role in mediating the transport of H2O2across the membrane in cells. Consistent with our findings, several previous studies reveal that multiple plant aquaporins facilitate H2O2transport (Waszczak et al.2018; Castro et al.2021). For instance, Arabidopsis PIP1;4 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1;4) and PIP2;1 aquaporins mediate H2O2influx into the cytoplasm during plant immunity and stomatal closure, respectively (Grondin et al.2015; Tian et al.2016). Intriguingly, recent findings reveal that autophagy is involved in the degradation of PIP2;7 under drought stress conditions (Li et al.2020; Tang & Bassham.2022), indicating autophagy may function with several membrane-localized proteins modulating cellular ROS trafficking in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Interestingly, another MACP family member NSL1 also contains the conserved AIM domain (Fig. S1), which is involved in modulating ROS production in plant immunity response (Fukunaga et al.2017). However, whether NSL1 shares a redundant function with MACP2 in maintaining cellular ROS homeostasis and regulating autophagy biogenesis remain to be further investigated.

Moreover, several studies have revealed that autophagy likely mediates the maintenance of ROS homeostasis under stresses via the NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES1 (NPR1)–PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4 (PAD4)–ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1) SA pathway (Liu & Bassham2012; Chen et al.2015a; Qi et al.2017; Guo et al.2021). Previous studies have demonstrated that SA agonist BTH induces autophagosome formation (Yoshimoto et al.2009; He et al.2023; Qi et al.2023). In Arabidopsis, mutation ofATGgenes results in upregulation of the SA biosynthesis genes and consequent SA accumulation, thereby influencing both senescence processes and pathogen defense responses (Yoshimoto et al.2009; Liao & Bassham.2020). Consistent with this notion, the SA and SAG contents ofmacp2andMACP2-OE plants were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than in wild type (Fig.3a). Moreover, the accelerated natural senescence and hypersensitivity to nutrition starvation seen inMACP2-OE lines were completely suppressed in theeds1andpad4mutant backgrounds (Fig.3c-f, Fig. S2). Moreover, the SA signaling mutantnpr1is observed to suppress the early senescence phenotype inatg5, suggesting that the senescence phenotype inatg5mutant is SA dependent (Yoshimoto et al.2009). Therefore, the observations that themacp2mutation rescued the accelerated senescence phenotype and the sensitivity to nutrient starvation ofatg5-1in themacp2 atg5double mutants (Fig.5a-d), may be explained by the decreased SA contents in themacp2mutants during senescence or upon starvation. Furthermore, previous works have suggested that the accumulation of ROS inatgmutants is mediated by SA pathway (Yoshimoto et al.2009; Chen et al.2015a). Likewise, the accumulation of ROS can stimulate SA biosynthesis, suggesting these two signaling molecules likely form a positive amplification loop (Shah2003; Yoshimoto et al.2009). Collectively, these findings establish that SA and ROS both function as autophagy inducers and mutually reinforcing signaling molecules within an integrated regulatory network. It is worth noting that mutation of either MACPF family gene,CAD1orNSL1, constitutively activates plant defense responses and programmed cell death in an SA-dependent manner (Morita-Yamamuro et al.2005; Noutoshi et al.2006; Tsutsui et al.2006; Asada et al.2011; Fukunaga et al.2017; Chen et al.2021). Thus, SA is an important regulatory signaling molecule that modulates MACPF function and ROS-triggered autophagy induction.

We further showed that under normal growth conditions, MACP2-YFP predominately localized to the plasma membrane; however, MACP2-YFP translocated to autophagosomes in response to nutrient starvation, as evidenced by the colocalization of MACP2-YFP punctate dots with mCherry-ATG8f-labeled vesicles (Fig.7a-c, S6). The association of MACP2 with autophagosomes may reflect its feedback degradation by the autophagy machinery under long-term stresses (Fig.7d, e, Fig. S8), indicating that MACP2 probably regulates and is regulated by the autophagy pathway, which is potentially a key mechanism in controlling a proper cell ROS balance, especially during prolonged starvation exposure. This phenomenon has been frequently observed in the autophagy- and vacuolar sorting–mediated degradation pathways. For instance, the two central protein complexes ATG1–ATG13 and SEVEN IN ABSENTIA OF ARABIDOPSIS (SINATs)–FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR ENDOSOMAL SORTING1 (FREE1) modulate autophagosome biogenesis and are degraded via the autophagy pathway (Suttangkakul et al.2011; Xia et al.2020), thus providing feedback control of autophagy initiation. Notably, our results demonstrated that the MACP2 protein stability is mediated by autophagy pathway, but not through the 26S proteasome pathway during carbon starvation (Fig.7d, e). However, the degradation of MACP2 was suppressed in the dual ATG8/Ubiquitin receptor mutantrpn10-1(Fig.7e). A previous work demonstrates that the proteasome subunit RPN10 simultaneously binds to both ATG8 and ubiquitin (Marshall et al.2015). Thus, RPN10 likely acts as a selective autophagy receptor to target inactive 26S proteasomes by concurrent interactions with ubiquitylated proteasome subunits and lipidated ATG8 lining the enveloping autophagic membranes (Marshall et al.2015). Thus, we considered that RPN10 may mediate the degradation of MACP2 by activation of proteophagy during carbon starvation, rather than proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying RPN10-mediated MACP2 degradation requires further elucidation.

In conclusion, we elucidated the roles of MACP2 in the regulation of autophagy induction through control of the influx of extracellular ROS in Arabidopsis (Fig.7f). During leaf senescence or in response to nutrient deprivation, MACP2 forms a homo- or hetero-polymer at the plasma membrane to form a membrane attack complex (MAC) pore, which mediates the transport of the extracellular H2O2produced through RBOHs into the cytoplasm. During early senescence or nutrient starvation, H2O2acts as a signal molecule to stimulate the induction of autophagy, which maintains cellular homeostasis and energy supply, ensuring cell growth (left panel, Fig.7f). By contrast, the continuous accumulation of H2O2triggers the association of MACP2 with autophagosomes and targets MACP2 for its vacuolar degradation (right panel, Fig.7f), thus mediating cell ROS homeostasis and promoting cell survival under long-term starvation. Our findings therefore provide insights into the molecular link between extracellular ROS and autophagy induction and suggest that MACP2-composed MAC pores at the plasma membrane may serve as functional channels for ROS influx in response to environmental or physiological stresses, including nutrient starvation.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accession Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as the wild type in this study. The T-DNA insertionmacp2-1(SALK_040186) andmacp2-2(SALK_052845C) mutants were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR;http://www.arabidopsis.org). Theeds1-22,pad4,atg5-1,atg8e, andrpn10-1mutants used in this study have been described previously (Shah1997; Chen et al.2015b; Xia et al.2020). For genetic analysis, theeds1-22andpad4mutants were crossed toMACP2-OEs to generate the OEeds1(Zhang et al.2022) and OEpad4lines; similarly, theatg5-1mutant was crossed tomacp2mutants to generate the double mutantsmacp2-1 atg5-1andmacp2-2 atg5-1. To investigate H2O2influx in plants,p35S::HyPertransgenic line (Shi et al.2022) was crossed tomacp2-1mutant to generate themacp2-1 p35S::HyPerline. Fluorescence intensity of pHyPertransgenic plants was determined in the roots of 1-week-old seedlings by the excitation wavelength at 488 nm or 405 nm and the emission at 530 nm (band pass 20). A fluorescence ratio was calculated as 488/405.

For seed germination assays, Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized with 20% (v/v) bleach containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma, P2287) for 15 min, washed with distilled water at least six times, and plated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS, Sigma, M5519) medium with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) agar. The plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 d in the darkness, before being transferred to a growth room under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark (20 °C/24 °C day/night) photoperiod. At 7 d after germination, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Pansa,PS008321) for further growth under the same conditions.

The treatment of nutrient starvation was performed as described previously (Qi et al.2023). For nitrogen starvation tests, 7-d-old seedlings grown on solid half-strength MS medium were transferred to liquid half-strength MS medium or nitrogen-free liquid half-strength MS medium and grown under normal growth conditions for the indicated times. For carbon starvation, 4-week-old adult plants were transferred to continuous darkness for the indicated times and then allowed to recover under normal growth conditions for 7 d. For seedling treatment, 7-d-old seedlings grew in half-strength MS were transferred to solid sucrose-free medium with or without 500 μM GSH and incubated under continuous dark conditions for 12 d, followed by recovery under normal growth conditions for 5 d. Samples were collected or photographed at the indicated time points. The relative chlorophyll content was recorded as described below.

For chemical treatments, 7-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on solid half-strength MS medium with 1% (w/v) sucrose were transferred to sterile 12-well plates filled with liquid half-strength MS medium with no added sucrose (− C) and 50 μM MG132 or 1 μM concanamycin A (ConA) in continuous darkness at the indicated time points (0, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h). After the specified treatments, seedlings were collected for confocal analysis or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction and immunoblot analysis. For transient expression analysis, the plasmidMACP2-HAandMACP2 M1-HAwere transfected into wild-type,atg5-1,atg8e, andrpn10-1protoplasts; after overnight culture under continuous light, protoplasts were treated with 50 μM cycloheximide (CHX) in darkness for the indicated times (0, 2, 4, or 6 h). Subsequently, the protoplasts were collected and the protein extracted for immunoblot analysis.

For conducting the yeast two-hybrid assay, the cDNA ofArabidopsis ATG8ewas inserted into the pLexA vector, which was fused with the LexA DNA-binding domain (BD), thereby serving as the bait. The screening was carried out using the Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech) along with the EGY48 yeast strain to probe an Arabidopsis cDNA library (Xu et al.2002). The transformed yeast cells were then cultured on 2% Gal/Raf/X-β-gal (SD-Ura/-His/-Trp/-Leu) selective medium in accordance with the guidelines provided by Clontech.

All constructs were generated using a ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (catalog no. C112; Vazyme). All gene-specific primers with about 15-bp extensions homologous to the corresponding vectors are listed in Table S1. For theMACP2-HAandMACP2 M1-HAconstructs, the full-length coding sequence ofMACP2andMACP2with mutations (MACP2F134A,L137A) were cloned intoBamHI- andStuI-digested pUC119 vector (containing the ArabidopsisUBIQUITIN10[UBQ10] promoter; Li et al.2013; Xia et al.2020) to generate theMACP2-HAandMACP2 M1-HAconstructs. The full-length coding sequence ATG8e was cloned intoBamHI-digested pUC120 (harboring the ArabidopsisUBQ10promoter; Xia et al.2020) to generate theFLAG-eGFP-ATG8econstruct. To generate plasmids for the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, the full-length coding sequence ofMACP2and its variant (MACP2F134A,L137A) was cloned intoBamHI-digested pHBT-YN or pHBT-YC vector (Qi et al.2017), respectively, to generateMACP2-nYFPand MACP2 M1-nYFPconstructs. The full-length coding sequence fragment ofATG8ewas cloned intoBamHI-digested pUC120-YC (Xia et al.2020) to generatecYFP-ATG8econstruct.

To generate stable transgenic plants expressingMACP2-YFPorMACP2-FLAG, the fusion cassettes derived from the above pUC119 constructs were cloned into the binary vector pFGC-RCS (Li et al.2013; Zhang et al.2022). The resulting clones were subsequently introduced into wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0) or the mutantseds1andpad4via Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) –mediated transformation using the floral dip method (Clough & Bent (Clough, et al.,1998)) to generateMACP2-FLAG,MACP2-YFP(MACP2-OEs),MACP2-YFP eds1(OEeds1), andMACP2-YFP pad4(OEpad4) transgenic plants. TheMACP2-YFPline was crossed tomCherry-ATG8fto generate the double transgenic linemCherry-ATG8f MACP2-YFP.Themacp2-1 eGFP-ATG8edouble mutant was obtained by crossingmacp2-1to theeGFP-ATG8eline, and the transgenic plantMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8e(MACP2-FLAG eGFP-ATG8e) was produced by introduction ofMACP2-FLAGintoeGFP-ATG8eline.

Preparation and transfection of Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were performed according to Yoo et al. (2007). Protoplasts isolated from the rosettes of 4-week-old plants were transfected with the indicated plasmids and cultured for 16 h in the light before protein extraction. For the Co-IP assays, the transfected protoplasts were centrifuged and collected and lysed in 200 μL immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% [v/v] glycerol) with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. A 10% volume of total lysate was used as input, and the remainder was mixed with 300 μL IP buffer without Triton X-100 and incubated with FLAG affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged, collected, and washed six times with IP buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, followed by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min before immunoblot analysis.

For the BiFC assay, the appropriate pairs ofnYFPandcYFPplasmids were transfected in leaf mesophyll protoplasts prepared from wild-type rosettes, incubated for 12 h under continuous light conditions to allow transgene expression, and then incubated with 100 μM benzo [1,2,3] thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) and 1 μM ConA for 6 h for treated cells. The YFP fluorescence was detected by confocal microscopy (ZEISS 880) with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm and emission collected with a bandpass infrared (IR) filter from 524 to 550 nm.

Chlorophyll contents were determined as described previously (Qi et al.2022). Arabidopsis leaves were harvested at the natural senescence stage or during carbon or nitrogen starvation at different growth periods. Total chlorophylls were extracted by incubating the samples in 2 mL anhydrous ethanol in the dark at 4 °C for 48 h. Absorbance was determined at 664 and 647 nm, and the total chlorophyll content was measured and normalized to fresh weight per sample.

Phytohormones were extracted and their concentrations measured as described previously (Pan et al.2010; Chen et al.2015a). Powdered tissue was weighed in a 2-mL centrifuge tube and extracted in 800 μL extraction buffer (2-propanol/water/concentrated HCl [2:1:0.005, v/v/v]) with internal standards (10 ng d4-salicylic acid [SA] and 10 ng d5-jasmonic acid [JA]; Sigma-Aldrich). The mixtures were mixed with shaking at 100 g for 30 min at 4 °C, after which 1 mL dichloromethane was added and shaking continued for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. One milliliter from the lower phase was collected and dried using a nitrogen evaporator with nitrogen flow. The samples were dissolved in 200 μL 60% (v/v) methanol in sterile ultrapure water. Quantitative detection and analysis of phytohormones were performed with a chromatograph (Shimadzu) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Triple TOF 5600 [AB SCIEX]) (Chen et al.2015a).

H2O2was extracted from the leaves of 4-, 5-, and 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants using an Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as described previously (Pucciariello et al.2012). Briefly, 50 μL of extracted supernatant and 50 μL of the reaction working solution provided in the kit were transferred to a transparent plate and incubated at room temperature in darkness for 30 min. The absorption was determined at 560 nm on a multimode reader. A standard curve was generated by diluting the H2O2working solution provided with the kit to concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, or 20 μM in a final volume of 50 μL 1 × reaction buffer. Each dilution was mixed with 50 μL reaction working solution and incubated as above.

Total RNA was extracted from the leaves of 4-, 5-, and 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants using a HiPure Plant RNA Mini kit (Magen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The isolated total RNA was converted into first-strand cDNA with a HiScript II QRT Super Mix kit with gDNA Wiper (Vazyme). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with ChamQ SYBR Color qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) on a StepOne Plus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).

qPCR was performed with the following settings: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and a subsequent standard dissociation protocol to validate the presence of a unique polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product. For calculation of the relative expression levels of different genes, three technical replicates were performed per reaction. The delta of threshold cycle (△Ct) values were calculated by subtracting the arithmetic mean Ct values of the targets from the normalizingACTIN2. The relative transcript level (2−△△Ct) was calculated from three independent experiments. The gene-specific primers used for qPCR are listed in Table S1.

For total protein extraction, plant tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in ice-cold protein extraction buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate [pH 7.0], 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2% [v/v] β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% [v/v] glycerol) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 04693132001). The samples were placed on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 g. The supernatant was transferred to a new microfuge tube before electrophoresis. For total protein extraction from protoplasts, collected cells were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extracted in IP buffer.

For immunoblot analysis, the supernatants from protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham). Specific anti-HA (cat. no. H6533, 1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-FLAG (cat. no. A8592, 1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-eGFP (cat. no. M20004, 1:3,000; Abmart), and anti-ACTIN (cat. no. 58169; 1:5,000; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies were used for immunoblotting analysis. Quantification of the immunoblot signal was determined with ImageJ software.

To determine the effect ofmacp2andMACP2-OE plants on autophagosome formation during carbon starvation, 7-d-oldeGFP-ATG8e,macp2-1 eGFP-ATG8e, andMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8eseedlings grown on half-strength MS medium were transferred to sucrose-free MS medium with or without 1 μM ConA and incubated in constant dark conditions for fixed-C starvation treatment. For H2O2and BTH treatment, 7-d-oldeGFP-ATG8e,macp2-1 eGFP-ATG8eandMACP2-OEeGFP-ATG8eseedlings were transferred to half-strength MS liquid medium with or without 100 μM H2O2or BTH (SA agonist, benzo [1,2,3] thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester) for 12 h or 8 h, respectively.

For the subcellular localization of MACP2-YFP and the colocalization of MACP2-YFP with mCherry-ATG8f in response to nutrient starvation, 7-d-oldMACP2-YFPandMACP2-YFP mCherry-ATG8fseedlings grown on solid half-strength MS medium were transferred to sucrose-free liquid half-strength MS medium (− C) containing 1 μM ConA and incubated in constant dark conditions for fixed-C starvation treatment, or seedlings were transferred to nitrogen-free liquid half-strength (− N) containing 1 μM ConA for indicated times. The eGFP, YFP and mCherry signals were detected by confocal microscopy (ZEISS 880) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (eGFP), 514 nm (YFP) or 561 nm (mCherry) and emission collected with a bandpass infrared (IR) filter from 500 to 530 nm (GFP, YFP), or 560 to 610 nm (mCherry).

Data presented in this study are means ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments unless indicated otherwise. Significant differences within or between groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test via STAT software, and aP-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

After overnight culture, protoplasts were treated with 50 μM cycloheximide (CHX) under darkness for the indicated times (0, 4, 6, or 8 h). The experiments were performed as three biological replicates, each with similar results. The abundance of eGFP-FLAG was used as a control. The relative quantification of MACP2-HA and MACP2 MA-HA proteins were normalized to the corresponding eGFP-FLAG control and then compared to its level at 0 h. Data are means ± SD (n= 3) calculated from three biological replicates. The numbers on the left indicate the molecular weight (kD) of each size marker. hpt, h post-treatment.
