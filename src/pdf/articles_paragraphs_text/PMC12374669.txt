Non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour (NSSI) is defined as purposeful self-injury without the intention to die. NSSI has become an important threat to public health among teenagers globally, imposing considerable costs on individuals, families and society. It reflects poor emotional regulation and serves as an early warning sign for suicidal ideation and behaviour. The purpose of this study is to look at the prevalence of NSSI and the risk factors related to it in Beijing’s adolescent population.

Epidemiological surveys and qualitative interviews will both be used in this study. First, a cross-sectional epidemiological survey with stratified sampling will assess the prevalence, risk factors and variables associated with NSSI among adolescents in Beijing. The survey will include a sample size of at least 1415 adolescents. The significance of emotional control, social support and mental health in NSSI conduct will then be investigated through qualitative interviews. This part of the study will use a phenomenological qualitative research approach, with the sample size determined by data saturation, typically around 10 participants, but flexible due to the large sample from the epidemiological survey. In order to investigate the prevalence of NSSI, statistical analysis of correlation, descriptive statistics and regression analysis with multiple variables will be used to analyse the survey data using SPSS V.27.0 and Excel 2003. NVivo V.12 software will be used to code the qualitative data, and thematic analysis and word frequency will be used to find connections between the various NSSI experiences.

The Guang’anmen Hospital Ethics Committee of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences has given its approval to the project (no. 2023-259-KY). Participants will provide both verbal and written informed consent prior to participation, with legal guardians signing for the qualitative part of the study. Participants will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without affecting their clinical care. Results will be shared through academic journals, conferences and public health platforms to raise awareness of NSSI and inform related policy development.

Qualitative interviews and epidemiological surveys are used in this mixed-methods study, enabling a comprehensive analysis of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviours and their social and psychological effects.

With a sizeable, representative sample to accurately depict the frequency of NSSI and its related risk factors in cities like Beijing, epidemiological data from the teenage population of Beijing will be used.

The cross-sectional data, however, do not capture temporal changes, which limits the ability to infer causality and provides only a snapshot of NSSI behaviours.

Self-reported data from surveys and interviews may result in the underestimation or exaggeration of behaviours and emotions, potentially affecting the accuracy and reliability of the results.

NSSI is increasingly recognised in clinical practice as a transdiagnostic phenomenon. It is a symptom associated with other psychiatric disorders, often co-occurring with severe mood or psychotic disorders.9NSSI is more likely to occur in people with depression, bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder10 11than in people without these diseases. NSSI behaviours may become part of maladaptive emotional regulation strategies as individuals mature, further impairing mental health and social functioning. During adolescence, individuals typically experience intense emotions such as low mood, anxiety and anger, along with decreased emotional regulation and pain tolerance,8 12which heightens the likelihood of NSSI.13NSSI is strongly associated with these problems as well as with suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB). Research shows that NSSI is a significant early warning sign and risk factor for STB,14 15and the occurrence of STB can predict the onset of NSSI.8Approximately 17% of children with STB eventually attempt suicide.16This suggests that NSSI may serve as a transitional step towards suicidal behaviour, often occurring before a suicide attempt and reflecting an individual’s impaired emotional regulation. For instance, by the time they were 13 years of age, 7.5% of children aged 12 years and under17had suicidal thoughts, 2.2% had planned suicide, 1.3% had tried suicide and 1.4% had self-harmed.

Adolescents’ emotional and physical health is dealing with serious issues. NSSI, as an early warning sign and comorbid symptom, urgently requires the attention of society and public health authorities. Despite this global trend, there is a lack of systematic, large-scale investigations and multidimensional risk factor analyses of adolescent NSSI, particularly in non-Western countries and in Beijing, which serves as China’s political, economic and cultural centre. Adolescents in Beijing face heightened academic competition and family educational expectations. Emotional and behavioural issues are more likely to arise due to these social influences. Studies show that the overall rate of social, emotional and behavioural problems among Beijing students is 16.7%.18Additionally, Beijing adolescents come from diverse cultural backgrounds and family structures, which may influence the development and occurrence of NSSI. Therefore, studying NSSI behaviours among Beijing adolescents can provide insights into its characteristics in this specific socio-cultural context and offer a basis for developing targeted interventions in similar cities.

Currently, most research on NSSI focuses on clinical interventions and psychotherapy. Individual treatment and intervention strategies such as dialectical behaviour therapy19and cognitive behavioural therapy20 21have been studied. These psychotherapies have been widely used. However, these studies have often neglected the epidemiological characteristics and deeper individual behavioural causes of adolescent NSSI, resulting in a lack of universally effective preventive interventions.22This study integrates qualitative research with epidemiological investigations to obtain a more thorough picture of their habits. It seeks to investigate the sociocultural settings and underlying psychological processes. We used epidemiological studies to provide group-level macrodata to reveal the prevalence of NSSI and at-risk groups. We also used qualitative studies to conduct longitudinal analyses of motivation, emotional regulation methods and individual-level sociocultural contexts. This study attempts to pinpoint the precise causes of NSSI and comprehend how people deal with self-harming behaviours by fusing individual viewpoints with macrotrends. It also looks at how these behaviours are expressed in relation to sociocultural influences. This method gives medical professionals a thorough grasp of the issue and establishes a strong basis for creating more targeted preventative and intervention plans.

In summary, studying the incidence and determinants of NSSI is important for early adolescent mental health intervention. We can provide a scientific basis for formulating precise prevention and intervention strategies through systematic research that identifies high-risk factors and their sociocultural contexts. This will help parents, schools and society to identify adolescents at risk for self-harm earlier and provide data to support mental health policy and resource allocation at the national level. It will also reduce the mental health burden of the adolescent population.

This study aims to conduct a quantitative analysis of the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of NSSI among adolescents in Beijing. The prevalence and severity of NSSI will be assessed through a 1-year cross-sectional survey involving approximately 1415 adolescents in Beijing. Prevalence refers to the proportion of adolescents who reported engaging in NSSI over the past year, while epidemiological characteristics include the frequency, intensity and types of NSSI behaviours observed.

This study aims to identify and quantify the multilevel risk factors for NSSI. These factors include an individual’s mental health status (eg, depression and anxiety), the family environment (eg, parenting style and family support) and the sociocultural environment (eg, peer influence and cultural attitudes towards mental health). Multivariate regression and mediation analyses will be used to interpret the data. Additionally, a review of the published literature will compare the NSSI risk factors among adolescents in Beijing with those in other cities.

This study aims to explore the experiences of adolescents who engage in NSSI, focusing on the factors that influence the onset and development of self-injury behaviour. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with adolescents who have engaged in NSSI, focusing on their personal narratives about their behaviours and their emotional, psychological and developmental backgrounds. Through these interviews, we will explore how adolescents perceive societal and familial attitudes towards NSSI and the meanings they attach to their actions. This will help us understand the influence of sociocultural and individual values on NSSI. Thematic analysis will be used to identify recurring themes related to NSSI in the interviews.

The study aims to explore the relationship between NSSI and STB, particularly whether self-harm acts as a precursor to suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts. This will be assessed through qualitative, semi-structured interviews, which will explore the experiences of adolescents with self-harm and their perceptions of its connection to suicidal thoughts or behaviours. The interviews will focus on how adolescents perceive the relationship between their NSSI behaviours and these issues. The interview data will be analysed using thematic analysis to identify common patterns or risk factors associated with NSSI and STB. This analysis will help identify adolescents at high risk for suicide-related behaviours and inform recommendations for early intervention.

This study combines cross-sectional epidemiological surveys with qualitative research to explore the epidemiological characteristics, risk factors and sociocultural influences of NSSI behaviours among adolescents in Beijing. Epidemiological data will be collected using quantitative questionnaires. NSSI youth who meet the criteria will be selected from the cross-sectional survey and interviewed qualitatively to gain insight into their individual experiences and emotional responses. Combining these methods will ensure a comprehensive understanding of NSSI in the Beijing adolescent population and its potentially complex causes. The study flow chart is shown infigure 1.

Consent to take part in this investigation and sign an informed consent form.

Possess intellectual impairment, autism and schizophrenia.

According to the formula, the required sample size is n=1349. Considering a 5% invalid questionnaire rate, this study needs to include at least 1415 participants.

The epidemiological investigation stratified sampling will be used to select three representative middle schools and child psychiatry clinics from three tertiary hospitals as surveillance sites.

At the school level, stratified sampling will be performed by grade, ensuring that students from each grade, gender and other demographic groups are randomly selected in proportion. The survey will be conducted when students are available. All students in the classrooms chosen will receive a standardised letter inviting them to participate voluntarily. Participants will sign an informed consent form on-site, confirming their understanding of the study’s purpose, content and voluntary nature.

At the hospital level, eligible patients will be surveyed using convenience (drop-in) sampling. The research team will contact patients who meet the study requirements and invite them to participate. Like the school participants, all hospital participants will sign an informed consent form on-site to confirm they understand the study’s goals, methods and that participation is completely optional. All gathered information will remain private and be used only for academic purposes.

The primary outcomes of this study will be the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of NSSI among adolescents in Beijing. The study will focus on understanding the frequency, severity and types of NSSI behaviours, such as cutting and burning. Additionally, it will explore how demographic factors, like age, gender, socioeconomic status and cultural influences, affect the occurrence of NSSI. By identifying the prevalence rate and key epidemiological characteristics, the study will provide a clear understanding of the scope of NSSI among adolescents in this population.

This study will collect demographic characteristics of adolescents, including but not limited to the following: gender, age, family socioeconomic status, educational background, living situation and siblings.

Although current self-injury scales help identify and assess suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviours, they have some limitations. Many of these scales, especially those developed in Western countries such as the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (OSI),24do not take into account the social and cultural background of Chinese adolescents. This lack of cultural adaptation means that these scales may not accurately reflect the cultural characteristics and psychological reasons behind Chinese adolescents’ self-injurious behaviours.

Additionally, other measures such as the Adolescent Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Questionnaire (ANSAQ)25and the Functional Assessment of Self-Injury Scale24 26mainly focus on various types and reasons for self-harm. They do not address the subject’s intent to die, impulsivity or difficulties with control. While all scales touch on functioning to some extent, they could go deeper into areas such as motivation and emotional regulation.

Furthermore, some of the existing scales, such as the Alexander Brothers Self-Injury Assessment Inventory24 27and the NSSI Symptom Disorder Scale,27are mainly used in clinical settings, especially with psychiatric patients. This makes them less useful for the general adolescent population. For regular adolescents, these scales may not accurately capture the specific behaviours and emotional reasons for non-suicidal self-harm.

Therefore, given the limitations of the existing scale, this study decided to develop a new scale to identify better and assess adolescents’ NSSI behaviours. The new scale will focus on cultural factors such as family background, school environment and social pressure. It will also address control and impulsivity situations related to self-injury, exploring internal psychological motivation and emotional regulation, such as managing emotions and social avoidance. In addition, the scale will include additional domains such as environmental factors, social interactions and academic pressures related to NSSI to capture different aspects of NSSI better. We will cover important aspects of NSSI while keeping the scale simple. We will avoid complex scoring and lengthy questions so that participants can complete the scale quickly and improve the accuracy of the data.

To ensure the validity of our self-developed scale, we implemented several measures. Initially, we conducted a pilot test with a small group of adolescents. This test aimed to collect data on the frequency, types and causes of NSSI, along with the psychological and emotional factors associated with these behaviours. Based on these results, we identified items requiring improvement. For instance, we rephrased some items for clarity and modified the response options to better capture adolescents’ experiences with NSSI.

Furthermore, we collaborated with experts in adolescent psychology and psychiatry through multiple rounds of Delphi consultations to revise and refine the scale, ensuring its validity and reliability. Experts provided feedback on the clarity and relevance of the scale items to ensure they comprehensively covered all dimensions of NSSI, including behavioural types, psychological motivations and emotional regulation. This expert review confirmed the scale’s content validity and applicability, ensuring it accurately captures the key characteristics of adolescent NSSI.

We used this scale in our study in order to test its reliability and validity in a larger population sample. We will use the OSI and ANSAQ to validate our self-designed scale and perform validity analyses.

OSI and ANSAQ were selected both as validation tools for the self-designed scales and to assess the incidence, types, triggers and motivations of NSSI. This approach served the dual purpose of both validating the scale and supplementing the study’s analysis.

The OSI is an internationally recognised tool with high reliability and validity that can fully measure NSSI behaviours. The internal consistency of the function subscales, as measured by Cronbach’s α, was 0.952, with α coefficients for the four factors ranging from 0.637 to 0.896.28Although the ANSAQ has certain limitations, it was developed independently in China and aligns well with Chinese culture context. The Cronbach’s α coefficient, split-half reliability coefficient and test-retest reliability coefficient for the behaviour questionnaires were 0.921, 0.851 and 0.843.25The Cronbach’s α coefficient, split-half reliability coefficient and test-retest reliability coefficient for the functional questionnaires were 0.905, 0.786 and 0.805.25By using these two scales as validation tools, we can ensure the validity and reliability of the self-administered scales in this study and provide a more complete assessment framework.

The secondary outcome of this study is to explore the multilevel risk factors for NSSI in adolescents. This will involve examining the relationship between NSSI and various mental health and environmental factors. Specifically, we will assess psychological symptoms, family dynamics and coping mechanisms that may contribute to the development and persistence of NSSI behaviours.

Have a history of NSSI behaviour identified in an epidemiological survey.

NSSI behaviour meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for NSSI (characterised by repeated superficial but painful injuries to body surfaces).

The teen and their legal guardian sign an informed consent form to participate in the study.

Possess sufficient comprehension and verbal skills.

1. Possess intellectual impairment, autism and schizophrenia.

3. Have a language barrier that prevents effective participation in the interview.

This study will use a phenomenological qualitative research approach,40with the final decision based on data saturation.41 42Typically, phenomenological studies have sample sizes of around 10 individuals.43 44However, due to our large sample base, this number will not be fixed in our study. Participants for the qualitative part will be selected from adolescents who meet the NSSI criteria in the epidemiological survey. Therefore, the rate of data collection will determine the sample size. The sample size for the qualitative study can be adjusted because NSSI behaviours are influenced by different and complex factors, including biological, social, cultural and psychological aspects. This flexibility ensures that the various aspects of NSSI behaviour are adequately captured and understood. In future studies, the sample size will be adjusted based on actual data collection and information saturation. This means that if no new significant information emerges during data collection, the researcher will consider the sample size sufficient and stop data collection.

During the interview phase of this study, participants who have completed the epidemiological survey will be screened to identify adolescents who meet the behavioural criteria for NSSI. All adolescents who meet these criteria will be considered as potential respondents.

Researchers will screen participants from the epidemiological survey to identify adolescents who meet the behavioural criteria for NSSI. They will contact potential participants and their guardians by phone or email to explain the purpose, process and content of the interview, as well as the possible psychological effects of participating. Researchers will inform participants about the interview’s purpose and potential emotional risks, including its connection to the adolescent’s experience of NSSI and related feelings. After contacting eligible participants, researchers will clearly explain the study’s objectives and the interview content to participants and their guardians. Each participant and their legal guardian must sign a consent form during this process. The consent form will detail the voluntary nature of the interview, data confidentiality and protection of the participant’s privacy.

The timing of the interviews will be flexible to accommodate the participants and their guardians, ensuring that adolescent participants can attend the interviews at a suitable time and receive the necessary psychological support.

Semi-structured in-person interviews will be conducted to collect qualitative data for this study. The interviews will explore themes such as the life experiences, psychological motivations and socio-cultural factors of adolescents with NSSI. The interview structure relies on a literature review45,47and the research questions.

Psycho-motivational and emotional drivers of NSSI.

Alternatives to NSSI, related social support and treatment experiences.

Other life experiences and coping styles of the adolescents.

Open-ended questions are included in the interview guide to encourage participants to provide more details about their experiences.

The primary outcome of this study is to examine the lived experiences and psychological motivations underlying NSSI in adolescents, with an emphasis on the emotional drivers and internal reasons for engaging in self-injury. The secondary outcomes aim to investigate the sociocultural influences on NSSI, including how family dynamics, peer pressure and societal attitudes shape adolescents’ self-injurious behaviours. Additionally, the study will examine coping mechanisms and social support systems, investigating how adolescents manage distress and whether alternative coping strategies are available. These outcomes will provide a comprehensive understanding of both the internal psychological factors and external social influences contributing to NSSI.

All surveys and interviews will be conducted following standardised procedures. This study will first develop a scale to assess NSSI behaviours in adolescents, ensuring its validity through expert consultations and pilot testing. Once the scale is developed, the research team will select representative samples from three secondary schools and three tertiary hospital psychiatric outpatient clinics using stratified random sampling. By selecting various types of schools and hospitals, we aim to include adolescents from diverse social backgrounds and mental health conditions, thereby enhancing the applicability of the findings. The research team at each school and hospital will select adolescents who meet the study requirements and consent to participate, inviting them to complete the survey. The survey will collect information on demographics, self-harm, sleep, diet, exercise, internet use, academics, mood, cognition and parent-child relationships. The questionnaire will be administered by uniform researchers who will guide the participants, ensuring that each completes it under the same conditions.

Based on the survey results, the research team will further select adolescents with NSSI behaviours for semi-structured face-to-face interviews. To ensure the validity of the interview data, we tested and refined the interview outline through pilot interviews during the development process. Before the interview, participants and their guardians will provide informed consent. With their consent, interviews will be audio-recorded, and field notes will be taken to ensure the quality and completeness of the data. All interviews will be conducted in a quiet treatment or consultation room in the hospital to ensure that participants can share their experiences in a comfortable and private setting. All interviewers (PhD and MSc) received training in qualitative research methods, ethical requirements and interview techniques. Interviewers will conduct real-time assessments during the interview and ensure consistency through regular quality control meetings. Additionally, all interview data are reviewed to ensure consistency and reliability in the data collection process. The interviewer strictly follows the preset outline to ensure consistency in the process and content of each interview, preventing any data discrepancies due to interviewer variations. Each interview is scheduled to last about 60 min, ensuring that anonymity and privacy are always protected. To maintain interview quality and data consistency, all interviews and data collection processes will be evaluated during weekly meetings.

After data collection, descriptive statistical analysis using SPSS V.27.0 will describe the basic characteristics of the teenage group, as well as the frequency, type and reasons for NSSI behaviours. Correlational analyses will explore the relationships between mental health conditions (such as anxiety, depression and emotional regulation) and NSSI behaviours. Regression analysis will be performed to determine predictive factors. Thematic analyses of qualitative interview data will be conducted using NVivo V.12 to code the interviews and extract key themes, providing insights into the epidemiological characteristics of NSSI and its psychosocial determinants. These methods will offer a comprehensive assessment of the behavioural characteristics, mental health status and socio-cultural context of NSSI.

The epidemiological survey component of this study will use both paper and electronic questionnaires to collect data. The data will mainly consist of demographic information and questionnaires. Data will be entered by two people simultaneously, and comparisons will be made after entry to ensure accuracy. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS V.27.0.

This study will collect qualitative data primarily through in-depth interviews. Each interview will be audio-recorded and transcribed immediately after the session. The interview data will be organised, categorised and managed using NVivo V.12 software. The software’s coding and analysis features will help systematise the interview data.

Electronic data files, such as databases, control processes, analysis methods, analysis findings, codebooks and descriptive papers, will be systematically organised and backed up on various CD-ROMs or other media for secure storage. All original files will be kept for the necessary duration. To maintain data quality and accuracy, all data will be cleaned prior to analysis to eliminate duplicates, outliers and missing values. Participant data will be anonymised to ensure privacy following ethical standards. The data will be used exclusively for academic research, and participant privacy will be preserved.

To build a database, epidemiological survey data will be analysed using SPSS V.27.0 and Excel 2003. Descriptive statistics will examine the basic characteristics of the study population and the prevalence of NSSI. Multiple regression and correlation analyses will investigate the relationship between NSSI and mental health parameters.

Quantitative data will be presented as mean±SD. The Shapiro-Wilk test, or another normality test, will be used to check if the data follow a normal distribution. If the data are normally distributed, an independent samples t-test or a paired samples t-test will be conducted to compare the two groups. If there are three or more groups and the data meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, a one-way analysis of variance will be used to compare the means. If multiple dependent variables are involved, a multivariate analysis of variance will be considered to assess the impact of group differences on all dependent variables simultaneously. Non-parametric tests will be applied for data that do not follow a normal distribution. Fisher’s exact test, χ2tests and other appropriate methods will be used for counting data. For non-parametric data at different time points, Kruskal-Wallis tests or rank sum tests will be used. Logistic regression will be used for binary classification outcomes. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel technique will be used for stratified data analysis. For further analysis, network analysis may be employed to explore the inter-relationships between multiple factors influencing NSSI behaviours, and mediation analysis may be used to investigate whether certain variables mediate the relationship between risk factors and NSSI behaviours.

The qualitative data from the interviews will be analysed using NVivo V.12. This software will be used to organise and categorise the data. It will help ensure that all relevant data are systematically organised and linked to the appropriate themes. To ensure consistency, the research team will code the data multiple times and compare the results from different individuals. The team will discuss any inconsistencies to reach a consensus, ensuring a reliable analysis that captures the depth and nuance of the participants’ experiences.

This study will analyse qualitative data using a combination of phenomenological, content and thematic analyses. These approaches enable a thorough exploration of the participants’ lived experiences with NSSI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their behaviours, motivations and emotions. The analysis will be conducted in a systematic and iterative manner to ensure reliability and validity. Phenomenological analysis focuses on participants’ perceptions and emotional states to examine their lived experiences of NSSI. Researchers must consciously set aside their preconceptions, assumptions and prior knowledge of NSSI. Content analysis will categorise and analyse textual data systematically, identifying recurring words and themes. NVivo V.12 software will facilitate the deductive and inductive coding processes. Thematic analysis identifies and refines patterns or themes within the data through an iterative process. This ensures that the final themes accurately reflect the participants’ experiences and maintain consistency across the dataset.

To ensure the accuracy, completeness and compliance of data collection, the study will implement several monitoring techniques. Regular audits will be conducted by the research team to verify the data’s accuracy and consistency across all collection sites. At the end of each data collection cycle, the data will be reviewed to identify and correct any entry errors or missing information. A dedicated monitoring team will regularly assess the data collection process to ensure that all participants meet the enrolment criteria and that the process follows the established procedures.

The Ethics Committee will carry out regular assessments to verify the study’s adherence to ethical guidelines. Moreover, the research team will offer ethical training to ensure that all participants understand the informed consent form before signing it. The research team will submit regular progress reports and feedback, and any issues related to data quality or process deviations will be promptly reported to the Ethics and Monitoring Committee to ensure transparency and compliance.

The first participant in the epidemiological survey was tested on 28 August 2024. As of the date of this submission, 352 participants have been tested. The first participant in the qualitative interview section was interviewed on 26 April 2025. To date, five participants have been interviewed. Recruitment for both sections is ongoing, and completion is expected by December 2025. If the expected number of participants is not met by the end of 2025, the research team may extend the project timeline.Figure 2shows the current planned timeline.

Patients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.

This study was ethically reviewed by the Ethics Committee of Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (ID 2023-259-KY).

Participants will receive detailed information from the researcher about the study’s objectives, data collection procedures, potential risks and the use of the data. Participants will give their verbal and written informed consent prior to participation. The participants’ legal guardians will sign the informed consent form for the qualitative part of the interview. Before or during the interview, participants will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without affecting their clinical care.

Psychological discomfort may arise, as the study could prompt participants to recall disturbing or distressing events. The researcher will ensure that any discomfort is addressed promptly. If a participant becomes uncomfortable, the researcher will pause the survey or interview and resume when the participant is ready. If the participant cannot continue, the current survey or interview will be rescheduled or cancelled. If a participant is in distress, the researcher will provide appropriate support services. If a participant discloses self-harm, suicidal thoughts or other health risks during the interview, the researcher will report this to the research team to ensure the participant’s safety. The present interview or survey will be terminated or postponed if the participant is unable to continue. The researcher will offer suitable assistance to participants who are experiencing distress. During the interview, the researcher will notify the study team if a subject discloses self-harm, suicidal ideation or other health problems in order to protect the person. This information will be clearly explained to the participant during the informed consent process.

All personal information in the study will be kept strictly confidential. Participants’ identities will remain anonymous or coded during data collection, analysis and reporting. Only authorised personnel (eg, data managers) can access sensitive information. After the study, all collected data will be securely stored for a while and then archived.

The study’s findings will be disseminated through a variety of channels, including peer-reviewed journal publications and academic conferences and seminars that will reach national and international scientists, health agencies, legislators and the general public. To support efforts in preventing suicide and self-harm, and to inform the development of related treatments, the results will also be shared with hospital or school management teams and relevant local regulatory organisation﻿.
