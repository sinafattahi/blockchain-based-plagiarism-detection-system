Globally, HIV remains a significant concern, particularly for high-risk populations. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has emerged as a promising method for HIV prevention, but understanding the factors influencing its uptake and retention is crucial. This study focuses on investigating how accountability partners and WhatsApp groups influence PrEP use among women at risk in Soweto, South Africa, aiming to empower them in their efforts to prevent HIV transmission.

The study design involved a venue-based intercept survey with data collected from 416 women at risk in Soweto. Utilizing REDCap, data were gathered from locations frequented by women at risk. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and logistic regression models were employed to assess the influence of accountability partners and social media groups on PrEP uptake and continuation.

The median age of the participants was 23 years, and factors influencing PrEP initiation and continuation were explored. Multiple sexual partners were significantly associated with both initiation and continuation (p< 0.001) with the likelihood of initiation and continuation being OR: 3.67 and OR: 1.13 respectively. Friends’ influence and the feeling of being at risk played a significant role in both stages (p< 0.001). Participation in WhatsApp groups discussing PrEP and health-related topics was significant for initiation, while general WhatsApp groups were associated with continuation. Partner refusal to use condoms was highly associated with higher reported rates of initiation and continuation of PrEP (OR: 3.67 and 5.93) respectively.

The study highlights the crucial role of accountability partners and WhatsApp-based social groups in shaping PrEP utilization among high-risk populations. Findings underscore the potential for targeted public health strategies to enhance PrEP awareness, uptake, and continuation, contributing to the prevention of HIV spread in these communities.

HIV remains a critical global health concern, with millions affected worldwide. According to the UNAIDS, despite significant progress in prevention and treatment, the prevalence of HIV remains a significant global health concern, with millions of people still affected by the virus [1,2]. South Africa, in particular, carries a significant burden, the statistics office of South Africa (stats-sa) in 2022 reported that approximately 8.45 million individuals in South Africa live with HIV, which accounts for roughly 13.9% of the total population [3]. Among South African women in the 15–49 age group, an estimated 22.3% are HIV positive [4]. This age group makes up the ‘high-risk populations’ engaging in risky lifestyles such as unsafe sexual behaviours and needle-sharing which predispose them to HIV transmission [5,6]. In response to this epidemic, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has emerged as a significant advancement and a promising biomedical intervention to prevent HIV transmission among individuals at heightened risk [7–11]. It is essential to acknowledge PrEP as a fundamental component of comprehensive prevention strategies and to increase its adoption and continuation on a larger scale to optimize its influence on HIV incidence and prevalence [12,13].

Although the utilization of PrEP in the prevention of HIV transmission has shown great promise, many who enrol on PrEP tend to discontinue due different reasons, challenges, and barriers [14–20]. Some of which may include social, cultural, religious, and structural factors among others [21–24]. However, in order to maximize the impact of PrEP as a preventive measure, there is a need to better understand the multifaceted factors influencing its adoption and usage among high-risk populations and in this global fight against HIV/AIDS [25–27].

Women at risk, particularly female sex workers, constitute a priority population susceptible to HIV transmission, and Among high-risk populations, female sex workers and young women in sub-Saharan Africa face unique barriers to HIV prevention. Research has documented experiences with condom failure and PrEP usage within this group, providing valuable insights into HIV prevention strategies in this specific context [28–35]. Research evidence has shown that accountability partners such as sexual partners, family members and religious leaders play a substantial role in influencing decision-making and willingness to adopt HIV prevention strategies [36]. For this study, an accountability partner was defined as any individual such as a friend, peer, family member, or community member who actively encouraged or reminded a participant to initiate or continue PrEP. Community-based communication or support has also been identified to play a significant role in promoting PrEP awareness and has the potential to drive PrEP adoption [37].

Peer-to-peer delivery of HIV and sexual health information is a promising approach, particularly among youth in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa [38]. Understanding the motivators for oral PrEP uptake and retention is a crucial facet of developing effective interventions [19,39]– [41]. One particularly promising strategy for disseminating HIV prevention information is peer-to-peer digital health interventions. Mobile communication tools, such as WhatsApp, have been utilized in various health interventions, demonstrating effectiveness in engaging at-risk populations and improving health outcomes [42]. Digital health interventions tailored to specific community needs have shown promising results in increasing awareness, facilitating behavioral change, and enhancing PrEP adherence [43]. Given the widespread use of mobile technology in South Africa, leveraging WhatsApp and other digital platforms for peer-driven education and support presents a novel opportunity for improving PrEP uptake and retention.

The study aims to understand the dynamics surrounding PrEP use and continuation/discontinuation, with a focus on the role of social support network in promoting PrEP usage. Partners, friends and peer networks can significantly influence health-related decisions, including preventive behaviors. These findings will inform the development of supportive networks that foster a sense of community support and encourage HIV prevention practices among at-risk individuals. This study’s outcomes will be relevant in enhancing comprehensive HIV prevention strategies, integrating PrEP with other preventive measures like condom use and education. Understanding the factors influencing PrEP adoption will ensure its effective incorporation into broader prevention plans, ultimately strengthening prevention outcomes. Furthermore, the research findings will provide valuable insights for healthcare providers and policymakers, facilitating evidence-based resource allocation and targeted interventions, with the goal of reducing new transmissions, improving health outcomes, and achieving an AIDS-free world by 2030, all while addressing the unique needs of high-risk populations and fostering social support.

This study employs a venue-based intercept survey design to investigate factors influencing PrEP initiation and continuation among women at risk in Soweto, South Africa. A cross-sectional approach was utilised to gather data from participants at different sites in Soweto, which included brothels and street corners frequented by women at risk. Participants were approached through a venue-based intercept strategy at known sex work hotspots such as taverns, informal bars, street intersections, as well as referral through Peer Educators and Community Workers affiliated with Best Health Solutions (BHS) a community based organisations. These fieldworkers were trained to use a brief, non-stigmatizing introduction to engage potential participants during outreach sessions that included condom distribution and health talks.

This study was conducted within the dynamic context of Soweto, in South Africa, a densely populated area that has faced a substantial burden of HIV cases in Gauteng, within South Africa. Soweto is viewed as a peri-urban area characterized by diverse communities and socio-economic status and varied religious belief systems and health seeking behaviour [44]. Soweto is home to more than five million people who are mainly of the Black racial group, with many families who have resided there for generations [45]. To address the burden of HIV, the South African government, in collaboration with local healthcare providers such as Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Clinics, Non-Governmental Organisations and Community-Based Organisations has made PrEP readily available to those at risk of HIV infection in Soweto and surroundings [46,47]. Data collection took place at the aforementioned locations, providing a focused setting that mirrors the environment in which women at risk frequent.

The study employed snowball sampling approach to recruit participants. The initial participants were recruited from public locations where women at risk were known to congregate, including taverns, informal bars and street intersections. These participants were then asked to refer peers in their networks using a snowball method. Peer referrals were facilitated through in-person connections. The study population were women at risk, aged 18 years old and above in Soweto. Inclusion criteria for this study were individuals who identified as female, transmen and transwomen who were 18 years or older and indicated that they were on HIV PrEP. These criteria were employed to ensure that the research captured a diverse range of gender identities and focused on adults capable of providing informed consent while examining the reason behind PrEP uptake and retention among women at risk. In South Africa, most group of women are categorized as “at risk” for HIV based on epidemiological, behavioral, and socio-economic factors. High-risk groups include women aged 15–49, particularly adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), who face disproportionately high HIV prevalence (22.3% in 2022) [4]. Risk factors include inconsistent condom use, multiple partners, transactional sex, and injecting drug use, compounded by poverty, limited healthcare access, gender-based violence (GBV), and stigma. Key subgroups include female sex workers (FSWs), women in serodiscordant relationships, pregnant/postpartum women, and migrant/mobile populations, all of whom experience unique vulnerabilities. Addressing these risks requires tailored interventions, including community support, PrEP awareness, and digital health strategies like WhatsApp-based peer education, to enhance prevention and retention in care.

In this study, the primary objective was to assess and analyze factors influencing PrEP initiation and continuation among study participants. To achieve this, we employed a structured measurement framework that included both dependent and independent variables.

PrEP Initiation (Yes/No)– Whether a participant started PrEP.

PrEP Continuation (Yes/No)– Whether a participant continued using PrEP after initiation.

We considered a range of independent variables that could potentially influence PrEP initiation and continuation. These included.

Gender Identity(categorical: Female, Transman, Transwoman, Gender Non-Conforming).

Perceived HIV Risk: Measured through self-reported engagement in high-risk sexual behaviors (e.g., multiple sexual partners, inconsistent condom use).

Social Influence: Encouragement from an accountability partner (family, friend, peer) already on PrEP (Yes/No); Participation in PrEP-focused WhatsApp groups (Yes/No); Membership in broader health-related WhatsApp groups (Yes/No).

Perceived Risk Factors: Self-reported continued engagement in behaviors associated with HIV exposure (e.g., multiple sexual partners, partner’s refusal to use condoms).

Social Support: Ongoing encouragement from friends or peers on PrEP (Yes/No); Continued engagement in PrEP-specific WhatsApp groups (Yes/No); Continued participation in health-related WhatsApp groups (Yes/No).

The selection of these measures was informed by prior research on PrEP uptake and continuation. Studies have shown that social influence, particularly peer encouragement and digital engagement through WhatsApp groups, significantly affects health behavior change [42,43]. Furthermore, literature highlights the role of perceived risk and relationship dynamics in shaping PrEP decisions. Based on this, we structured our survey questions to capture these factors explicitly.

Social Influence: Measured through direct survey items (e.g., “Did a friend currently on PrEP encourage you to start?” Yes/No).

WhatsApp Engagement: Assessed through self-reported membership and active participation in PrEP and health-focused WhatsApp groups.

Risk Perception: Evaluated based on self-reported behaviors and relationship factors (e.g., “Do you have multiple sexual partners?” Yes/No; “Does your partner refuse to use condoms?” Yes/No).

Data collection started in October 2021 over a period of six months, by The Best Health Solutions’ (BHS) trained field team members based in Soweto. All the field team members were familiar with the study area as they were locally based in Soweto. Prior to data collection and as part of routine health promotion activities, the trained field team members conducted a sexual health and reproductive seminar, and distributed condoms. Thereafter, participants were briefed about the study, its purpose, objectives and its significance. Data were collected from a total of 416 participants using electronic questionnaires loaded on REDCap, which ensured data security.

Data was analysed using Stata SE version 17. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages, to understand the distribution of the data. Bivariate analysis such as Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and Fischer’s exact tests were used to examine the relationships between variables to draw inferences. Logistic regression models were used to gain further insights into factors associated with PrEP initiation and continuation. Variables included in the logistic regression were selected based on statistical significance in bivariate analysis (p< 0.05) and theoretical relevance from literature.

The demography of the study population consisting of 416 participants, young adults were also prominently represented, suggesting that the study targeted a population at a stage where they might engage in higher-risk sexual behaviours. Table1shows the demographic characteristics and motivations related to PrEP initiation and continuation. Notably, the median age was 23 years, with the interquartile range spanning from 18 to 27 years. The gender distribution revealed that the majority identified as female, constituting an overwhelming 96.6% of the total sample, while smaller percentages identified as gender nonconforming (1.4%), transmen (0.7%), or transwomen (1.2%).

Regarding the motivations for initiating PrEP, a substantial 76.68% embarked on their PrEP journey due to having multiple sexual partners, while 59.1% cited encouragement by friends who were already on PrEP as a significant motivator. A smaller subset, comprising 6.73% of the total, reported being part of PrEP-specific WhatsApp social based groups motivated them.

These insights lay the foundation for a deeper analysis and discussion within the study, enriching the understanding of the study participants and their PrEP-related choices.

Table2above presents the results of a bivariate analysis, where variables were assessed in relation to the use of PrEP. The statistical tests used for analysis are denoted along with accompanying p-values.

Factors influencing PrEP initiation and continuation were examined. For those who initiated PrEP due to having multiple sexual partners, a Chi-square test was conducted, revealing a highly significant association (p< 0.001). Similarly, a Chi-square test demonstrated a highly significant association (p< 0.001) between continuing PrEP and presence of multiple sexual partners. The influence of friends on PrEP initiation and continuation was also explored. For those who initiated PrEP with encouragement from friends already on PrEP, the Chi-square test indicated a highly significant association (p< 0.001). Likewise, the impact of friends on PrEP continuation was assessed, and a Fisher’s Exact Test also highlighted a highly significant association (p< 0.001).

The Table3below presents the results of a logistics regression analysis, where variables were assessed in relation to the use of PrEP.

Reasons for PrEP Initiation: The findings present a comprehensive insight into the factors influencing both the initiation and continuation of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) usage among the study participants. For reasons associated with PrEP initiation, the analysis reveals significant associations. Individuals with multiple partners demonstrated an increased likelihood of initiating PrEP, indicated by an odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.055–1.318). Similarly, those encouraged by a friend on PrEP exhibited a likelihood of initiation with an odds ratio of 1.20 (CI: 1.111–1.364) and those on a WhatsApp group where they discuss PrEP related issues were more likely to start using oral PrEP services (OR = 1.23,CI: 1.032–1.643). Higher educational levels were associated with a improved likelihood of PrEP initiation, as evidenced by an odds ratio of 1.30 (CI: 1.184–1.482). Additionally, being sexually active and feeling at risk were both linked to a higher likelihood of PrEP initiation, with odds ratios of 1.02 (CI: 1.008–1.055) and 1.35 (CI: 1.236–1.532) respectively. Interestingly, participants whose partners did not want to use condoms were 3.67 times more likely to initiate PrEP, albeit with a significantp< 0.026.

Reasons for PrEP Continuation: Turning to the factors influencing PrEP continuation, participants with multiple partners were 3.47 times more likely to continue PrEP (CI: 1.766–6.832). Similarly, feeling at risk was associated with an increased likelihood of continuation, indicated by an odds ratio of 1.39 (CI: 1.232–1.671). Higher educational levels was also linked to a higher likelihood of continuation, supported by an odds ratio of 1.36 (CI: 1.229–1.568 ). Being sexually active was also associated with increased likelihood of PrEP continuation with an odds ratio of 1.02 (CI: 1.008–1.052). Partner’s reluctance to use condoms significantly increased the likelihood of PrEP continuation, as indicated by an odds ratio of 5.93 (CI: 1.943–18.092).

The findings of this study also highlight the importance of supportive interpersonal relationships in facilitating PrEP uptake and continuation. This supports previous literature on the role of social support in health-seeking behaviors. WhatsApp emerged in this study as a key channel for enhancing PrEP-related communication, offering both informational and emotional support for women at risk. While digital outreach was not a primary outcome, it became an important exploratory focus given the widespread mobile phone access in Soweto. The study findings are consistent with prior work highlighting the role of digital and peer-mediated strategies in PrEP uptake. For instance, Bergam et al. [24] describe how stigma mitigation and peer dialogue in digital spaces can improve PrEP acceptability among South African women, while Adeagbo et al. [38] found peer-to-peer delivery of HIV prevention content, often facilitated through WhatsApp—improved youth engagement in KwaZulu-Natal. These findings suggest that community WhatsApp groups not only disseminate accurate PrEP information but also help build social accountability, reinforcing motivation to continue PrEP. Given these results, future PrEP programming should consider integrating structured digital peer support components to complement facility-based services.

The study participants reflected a population of young adults with median age of 23 years, with an interquartile range spanning from 18 to 27 years. This age distribution is noteworthy, as it implies that the study targeted a population in a stage of life when they might be more inclined to engage in higher-risk sexual behaviours [32,48]. Moreover, the majority of participants identified as female, further highlighting the study’s focus on women at risk. The PrEP uptake was found to be around 51% among this population. This may imply that PrEP is considered relevant and accessible to individuals of all ages, dispelling any age-related barriers to PrEP utilization [9,11].

The study’s most compelling findings related to factors influencing PrEP initiation and continuation within the population of women at risk in Soweto, South Africa is that participants whose partners do not agree to use condoms appeared to be most like to take-up PrEP and continue using. This finding is interesting as participants who fail in their condom negotiation were able to take proactive approaches towards preventing HIV infections by using HIV PrEP services. Two similar studies conducted among sex workers and men who sleep with men in South Africa also agrees with this finding [49,50]. Other studies have also showed how power dynamics can predispose sex workers to HIV infection and the importance of implementing PrEP intervention programs and positive deviance through adaptive risk reduction behaviours to help reduce the rising scourge of the HIV epidemic [51,52]. Additionally, some participants also indicated that they started using oral PrEP because they were part of a social media group (i.e., WhatsApp) where the importance of taking up the PrEP services were discussed. This highlights the significance of accountability groups and platforms where clients are educated and encouraged to start and continue these preventive services. A recent systematic review emphasised the benefits of social media in creating awareness, improving knowledge which will in turn promote the uptake of PrEP services among specific populations [53]. With the advancement in technology, and rise in tech-friendly generation social media has the power to enable the exchange of resources and information concerning PrEP and also holds the potential to alter stigma and prevailing social norms if used correctly [54,55].

Our initial analysis showed that having multiple sexual partners was associated with PrEP use and after further analysis using a logistic regression model, our findings revealed that multiple partners was a significant predictor of PrEP initiation. In fact, individuals with multiple sexual partners demonstrated a significantly increased likelihood of enrolling in PrEP, with each additional sexual partner correlating with a higher likelihood of PrEP initiation. This finding is in agreement with other studies conducted in South Africa, Belgium and Brazil among different population groups that highlights the critical role that PrEP plays in the sexual health of those engaging in high-risk behaviors, such as sex workers and people who inject drugs [33]– [35,56]– [61]. The study shows the importance of tailored messaging to promote PrEP among individuals with multiple sexual partners. Additionally, multiple sexual partners also proved to be a critical factor influencing PrEP continuation among the study participants. This is an interesting finding as a study also found that people with risky sexual behaviours such as those with multiple sexual partner or sex workers tends to become conscious of the associated risk of contracting HIV, and take precautionary steps to prevent them [62,63]. These results aligned with findings from previous scholars who reported that having multiple sexual partners was associated with PrEP use [64–66]. In our study, respondents were more likely to continue their PrEP use, emphasizing the importance of continued protection for those engaged in high-risk sexual activities.

Similarly, participants who were encouraged by a friend taking oral PrEP showed an increased likelihood of initiating and continuing the use of PrEP. This positive influence of peers and friends on PrEP uptake as evident in the results from our study aligns with findings from other settings, notably one conducted by Huebner and Mustanski which found that, receiving encouragement from friends and community members who were already using a particular treatment or PrEP played a pivotal role in motivating individuals to initiate PrEP [67]. This phenomenon from our study population could be attributed to the perceived safety and confidence seen in those taking the treatment, emphasising the impact of social support in shaping health-related decisions. This highlights the potential for leveraging social support systems and positive testimonials from PrEP users to encourage uptake among women at risk and similar populations. Additionally, from our study we found that being sexually active, feeling at risk and having higher educational were also associated with an increased likelihood of PrEP initiation and retention. This finding was interesting because a number of studies have found that the feeling of being at risk and being sexually active promotes PrEP uptake among various populations [53,68].

While our findings apply broadly to women at risk of HIV, the study population primarily consisted of young women (median age: 23) in Soweto, South Africa, many of whom engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors. Among this group, female sex workers (FSWs) constituted a key subgroup, given their heightened vulnerability due to condom negotiation challenges and exposure to multiple sexual partners. Notably, our findings suggest that accountability partners such as friends, sexual partners, family members, and social media networks play distinct roles in influencing PrEP uptake and adherence within these subgroups. For instance, peer influence and social media groups (e.g., WhatsApp discussions) were particularly impactful among young women, fostering a sense of collective encouragement and knowledge-sharing that facilitated PrEP initiation. In contrast, among FSWs, condom negotiation failures with clients and intimate partners emerged as a primary driver for PrEP use, emphasizing how power dynamics shape preventive health behaviors. Additionally, while peer and friendship networks played a significant role in encouraging PrEP uptake across subgroups, family influence appeared more relevant among younger women not engaged in sex work, where parental or partner support contributed to decision-making.

This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the use of self-reported data introduces the potential for recall bias and social desirability bias, as participants may underreport or overreport behaviors related to PrEP uptake and adherence. Additionally, the cross-sectional study design limits our ability to establish causal relationships between determinants of PrEP initiation and continuation. Another key limitation is the venue-based intercept survey method, which, while useful for reaching at-risk populations, may introduce selection bias based on the social dynamics of the chosen venues. Moreover, peer influence at the venue may have shaped participant disclosures, either by reinforcing shared behaviors or discouraging candid responses due to fear of stigma.

Furthermore, while our analysis accounted for key demographic and behavioral factors, potential confounders such as mental health status, substance use, intimate partner violence, and structural barriers (e.g., healthcare access, economic instability) were not fully controlled for. These unmeasured variables may or may not have influenced PrEP uptake and retention in ways that were not captured in our findings. Future studies should employ longitudinal designs and qualitative methods to explore these dynamics more comprehensively and minimize these limitations.

In conclusion, this study delves into the intricate dynamics surrounding the initiation and continuation of PrEP among women at risk of HIV in Soweto, South Africa. The research targeted a young adult population with a median age of 23, emphasizing a critical life stage susceptible to higher-risk sexual behaviors. Notably, the majority of participants identified as female, highlighting the study’s focus on women at risk. The 51% PrEP uptake suggests its perceived relevance and accessibility across various age groups. A significant finding reveals that individuals whose partners resist condom use are more likely to initiate and continue PrEP. This proactive approach to HIV prevention underscores the importance of PrEP intervention programs, especially in contexts where power dynamics impact condom negotiation. The study strengthens initial assumptions about the positive association between multiple sexual partners and PrEP initiation, revealing an increased likelihood of enrolment among individuals with more partners. Furthermore, it also emphasizes the critical role of tailored messaging to promote PrEP among this demographic using social media and supportive groups online.

Furthermore, the study highlights the positive influence of peers on PrEP initiation and continuation, agreeing with findings from other settings. This underscores the impact of social support in stigma reduction and how this in turn shape health-related decisions. Leveraging social support systems and positive testimonials from PrEP users may enhance uptake among women at risk and similar populations. Additionally, factors such as being sexually active, feeling at risk, and having higher educational levels were associated with a higher likelihood of PrEP initiation and retention. These findings contribute to the nuanced understanding of the multifaceted determinants influencing PrEP utilization. In essence, the study provides valuable insights for designing targeted public health interventions, educational programs, and behavioral interventions. Addressing perceptions of risk, raising awareness, and overcoming barriers related to peer influence and partner dynamics are crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of PrEP programs among women at risk of HIV in South Africa.
