This study explores the relationships between biochemical phenotypes identified using machine learning, and key health outcomes, including body composition, physical function, and mortality risk. Data were collected from 536 physically active Spanish participants aged over 65 years (76.5% women) enrolled in the EXERNET cohort (2017–2018), with a 6-year mortality follow-up. Principal component analysis, and hierarchical and k-means clustering was used to identify distinct biochemical profiles. Associations between clusters and health outcomes were assessed using analysis of covariance and Cox proportional hazards models. Three distinct clusters emerged: ‘Healthy’, characterized by biochemical values within the normal range and used as the reference group; ‘Metabolic’, marked by dysregulated metabolic parameters; and ‘Hepatic’, which exhibited impaired liver function markers. Notably, all clusters showed subclinical levels of dysfunction. The ‘Healthy Cluster’ demonstrated the highest levels of organized physical activity (90%,p< 0.001), whereas the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ showed poorer body composition and reduced physical performance. Both the ‘Metabolic’ and ‘Hepatic’ clusters demonstrated a higher mortality risk, as confirmed through Cox regression analyses. Adjusted hazard ratios were significantly elevated when considering physical activity and adiposity, with values of 3.45 and 3.71 for the ‘Metabolic Cluster’, and 3.01 and 3.85 for the ‘Hepatic Cluster’ (p< 0.05). This study underscores the strong link between metabolic health, physical activity, body composition and 6-years mortality risk in older adults. Machine learning techniques for identifying phenotypic clusters offers a promising tool for early detection and targeted interventions to improve aging outcomes.

In Spain, the percentage of older adults currently stands around 20% of the population and is projected to rise to 37% by 20501. This demographic shift is linked to a rise in health issues associated with the functional decline of aging. Understanding essential factors (i.e. biological, physical, psychological, and social) that support optimal aging is essential for applying medical resources more effectively and developing targeted healthy aging strategies2. Increasing evidence indicates that modifiable lifestyle behaviours, such as physical activity or sleep quality, can significantly influence phenotypic aging, highlighting the relevance of preventive measures aimed at enhancing biological resilience3,4. Insights into these biological and behavioural factors would allow for a more precise definition of clinical phenotypes and risk groups, enabling tailored interventions.

Most studies focus on hospital medical diagnoses and multimorbidity, identifying groups according to their diseases5. However, they tend to exclude physiological and biochemical health measures, such as routine blood test parameters, from their classifications. This gap highlights the need to explore which routine blood markers best characterize health in older adults, potentially enabling their categorization into distinct physiological phenotypes and understanding why some individuals are more resilient to health risk factors, such as aging. Furthermore, this approach can clarify the relationships between biochemical status, physical activity, functional status, and mortality risk.

The availability of rich datasets on lifestyle, body composition, and physical functionality collected through the elderly EXERNET multi-centre study (Spanish Research Network on Physical Exercise and Health), which focuses on active individuals over 65 years of age, provides a powerful tool to understand the factors influencing aging6. Since all subjects in this study met WHO guidelines by accumulating 150 to 300 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week7, it is possible to analyze differences within this active population while accounting for variation in health patterns. To study and classify this extensive dataset, machine learning techniques can be applied to stratify risk and predict health outcomes. Specifically, unsupervised machine learning techniques avoid the use of labels, thereby eliminating preconceived biases that may impact aging studies. As a result, unsupervised clustering enables the identification of underlying phenotypic patterns in active older adults based on their biochemical variables, allowing comparisons across physical functionality, body composition, and lifestyle factors.

Unsupervised learning has previously been used to identify patterns in older individuals with multimorbidity, classifying them into groups based on cardiovascular/metabolic disorders, anxiety/depression/somatoform disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders8. Other recent studies have explored health-related profiles according to activity levels and active aging. Building on the active aging model, which emphasizes Health, Lifelong Learning, Participation, and Security, Rojo-Pérez et al. identified five distinct older adult profiles, ranging from those with moderate activity and limited resources to those with optimal conditions for active aging9. Even within the same EXERNET cohort, a subclassification based on physical fitness and body composition has been conducted10. However, as noted earlier, this type of analysis has yet to be applied to routine blood test data. This presents a novel and clinically relevant opportunity to identify phenotypic clusters using commonly available biochemical markers, enabling early stratification of health risks even before overt disease manifests. Such pre-clinical risk stratification—the detection of biological alterations below diagnostic thresholds—could help reveal hidden vulnerabilities and offer a foundation for preventive or lifestyle interventions tailored to individual profiles. Moreover, applying data-driven approaches to routine blood data may support cost-effective early screening strategies, with implications for personalized aging and healthcare planning.

Thus, this study seeks to use unsupervised clustering analysis to identify different phenotypes within the heterogeneous spectrum of active old age in Spain, based on routine laboratory test data. Additionally, it aims to establish relationships between these phenotypes and other key health outcomes, including body composition, physical functionality, lifestyle, and six-year mortality risk.

This study is part of the elderly EXERNET multi-centre study (third wave, EXERNET 3.0, performed in 2017–2018), conducted across five Spanish regions, which aims to develop a representative sample of older adults and determine the relationship between physical abilities, body composition, and biochemical variables. The entire protocol has been published previously11.

To ensure diversity, participants were selected using multistage sampling. Random allocation of civic and sports centres was carried out in different regions of Spain (Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Madrid, and Extremadura). Recruitment was then accomplished through advertisements and personal communication within these centres, indicating that most of the population in question is physically active.

The exclusion criteria for the present study were: (1) being under 65 years of age; (2) being institutionalised; (3) suffering from cancer or dementia and (4) not meeting the WHO recommendations for physical activity. In this study, a total of 839 participants were included, with data collection occurring between late 2016 and 2018. More information on data collection, sampling procedures, documentation for each participant, and other technical details can be found elsewhere10–12.

The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Aragón (18/2008) for the baseline study and by the Hospital Universitario Fundación de Alcorcón (Madrid, Spain) (16/50) for follow-up. It adhered to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 (with the Edinburgh 2000 revision and subsequent amendments). All participants provided written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.

Anthropometric and physical fitness measurements were conducted by trained researchers following standardized protocols after a workshop to ensure consistency and alignment in assessments13.

To assess body composition, height was measured using a portable stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) with a maximum capacity of 2.10 m and an accuracy of 0.001 m. Measurements were performed according to international anthropometric standards14. Body weight, body fat mass (FM) and body fat percentage (%BF) were measured using a portable bioelectrical impedance analyzer, Tanita BC 418-MA (Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan), with a maximum capacity of 200 kg and an error margin of ± 100 g. Participants were measured without shoes, socks, or heavy clothing10. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m2).

Physical fitness measurements included hand grip strength, measured by dynamometry (Dynamometer TKK 5401, Takei, Tokyo, Japan) as an independent marker of health status, and the Senior Fitness Test battery (SFT)15, composed of the following components: lower- and upper-body strength assessed with the 30 s chair-stand and arm-curl tests, respectively; agility/dynamic balance measured using the eight-foot up-and-go test; speed by the 30-m walk and cardiorespiratory fitness assessed by the 6-min walk test. Additionally, static balance was evaluated using the one-leg test16. All the tests were performed twice, except for the chair-stand and the 6-min walk tests, which were performed once.

The socio-demographic characteristics of participants were collected through structured interviews that included questions on age, education, socio-economic status, marital status, among other factors. Information was also gathered on illness history, medication, physical activity, nutrition, and frailty. Specifically, participants were asked about Organized Physical Activity (OPA) using a validated questionnaire with the question: "Are you currently engaged in organized physical activity?"17This question encompassed any OPA, defined as a collective, guided, and supervised activity led by an instructor. The number of hours spent in OPA was recorded, alongside weekly walking time. This combined duration was used to classify participants as physically active according to WHO recommendations. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was evaluated using the PREDIMED questionnaire18. Frailty levels were assessed using the Frailty Phenotype criteria published by Fried19, and mobility was measured using the EuroQol-5D questionnaire20.

Data on all-cause mortality were obtained from the 2023 Spanish National Mortality Database, where individuals who had died, along with their dates of death, were identified. Participants were followed over a median period of six years, from 2017 to 2023.

Participants who completed all required hemogram and biochemical tests were selected, as these variables were included in the clustering analysis. The biochemical variables analyzed were: glucose (mg/dL), creatinine (mg/dL), glomerular filtration rate (ml/min/1.73 m2, calculated by CKD-EPI), uric acid (mg/dL), potassium (mEq/L), calcium (mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (GPT/ALT) (U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (U/L), bilirubin (mg/dL), total cholesterol (TC) (mg/dL), triglycerides (TG) (mg/dL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (mg/dL), triglycerides/glucose index (TyG index), leukocytes (10⁹/L), red blood cells (RBC) (1012/L), hemoglobin (g/dL), hematocrit (%), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) (fL), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) (pg), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) (g/dL), platelets (109/μL), Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) (fL), total neutrophils (10⁹/L) and their percentage, total lymphocytes (10⁹/L) and their percentage, total monocytes (10⁹/L) and their percentage, total eosinophils (10⁹/L) and their percentage, and total basophils (10⁹/L) and their percentage. The TyG index, as mentioned, is used as a marker of insulin resistance and is a valuable tool for assessing metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular risk21,22.

Variables with more than 10% missing data were excluded to balance data completeness with sample retention. Data cleaning was performed using functions fromPandas: Python Data Analysis Library(v1.3.5), accessible athttps://pandas.pydata.org. A total of 33 clinically relevant biochemical and hematological variables were retained for analysis. Additionally, all variables were normalized using the StandardScaler function from the Sklearn package to enable joint analysis. Using this same package, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify the variables contributing most significantly to the description of the dataset and reduce the dimensionality of the 33 selected variables prior to clustering. Two principal components were retained based on the cumulative explained variance criterion, accounting for 65.7% of the total variance.

Unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically clustering methods such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, were employed to classify patients based on variables from the blood analysis dataset. The selection of the optimal number of clusters (k) was determined by inspecting the elbow plot of the sum of squared errors (SSE), evaluating clustering solutions for k = 2 through k = 8 using the average Silhouette coefficient and visualizing the resulting dendrogram of hierarchical clustering. The dendrogram and the SSE values for clusters ranging from 1 to 10 were plotted, and this information is included in the Supplementary Fig. 1. A similar approach was taken for the silhouette scores (Table1, supplementary material). According to the elbow method and average Silhouette coefficient, three clusters were identified as optimal, with a Silhouette score of 0.070, offered the best compromise between statistical performance and clinical interpretability. Although the highest value was observed for k = 2 (0.115), this solution was deemed less informative from a clinical perspective, as it produced an overly broad grouping of individuals Models with k > 3 yielded lower silhouette values and resulted in redundant or fragmented phenotypes with limited clinical relevance.

Sociodemographic characteristics of the three phenotypes.

To facilitate a graphical comparison of the differential variables across each cluster, the data were normalized using the Min–Max method. This process scaled the data to the interval [− 1, 1], and the variables were grouped according to their respective biochemical functions.

Descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The means of each of the numerical variables under study are presented for both the biochemical variables used for clustering and the sociodemographic, body composition, and physical functionality variables that were compared between clusters. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages are reported. To compare the variations between clusters in the numerical variables, ANCOVA was employed, considering sex and age as covariates. The Bonferroni technique was applied, and post hoc tests were conducted to facilitate multiple comparisons. A significance level ofp< 0.05 was established to indicate significant differences. For the categorical variables, differences between clusters were examined using cross-tabulations and the Chi-square test.

Kaplan–Meier curves were generated to assess the probability of survival in each of the groups. It was conducted using the Lifelines Python package. Hazard Ratios (HRs) were calculated, with Cox proportional hazards models in SPSS, to evaluate how clusters influenced the risk of death. Different models incorporating sociodemographic, lifestyle, physical activity, adiposity, and physical functioning variables were used, considering these variables as potential confounders.

Of the 839 individuals available in the EXERNET 3.0 initial database, a final cohort of 536 participants (64.11%) was included in this study, following the exclusion of cases with missing variables and inconsistent data (Fig.1). Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Fig.2) revealed that lipid metabolism variables contributed most strongly to the principal components (loading > 0.25), followed by markers related to the immune system, particularly total cellular elements.

The plot represents the contribution of variables onto the principal components which explain X% (First component) and Y% (Second component) of the total variance, respectively. The colour of the points reflects the contribution of each variable to the PCA. K: potassium, Ca: calcium, ALT: alanine aminotransferase, GGT: gamma glutamyltransferase, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, VLDL: very low-density lipoproteins, TyG index: triglycerides/glucose index, MCV: Mean Corpuscular Volume, MHC: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin, MCHC: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration, MPV: Mean Platelet Volume.

The selected variables, along with sex and age, enabled the classification of the sample into three distinct clusters determined using k-means clustering, employing both the SSE through the elbow method and average silhouette coefficients. These findings were validated with hierarchical clustering, as detailed in the supplementary material. The three clusters, defined by routine blood test variables, are illustrated in Fig.3.

Biochemical profiles of three phenotypes across four parameter categories. The figure shows the biochemical profiles of the ‘Healthy Cluster’, ‘Hepatic Cluster’, and ‘Metabolic Cluster’ across four categories: (a) metabolic, (b) renal, (c) immunological, and (d) hepatic parameters. The X-axis represents the parameters within each category, and the Y-axis displays the scaled values (− 1 to 1) to enable comparison across clusters. VLDL: very low-density lipoproteins, TyG index: triglycerides/glucose index, K: potassium, Ca: calcium, ALT: alanine aminotransferase, GGT: gamma glutamyl transferase, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase.

Cluster 1, termed the ‘Healthy Cluster,’ exhibited favourable metabolic and renal profiles, with lower levels of triglycerides, VLDL, glucose, and TyG index, alongside normal glomerular filtration and low levels of creatinine, uric acid, calcium, and potassium. Liver and immune markers remained within normal limits.

Cluster 2, or the ‘Metabolic Cluster,’ showed elevated triglycerides, glucose, TyG index, creatinine, uric acid, and calcium, as well as reduced glomerular filtration. Inflammatory cell counts (leukocytes, monocytes, basophils) were also higher, though most values remained within subclinical thresholds, except for glucose and TyG index (Supplementary Table 2).

Cluster 3, the ‘Hepatic Cluster,’ presented intermediate metabolic profiles but relatively elevated (yet subclinical) liver-related markers, including ALT, GGT, LDH, and bilirubin.

Table1summarizes the sociodemographic and lifestyle variables across clusters. The ‘Healthy Cluster’ comprised a higher proportion of women (82.8%,p= 0.015), with a lower prevalence of university education (3.3%,p< 0.001). A key distinguishing feature of this cluster is a greater engagement in physical activity, with 90% of participants reporting regular exercise (p< 0.001), and 93.3% walking for more than 2.5 h per week (p= 0.022). Mobility limitations were least common in this group (82.8% without issues,p= 0.03). Participants in the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ had fewer women (75%), higher rates of mobility problems (64%), and a lower proportion walking more than 2.5 h weekly (86%). The ‘Hepatic Cluster’ included the oldest individuals (mean age 78.0 ± 5.1 years,p= 0.038). No significant differences were noted in Mediterranean diet adherence or medication usage.

Generalized linear mixed models describe differences between body composition and physical function parameters in the different clusters established, adjusted by sex and age (Table2). Participants in the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ exhibited the highest levels of adiposity, including greater total body weight, increased waist-to-hip ratio, and higher total fat mass (allp< 0.05). These differences were especially pronounced in regional fat distribution, with significantly higher fat mass in the limbs compared to individuals in the ‘Healthy’ and ‘Hepatic’ clusters (Table2,p< 0.05). Fat-free mass, however, did not differ significantly among groups.

†Each letter of the superscript denotes a subset whose proportions do not differ significantly from each other at the 0.05 level.

Physical performance outcomes were also poorest in the ‘Metabolic Cluster’. Participants in this group showed lower scores in multiple domains of functionality, including agility, walking speed, cardiorespiratory endurance, and flexibility (p< 0.05 for all comparisons with the other clusters, Table2). By contrast, no significant differences were found between clusters for muscular strength (as assessed by handgrip, arm, and leg strength) or balance measures.

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (Fig.4) revealed clear differences in six-year survival probabilities among the clusters. Participants in the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ demonstrated the lowest survival rate (85%), followed by those in the ‘Hepatic Cluster’ (89%) and the ‘Healthy Cluster’ (95%). These findings suggest that biochemical phenotypes are associated with differential mortality risk in this cohort of physically active older adults. Figure4further displays the variables most impacting HRs within the general population.

The figure shows: (a) survival curves for the ‘Healthy’, ‘Metabolic’ and ‘Hepatic’ clusters, (b) by sex, and (c) Cox proportional hazard plot showing the log of the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for variables influencing mortality, highlighting significant risk factors for mortality across groups. BMI: Body mass index.

Cox regression analyses (Table3) were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality, adjusting for potential confounders. Both the ‘Metabolic’ and ‘Hepatic’ clusters showed higher mortality risks compared to the ‘Healthy Cluster,’ with these associations becoming statistically significant in models that adjusted for physical activity (Model 4) and adiposity (Model 5). Specifically, the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ exhibited HRs of 3.45 (95% CI: 1.11–10.61) and 3.71 (95% CI: 1.14–12.06), while the ‘Hepatic Cluster’ showed HRs of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.05–8.61) and 3.85 (95% CI: 1.09–13.58), respectively (bothp< 0.05). Moreover, the association between the ‘Hepatic Cluster’ and increased mortality remained significant when physical function was introduced as a covariate (Model 6), with an HR of 3.67 (95% CI: 1.06–12.72;p= 0.04).

†Model 1: not adjusted; Model 2: adjusted by sociodemographic variables (age, sex, studies level and economic level; Model 3: adjusted by model 2 and quality of life (smoking and diseases type); Model 4: adjusted by model 3 and physical activity (Organized Physical Activity and walks more than 150 min per week); Model 5: adjusted by model 4 and adiposity (body mass index, waist to hip ratio and fat mass); Model 6: adjusted by model 5 and physical function (balance, leg strength, velocity and resistance).

This study provides new insights into the biochemical phenotypes of active Spanish adults aged over 65 by identifying three distinct health-related clusters: ‘Healthy’, ‘Metabolic’, and ‘Hepatic’. Each cluster reflects a unique health profile with varying implications for physical function, body composition, and survival probability. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to routine blood test data, we identified clinically meaningful subgroups within a population that meets WHO guidelines for physical activity. Our approach underscores the potential of blood-based phenotyping as a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for early, pre-clinical risk stratification.

The ‘Healthy Cluster’ serves as a reference group, characterized by optimal values across metabolic, hepatic, renal, and immune biomarkers. This cluster also displayed the most favourable profiles in physical activity participation, mobility, and body composition, reinforcing the synergistic role of behavioural and physiological resilience in healthy aging. Importantly, the predominance of women in this cluster suggests potential sex-based differences in vulnerability or protective factors, which aligns with recent findings that point to sex-specific trajectories in biological aging and inflammation23,24. While the well-known male–female health-survival paradox posits longer female longevity despite worse morbidity, our results reveal a subgroup of women with superior clinical and functional profiles—possibly reflecting enhanced behavioural engagement, biological buffering capacity, or both. OPA engagement and active walking were highest in this cluster, highlighting structured physical activity as a key differentiator of health status even within an active cohort25,26. Beyond its well-established physical benefits, physical activity is increasingly recognized for its impact on biological aging markers. Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation—novel proxies for biological age—respond favourably to regular activity, with active individuals exhibiting slower molecular aging27. The biomarker constellation of the ‘Healthy Cluster’ may thus reflect both behavioural factors and deeper molecular adaptations, offering a phenotype of resilient aging. This cluster’s combination of biochemical normalcy, functional competence, and low mortality risk offers a benchmark for what successful aging may look like in community-dwelling older adults. As such, it provides a valuable reference phenotype for identifying deviations and guiding preventive strategies in more at-risk profiles.

The ‘Metabolic Cluster’ is distinguished by elevated glycaemic, lipid, and renal markers—namely glucose, triglycerides, TyG index, and creatinine—as well as reduced glomerular filtration rate, aligning with early manifestations of metabolic syndrome28,29. These subclinical deviations, despite the participants’ adherence to physical activity recommendations, reveal latent metabolic dysregulation that is not yet clinically apparent but nonetheless linked to poorer health. The innovation of our findings lies in the identification of these risk profiles from routine biomarkers in non-diseased, active individuals—a strategy that may inform early preventive interventions, especially lifestyle-based ones. Participants in the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ presented greater body weight, adiposity (including regional fat accumulation), and poorer performance in agility, speed, endurance, and flexibility. This aligns with the established pathophysiological nexus between metabolic dysfunction, increased fat mass, and diminished functional capacity30. Notably, physical function appeared to moderate—but not eliminate—the cluster’s elevated mortality risk, highlighting its partial protective role and the need for additional interventions. These findings emphasize that routine biochemical markers can reveal hidden metabolic stress even among older adults who meet physical activity guidelines. Strikingly, this cluster showed the lowest six-year survival rate (85%), with hazard ratios for mortality significantly elevated after adjusting for adiposity and physical function, as described in31. These data reinforce the prognostic value of subclinical metabolic markers, supporting their inclusion in preventive screening strategies aimed at optimizing aging outcomes32,33. Early identification and targeted management—possibly combining tailored exercise programs, nutritional counselling, and pharmacological options34—could reduce morbidity and mortality in this growing demographic.

The ‘Hepatic Cluster’ presented intermediate metabolic profiles but was distinguished by elevated (yet subclinical) hepatic enzymes—ALT, GGT, LDH, and bilirubin—suggesting latent hepatic dysfunction35. Importantly, this phenotype was not associated with greater medication use, suggesting endogenous rather than iatrogenic origins. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to report liver-based phenotypic clustering using routine blood tests in an active, community-dwelling older adults’ population. Given the growing burden of asymptomatic hepatic conditions such as NAFLD in aging cohorts, this phenotype merits further clinical attention. Although the ‘Hepatic Cluster’ had a six-year survival rate slightly higher than the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ (89%), Cox regression revealed a similarly elevated mortality risk, even after accounting for physical function. This finding suggests that hepatic biomarkers may serve as independent predictors of mortality risk in older adults, as previously documented in36, warranting their inclusion in geriatric assessments. The persistence of risk after adjusting for adiposity and physical function suggests underlying hepatic or systemic vulnerabilities that remain to be fully understood.

Overall, our findings demonstrate that even subclinical deviations in routine biochemical markers—particularly those reflecting metabolic and hepatic function—are associated with meaningful differences in physical performance and mortality risk. The clustering approach adopted here provides a powerful framework to stratify risk and personalize interventions in aging populations previously considered homogeneous. Such stratification may be instrumental in delaying the onset of age-related decline and optimizing healthcare resource allocation. These results advocate for the integration of unsupervised learning models into routine clinical practice, particularly in the context of aging surveillance and primary care. Clusters such as the ‘Metabolic’ and ‘Hepatic’ phenotypes could be targeted for early lifestyle or pharmacological interventions well before traditional clinical thresholds are crossed. In contrast, the ‘Healthy Cluster’ serves as a valuable model of resilient aging, with potential implications for identifying protective factors—both behavioural and biological—that could be promoted across the broader population.

This study has several strengths. First, the data used for the cluster analysis, specifically blood test parameters, are minimally invasive and routinely available, making this approach feasible for broad application across various cohorts and healthcare settings in the future. Additionally, body composition and physical function assessments were conducted in a standardized and objective manner, ensuring consistency and allowing for unbiased cluster analysis. The 6-year follow-up period also provided a robust basis for evaluating survival outcomes, highlighting differences in survival probabilities across the clusters.

However, some limitations should be noted. The sample consisted of older adults who were voluntarily engaged in structured physical activity programs, which may have led to selection bias. As such, individuals with reduced mobility, sarcopenia, or poorer health may be underrepresented, potentially underestimating the true prevalence and clinical severity of adverse metabolic and hepatic phenotypes. Consequently, while our findings are highly relevant for physically active older populations, they may not generalize to more sedentary or institutionalized cohorts. Future studies should aim to include a broader range of activity levels and health statuses to improve external validity. Another limitation is that body composition was measured by bioimpedance, which can be influenced by factors such as water distribution and body temperature, potentially introducing variability into the results, although the measures were always carried out under similar circumstances, following the same protocol, to reduce variability.

Additionally, physical activity was assessed using self-reported questionnaires, which are susceptible to recall bias and social desirability effects. Objective measurements using wearable devices, such as accelerometers, could provide more accurate and continuous data on activity patterns. Recent evidence supports stronger associations between accelerometer-derived metrics and molecular aging markers37reinforcing the value of such tools in future research. Finally, as a cross-sectional study, this research cannot establish causation or track how cluster membership impacts variables over time, except for survival likelihood.

This study identified three distinct clusters—‘Healthy’, ‘Metabolic’, and ‘Hepatic’—within a cohort of physically active older adults in Spain, based on routine biochemical markers. Despite all participants meeting physical activity guidelines, the ‘Metabolic’ and ‘Hepatic’ clusters revealed latent physiological dysregulation, with poorer functional profiles and elevated mortality risks. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of subclinical biomarker patterns in stratifying health trajectories during aging. Our results highlight the utility of machine learning for uncovering hidden risk in seemingly healthy populations and suggest that integrating biochemical phenotyping into preventive health strategies may improve long-term outcomes in older adults.

Our results advocate for a holistic approach to biochemical assessment, focusing on the collective patterns of routine blood markers rather than isolated parameters. By applying machine learning techniques, this study demonstrates the potential to identify risk factors early, paving the way for personalized preventive measures. These findings have potential applications in the early detection of disease and the development of specific interventions for healthy ageing. By identifying subclinical biochemical patterns associated with poorer physical function and survival, our approach could serve as a basis for the design of practical health monitoring tools for older people. The integration of unsupervised clustering into existing protocols for assessing the health of older adults—such as those used in primary care or community prevention programmes—could enable the early identification of individuals at risk who do not yet meet clinical thresholds for disease. Individuals in the ‘Metabolic Cluster’ could benefit from early non-pharmacological strategies such as personalised physical activity or metabolic monitoring. In some cases, early pharmacological interventions could also be considered, potentially reducing the need for more intensive treatment later. By anticipating complications before they manifest clinically, healthcare systems may reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve resource allocation, reinforcing the value of early prevention in ageing populations. These results provide a novel and accessible way to stratify risk using routine blood data and could improve current health management strategies by prioritising timely, cost-effective measures before disease develops. In summary, using unsupervised learning to detect biochemical profiles based on routine clinical data could help to inform preventive strategies and ultimately contribute to an improved quality of life and increased longevity for older adults, as well as more sustainable healthcare outcomes.
