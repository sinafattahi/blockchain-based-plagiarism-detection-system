Gardneria multifloraMakino is an important medicinal plant endemic to China, with its roots and leaves traditionally used for therapeutic purposes. In this study, we report the complete chloroplast genome ofG. multiflora. The 144,920 bp genome (GC 37.82%) has a typical circular quadripartite structure: 98,036 bp LSC, 18,382 bp SSC, and two 14,251 bp IRs. It has 125 unique genes, comprising 82 protein-coding, 35 tRNA, and 8 rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that G. multiflora is closely related to G. ovata. The data presented in this study can guide future research on the evolutionary history of this species.

Gardneria multifloraMakino (1901,Figure 1), a valuable medicinal plant from the Loganiaceae family, is widely distributed in China, specifically south of the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River Line and north of the Nanling Mountains in China (Zhang et al.2021). The genusGardneria, belonging to the Loganiaceae family, is endemic to Asia and occurs throughout East Asia, from the eastern Himalayas to Japan. It comprises six recognized species:G. multifloraMakino,G. anguatifoliaWall.,G. linifoliaC.Y. Wu & S.Y. Pao,G. lanceolataRehd. & Wilson,G. ovataWall., andG. distinctaP.T. Li (Jiang et al.2012).

Multiflorais a species of lianas or scandent shrubs that thrives along forest edges at altitudes ranging from 300 to 2100 m (Editorial Committee of Flora of China1996). Both its roots and leaves exhibit anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and hemostatic properties, making them widely used in traditional medicine to treat conditions such as arthrophlogosis and sciatica by dispersing wind and promoting blood circulation (He and Peng2010). Numerous studies have shown that the primary bioactive compounds inG. multifloraare monoterpenoid alkaloids and lignans (Yang et al.2018). However, research on the molecular aspects ofG. multifloraremains limited. To enhance understanding of the phylogenetic position ofG. multiflorawithin the Loganiaceae family, this study aimed to assemble and characterize its complete chloroplast genome (cpDNA). The results will contribute to evolutionary research onG. multifloraand support the inference of phylogenetic relationships with related species.

Fresh leaves ofG. multiflorawere collected from the medicinal botanical garden of West Anhui University, located in Anhui Province, China (latitude: 31°77′ N, longitude: 115°93′ E). A voucher specimen (No. PLG-20230318-1), has been deposited at West Anhui Health Vocational College (contact: Guangyan Li, email:lgyhjj8812345@126.com). Genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves using a genomic DNA extraction kit sourced from Tiangen Biotech (Beijing, China). Whole genome sequencing was conducted using the BGISEQ-500 platform provided by Hefei Biodata Biotechnologies Inc.

The chloroplast genome ofG. multiflorawas filtered using the program fastp (Chen et al.2018) and subsequently assembled with SPAdes assembler version 3.10.0 (Bankevich et al.2012). Genome annotation was performed using utilizing GeSeq (Tillich et al.2017) and BLASTx (Gish and States1993). The finalized completed chloroplast genome sequence ofG. multiflorahas been submitted to GenBank under the accession numberOQ756143.

A phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the complete the chloroplast ofG. multiflora, along with those of nine other closely related species, withHemidesmus indicusdesignated as the outgroup. The cpDNA sequences of the other related species were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. Sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v7.307 (Katoh and Standley2013). A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was then constructed using FastTree version 2.1.10 with 100 resamples, employing the Generalized Time-Reversible (GTR) model and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test to assess branch support. Support values based on the SH test were displayed at the corresponding branches of the resulting phylogenetic tree (Price et al.2010).

The average coverage depth of the chloroplast genome ofG. multiflorais 2036.7×. The read coverage map presented a relatively uniform distribution (Figure S1), indicating the robustness and reliability of the sequencing data used in this study. Analysis with the CPGview tool (Liu et al.2023) revealed that the chloroplast genome has a typical circular, quadripartite structure with a total length of 144,920 bp. It consists of two inverted repeats (IR) regions of 14,251 bp each, separating a large single-copy (LSC) region of 98,036 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,382 bp (Figure 2). The overall GC content of the genome is 37.82%, with the LSC, SSC, and IR regions having GC contents of 36.30%, 31.99%, and 46.81%, respectively.

Schematic illustration of the chloroplast genome ofG. multiflora. This graphical map, generated using the CPGview online tool, visualizes key features identified in the complete chloroplast genome. It consists of seven concentric layers. The outermost layer shows dispersed repeats, with red arcs indicating forward repeats and green arcs indicating reverse repeats. The second layer displays long tandem repeats, marked by short blue bars. The third layer represents short tandem repeats (microsatellites), illustrated by colored bars of varying shades. The fourth layer outlines the boundaries and lengths of the small single-copy (SSC) and large single-copy (LSC) regions. The fifth layer highlights the inverted repeats (IRA and IRB). The sixth layer depicts the GC content distribution across the plastome. Lastly, the innermost layer presents gene annotation, with genes grouped by functional category and color-coded for clarity.

The chloroplast genome ofG. multifloracontains a total of 125 genes, comprising 82 protein-coding genes, 35 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. Of these, 10 genes are duplicated within the IR regions, including one protein-coding gene, five tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. The LSC region harbors 88 genes in total, including 64 protein-coding genes and 24 tRNA genes. In contrast, the SSC region contains 12 genes – 11 protein-coding genes and one being a tRNA gene. Additionally, 16 genes contain two exons, while four genes –pafI,clpP1, and two copies ofrps12 – contain three exons. Several genes, includingrps16,atpF,rpoC1, pafI,clpP1,petB,petD,rpl16,rpl2, ndhB, andndhA, undergo cis-splicing (Figure S2). Notably,rps12 was identified as a trans-splicing gene (Figure S3).

To determine the taxonomic placement ofG. multiflora, we aligned its complete chloroplast genome with those of ten related species using MAFFT v7.307 (Katoh and Standley2013). The resulting maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirmed a close relationship betweenG. multifloraandG. ovata(Figure 3). These two species formed a strongly supported monophyletic clade, with a bootstrap value of 100%. Furthermore, they were most closely related to the fourStrychnosspecies included in the analysis. The phylogenetic tree constructed in this study provides a valuable framework for future evolutionary and taxonomic research within the Loganiaceae family.

The tree was constructed using 1000 bootstrap replicates and support values are shown at the corresponding branches. The following ten chloroplast genome sequences were included in the analysis:Strychnos nitida(OP581044),Strychnos wallichiana(ON881741) (Jin et al.2024),Strychnos cathayensis(ON881581) (Jin et al.2024),Strychnos nux-vomica(MZ440354),Strychnos nux-vomica(MZ440353),Gardneria ovata(MZ440349),Mitreola yangchunensis(MT471262) (Du et al.2020),Mitrasacme pygmaea(MT330399) (Du et al.2020),Coffea arabica(PV021911) (Zhang et al.2020), andGalium aparine(KY562587) (Zhang et al.2020). The numbers above the tree nodes represent SH-like local support values.

In this study, we successfully sequenced and characterized the complete chloroplast genome ofG. multiflora. To ensure the accuracy of the genome assembly, we conducted thorough validation using multiple software tools. Specifically, the genome was assembled using both SPAdes version 3.10.0 and NOVOPlasty version 4.3 (Dierckxsens et al.2017). Notably, both approaches yielded identical assembly results, thereby confirming the reliability and precision of the sequence data.

The phylogenetic analysis confirms a close relationship betweenG. multifloraandG. ovata. Despite their genetic similarity, the two species exhibit distinct morphological differences. Specifically,G. multiflorapossesses five calyx lobes, five corolla lobes, and five stamens, whereasG. ovatahas four of each. These findings support traditional morphological classifications and provide valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics within the Loganiaceae family. Notably, this study presents the first complete assembly of the chloroplast genome ofG. multiflora. This genomic information represents a valuable genetic resource for theGardneriagenus and holds significant potential for advancing our understanding ofG. multiflora’s evolutionary history. The research provides a solid foundation for species identification, detailed evolutionary studies, and the genetic improvement of this important medicinal plant. Furthermore, the chloroplast genes identified inG. multifloramay have promising applications in genetic engineering, potentially leading to the discovery or enhancement of medicinal properties.
