Ga2O3thin films were deposited
simultaneously
on (112̅0)a-plane, (101̅0)m-plane, (0001)c-plane, and (011̅2)r-plane sapphire substrates using metal–organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The different surface energy and
strain conditions imposed by each sapphire plane make the choice of
substrate orientation critical to the stabilization of the α-phase.
β-Ga2O3nucleation was found to be preferential
over α-Ga2O3on sapphire orientations
with <11̅00> α-Al2O3present
(c- anda-planes) when grown under the same conditions.
In contrast, α-Ga2O3is preferred during
the initial stages of growth on ther- andm-plane, although suppression of island growth is required
to prevent the formation of inclined facets on which β-Ga2O3might nucleate. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) provided a direct confirmation of this growth forr-plane substrates. Classical nucleation theory was applied to rationalize
these observations and guide the search for the growth window of α-Ga2O3. As a result, decreasing the VI/III ratio and
increasing the TEGa flow rate were found to be effective in realizing
phase-pure α-Ga2O3ona-plane sapphire by MOCVD with good structural quality (62 arcsec
full width half-maxima of X-ray rocking curve), though the equivalent
growth onc-plane substrates yielded mixed-phase
β- and κ-Ga2O3another metastable
phase of Ga2O3, instead. Growth on them-plane resulted in the smoothest surface morphology and
thickest phase-pure α-Ga2O3film, indicating
that it is the most promising substrate orientation for future device
manufacturing.

Corundum α-Ga2O3(space groupR3̅c) boasts
the widest bandgap of
all Ga2O3polymorphs (5.1–5.3 eV) and is isostructural with α-Al2O3, commonly known as sapphire. This permits not only
the growth of high-quality domain-matched α-Ga2O3layers on economical substrates (sapphire being available at significantly lower cost than native
Ga2O3substrates used for high-quality β-Ga2O3growth) but also extensive bandgap engineering
by alloying with Al over the full composition range fromx= 0 to 1 in α-(AlxGa1–x)2O3, leading to a bandgap
range of 5.1–8.8 eV.−Such compositional control is
generally more difficult in the monoclinic phase, where β-(AlxGa1–x)2O3films typically suffer from local segregation
of Al and Ga (e.g., on (001) and (2̅01) β-Ga2O3substrates),or phase segregation
of β- and γ-Ga2O3(e.g., on (010)
β-Ga2O3substrates),toward
high Al content. Up to 99% Al composition β-(AlGa)2O3films have been achieved on (100) β-Ga2O3substrates, but the film quality degrades with increasing
Al content. In contrast, α-(AlGa)2O3films do not degrade or even improve in crystallinity
toward Al-rich regimes.,Finally, it is worth highlighting
that, similar to β-Ga2O3, n-type conductivity
of α-Ga2O3films can be achieved by Si,−Sn,,or Ge doping,,with controllable
carrier density over the range of 1017–1019cm–3and electron mobility up to 98.7 cm2V–1s–1having been reported. These qualities make α-Ga2O3an attractive material for the fabrication of high-breakdown
power devices like Schottky diodes,,,field-effect transistors,,and optoelectronic devices such as solar blind photodetectors.

Despite these advantages, the growth of
α-Ga2O3is challenging because of its
metastability. Thin films of
phase-pure α-Ga2O3can transform into
the most thermodynamically stable polymorph β-Ga2O3, typically at temperatures above 600–650 °C.−Up to now, mist chemical vapor deposition (mist-CVD),,,and halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE)−have proven to be the
most effective methods capable of realizing thick layers of α-Ga2O3onc-plane sapphire; this might
be due to the presence of HCl that acts as a catalyst and aids the
formation of α-Ga2O3. For epitaxial techniques without HCl such as pulsed laser
deposition (PLD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), or standard metal
organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), Schewski et al. found that
only a pseudomorphic interlayer of α-Ga2O3could be stabilized onc-plane sapphire before
transitioning to (2̅01) β-Ga2O3as
soon as the film relaxes. Although only
a few monolayers of α-Ga2O3were stabilized,
this study demonstrated that substrate-imposed strain conditions are
a key factor in the stabilization of α-Ga2O3. A later study by Schowalter et al. showed that the thin pseudomorphic
interlayer is actually α-(AlGa)2O3with
∼65% Al, rather than pure α-Ga2O3as previously assumed, suggesting that Ga–Al interdiffusion
between the film and substrate may occur during its formation. Nonetheless, the influence of epitaxial stress
and strain on the Ga2O3phase selection remains
significant and cannot be overlooked. Hence,a-,m-, andr-plane-oriented sapphire were
subsequently investigated by other authors as a growth substrate for
α-Ga2O3.−Nevertheless, due to different growth kinetics across
the range of epitaxial techniques reported in the literature, it is
not fully clear how sapphire orientation alone affects the assumed
phase of Ga2O3. For instance, in MBE growth
onm-plane sapphire, it was found that β-Ga2O3started to grow ona-plane
facets of α-(InGa)2O3film as the thickness
exceeded 50 nm. In contrast, a recent
MOCVD study reported that growth onm-plane yields
mixed-phase α and β at 100 nm thickness, attributed to
β-Ga2O3growing ona-plane
facets on the α-Ga2O3layer. In PLD growth, using the same substrate orientation,
phase-pure α-Ga2O3films are only possible
up to 220 nm before β-Ga2O3started to
nucleate onc-plane facets instead.

In this work, to unambiguously determine the influence
of sapphire
substrate orientation on Ga2O3epitaxy by MOCVD,
which is the industry-preferred growth technique, growth must be performed
simultaneously on all orientations in the same reactor. The following
four sapphire orientations were studied: (112̅0)a-plane, (101̅0)m-plane, (0001)c-plane, and (011̅2)r-plane. Systematic investigation
of Ga2O3crystallographic structure, material
quality, and growth mode for each sapphire substrate orientation provides
crucial insight toward achieving high-quality α-Ga2O3growth by MOCVD.

Thin films of Ga2O3were simultaneously
grown
on (11̅20)a-plane, (101̅0)m-plane, (0001)c-plane, and (011̅2)r-plane sapphire substrates using an Agnitron Agilis 100
MOCVD reactor. All sapphire substrates were diced into 10 × 7.5
mm2rectangular samples and cleaned using solvents, buffered
oxide etch, and a 30 min DI water rinse with ultrasonification before
being loaded into the reactor chamber. Triethylgallium (TEGa) and
high-purity O2gas (99.9999%) were used as Ga and O precursors
with argon (Ar) carrier gas. TEGa flow rate, VI/III ratio, reactor
pressure, and growth temperature were held constant at 19.92 μmol/min,
450, 20 Torr, and 500 °C, unless stated otherwise. The surface
morphology of the resulting Ga2O3layers was
characterized using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
crystallographic characteristics (crystal structure, quality, and
orientation) were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Layer thicknesses were measured by X-ray
refractory (XRR) or optical reflectometry. Reflectometry data were
fitted using α- and β-Ga2O3refractive
indices reported by Johnston et al. All
XRD and XRR measurements were performed using a Philips X’pert
diffractometer with a Cu Kα source.

Growth time was varied between
2 and 14 min to produce sets of
Ga2O3films of various thicknesses on thea-,m-,c-, andr-plane.Figureshows XRD 2θ-ω scans of all 16 samples grown.
In each growth, the thicknesses of the layers were measured to be
approximately 13, 20, 50, and 100 nm for all four substrates, i.e.,
the average growth rate (∼430 nm/h) was found to be independent
of crystal orientation. We denote the 16 films as X1–X4, where X indicates the substrate orientation (A:a-plane, M:m-plane, C:c-plane, and R:r-plane), and the subscript corresponds
to the film thickness (1:13 nm, 2:20 nm, 3:50 nm, and 4:100 nm). For
example, A3refers to the film grown ona-plane sapphire with a 50 nm thickness.

XRD scans of 13–100
nm thick Ga2O3films deposited on (a)c-plane sapphire, (b)a-plane sapphire,
(c)r-plane sapphire
(skew-symmetric geometry with azimuth aligned to [211̅0], tilt
∼25°), and (d)m-plane sapphire substrates,
under the same growth conditions ofT= 500 °C,
TEGa ∼20 μmol/min, VI/III = 450, andp= 20 Torr. The inset of (c) shows XRD scans of the samer-plane samples in symmetric geometry. Note that a few spectra
show aluminum peaks at 2θ = 38.2°, 44.5°, and 82.3°
arising from the diffractometer stage on which samples were directly
placed during the scan.

For growth on thec-plane (0001)
sapphire (Figurea),
Ga2O3nucleated
as the β-phase and continued to grow
into pure β-Ga2O3films with increasing
growth time: only {2̅01} β-Ga2O3peaks (2θ = 18.9°, 38.3°, and 59.1°) were observed.
For growth ona-plane sapphire (11̅20), shown
inFigureb, a mixture
of α- and β-Ga2O3was detected,
as indicated by the presence of both (112̅0) α-Ga2O3(2θ = 36.0°) and (2̅01) β-Ga2O3peaks inFigureb. As the film grows, the intensity of the (2̅01)
β-Ga2O3peak increases at a faster rate
than the (112̅0) α-Ga2O3peakthe
latter remaining roughly constant as the film thickness exceeded 50
nm, indicating that growth is predominantly β-Ga2O3for thicker films.

For layers grown onr-plane (011̅2) sapphire,
the (022̅4) α-Ga2O3peak at 2θ
= 50.2° in the symmetric scan (zero tilt) was always present
(Figurec inset),
but from 50 nm thickness onward, the (2̅01) β-Ga2O3peak begins to appear in the skew-symmetric scan (25°
tilt) aligned to a {112̅3} plane of the sapphire (Figurec). Note that the (112̅3)
α-Ga2O3reflection has a lower relative
intensity than the (022̅4) α-Ga2O3reflection due to the former’s weaker diffracting power.
Likewise, (4̅02) β-Ga2O3is not
visible inFigurec because of a weaker diffracting power than that of (2̅01)
β-Ga2O3, which already has a low intensity.
These XRD observations indicate that the film on ther-plane begins as predominantly α-Ga2O3and becomes a mixed phase at some point during epitaxial growth,
likely due to β-Ga2O3growing on exposed
facets of α-Ga2O3growth islands. This
can occur via (2̅01) β-Ga2O3nucleating
on {112̅3} (n-plane) facets of α-Ga2O3, but not exclusively, as later transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed the presence of additional
orientations of the β-Ga2O3crystallite.
So far, we have assumed that no bulk α → β transition
took place within the initial few monolayers during growth, which
is reasonable considering that the growth temperature was fixed at
500 °Cwell within the stability limit of α-Ga2O3. Such a transformation
would also heavily suppress the (011̅2) α-Ga2O3peaks, which was not observed. In fact, the (022̅4)
α-Ga2O3peak increases in intensity as
the film grows thicker. Note that since (2̅01) β-Ga2O3growing onn-plane facets does
not result in a detectable peak in symmetric geometry, caution must
be exercised when determining the phase composition of Ga2O3grown on ther-plane. In addition,
as previously discussed, a similar growth mode was also observed in
MBE growth where the (2̅01) β-Ga2O3reflections were found onc-plane facets instead.

Finally, only growth on them-plane (101̅0)
sapphire resulted in phase-pure α-Ga2O3films. The peak attributed to (303̅0) α-Ga2O3at 2θ = 64.8° can be seen inFigured. In terms of α-Ga2O3crystal quality, the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the ω-scan rocking curve was measured to be 0.42°
for 50 nm thick layers on thea-plane (at (112̅0)),
0.73° for them-plane (at (303̅0)), and
1.18° for ther-plane (at (022̅4)).

Investigation of surface morphology (imaged by AFM,Figure) of Ga2O3grown ona-,m-,c-, andr-plane sapphire substrates reveals that
from 13 nm layer thickness onward, growth proceeds through 3D islands
forc-,a-, andr-plane substrates. On average, the growth island size onc- anda-planes (24–26 nm wide at
13 nm thickness) is larger than the island size onm- andr-planes (15–16 nm wide at 13 nm thickness).
The increasing size and height of the growth islands manifest as a
monotonic increase in surface roughness with film thickness (Figure). Notably, the morphological
evolution of the film onc- anda-planes is quite similar, with almost identical surface roughening
rates as a function of deposited thickness and island sizes. This
correlates with the dominance of β-Ga2O3growth on these substrate orientations, especially after 50 nm for
thea-plane as shown in the XRD results inFigure. In contrast, for
ther-plane, although the growth started with the
nucleation of α-Ga2O3nanoislands, as
the film exceeds 50 nm, large islands began to emerge on the surface
of the samples grown onr-plane sapphire (Figurek); these subsequently
grow into elongated islands running along one direction (Figurel), resulting in
a distinct increase in surface roughness. It is speculated that these
elongated islands are a result of β-Ga2O3nucleating on inclined facets of α-Ga2O3islands as previously discussed, since the emergence of these features
coincides with the onset of (2̅01) β-Ga2O3peaks in the skew-symmetric XRD scan of ther-plane, seen inFigurec. Interestingly, at higher growth temperatures only (650 °C),
a similar growth mode can be observed on them-plane,
which will be discussed below.

AFM scans (2 × 2 μm2area) of Ga2O3films grown on (a–d)a-plane
(films A1–A4), (e–h)c-plane (films C1–C4), (i–l)r-plane (films R1–R4), and
(m–p)m-plane (films M1–M4) sapphire substrates, with thicknesses between 13 and 100
nm (Tgr= 500 °C). Note that film
names have the formatXi, whereXindicates the substrate orientation (A:a-plane, M:m-plane, C:c-plane, and R:r-plane), and the subscripticorresponds to the film thickness (1:13 nm, 2:20 nm, 3:50
nm, and 4:100 nm). The surface roughness of all 16 samples is plotted
inFigure.

Root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 13–100
nm thick
Ga2O3films grown ona-,m-,c-, andr-planes (Tgr= 500 °C).

For growth onm-plane substrates
(Figurem–p)
at 500 °C,
before reaching 20 nm film thickness, it appears that the surface
fully coalesces with subnanometer surface roughness. When the epilayer
reaches 50 nm thickness, however, new growth hillocks (40–80
nm wide) emerge and are sparsely spaced-out on a very smooth coalesced
surface of RMS roughness ∼0.6 nm (Figureo), with RMS roughness comparable to the
film at a thickness of 20 nm (Figuren). These islands subsequently expand to 70–130
nm width (Figurep).
Hence, it is most likely that the growth mode of α-Ga2O3on them-plane is layer + island (Stranski-Krastanov),
consistent with observations reported by Li et al. and Jinno and Okumura. Compared
to the Ga2O3films grown at 500 °C discussed
so far,Figureshows
the XRD scan ofm-plane Ga2O3films grown at a higher growth temperature of 650 °C and their
respective AFM scans. As the film grows past 60 nm, XRD 2θ peaks
associated with β-Ga2O3(2θ = 60.9°)
begin to appear near the Kβsapphire peak (Figurea), coinciding with
the emergence of elongated islands running along [0001] in AFM scans
(Figurec,d). Since
similar surface features and XRD peaks have been observed in growth
by PLD, they have been attributed to
(2̅01) β-Ga2O3nucleating ontoc-plane facets of α-Ga2O3growth
islands, which act as nucleation sites for β-Ga2O3at higher growth temperatures only.

nm thick Ga2O3films grown onm-plane sapphire at 650 °C.

nm thick, (c) 60 nm thick, and (d) 100 nm thick film.

The in-plane crystallographic relationships among
α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and the
sapphire were confirmed using XRD skew-symmetric ϕ-scans. InFigurea, every α-Ga2O3peak on thea-,m-, andr-plane is matched to its sapphire equivalent,
signifying one single rotational domain. On the other hand, the six
peaks over 360° of β-Ga2O3represent
six rotational domains. For growth onc-plane sapphire,
this is the well-known epitaxial relationship <010>(2̅01)
β-Ga2O3|| <101̅0>(0001) α-Al2O3as depicted by the model inFigureb, which shows similar hexagonal
oxygen arrangement for both (0001) α-Al2O3and (2̅01) β-Ga2O3. However, unlike thec-plane,
atoms on thea-plane of sapphire do not have 3-fold
rotation symmetry. Thus, the epitaxial relationship must be slightly
different despite the same number of β-Ga2O3rotational domains. Noting that β-Ga2O3domains are only approximately 60° apart, and that [11̅01]
and [11̅01̅] form a 57.6° angle with [11̅00]
on either side such that [11̅00] is the bisecting line, the
epitaxial relationship is <010>(2̅01) β-Ga2O3|| [11̅00]/<11̅01>(112̅0) α-Al2O3(depicted inFigurec). Based on the spacing between neighboring
oxygen atoms, the lattice mismatch between β-Ga2O3anda-plane sapphire is approximately 6.5%
for <010> β-Ga2O3|| [11̅00]
α-Al2O3and 12.0% for <010> β-Ga2O3|| <11̅01> α-Al2O3.

sapphire while blue ones represent oxygen atoms on β-Ga2O3(generated with Visualization for Electronic
and Structural Analysis (VESTA) software).

Our observations so far suggest that there are
two general cases
of Ga2O3thin film growth on sapphire substrates
(Figure). In case
(a), mixed α- and β- or pure β-grains directly nucleate
on the substrate on which there are atoms aligned along <11̅00>
α-Al2O3(e.g.,c- anda-planes). Eventually, β-grains of Ga2O3grow over α-grains, and β-Ga2O3becomes the only phase growing. The proposed growth mode
of case (a) substrates is consistent with transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) observations reported by various authors.,In contrast, in case (b), for sapphire planes which do not have
atoms aligned along a <11̅00>, such asm-plane andr-plane substrates, a layer of phase-pure
α-Ga2O3is stabilized first. However,
if growth proceeds via 3D islands, as the α-Ga2O3film develops, the β-phase can start nucleating on
inclined facets of α-Ga2O3islands, resulting
in significant surface roughening. This occurs after a certain thickness
only, since larger grains provide more suitable facets for β-Ga2O3nucleation. Hence,
suppressing island growth and achieving a smooth surface morphology
will be crucial to growing phase-pure α-Ga2O3on case (b) substrate orientations by MOCVD. Form-plane substrates, such a growth mode has been consistently
demonstrated across a range of epitaxy methods.−However, as
previously noted, the specific facet that emerges, which is likely
governed by growth kinetics, might vary between different methods.

Schematic
diagram of the structure evolution of the Ga2O3epilayer in two cases: (a) In-plane <11̅00>
α-Al2O3is present. β-Ga2O3can grow directly on the substrate. (b) In-plane <11̅00>
α-Al2O3is not present. α-Ga2O3grows first, but β-Ga2O3can nucleate through growth island facets.

To confirm that the structural evolution of Ga2O3films grown onr-plane substrates
is consistent
with the proposed growth mode of case (b) substrates, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of sample R3(Tgr= 500 °C,t= 50 nm)
are shown inFigure. A sharp film–substrate interface can be clearly observed
in both low- and high-magnification images ofFigurea,b. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image
of the film inFigureb reveals two distinct regions: a lower α-Ga2O3region with similar lattice spacing (d-spacing)
to the substrate and an upper β-Ga2O3region
with largerd-spacing, consistent with the fact that
the β-phase has lower density. While the precise α-/β-phase
boundary is somewhat indistinct, possibly due to being slightly off
edge-on orientation, the β-phase appears to nucleate on top
of inclined facets of α-phase crystallites rather than directly
on sapphire, appearing as (200) β-Ga2O3lattice planes (with ad-spacing of approximately
0.6 nm) oriented ∼15° to the (011̅2) α-Ga2O3planes inFigureb. Note that the dotted white line depicting the boundary
inFigureb is an
approximation since the phase boundary may not be sharply defined:
phase overlap and deviation from the line are possible. Local fast
Fourier transforms (FFTs) of the substrate and regions where α-
and β-phases exist separately further confirm the identity and
relative orientation of the crystals. Both α-Ga2O3and sapphire show diffraction patterns (DPs) consistent with
the [211̅0] zone axis of corundum crystals (Figured,e). The FFT of the β-Ga2O3region (Figurec) is consistent with the diffraction pattern (DP)
of the [010] zone axis. Notably, the Bragg spots of (200) β-Ga2O3are misaligned by ∼15° relative
to the (011̅2) spots of the corundum crystals, which explains
why the β-crystallite observed inFigureb is not visible in standard symmetric 2θ-ω
scans. Therefore, TEM analysis of the film grown on ther-plane substrate shows that, in addition to (2̅01) β-Ga2O3growing on (112̅3) α-Ga2O3facets found in XRD, β-Ga2O3can also grow as (200) β-Ga2O3on inclined
α-Ga2O3facets. Since in the DPs inFigurec,d, {202̅}
β-Ga2O3and {01̅4} α-Ga2O3Bragg spots are approximately aligned on the
same axis, we speculate that the crystallite consisting of (200) β-Ga2O3planes (inFigureb) arises from the similard-spacings of {202̅} β-Ga2O3planes
(d-spacing ∼2.8 Å) and {01̅4} α-Ga2O3planes (d-spacing ∼2.6
Å). Nonetheless, a more detailed TEM investigation will be needed
to exhaustively categorize β-phase grains and fully explain
their origins onr-plane sapphire. Current TEM and
XRD analyses collectively support the proposed structural evolution,
wherein β-Ga2O3nucleates on inclined
α-Ga2O3facets during growth and not directly
on ther-plane-oriented substrates (i.e.,Figurecase (b) substrates).

The nucleation of
α-Ga2O3is favored
if ΔGβ–α>
0.
The first term ofeq, which accounts for the difference in condensation energy (per unit
volume) ΔGVbetween β- and
α-nucleates, is independent of substrate orientation and always
negative since β is the most stable phase. The second term accounts
for the difference in surface energies γβ‑α. Assuming that the four corundum planes considered in this study
compete with common monoclinic planes such as (2̅01) and (100),
density functional theory calculations suggested that γβ‑αis most likely negative for all four
substrates. The third term accounts for
the difference in misfit dislocation energy σm,β–α. During the very initial stages of
growth, this term is negligible because islands can be fully strained.
The last term, which accounts for the difference in strain energyEs,β–α, is the only positive
term since α-Ga2O3is lattice-matched
to sapphire. Hence, if the magnitude ofEs,β–αis greater than that of23πR3ΔGV+2πR2γβ−α, α-Ga2O3growth
should be initially favored. Past studies have estimated that, if
the nearest-neighbor mismatch between the stable phase (β-Ga2O3) and the substrate (α-Al2O3) is much larger (greater than 10–20%) compared to
the mismatch between the metastable phase (α-Ga2O3) and the substrate (ideally as close to zero as possible),
then growth islands forming on the substrate prefer to assume the
metastable phase.,However, for sapphire orientations
in which the in-plane epitaxial relationship <010> β-Ga2O3|| <101̅0> α-Al2O3is possible, such asc-plane,a-plane, orn-plane, the mismatch between
α-Ga2O3and sapphire is comparable to
the mismatch between
β-Ga2O3and sapphire. Based on the arrangement
of oxygen atoms, the distance between nearest neighboring atoms along
[11̅00] is 3.02 Å for α-Ga2O3and 2.86 Å for α-Al2O3, resulting
in a mismatch of 5.6%. In comparison, the mismatch of <010>
β-Ga2O3|| < 11̅00> α-Al2O3is 6.5%. This is far from the ideal case considered
in theory.
As such, to minimize free energy, growth islands prefer to assume
the β-phase: the energy cost of inducing more in-plane strain
in the system is lower than the cost of assuming the α-phase.

Nonetheless, according toeq, it is possible to enhance the nucleation of the metastable
α-Ga2O3over β for case (a) substrates.
Solving forRby setting∂(ΔGβ−α)∂R=0gives a constant critical radiusR* above which growth islands will exclusively prefer the
stable phase over the metastable phase. This signifies that, to successfully grow metastable polymorphs,
the island size must be kept belowR*. In MOCVD growth,
the island size can be reduced by increasing Ga supersaturation via
a combination of higher TEGa flow rate and lower VI/III ratio. This
theory was tested fora-plane andc-plane substrates using a TEGa flow rate of ∼23 μmol/min
(15% increase from 20 μmol/min), a VI/III ratio of 200 (125%
reduction from 450), and a total pressure of 10 Torr (halved from
20 Torr) while maintaining the growth temperature at 500 °C.
Note that pressure was reduced here to minimize the probability of
homogeneous β-Ga2O3nucleation from the
gas phase, which can occur under high
TEGa flow, despite higher chamber pressure increasing supersaturation.
The XRD 2θ-ω scan of the resulting 70 nm thick Ga2O3film ona-plane sapphire (Figurea) shows peaks arising
from α-Ga2O3and the substrate only without
any {2̅01} β-Ga2O3peaks. In terms
of crystallinity, ω-scan rocking curves measured at the (112̅0)
α-Ga2O3peak show excellent quality, achieving
a fwhm of 62 arcsec, comparable to α-Ga2O3grown on thec-plane by mist-CVD.,This marked improvement is owed to the film being phase-pure α-Ga2O3, unlike the mixed-phase film obtained using
the initial growth conditions. However, phase-pure α-Ga2O3growth on ac-plane substrate
still proves challenging. Under the same conditions for which phase-pure
α-Ga2O3was grown ona-plane sapphire, the film grown on thec-plane is
mixed-phase β and κ-Ga2O3instead.
In the XRD 2θ-ω scan inFigureb, a new set of peaks appear to the right
of the {2̅01} β-Ga2O3peaks, which
can be attributed to κ-Ga2O3. It is difficult
to distinguish the first set of {2̅01} β-Ga2O3and {002}­κ-Ga2O3peaks
around 2θ = 19°, but the separation is more noticeable
toward higher 2θ angles, for example, (6̅03) β-Ga2O3at 2θ = 59.1° versus (006) κ-Ga2O3at 2θ = 59.8°. Nonetheless, our results
demonstrate that increasing TEGa flow rate and decreasing VI/III ratio
(with preferably low chamber pressure) can favor the growth of metastable
Ga2O3(α- or κ-) on substrates with
<11̅00> α-Al2O3present (tested
forc- anda-plane substrates),
in agreement with nucleation theory of metastable polymorphs. In addition,
our observations for growth onc-plane substrates
are consistent with a previous growth MOCVD study, in which κ-Ga2O3was stabilized
onc-plane sapphire by lowering VI/III ratios, and
similar diffraction patterns were observed. Interestingly, pushing
growth conditions into metal-rich regimes (i.e., low VI/III ratio
for MOCVD) seems to favor the growth metastable polymorphs of Ga2O3(α- or κ-) on sapphire substrates
with <11̅00> α-Al2O3for MBE,and PLD as well.

XRD scans of Ga2O3films grown on (a)a-plane sapphire
(with the inset showing the ω-scan
rocking curve of the (112̅0) α-Ga2O3peak) and (b)c-plane sapphire under the same growth
conditions ofT= 500 °C, TEGa∼ 23 μmol/min,
VI/III = 200, andp= 10 Torr. A Ge(220) 4-bounce
monochromator was used to obtain these scans.

By performing simultaneous growth of Ga2O3using MOCVD, ona-,m-,c-, andr-plane sapphire
substrates, and
systematically characterizing the resulting Ga2O3films by XRD and AFM, we have shown that the structural evolution
of the Ga2O3film depends on the presence of
<11̅00> α-Al2O3in the substrate.
For substrate orientations with <11̅00> α-Al2O3, such asc- anda-planes, β-Ga2O3tends to directly nucleate
at the start of growth, making the film either phase-pure β-Ga2O3or mixed-phase α- and β-Ga2O3. On the other hand, for substrate orientations without
<11̅00> α-Al2O3, such asm- andr-planes, α-Ga2O3tends to nucleate first without any sizable β-Ga2O3grains present, but 3D island growth needs to
be suppressed to prevent the emergence of facets that act as nucleation
sites for β-crystallites. Such a growth mode was directly observed
for growth onr-plane substrates via TEM. Despite
differences in the growth mechanism, the growth rate of the Ga2O3was found to be mostly independent of the substrate orientation. Finally,
classical nucleation theory was adopted to gain insight on the phase
selectivity and help identify favorable conditions for α-Ga2O3epitaxy on sapphire substrates with <11̅00>
α-Al2O3. As a result, we have demonstrated
phase-pure α-Ga2O3(with 62 arcsec rocking
curve fwhm) can be grown ona-plane substrates by
MOCVD under conditions with higher Ga supersaturation, but forc-plane substrates so far, only mixed-phase β- and
κ-Ga2O3films could be obtained. These
results serve as a valuable foundation for optimizing scalable α-Ga2O3growth toward future device fabrication.
