Fire blight, caused byErwinia amylovora, is a devastating disease that affects apples and pears, leading to significant economic losses worldwide. The disease is typically managed through a combination of biological, cultural, and chemical strategies. Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and concerns regarding chemical residues, there is an urgent need for new bactericides that are both highly effective and low in toxicity. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China approved the registration of a new bactericide, benziothiazolinone also known as 1,2-Benzisothiazol-3-one.

The assessment of benziothiazolinone demonstrated an EC50value of 0.48 µg/mL againstE. amylovoraBZ16 after a 10-hour inoculation period, and 0.67 µg/mL after 16 h. Furthermore, benziothiazolinone displays a broad antimicrobial spectrum against various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, as evidenced by its EC50values. Prolonged exposure to benziothiazolinone was found to enhance the production of amylovoran in theE. amylovorastrain BZ16BITR; however, this treatment significantly diminished the pathogenicity of the strain. Resistance risk analysis indicates thatE. amylovorahas a low risk of developing resistance to benziothiazolinone. Results from two-year field trials demonstrated that benziothiazolinone could significantly reduce the disease incidence of fire blight. Compared to the streptomycin control, the application of benziothiazolinone exhibited excellent efficacy, achieving over 80% effectiveness against the disease.

These findings indicate that benziothiazolinone is a promising agrochemical for the management of fire blight of pear.

Fire blight, a necrogenic disease caused by the bacteriumErwinia amylovora, poses a significant threat to apple and pear production, resulting in considerable annual economic losses. The disease was first documented in New York during the late 1780 s, with the pathogenE. amylovoraprimarily disseminated by insects, rainfall, and wind [1]. In 2016, fire blight was reported for the first time in Yili, Xinjiang, China [2]. Since its initial detection, the disease has spread extensively throughout most pear-producing regions in Xinjiang and parts of Gansu Province [2]. The impact of fire blight on the pear and apple industries in China has been substantial [2]. Notably, the outbreak in Korla, Xinjiang, in 2017 resulted in a production decline of approximately 30–50% in Korla City and led to the destruction of over 1 million pear trees [2]. Fortunately, collaborative efforts between government agencies and scientists have led to the development of effective management and governance strategies, which have successfully mitigated the spread of fire blight [2].

E. amylovoraemerges as ooze from overwintering cankers during the spring season. Research indicates thatE. amylovorais primarily transmitted through this ooze, with an average population size of 108CFU/µL per droplet [3]. The ooze is composed of pathogens embedded within a polysaccharide matrix, which attracts various insect species. Consequently, the bacteria can be transferred to flowers by these insects, leading to infection of the stigmas and the manifestation of blossom blight symptoms. The infection may subsequently spread to developing shoots and branches, ultimately resulting in the death of the entire tree. During the winter months, the bacteria persist in cankers and initiate a new cycle of invasion in the following spring [1,4]. Effective management of this destructive and increasingly prevalent disease, which impacts apple and pear trees, necessitates the suppression of the blossom-blight phase of fire blight [5]. A key strategy for controlling fire blight involves the judicious application of bactericides that specifically target the epiphytic growth ofE. amylovoraon flowers, in conjunction with the removal of infected tissues, shoots, and branches [6].

At present, many effective bactericides, including Bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol), Dioctyldiethylenetriamine (Xinjunan), copper compounds, and antibiotics, have been reported for the control of bacterial diseases [7–9]. These options provide greater possibilities for managing fire blight. Currently, extensive research has been conducted on effective strategies and methods for managing fire blight, including the application of antibiotics and copper-based bactericides [9,10]. Streptomycin, recognized as the most effective antibiotic, has been utilized for fire blight control in the United States since the 1950s. However, the emergence of streptomycin resistance (SmR) has been documented in numerous orchards across America, with the first report occurring in California in 1971 [11–15]. A study indicates that solar radiation and temperature have a detrimental effect on the antibacterial effectiveness of both kasugamycin and oxytetracycline [10]. Due to environmental contamination from chemicals and bactericides, as well as the development of resistance to bactericides, alternative strategies for managing bacterial pathogens are necessary. These years, the use of plant growth regulators, resistance inducers that can influence the host’s susceptibility to disease, and biological control agents specifically targeting pathogenic bacteria has evolved rapidly [16–18]. Nonetheless, the most efficient method for managing the disease is via chemical control measures [9]. Chemical bactericides not only minimize control expenses but also optimize plant productivity, thereby establishing their widespread adoption [19]. A comprehensive evaluation of control efficacy, safety, environmental impact, and effects on fruit reveals that only a limited number of effective bactericides are available for the management of fire blight [6]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop new, highly effective, and low-toxicity bactericides for the management of fire blight.

Benziothiazolinone (1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one) is a microbicide that has been independently developed in China. As a novel organic heterocyclic compound, it has demonstrated efficacy in disrupting the metabolic processes of pathogens, leading to physiological disorders in both bacterial and fungal cells [20]. This compound has been utilized as an industrial sterilization agent and preservative to safeguard various products, including curry, textiles, and cultural relics, across multiple countries. Furthermore, benziothiazolinone has been registered for use in the protection of crops such as cucumber, apple, grape, orange, pear, rice, and wheat from bacterial and fungal diseases, owing to its high efficacy, low toxicity, environmentally friendly characteristics, and safety for humans and animals [21]. Although the maximum residue level (MRL) of benziothiazolinone in crops remains undefined, China has established a temporary MRL of 0.05 mg/kg for apples and potatoes, and 1 mg/kg for rice (GB 2763 − 2018). Research conducted by Chai on the dissipation and residue levels of benziothiazolinone in apple samples from eight distinct regions in China indicated that, under conditions of good agricultural practices, the final residue levels of benziothiazolinone in apples were below 0.01 mg/kg [20]. This level is considered to pose an acceptable low health risk for daily consumption, particularly in light of the acute oral LD50 of benziothiazolinone, which is reported to be 1100 mg/kg [20].

The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of the novel bactericide benziothiazolinone in controlling fire blight disease in pear trees, as well as to investigate the impact of varying application timings and concentrations on its effectiveness.

The source information of the bacterial and fungal strains used in this research is listed in Supplementary Table1, the strains are stored in the college of plant protection and key laboratory of integrated management of crop diseases and pests, ministry of education, Nanjing Agricultural University. Stocks of 3% benziothiazolinone, 72% streptomycin sulfate, 99% benziothiazolinone, 2% kasugamycin, 20% zinc thiazole, 50% tetramethylthiuram disulfide, 80% mancozeb, and 75% chlorothalonil, were prepared at a concentration of 10,000 µg/mL. Moderate anhydrous ethanol (no more than 5% in the final culture broth) was used as cosolvent to dissolve the 99% benziothiazolinone, followed by adding sterile water to final volume. The other bactericides and fungicides used in this study are dissolved in sterile water. All solutions were prepared just before using.

We selected several registered bactericides for the control of fire blight [6,10,22,23], tested their inhibitory effects onE. amylovoraBZ16 in the laboratory, and compared their bactericidal efficacy with that of benziothiazolinone. The turbidity measurement method [24,25] was employed to evaluate thein vitrosensitivity ofE. amylovoraBZ16 to four antimicrobial agents benziothiazolinone, streptomycin sulfate, kasugamycin, and zinc thiazole. To facilitate this evaluation, stock solutions of the bactericides were respectively added into casitone-yeast extract (CYE) medium [26]. The final concentrations of the bactericides were meticulously adjusted to ensure that bacterial turbidity was uniformly distributed across a broad spectrum of bactericide concentrations. In the bacterial susceptibility assay, the bacteria were cultured in 5 mL of CYE medium containing varying concentrations of the bactericides, followed by incubation at 28°C. Bacterial growth was assessed by measuring the turbidity of the CYE medium and quantified using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer at the 10th and 16th hours post-incubation. Each bactericide was subjected to evaluation in two independent experiments, with three replicates for each concentration of the bactericide.

Furthermore, to assess the antimicrobial potential of benziothiazolinone, we evaluated its spectrum of activity against bacteria and fungi using established visualization techniques [24,25,27]. This section serves as a supplementary experiment, and the experimental results are available in the attached materials (Supplementary Table S2, S3).

The utilization of turbidity measurements [24,25] to quantify bacterial growth is a widely accepted methodology in the field of microbiology. Single colonies were cultivated in an appropriate liquid medium at a temperature of 28°C. A bacterial solution (5 µL, 1 × 108CFU/mL) was introduced into a tube containing 5 mL of suitable liquid medium, which was supplemented with specific concentrations of benziothiazolinone. A culture medium devoid of benziothiazolinone served as the negative control. The optical density (OD) of the bacterial solution was measured using spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 600 nm after a 14-hour incubation period. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated three times to ensure reliability of the results.

The inhibitory effects of benziothiazolinone, along with three control fungicides carbendazim, thiram, and chlorothalonil against 14 strains of pathogenic fungi were assessedin vitrousing the mycelial growth rate method, as previously described before [27]. Mycelial blocks measuring 7 mm were placed at the center of Petri dishes containing appropriate concentrations of the fungicides and incubated at 25°C. A medium devoid of fungicide served as a negative control. The colony diameter of the pathogenic fungi was measured using the cross method once the colony covered 75% of the agar surface. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated three times.

Benziothiazolinone-resistant mutant ofE. amylovorawas generated by exposing cultures of the bacterium to benziothiazolinone, using streptomycin as a reference. Specifically, the wild-type strain ofE. amylovorawas cultured in 25 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and incubated in a shaker at 28 °C with a rotation speed of 220 rpm until an optical density (OD600) of 1.0 was reached. The culture was subsequently spread onto LB agar plates containing 10 µg/mL of benziothiazolinone to screen for resistant colonies. Individual colonies were selected and transferred to new LB plates containing 10 µg/mL of benziothiazolinone, with subsequent transfers to plates containing gradually increasing concentrations of benziothiazolinone. Resistant colonies were then transferred to LB plates devoid of benziothiazolinone and cultured through ten successive generations to obtain the 10th generation. The effective concentration (EC50) of benziothiazolinone against the first and tenth-generation resistant strains was determined to assess the stability of their resistance. The experiment was conducted twice, with three replicates for each strain.

BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmRwere cultured in LB medium to OD600value of 1.0 was reached. Subsequently, 10 µL of the bacterial suspension was inoculated into sterile microplates containing 200 µL of LB medium. The microplates were then incubated in a Bioscreen PRO at 28 °C with shaking at 570 rpm for a duration of 44 h. The OD600was measured at 4-hour intervals, with the OD600value serving as an indicator of bacterial growth.

Amylovoran production by strains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmRwas quantified utilizing the cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)-binding turbidimetric assay, as previously described [28]. Strain BZ16SmRserved as a control in this assay. Overnight cultures were cultivated in LB medium at 28 °C, subsequently normalized to an optical density at 600 nm, and then sequentially cultured in MBMA (3 g KH2PO4, 7 g K2HPO4, 1 g (NH4)2SO4, 2 mL glycerol, 0.5 g citric acid, 0.03 g MgSO4, 1% sorbitol) for a duration of 24 h following washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The concentration of amylovoran in the culture supernatants was assessed using CPC at a concentration of 50 mg/mL, with an incubation period of 10 min. The OD600of the CPC-bound suspension was normalized against the OD600of the corresponding culture. This experiment was conducted in triplicate, with three technical replicates for each experiment.

Pear flowers were collected from pear trees (Pyrus sinkiangensisYü) transplanted into orchard in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, China. The experimental design for the detached flowers was conducted as previously described [29]. Pear branches bearing flowers were cut and placed in a laboratory environment maintained at temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 23 °C, with the basal ends immersed in water. The flowers began to blossom within 1 to 2 days. Intact flowers, complete with their stalks, were subsequently removed from the branches and placed in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes containing sterile 10% sucrose. A bacterial suspension ofE. amylovorastrains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmR, each with a cell density of 108CFU/mL, was inoculated onto the stigmas, while sterile distilled water served as a negative control. The inoculated flowers were then placed in sealable trays lined with moistened paper towels to maintain a relative humidity of 90%. The trays were incubated in a dark chamber at 16°C. At 72 h post-inoculation, the flowers were harvested, and the populations ofE. amylovorastrains BZ16 and BZ16BITRwere quantified using dilution plating methods. Five flowers were harvested for each treatment, and the pistils were collected into sterile tubes containing 1 mL of 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline, followed by grinding with a grinding rod. A 100 µL serial dilution of the ground tissue was spread onto LB medium and incubated at 28 °C for 3 days. The experiment was conducted twice, with three replicates for each treatment.

In this experiment, young pear shoots (Pyrus sinkiangensisYü) measuring 15 cm in length from potted one-year-old plants were utilized. The virulence on these young shoots was assessed using a standard assay for internal bacterial movement, as described by Momol et al. [30], with moderate modifications. The tips of the young shoots were inoculated using a 0.46-mm-diameter (26 gauge) hypodermic needle, inserted through the stem just above the youngest unfolded leaf. A volume of 20 µL of bacterial suspension, with a cell density of 108CFU/mL was introduced into each young shoot, ensuring that no significant inoculum remained outside the wound. Sterile distilled water served as a negative control. The inoculated young shoots were then incubated in a humidified chamber at 28 °C, maintaining a relative humidity of 90%. The length of the necrotic lesions on each shoot was measured 20 days post-inoculation. The experiment was repeated twice, three shoots in each replication were conducted per treatment.

The virulence ofE. amylovorastrains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmRwas evaluated using immature pears (Pyrus sinkiangensisYü). In brief, the pears were surface-sterilized and subsequently pricked with a sterile pipette tip. A 2 µL aliquot of bacterial suspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 104CFU/mL was inoculated into the stab-wounded pears, which were then incubated in a humidified chamber at 28°C. The pears were assessed for necrotic symptoms at 5 and 8 days post-inoculation (dpi). The experiment was repeated twice with three pears in each replicate per treatment.

To assess the efficacy of benziothiazolinone on the natural occurrence of fire blight, field trials were conducted in Xinjiang Province, China, during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons.

Field evaluation for fire blight control in Xiaduoga Village (31°38' 29"N and 90°34' 42"E) was conducted using 15-year-old pear trees (Pyrus sinkiangensisYü). The terrain was flat, featuring well-established irrigation and drainage systems, with a soil pH of 6.8. Field cultivation conditions, including soil type, fertilization regime, and irrigation, were uniform across the experimental site. The experimental orchard covered an area of 5.2 hectares with a plant spacing of 3 × 5 m and a history of annual fire blight occurrences. The experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two treatments. Trees within 2.6 hectares were treated with a 1000-fold dilution of 3% benziothiazolinone at a dosage of 3000 g/ha. Additionally, another 2.6 hectares of trees were sprayed with water as a blank control. In this experiment, application of the benziothiazolinone solution was performed using a backpack sprayer on tagged pear trees at the following timings: after the garden was cleared in spring (in mid-March), during early flowering (at the beginning of April), at petal fall (in mid to late April), and at the young fruit stage (in mid-May). Blossom blight symptoms were evaluated 10 days after spraying during the petal fall phase, while shoot blight symptoms were assessed 20 days after spraying during the same phase. A total of 100 replicate trees were surveyed for each treatment, with 250 branches and 250 flower clusters randomly investigated per tree. Blossom clusters were rated as diseased if at least one flower exhibited symptoms of fire blight, while current-growth shoots exhibiting discoloration or oozing were categorized as exhibiting shoot blight. The incidence of blossom blight and shoot blight was quantified by counting the number of blighted flower clusters and young shoots on each tree. Blighted clusters and shoots were removed immediately after counting.

Data collected from the experiments were evaluated using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), DPS 7.05 software (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China) and GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Apvalue of 0.05 was used to determine significance and compared using the Duncan’s multiple range test.

In vitroexperiments were conducted to compare the antibacterial effects of benziothiazolinone, streptomycin, kasugamycin, and zinc thiazole (Table1). Streptomycin demonstrated the highest efficacy againstE. amylovoraBZ16, exhibiting EC50values of 0.01 and 0.02 µg/mL at the 10th and 16th hours, respectively. Benziothiazolinone inhibited the growth ofE. amylovoraBZ16 with EC50values of 0.48 µg/mL at the 10th hour and 0.67 µg/mL at the 16th hour. Kasugamycin exhibited EC50values of 6.18 µg/mL and 6.27 µg/mL at the 10th and 16th hours, respectively. Underin vitroconditions, zinc thiazole displayed the least activity againstE. amylovoraBZ16, with EC50values of 270.53 µg/mL at the 10th hour and 632.29 µg/mL at the 16th hour.

Besides, benziothiazolinone demonstrated a broad spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal activity (Supplementary Table S2, S3). We investigated the bacteriostatic effect of benziothiazolinone on 19 bacterial strains in liquid cultures, utilizing streptomycin as a control. Benziothiazolinone could inhibit the 19 plant pathogenic bacteria with EC50values ranging from 0.03 to 2.35 µg/mL. Among the tested strains,Xanthomonas oryzaepv.oryzaePXO99 exhibited the highest sensitivity to benziothiazolinone, with an EC50value of 0.03 µg/mL. This was followed byAgrobacterium tumefaciens,Ralstonia solanacearumRS-SC2,Acidovorax citrullixjl12,Erwinia pyrifoliaeL2,Dickeya fangzhongdaiJS-5,Clavibacter michiganensissubsp.michiganensis,Pectobacterium carotovorumsubsp.brasiliense,Pseudomonas syringaepv.tomatoDC3000, andPseudomonas syringaepv.lachrymans, which exhibited EC50values of 0.15, 0.19, 0.20, 0.23, 0.45, 0.511, 0.78, 1.00, and 1.22 µg/mL, respectively. Additionally,Pantoea stewartiisubsp.indologenusDCSS1 displayed notable sensitivity to benziothiazolinone, with an EC50value of 1.95 µg/mL.

In this experiment, we assessed the inhibitory effect of benziothiazolonone on eight strains ofErwinia amylovora, which were isolated from various regions of Xinjiang province. The results indicated that the concentration required to achieve a 50% inhibition rate ofErwinia amylovoraby benziothiazolonone ranged from 2.13 to 2.35 µg/mL. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the eightE. amylovorastrains to streptomycin was found to be between 2.01 and 2.31 µg/mL. Streptomycin demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on thein vitrogrowth of the other 11 bacterial strains, with EC50values ranging from 0.0206 to 28.9407 µg/mL.

The antifungal efficacy of benziothiazolinone against 14 pathogenic fungal strains was evaluated using the mycelial growth rate method. Mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and thiram were employed as controls in this study. Benziothiazolinone demonstrated a broad spectrum of antifungal activity, with EC50values ranging from 1.31 to 76.11 µg/mL. Notably,Diaporthe phaseolorumexhibited the highest sensitivity among the tested fungi, with an EC50value of 1.31 µg/mL. Other fungi, includingDidymella bryoniae,Phomopsis amygdaliYH-13,Phytophthora sojae,Alternaria alternata,Verticillium dahliae,Rhizoctonia solani,Botryosphaeria dothideasy-8, andPseudopestalotiopsis theae, also displayed significant sensitivity to benziothiazolinone, with EC50values of 2.92, 3.14, 3.50, 4.18, 4.90, 5.14, 5.29, and 9.73 µg/mL, respectively. In contrast,Fusarium oxysporumf.sp.niveum,Fusarium oxysporumf.sp.melonis,Phytophthora fragariae,Colletotrichum lagenarium, andColletotrichum viniferumA-3 exhibited higher EC50values of 10.99, 12.91, 15.11, 43.86, and 76.11 µg/mL, respectively. The EC50values of thiram against the 14 pathogenic fungal strains ranged from 0.29 to 61.73 µg/mL, which were comparable to those of benziothiazolinone. Conversely, the EC50values for mancozeb against the pathogenic fungal strains were generally higher, ranging from 2.58 to 514.17 µg/mL. The EC50values for chlorothalonil against the 14 pathogenic fungal strains varied from 0.21 to 758.93 µg/mL. Notably, all four fungicides exhibited reduced inhibitory efficacy againstColletotrichumspp. compared to other genera.

The EC50values of benziothiazilinone for the wild-type strain BZ16, the first-generation resistant strain BZ16BITR, and the tenth-generation resistant strain BZ16BITR−10 at the 10-hour mark were 2.47, 1.29, and 1.57 µg/mL, respectively. At the 16-hour mark, the EC50values were 2.30, 1.50, and 1.70 µg/mL, respectively. The resistance factor (RF) values for benziothiazilinone in strains BZ16BITRand BZ16BITR−10 were 0.52 and 0.63 at the 10-hour mark, and 0.65 and 0.74 at the 16-hour mark (Table2). The EC50values of streptomycin for strain BZ16, the first-generation resistant strain BZ16SmR, and the tenth-generation resistant strain BZ16SmR−10 were 0.04, 4.66, and 1.00 µg/mL, respectively, at the 10-hour mark, and 0.05, 11.25, and 1.92 µg/mL, respectively, at the 16-hour mark. The RF values for streptomycin sulfate in strains BZ16SmRand BZ16SmR−10 were 126.02 and 27.08 at the 10-hour mark, and 236.38 and 40.24 at the 16-hour mark.

The growth curves of strains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmRcultured in LB medium are presented in Fig.1A. The area under the growth curve (AUC) was utilized to assess the growth capabilities of these strains, as illustrated in Fig.1B. Notably, BZ16BITRentered the logarithmic growth phase concurrently with BZ16 after 4 h, whereas BZ16SmRcommenced growth only at the 40th hour.

To investigate the potential contribution of BZ16BITR, which exhibits heightened sensitivity to benziothiazolinone through a chemical taming method, to the production of amylovoran, the strains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmRwere cultivated in MAMB medium. The levels of amylovoran production were subsequently quantified. As illustrated in Fig.2, a significant increase in amylovoran levels was observed in both BZ16BITRand BZ16SmR. The OD600value serves as an indicator of the amount of secreted amylovoran, was found to be 1.7-fold and 1.5-fold higher in BZ16BITRand BZ16SmR, respectively, compared to BZ16.

To elucidate the colonization capabilities ofE. amylovorastrains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmR, we investigated the population sizes of these derivatives following inoculation onto the stigmas of detached pear flowers. Each flower was initially inoculated with a bacterial population of approximately 106CFU. After 72 h of incubation, the population ofE. amylovoraBZ16 increased to 6.6 × 108CFU per flower. In contrast, the growth ofE. amylovoraBZ16BITRand BZ16SmRon the stigmas of detached pear flowers was significantly lower, with populations recorded at 6.8 × 107CFU per flower and 3.4 × 107CFU per flower, respectively (Fig.3A).

E. amylovorastrains BZ16, BZ16BITR, and BZ16SmRwere individually inoculated into young pear shoots through the method of shoot tip wounding. The strainsE. amylovoraBZ16BITRand BZ16SmRexhibited reduced virulence compared toE. amylovoraBZ16, as evidenced by a significantly lower growth of lesions on the young shoots (Fig.3B).

Immature pears inoculated with 104CFU/mL bacterial suspension ofE. amylovoraBZ16, displayed classical fire blight symptoms of necrosis and water soaking after 5 and 8 days. At 5 days post-inoculation in pear fruitlets, BZ16BITRand BZ16SmRgrew slowly and caused similar disease phenotype as the mock inoculations, whereas no phenotype was observed. Immature pears inoculated with BZ16BITRexhibited smaller lesion sizes 8 days post infection as compared to that of BZ16. No measurably lesion was observed in BZ16SmRover the 8 days. Symptom and quantity of bacteria in pears were significantly delayed and reduced compared to the wild type (Fig.3C and D).

Immature pears inoculated with a bacterial suspension ofE. amylovoraBZ16 at a concentration of 104CFU/mL exhibited classical symptoms of fire blight, including necrosis and water soaking, after 5 and 8 days. At 5 days post-inoculation, pear fruitlets inoculated with BZ16BITRand BZ16SmRdemonstrated slow growth and exhibited a disease phenotype similar to that of the mock inoculations, with no observable phenotype. In contrast, immature pears inoculated with BZ16BITRdisplayed smaller lesion sizes 8 days post-infection compared to those infected with BZ16. No measurable lesions were observed in the BZ16SmRtreatment over the 8-day period. The symptoms and bacterial quantities in the pears were significantly delayed and reduced in comparison to the wild type (Fig.3C and D).

Over the course of two years, all pear trees treated with benziothiazolinone exhibited a significant reduction in disease incidence compared to the control group, which was sprayed with water. A field experiment conducted in Xiaduoga Village evaluated the effectiveness of benziothiazolinone for managing fire blight on pear trees from 2019 to 2020 (Table3). In 2019, the incidence of blossom blight was 0.2% in the water-treated group, while benziothiazolinone significantly reduced the incidence to 0.1%. Similar trends were observed for the incidence of shoot blight, which was also reduced to 0.1% compared to the 0.2% incidence in the water-treated controls. Furthermore, no phytotoxicity was observed on the pear trees. In 2020, benziothiazolinone effectively controlled fire blight in pear orchards, the pear trees treated with benziothiazolinone showed no occurrence of blossom blight or shoot blight, while the water-treated group exhibited mild occurrences of both blossom blight and shoot blight at 0.1%.

An analysis of variance demonstrated the significant efficacy of benziothiazolinone in controlling shoot blight during both 2019 and 2020 in the orchard of Harayugong Village (Table4). As anticipated, the cankers on both the branches and trunks of pear trees were effectively suppressed by benziothiazolinone. In 2019, the application of benziothiazolinone at doses of 3000 g/ha and 2505 g/ha in the field resulted in control efficacies of 85.6% and 82.0% against fire blight, respectively. In comparison, streptomycin sulfate applied at a dose of 750 g/ha demonstrated a control efficacy of 76.4%. In 2020, the disparity in disease incidence between pear trees treated with bactericides and the control group became increasingly evident. The application of benziothiazolinone at doses of 3000 g/ha and 2505 g/ha in the field resulted in control efficacies of 94.6% and 85.7%, respectively, while the application of 750 g/ha of streptomycin sulfate yielded a control efficacy of 73.1%. Analysis using Duncan’s new multiple range test indicates that benziothiazolinone is more effective in controlling fire blight compared to streptomycin sulfate.

For an extended period, streptomycin has been regarded as the most effective antibiotic for managing fire blight during the blooming period [22,32]. However, there is growing awareness of the potential for antibiotic resistance gene transfer due to the emergence of SmR in various regions across the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Israel, and Lebanon [1,22,32]. It has been reported that three antibiotic alternatives to streptomycin -oxytetracycline, kasugamycin, and oxolinic acid- have been developed for managing the blossom blight phase of fire blight [33]. Studies indicate that both oxytetracycline and kasugamycin are susceptible to degradation due to solar radiation and temperature [10]. Neither streptomycin nor oxytetracycline effectively controlledE. amylovorapopulations on flowers for more than five days, nor did they exhibit the same curative effects as streptomycin [10,33]. Furthermore, oxytetracycline has been reported to have reduced efficacy in controlling blossom blight [33]. Additionally, oxolinic acid has not been commercially developed in any countries other than Israel [34]. Moreover, the ongoing agricultural use of copper compounds has raised concerns about their long-term efficacy and sustainability [35]. Consequently, the use of copper-based compounds in agriculture is highly restricted within the European Union [36].

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the importance of environmental health and social sustainability. The management of blossom blight through the application of biological control methods has undergone significant advancements over the past three decades [16]. Johnson et al. integrated various materials, includingAureobasidium pullulans, soluble copper, and Bacillus-based biorationals, at different intervals to control fire blight [37]. They revealed a strategy for material sequencing that could balance the effectiveness of control with the risk of reduced crop value due to fruit russeting. This is effective against fire blight but incurs higher costs. Bacteriophages (phages) have the ability to selectively identify cell surface receptors on their bacterial hosts, facilitating infection and subsequent lysis of the pathogens after replication within the host cell [38]. Numerous phages have been recognized as potent agents in the fight against fire blight [39]. In South Korea, a new method of using phages in combination with kasugamycin was used to control the invasive fire blight [40]. Lee et al. provide new insights into the development of control strategies for fire blight. They found that microbiota in apple flowers could compete for nutrient niches withE. amylovora.Pantoea agglomeransdemonstrated greater competitiveness for arabinogalactan thanE. amylovoraand was able to suppress the expression of virulence factors inE. amylovora[41]. As standalone treatments, effective non-antibiotic materials, such as yeast biocontrol agents, can increase the risk of phytotoxic responses [37]. In contrast, materials that are known to have a lower risk of russeting, such as Bacillus-based biorationals, are less effective in controlling fire blight [37]. Additionally, integrated materials tend to be more expensive [37]. In the present study, we demonstrate that a novel antimicrobial agent, benziothiazolinone, exhibits significant efficacy in controlling fire blight disease.

The stigma surface of flowers serves as the primary site for the epiphytic proliferation ofE. amylovora[1]. Additionally,E. amylovorahas the capacity to infect various plant organs, including fruits, woody tissues, and rootstocks [42]. As previously mentioned, insects typically facilitate the transmission of pathogens during pollination in the warm and humid conditions of spring. Furthermore, the bacteria can be disseminated from infected tissues to healthy plants via wind, rain, and unsterilized agricultural tools [43]. It has been reported that the application of bactericides during the blooming period is an effective strategy for managing fire blight and is widely implemented in the United States [42,44]. In the United States, in addition to streptomycin, other antibiotics such as oxytetracycline and kasugamycin are registered for the management of fire blight during the critical infection periods of early blooming and post-flowering stages [45]. In this study, we assessed the inhibitory effects of several bactericides onE. amylovoraBZ16 and compared their EC50values. The bactericides used, including streptomycin and kasugamycin (aminoglycoside antibiotics) as well as zinc thiazole (an organic zinc thiazole antibiotic), have all been registered for the control of fire blight [6,10,23]. In addition, considering the presence of numerous other pathogenic bacteria and fungi in practical applications, we measured the antibacterial spectrum of benziothiazolinone. The results indicated that benziothiazolinone exhibits broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and can effectively inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria, fungi, and oomycete.

The prolonged overuse of bactericides and fungicides has been shown to contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a phenomenon that is increasingly prevalent in humans, animal husbandry, industrial applications, and agricultural practices. AMR poses a significant global challenge, largely attributed to the misuse and overapplication of these antimicrobial agents [46]. The mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance are diverse; they may arise from the absence or presence of specific bacterial structures. Furthermore, the extensive and inappropriate use of antimicrobials can facilitate the acquisition of resistance in bacteria through mutations or horizontal gene transfer involving chromosomes or plasmids [47,48]. Research indicates that resistance genes can be vertically transmitted between bacterial strains, complicating control efforts and adversely impacting ecological systems and agricultural development [49,50].

Streptomycin was first introduced as a control measure for fire blight in 1955 and has been recognized as the most effective antibiotic for this purpose. However, the first strain ofE. amylovoraresistant to streptomycin was identified in California in 1971, and such strains have since been reported globally [45]. Consequently, the European Union and Brazil have removed streptomycin from their crop protection recommendations due to the risk of rapidly developing resistant strains ofE. amylovora[43]. Kasugamycin was originally employed as a fungicide for the prevention ofPyricularia oryzae, and was subsequently developed as a bactericide to manage fire blight in the 1980 s [12]. In their study, McGhee and Sundin [12] sequenced and identified samples from flowers, leaves, and soil collected from apple orchards treated with Kasumin, resulting in the isolation of sixE. amylovorastrains, all of which demonstrated sensitivity to kasugamycin. However, their research also indicated that exposure to increasing concentrations of kasugamycin in the media significantly elevated the risk of spontaneous resistance development. The spontaneous kasugamycin-resistant (KsR) mutants exhibited reduced fitness, including diminished virulence in immature pears. Nevertheless, chemical control remains the most effective method for managing fire blight [42].

In our current study, we assessed the risk of resistance inE. amylovoraBZ16 to benziothiazolinone and found thatE. amylovoraBZ16 was unable to develop resistance to benziothiazolinone through chemical taming. Conversely,E. amylovoraBZ16 did develop resistance to streptomycin under the same inducing conditions. Furthermore, the BZ16BITRstrain displayed decreased virulence on detached pear flowers, immature pears, and young shoots, despite producing higher levels of amylovoran.

Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of benziothiazolinone in managing fire blight disease. In the orchard of Xiaduoga Village, a dosage of 3000 g/ha of benziothiazolinone significantly reduced the incidence of blossom blight and shoot blight. In 2020, there was no occurrence of fire blight in the treatment group that sprayed benziothiazolinone. In the orchard of Harayugong Village, benziothiazolinone and streptomycin were diluted and applied to the pear trees. In these field experiments, benziothiazolinone was applied at dosages of 3000 g/ha and 2505 g/ha, both of which resulted in a control efficacy exceeding 80%. Our trial results indicated that benziothiazolinone was significantly more effective than streptomycin in reducing the severity of fire blight under field conditions. Furthermore, no adverse effects were observed on pear flowers, fruits, or leaves during the application of benziothiazolinone. Given its cost-effectiveness, a dosage of 2505 g/ha of benziothiazolinone can be effectively utilized.

Despite this, the long-term efficacy of benziothiazolinone in controlling fire blight is contingent upon the potential development of bacterial resistance within orchards. Consequently, to mitigate the emergence and impact of bacterial resistance in the field, it is essential to utilize an appropriate concentration of benziothiazolinone in conjunction with a diverse array of bactericides. This approach is critical in reducing the likelihood of resistance development.

In summary, our findings demonstrate that benziothiazolinone exhibits high efficacy in inhibitingE. amylovorain laboratory settings and in managing fire blight in orchards. Additionally, benziothiazolinone serves as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, effectively inhibiting the growth of various pathogens examined in this study. Furthermore, exposure to increasing concentrations of benziothiazolinone in LB medium did not result in the emergence of spontaneous resistance mutants. Collectively, these results suggest that benziothiazolinone represents a viable alternative antimicrobial agent for the management of fire blight in orchards. Moreover, this study offers guidance regarding the appropriate application concentrations for controlling fire blight in field conditions.
