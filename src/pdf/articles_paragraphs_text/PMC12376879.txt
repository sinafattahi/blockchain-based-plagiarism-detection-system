The sodium hydrogen orthophosphate (Na2HPO4) base was utilized in a stereospecific C–N coupling reaction to synthesize a novel series of nevirapine analogues in two-step reactions. This base is moisture tolerant, commercially available and makes the protocol cheap and energy efficient, with broad substrate tolerance, leading to the formation of cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and propane-engrafted dipyridodiazepinone derivatives in good yield with a higher atom economy >70%. All the synthesized analogues were examined for reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity and compared with the reference drug nevirapine. Furtherin silicoanalysisviamolecular docking, molecular simulation, and ADMET studies revealed that compounds 5a and 5b showed prominent inhibitory activity against reverse transcriptase. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between nevirapine analogues and human serum albumin. The binding affinity of 5b in the order of 102indicates that the synthesized analogues can be easily carried out into the bloodstream. These findings demonstrate that nevirapine analogous are promising reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the therapeutic treatment of HIV infection, offering a new avenue for the less toxic and more effective development of anti-retroviral drugs.

The sodium hydrogen orthophosphate base-mediated C–N coupling reaction was described for the synthesis of a novel series of dipyridodiazepinone derivatives as reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Seven-membered nitrogen-containing diazepine framework is a core heterocyclic skeleton in various bioactive agents, including compounds with antidepressant, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antitumor activities.1–4Many reports have revealed that benzodiazepine and pyridodiazepine in zapizolam, clozapine and olanzapine possess good anti-anxiety, anticonvulsant, sleep-inducing and muscle relaxant properties, while the dipyridodiazepinone skeleton in nevirapine plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme (Fig. 1).5,6This enzyme is responsible for converting RNA into DNA and promoting the replication of retroviruses in host cells.7Most importantly, diazepine motifs have received increasing interest in clinical practice and drug discovery. Hence, new strategies for constructing dipyridodiazepinone scaffolds have received considerable attention, and this skeleton is suitable for the design and development of more effective compounds for the treatment of HIV infections and related issues.

In recent years, the C–N coupling reaction has been very powerful for the construction of complex molecules from simple synthons.8–10Among coupling reactions, the Buchwald–Hartwig cross coupling reaction has attracted great attention for intermolecular and intramolecular coupling, resulting in the formation of a cyclic ring,i.e. a seven-membered diazepine ring. Previously, this reaction was assisted by caesium carbonate and a metal catalyst, mainly palladium catalysts, with additional ancillary ligands. Currently, metal-free and highly atom-economical methods are being explored worldwide for the synthesis of nitrogen heterocyclesviacoupling reactions.

The principal objective of the present study is the cost-effective synthesis of novel dipyridodiazepinones, which are analogues of nevirapine. The present study reports the design of dipyridodiazepinone analogues using pharmacophore modelling and synthesizes themviabase-promoted C–N coupling and cyclocondensation reactions (Fig. 2).

The synthesized analogues were examined for an inhibitory effect against the HIV-1 RT enzyme. Furthermore, a spectrum of computational studies including MD simulation, ADMET/pharmacokinetics analysis, physicochemical analysis,in silicodrug likeness, and molecular docking were performed. Additionally, the thermodynamic parameter of the binding interaction of synthesized compounds with human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. It is imperative to achieve the thermodynamic and binding parameters of the synthesized analogues to the macromolecules. Understanding thermodynamics and binding parameters is crucial for physicochemical mechanisms, such as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the synthesized dipyridodiazepinone.11Serum albumins are the most abundant protein in blood plasma responsible for the transportation of drugs in the circulatory system. The physiological role of the serum protein is to transport numerous ligands, such as amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, drugs, and metal ions, in the bloodstream to the targeted organs. In the circulatory system, serum albumin plays a major role in binding synthesized compounds or drugs and further transporting them to the target site. Thus, the binding of synthesized compounds to serum albumin is a pharmacokinetic criterion. The availability of the free drug is inversely proportional to the binding constant of serum albumin to the ligand. It means that when the binding is stronger, the availability of free drug is lower in the blood. Similarly, if the binding is weaker, the amount of free drug in the circulation is greater.12To understand the pharmacokinetic and ADMET mechanisms, knowledge of the binding interaction between the drug and protein is important. From this perspective, particular attention has been given to HSA, the most important plasma protein and the main carrier for transporting metabolites and drugs into the bloodstream.

The computer-aided drug design process, such as structure-based pharmacophore modeling, is useful for identifying possible lead compounds that inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. Discovery Studio 2.0 is used to develop a six-feature pharmacophore model consisting of two hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), two hydrophobic features (HY), and two hydrogen bond donors (HBD), as shown inFig. 3. Feature mapping of the synthesized compounds 5(a–h) on the developed HIV RT enzyme's structure-based pharmacophore and observed that 5a and 5b showed four feature mappings with 2.42008 and 2.59238 fit values. The PharmPrint of the synthesized analogues is shown in SI Table S1.

The exploration of the concept of the C–N coupling reaction in the synthesis of new nevirapine analogues is formulated inScheme 1. The synthesis of carboxamide 3(a–b) was achieved by the intermolecular C–N coupling reaction of 1(a–b) with 2-chloronicotinyol chloride 2 in the presence of base sodium hydrogen orthophosphate (Na2HPO4). The formation of compounds 3(a–b) was established by their1H NMR spectra, which showed a sharp singlet atδ8.8 ppm for one proton attached to nitrogen.

Compound 3(a–b) underwent an intermolecular coupling on its treatment with cyclopropylamine, cyclobutylamine, cyclopentylamine and propylamine in Na2HPO4; then, intramolecular coupling resulted in cyclization to form 1,4-dipyridiodiazepinone 5(a–h) (Scheme 2). The1H-NMR,13C-NMR, and mass spectral analysis were used to confirm the structures and purity of the synthesized nevirapine analogues. The result of the HSQC NMR experiment confirms the assignment of the NH signal at 8.87 ppm, as it shows no direct correlation to any carbon signal, consistent with the presence of a non-carbon-bound proton. This observation validates the presence of an NH group in the structure of compound 3a. Compared to starting material 2-chloro-3-aminopyridine 1(a–b), the most relevant variation in the NMR spectra arises owing to the amide and amine coupling. The spectra of nevirapine analogues were in accordance with the structure of synthesized analogues shown in SI S1–S42.

Initially, 3-amino-2-chloro-5-methyl pyridine 1a and 2-chloronicotinyol chloride 2 were selected as the model substrates to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 1). This reaction was carried out in potassium carbonate K2CO3and 1,4-dioxane at 60 °C for 6 h, and only a 20% yield was obtained. The change in solvent from 1,4-dioxane to THF results in an increase in yield from 20% to 40% (entry 2). Next, the caesium carbonate base is tested with solvent 1,4-dioxane; again, a decrease in the yield of the product was observed (entry 3). The same base tested with solvent THF showed an increase in yield (entry 4). We hypothesized that a change in the solvent system would affect the yield of the reaction owing to the solubility of the starting reactant and ion pairing. Further, to increase the yield from 50%, the solvent effect was further explored using a mixture of THF–H2O (entry 5). Encouraged by the result, Na2HPO4base utilized in THF–H2O (5 : 2) solvent showed the best conversion with a maximum yield of 91% (entry 6). In further exploration, an increase in the ratio of water provided 80% and 75% yields of 3a (entry 7–8). Finally, a reaction was performed on triethylamine, and a trace yield of the product was achieved (entry 9). The amide bond difference in products 3a and 3a′ was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, as evidenced by distinct variations in the carbonyl stretching frequencies of 1650 cm−1and 1725.04 cm−1, respectively, as shown in SI S2 and S3. The spot of the TLC plate indicates a favorable C–N coupling reaction between the amine of compound 1a and the carbonyl chloride of compound 2 in base Na2HPO4to form 3a in good yield.

Reaction conditions: 1a (0.0187 mmol), 2 (0.0187 mmol), Na2HPO4(0.02 mmol), 6 h, and temperature 60 °C in sealed tube.

Under the best optimized conditions (Table 1, entry 6), the substrate scope of various cyclic and acyclic amines, such as cyclopropyl amine, cyclobutyl amine, cyclopentyl amine and propyl amine, was investigated in C–N coupling reaction and cyclization (Scheme 2). It is noteworthy that the size of the ring influences the yield of the product. The smaller cyclopropylamine has a higher yield than cyclopentyl amine due to exhibiting steric hindrance in C–N cross coupling reactions. A good to high yield was obtained, where R is substituted with a methyl or hydrogen group. Noteworthy, 5a and 5b were obtained in higher yields, followed by substituents with cyclobutyl amine (5c–5d), cyclopentyl amine (5e–5f) and propyl amine (5g–5h). The larger substituents might cause steric hindrances, which further prevent intermolecular cyclocondensation from forming the diazepine ring.

Further series of control experiments were conducted to gain insight into this reaction, as outlined inScheme 1. The initial radical inhibition experiment was performed using TEMPO. The result showed that a product yield 77% was obtained and the reaction was not inhibited, which clearly stated that the radical mechanism was not involved (Scheme 3a). According to previous reports, we hypothesized that the reaction involves amidation, amination and cyclocondensation reaction.13For further investigation, we synthesized intermediates 3A and 3B at 60 °C, giving 85% and 91% yields inScheme 3b and c, respectively. Both intermediates under standard conditions produced 5a in 50% and 88%, respectively. These outcomes suggest that the formed intermediate might be responsible for accelerating the reaction. The mechanism is proposed based on the control experiment results, as outlined in SI Scheme S1. Further sustainability of the reaction pathway was examined by evaluating the atom economy. The synthesized compounds have an atom economy greater than 70%, indicating that the process is sustainable with minimum waste generation. The atom economy of the synthesized compounds is in the following order: 5a (71%), 5b (70%), 5c (72%), 5d (71%), 5e (73%), 5f (72%), 5g (71%), and 5h (70%).

The synthesized dipyridodiazepinone analogue 5(a–h) was screenedin vitrofor reverse transcriptase inhibitory effect using the HIV-1 RT ELISA kit. Among all, analogue 5b (IC50= 0.86 nM) was the most potent, followed by 5a (IC50= 1.07 nM), when compared with standard nevirapine (IC50= 3.05 nM). The results of the HIV-1 RT assay for all synthesized analogues are shown inFig. 4. The activity data indicate that cyclopropyl substituents in 5a and 5b showed prominent inhibitory activity compared to cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and alkyl substituted dipyridodiazepinone derivatives.

A molecular docking study is a crucial tool for evaluating the interaction between the target protein and drug. In this currentin silicostudy, dipyridodiazepinone analogues (5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g and 5h) were docked against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using the Auto-Dock Vina module. The docking scores of all synthesized compounds are shown inTable 2. The binding site of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is surrounded by the 10 amino acid residuesviz.Lys101, Lys103, Val179, Val106, Leu100, Tyr318, Tyr188, Tyr181, Pro95 and Trp229. We found that among all synthesized compounds, nevirapine analogues 5a and 5b had higher binding energies of −9.5 kcal mol−1and −9.8 kcal mol−1when compared to nevirapine −9.2 kcal mol−1, as shown inTable 2. This prompted the initiative to visualize their binding pose and interaction patterns with the target proteins relative to the reference drug (nevirapine) using PyMol and Discovery Studio Visualizer. The analogues were observed to fit into the same cavity of the binding sites. Interestingly, in 5a, the amino group of the diazepin-6-one ring was involved in the one hydrogen bond formation within the binding cavities of macromolecules, such as Lys101 at a bond length of 2.10 Å. A pi–sigma bond with 3.82 Å was observed between the diazepin-6-one ring and Leu100 amino acid residues, while 5a compound was also involved in the formation of alkyl and pi–alkyl bond interactions with the Val106 (3.89, 4.68 Å), Leu234 (4.65 Å), Tyr188 (4.66 Å), Tyr181 (5.27 Å), Val179 (4.23 Å), and Lys103 (5.20 Å) amino acid residues of the macromolecules. In the 5b compound, the diazepin-6-one ring was involved in hydrogen bond formation with Lys101 amino acid residues at a 2.05 Å bond length. Similarly, the diazepin-6-one ring was involved in the formation of a pi–sigma bond with the Leu100 (4.54 Å) amino acid residue of the macromolecule, while the 5b compound was also involved in the formation of alkyl and pi–alkyl bond interactions with the Lys103 (5.29 Å), Tyr181 (4.83 Å), Val106 (3.86, 4.90 Å), Leu234 (4.51 Å), and Tyr188 (4.83 Å). The reference drug, nevirapine, used in this study showed a comparable binding energy of −9.2 kcal mol−1. The amide group of the diazepinone ring was able to form one hydrogen bond with Lys 101 at a distance of 2.54 Å. Meanwhile, Leu 103 established a carbon–hydrogen bond at a distance of 4.60 Å. Tyr188 (4.51 Å), Val 106 (5.49, 4.36 A), Tyr 318 (4.59 A), Tyr 188 (4.51 A), Tyr 181 (5.24 A), Val 179 (5.04 A), and Leu 100 (4.60, 3.93, 3.74 A) were associated with the reference drugviaalkyl and pi–alkyl bonds, as shown inFig. 5. The binding interactions of 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g and 5h are shown in SI (Fig. S1–S6). The results from molecular docking suggest that amino acids, such as leucine, valine, and tyrosine, are vital for binding ligands to the HIV-1 RT active site. In conclusion, the docking results were in line with thein vitroassay and indicated that the synthesized analogues might be potential inhibitors of HIV-1 RT.

The findings of the drug-likeness and physicochemical studies provide supporting evidence for the drug-like properties of the synthesized analogues (Table 3). According to the results, nevirapine and its analogues 5a, 5b had logP(ClogP) < 5, molecular weight < 500, fewer than 10H-bond acceptors, and 5H-bond donors. These findings indicate that the synthesized analogues follows Lipinski's rule of 5 and exhibit drug-like properties.

ADMET analysis was conducted to define the pharmacological profile of nevirapine and its synthesized analogues, which paves the way for predicting it as a drug candidate. Drug candidates demonstrated inadequate absorption when their topological polar surface area (TPSA) exceeds the threshold of 140 Å2, which serves as a baseline for approved pharmaceuticals. There exists a positive association between TPSA and mass, wherein molecules with a mass above 500 g mol−1were reported to exhibit TPSA values outside the range of 0–140. The TPSA values and Gastrointestinal Absorption (GIA) of the retrieved analogues were deemed satisfactory.14A bioavailability score larger than zero,i.e.0.55, suggests that the analogues exhibit at least 10% oral bioavailability or measurable Caco-2 permeability, contributing to their drug-like property. The permeability characteristics of a medication, namely its GIA and Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability, have significant importance in the context of developing a treatment intended for extensive use.

Many previous studies have been conducted to enhance the gastrointestinal penetration of molecules for the oral delivery of poorly absorbed medications.15All three compounds demonstrated satisfactory growth inhibitory activity and were able to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are an imperative group of enzymes, including heme, and play a substantial role in metabolising pharmaceutical compounds and eliminating foreign substances. CYP activity might be affected by pharmaceutical agents, resulting in noteworthy drug–drug interactions with potential clinical implications. These interactions may give rise to therapeutic inefficacy or unexpected side effects. It is noteworthy that 5a, 5b, and nevirapine do not inhibit enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, indicating that they have increased chances of being eliminated and metabolized through the metabolic biotransformation process at a substantial rate. The acute toxicity prediction assays, including the AMES test, acute oral toxicity, skin sensitization, and hepatotoxicity, revealed 5a, 5b, and nevirapine to be non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-mutagenic, and non-irritant. Although 5a, 5b, and nevirapine were predicted to be hepatotoxic, these effects might be produced at a higher dose range. Notably, according to the Globally Harmonized System (300 < category 4 ≤ 2000 mg per kg per day), LD50values found within the range of 1266–2175 mg per kg per day were considered in category 4, indicating that 5a and 5b are non-toxic.16Consequently, based on preliminary drug-likeness, physicochemical, and ADMET prediction studies, 5a and 5b may be promising candidates for further investigations.

The synthesized analogues showed inspiring resultsin silicoand drug-likeness studies; the analogues were screened for MD simulation studies.17,18MD simulations on the analogues were conducted using the Desmond package with significant predicted binding energies (>−70.00 kcal mol−1). The binding energies were calculated between the HIV–I reverse transcriptase protein and synthesized analogues. The 5a and 5b exhibited −73.53 kcal mol−1and −86.44 kcal mol−1binding energies, respectively (Fig. 6and7). In the current investigation, the stability of novel synthesized nevirapine analogues (5a and 5b) and enzyme (1tkx) complexes were identified using HIV-I reverse transcriptase and 100 ns MD simulations.

The root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculates the average distance caused by atom displacement for a given time frame. RMSD analysis can be used to establish the occurrence of equilibrated simulation. Notably, fluctuations between the range of 1–3 Å are considered perfectly acceptable within a reference protein structure. A significant conformational change in the structure of a protein indicates an unstable system. During a 100 ns simulation experiment, analogues 5a and 5b exhibited an extended variation of 4.53 Å and 5.57 Å, respectively, as presented in SI (Table 2). According to the results, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase undergoes a protein conformational change as a result of binding with analogues. Analogue 5a showed minimal structural modifications within the range of 32–46 Å, suggesting a rather stable alignment throughout the binding region (SI (Fig. S7a)). Similarly, 5b was involved in the hydrogen bond formation with Lys101 and Tyr318 amino acid residues; hydrophobic interactions with Pro95, Pro97, Tyr181, Val179, Val106, Leu100, Tyr183, Tyr188, Phe227, Trp229, and Leu234 and water bridge interactions with Ile94, Pro95, Lys101, Lys103, Ile180, His235 and Pro236 amino acid residues of HIV-I RT enzyme. Similarly, 5b showed minimal structural modifications ranging from 28 to 38 Å, suggesting a rather stable alignment within the binding site (SI (Fig. S7c)). The molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation results showed that compounds 5a and 5b exhibited hydrogen bond interaction (hydrophilic interaction) with the Lys101 amino acid residue of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme. Similarly, both compounds 5a and 5b formed hydrophobic interactions with various Leu234, Val106, Lys103, Leu100, Tyr188, Tyr181 and Val179 amino acid residues of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme. These amino acid residues represent the allosteric binding sites of the HIV-1 RT enzyme.19The literature review demonstrates that an allosteric binding site of the HIV-1 RT enzyme, also named the NNRTIBP (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors binding pockets), is located within the primer grip region near the polymerase's active site, which lies primarily in the p66 region of the polymerase active site.20,21It comprises several aromatic (Tyr181, Tyr188, Phe227, Trp229 and Tyr232), hydrophilic (Lys101, Lys103, Ser105, Asp132, and Glu224), and hydrophobic residues (Pro59, Leu100, Val106, Val179, and Leu236) and two more amino acids (Ile135 and Glu138) from p51 subunits. Similarly, NNRTIs, including nevirapine, rilpivirine and efavirenz, showed binding interactions with the allosteric site of the enzyme and acted as non-competitive inhibitors.22,23These analyses hypothesized that compounds 5a and 5b showed similar binding interactions with the amino acid residues of the allosteric sites, so both compounds might act as non-competitive inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme (Fig. 8).

ITC studies on the interaction of nevirapine and its analogues (5a and 5b) with HSA protein were performed by injecting the ligand solution into the sample cell loaded with 60 μM HSA protein. The concentration of nevirapine and its analogues in the syringe was optimized (0.34 mM) to confirm the saturation of the HSA protein with the derivatives within 19 additional injections.Fig. 9displays a representative ITC profile for the interaction of nevirapine and its analogues with HSA protein at 298 K.Fig. 9, upper panel, presents raw data as powerversustime upon the addition of nineteen sequential injections. However, the lower panel shows the heat profile as a function of analogues to the HSA protein molar ratio.

A single set of binding site models fit the experimental results well, thereby providing the values of the stoichiometry of binding (n), Gibbs free energy change (ΔGm), standard molar enthalpy (ΔHm), and binding constant (Kb).Fig. 9shows the obtained values of these thermodynamic parameters. The associated thermodynamic parameters of interactions of nevirapine with HSA are asKb= 1.0 × 105M−1, enthalpy change ΔHm= −10.6 kJ mol−1, ΔGm= −28.6 kJ mol−1, andn= (0.9). The obtained value ofKbwith order 105M−1suggests the presence of strong binding between nevirapine and the HSA protein. The binding was observed to be associated with exothermic heat effects, indicating the involvement of hydrophilic interactions in the binding process since hydrophilic interactions are accompanied by exothermic heat effects. In addition, the negative ΔGmvalue directly relates to the binding affinity for spontaneous binding between nevirapine and the biomolecule HSA. The nevirapine stoichiometry value (0.9) implies the binding of one molecule of nevirapine to the HSA protein. These findings of ITC investigations imply that the binding interactions of nevirapine with HSA macromolecules are thermodynamically favourable.

Next, the observed quantitative characteristics of interactions of synthesized analogues 5a and HSA protein, including binding constant, enthalpy change, Gibbs free energy change, and stoichiometry, are 2.7 × 103M−1, −8.1 kJ mol−1, −19.5 kJ mol−1, and 1.3, respectively.

Fluorescence quenching studies were performed to understand the binding of dipyridodiazepinone derivatives with HSA and to complement the ITC results. Fluorescence quenching studies were also performed with nevirapine to compare the effect of the methyl group position change on the binding interaction with HSA. For this, HSA was taken in a cuvette, and aliquots of nevirapine and its analogues were added to this solution. The concentrations of nevirapine and its derivative solution were increased from 0 to 0.17 mM to achieve quenching of HSA fluorescence.

whereF0andFare the fluorescence intensity of HSA in the absence and presence of the quencher, andKbis the binding constant. The quenching spectra are shown in the upper panel ofFig. 10, and Stern–Volmer plots are shown in the lower panel. Quenching spectra show the strong quenching of HSA fluorescence in the presence of nevirapine. Compound 5a shows comparatively less quenching than nevirapine, while compound 5b shows the least quenching of HSA fluorescence. Binding constant values obtained by plotting ln[(F0−F)/F] as a function of ln[Q] were 5.7 × 105M−1, 2.5 × 103M−1, and 1.1 × 102M−1for nevirapine, compound 5a, and compound 5b, respectively. Fluorescence intensitiesFandF0of HSA were observed at 338 nm (emission) and 280 nm (excitation), respectively. No significant shift was observed in wavelength with maximum absorbance after the addition of the quencher. Binding constant values suggest the maximum binding of nevirapine with HSA. However, changing the position of the CH3group from γ to β position in compound 5a decreased the binding constant value with HSA. Compound 5b, where the CH3group is being replaced by H, showed the least binding with HSA and complemented the ITC results. Fluorescence quenching analysis also confirmed that 5b possessed poor binding affinity with HSA and was released easily in the body, which significantly influenced the ADMET mechanism.

Here,Tis the experimental temperature,Ris the molar gas constant andKis the binding constant. The nature of the acting forces in the interaction process is as follows: (i) electrostatic/ionic interactions: ΔH< 0 and ΔS> 0; (ii) hydrophobic force: ΔH> 0 and ΔS> 0; and (iii) hydrogen and van der Waal's force: ΔH< 0 and ΔS< 0. It is evident from the ITC results that the calculated ΔGvalue is negative, which signifies that the binding of the synthesized compound with HSA is spontaneous. The entropies of the nevirapine, 5a and 5b were found to be +60.4, +38.26 and +25.5 J K−1mol−1, respectively. The negative ΔHand positive ΔSsupport the electrostatic/ionic interactions with HSA and are responsible for the intrinsic fluorescence property.

All solvents, reagents, and HSA were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without purification. The structures of all the synthesized analogues were confirmed by applying the NMR technique.13C NMR and1H spectra were obtained using a Bruker spectrometer (400 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. A mass spectrum was recorded using a PE-SCIEX API-300 with a Turboion spray mass spectrometer. Elemental analysis was carried out using the EURO EA3000 elemental analyser instrument. The open capillary tube method was used to determine the melting points on the Buchi melting point apparatus.

A mixture of 3-amino-2-chloro pyridine derivatives (2.4 g, 0.0187 mmol) and sodium hydrogen orthophosphate (6.25 g, 0.02 mmol) in THF-H2O was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. To this, 2-chloronicotinyol chloride (3.29 g, 0.0187 mmol) was added with continued stirring for 8 h at 60 °C to obtain a pinkish colour. Further, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, extracted with ethyl acetate, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the solvent was removed by rotatory evaporation to give crude carboxamide. It was further purified by column chromatography (silica gel 60–120 mesh size; 15–18% ethyl acetate in hexane) to give pure carboxamide.

Sodium hydride (0.565 mmol) was washed with dry hexane. Then, substituted amine (0.3 mmol) and 10 ml dry THF were added to it at room temperature in a two-neck round-bottom flask. The reaction was stirred for 30 min, and appropriate carboxamide (1.7 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 12 h at 60 °C. After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was further cooled to room temperature and acidified with diluted HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 10 ml). All organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated under vacuum to produce crude dipyridodiazepinone. The crude compound was purified from column chromatography (silica gel 60–120 mesh size, 10–14% ethyl acetate in hexane) to give pure dipyridodiazepine 5(a–h).

The computational technique of molecular docking is utilized to examine the interaction between ligands and macromolecules. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (PDB id: 1tkx) was retrieved from thehttps://www.rcsb.org/proteindata bank site. Further, the macromolecule's 3D structure was opened in Discovery Studio Visualizer, hydrogen atoms were added, water molecules were removed, and valency was satisfied and saved in the PDBQT format.26,27Subsequently, both ligands (5a, 5b, and nevirapine) and macromolecules were subjected to a PyRx window to predict the binding interaction using the AutoDock Vina module.28Other parameters remained at their default values, except the grid box modified following the active sites of individual macromolecules. Additionally, the ligand's bonds were permitted to rotate unrestrictedly, resulting in a rigid receptor. After the molecular docking study was completed and 10 configurations for each drug–protein complex were constructed for all synthesized analogues, text files with scoring results were generated for manual comparison. The docking poses with weaker binding energy were believed to be the best. Using Discovery Studio Visualizer and PyMol, the interaction between ligands and macromolecules was analyzed and visualized.

Lipinski's rule of five criteria was used to evaluate the potential drug-likeness of each ligand. The ADMETSar web tool was used to validate Lipinski's rule of five parameters. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of a potential drug candidate, it is necessary to consider the ADMET mechanism of the molecule.29After molecular docking, ADMETSar and SWISSADME servers were used to predict the ADMET mechanism of the nevirapine analogues. The SMILES format of the ligand structure was used in the web server.

MD simulations were conducted with the GROMACS 2020 software to evaluate the credibility of the docking results.30,31The simulations used the CHARMM36 force field, TIP3P water model, and CHARMM36-Feb 2021 update version.13Proteins, namely, 5dyw and 4ey7, were placed together with their respective complexes and positioned in the geometric center of a dodecahedron-shaped container. The distance between the protein complexes and the edges of the container was set at 10 Å. To achieve system neutralization at this step, negative ions (Cl−) and positive ions (Na+) were introduced parallelly by displacing the solvent molecules as required. Then energy minimization procedure was conducted using the Verlet cutoff methodology to mitigate steric hindrances inside the system. Further, the energy minimum was conducted using the steepest descent method with a maximum step size of 50 000 to ensure the absence of atomic collisions. Furthermore, equilibrium states were achieved by 100 ns NPT and NVT simulations at a pressure of 1 ATM and at a temperature of 300 kelvin. Subsequently, a molecular simulation lasting 10 ns was conducted. Following MD simulation, an investigation of several properties, such as Radius of Gyration (Rg), Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), and Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), was performed on the trajectory. These properties were obtained using the built-in capabilities provided by Desmond software.

To analyse the energetics of the interaction of nevirapine within the solution, ITC is recognized as the gold standard experimental device. ITC offers accurate, quick, and easy label-free monitoring of the thermodynamics of molecular interactions by determining the heat gained or released during interactions.32Therefore, MICRO CAL PEAQ-ITC (Malvern) is used to determine the thermodynamics of the interactions of ligands with the macromolecule.33,34The calibration of ITC was performed before running the experiments with standard EDTA and Ca2+solutions, and binding parameters matched well with the standard thermodynamic parameters of Ca–EDTA binding. The exact concentration of macromolecule (HSA) and synthesized compounds required for ITC experiments was determined using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer from SHIMADZU at 280 nm (A1cm1%= 5.3). All the solutions were prepared in 5% DMSO solution in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) for microcalorimetric experimental analysis. The same solution was also used in the reference cell to evaluate the thermodynamic properties associated with the interactions. The macromolecule solution in the sample cell was titrated with the ligand solution filled in a computer-controlled syringe. A syringe (40 μl) was used to inject the ligand solution into the sample cell that contained 200 μl of macromolecules. Dilution experiments were conducted by titrating the syringe solution (5a, 5b and nevirapine) against a similar buffer. The final heat reported in the ITC profiles was calculated by subtracting the heat produced in the dilution experiment from the primary titration profile. At the end of titration, the concentration in the syringe was adjusted to achieve saturated heat for each experiment. The experiment was programmed for 19 consecutive injections, with the first injection 0.4 μl, followed by 18 subsequent injections (2 μl), at 150-second time intervals. For all titrations throughout the run, a stirring speed of 750 rpm was fixed for the syringe.

In the present study, novel dipyridodiazepinone (nevirapine) analogue 5(a–h) was synthesized using a simple and efficient base-promoted C–N coupling reaction assisted by amination amidation and cyclocondensation reactions. Synthesized analogues were analyzed by employing feature mapping analysis using structure-based pharmacophore design, molecular docking andin vitroHIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, MD simulation andin silicopharmacokinetic properties utilizing the ADMETSar web tool. Further, thermodynamic and spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized analogues were conducted using an ITC experiment to understand their binding interactions with HSA.

The feature mapping analysis and molecular docking studies indicated that compounds 5a and 5b possess good fit value and affinity towards HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and showed considerable interaction with key residues such as hydrogen residue (Lys101), pi–sigma residue (Leu100), alkyl and pi–alkyl residues (Lys103, Tyr181, Val106, Leu234, and Tyr188) available at the catalytic site of enzyme. Furthermore, based on ADMET and physicochemical analysis, the results indicate that compound 5b had favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics and drug-like properties. Most notably, both compounds exhibited considerable safety in toxicity assessments. The findings from ITC revealed key interactions between the synthesized analogues and HSA protein, which in turn indicated the possibility of their expedited transportation and associated therapeutic effect in the recipient. In conclusion, these findings suggest that these compounds have significant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities and possess drug-like properties and thus need immediate in-depth exploration for their utility as therapeutic agents in the management of HIV-1-mediated diseases.
