Mentha piperitaL. (peppermint) is a valued medicinal and industrial plant known for its essential oils and bioactive compounds, particularly menthol. This study investigates the effects of four phytohormonal elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MJ), abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and gibberellic acid (GA) on oxidative stress, gene expression, and the biosynthesis of menthol and related monoterpenes in peppermint. Treatments at two concentrations, 0.2 mM and 0.4 mM, were evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for gene expression and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for metabolite profiling. The results showed that MJ and SA at 0.4 mM significantly enhanced menthol and menthone levels while reducing menthofuran accumulation. ABA reduced menthol content at the same concentration, whereas GA had a limited impact on metabolite levels. Expression of key genes associated with the menthol biosynthetic pathway, including the biosynthetic genesPR,MDH, andMFS, as well as the regulatory transcription factorsMhMYB1andMhMYB2, was significantly affected by the treatments. MJ and SA particularly upregulatedMhMYB1,MhMYB2,PR, andMDH. All phytohormones induced oxidative stress and elevated antioxidant enzyme activities, with MJ and ABA showing the strongest effects. The findings highlight the diverse regulatory roles of phytohormones in menthol biosynthesis. These results suggest that MJ and SA can be used to optimize menthol production in peppermint.

Medicinal plants have long been integral to global healthcare systems due to their capacity to synthesize a diverse array of specific organic compounds known as secondary metabolites1. These compounds form the basis of traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda, Unani, and others. Even in modern contexts, bioactive constituents derived from medicinal plants remain crucial in pharmaceuticals and various industrial applications2. From a plant biology perspective, secondary metabolites play a vital role in defending plants against both biotic and abiotic stressors, including pathogens, herbivores, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and oxidative stress3. Studies have shown that compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids contribute significantly to plant adaptation and survival. These same compounds are also largely responsible for the therapeutic properties of medicinal plants4.

One prominent example of such a plant isMentha piperitaL., commonly known as peppermint. It is a naturally occurring hybrid betweenMentha spicata(2n = 48) andMentha aquatica(2n = 96), and is classified within the Lamiaceae family as a hexaploid species5,6. This economically and medicinally valuable perennial plant is widely cultivated in temperate regions, including Europe, Asia, the United States, India, and the Mediterranean7.

Peppermint essential oil holds high commercial value in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries, largely due to its wide range of bioactive compounds. The oil is primarily composed of terpenes, with monoterpenes making up about 52% and sesquiterpenes around 9%8. Key monoterpenes such as menthol, menthone, limonene, isomenthone, and menthofuran are responsible for its characteristic aroma and a variety of biological effects9. Among these, menthol stands out as the most abundant and biologically active compound. It exhibits antimicrobial, analgesic, and insect-repellent properties and is widely used in medicinal and hygienic products10. Clinically, menthol plays a role in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by modulating nociceptive and inflammatory pathways11. Additionally, research suggests that menthol may contribute to cholesterol regulation and the inhibition of liver fibrosis progression12. The global industrial relevance of menthol is highlighted by an annual demand of approximately 30,000–32,000 metric tons, ranking it among the most in-demand natural flavoring agents alongside vanilla and citrus13.

The essential oil of peppermint is synthesized and stored specifically in glandular trichomes found on the aerial parts of the plant14. The biosynthesis of menthol begins in coordination with leaf development, as enzymatic activity initiates the accumulation of essential oils within these trichomes. As the plant matures, menthol content increases progressively, reaching its maximum concentration at the flowering stage15.

The biosynthetic pathway of menthol in peppermint consists of eight steps, originating from primary metabolism and utilizing the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway to supply the C5 isoprenoid precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). This pathway begins with the condensation of these precursors to form geranyl diphosphate, which undergoes cyclization to yield (-)-limonene. Subsequent hydroxylation, isomerization, and multiple redox transformations establish the chiral structure of menthol15(Fig.1). Although the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway in theMenthagenus has been fully elucidated, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this pathway and the molecular factors that control gene expression remain poorly understood. Recent studies, however, have identified two MYB transcription factors, MhMYB1 and MhMYB2, which play a critical regulatory role by modulating the expression of key enzymatic genes, particularly those encoding menthol dehydrogenase (MDH) and pulegone reductase (PR). These factors significantly influence the biosynthesis of menthol16.

The arrows indicate the enzymes involved in menthol biosynthesis, while the green arrows highlight the genes analyzed in this study. The verified subcellular locations are identified, with ER representing the endoplasmic reticulum and Mit denoting the mitochondria. The enzymatic reactions are catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), (−)-limonene synthase (LS), (−)-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), (−)-trans-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD), (−)-isopiperitenone reductase (iPR), (+)-cis-isopulegone isomerase (iPI), (+)-pulegone reductase (PR), (−)-menthol dehydrogenase (MDH), and menthofuran synthase (MFS). The C5 precursors, IPP and DMAPP, originate from the MEP pathway and serve as initial substrates in the menthol biosynthetic pathway15,17.

The optimization of plant metabolite production for pharmaceutical and industrial applications, through genetic engineering or elicitor-mediated production under tissue culture conditions, fundamentally depends on identifying metabolic pathways and the regulatory factors that control these processes. Consequently, the use of a wide range of biotic and abiotic elicitors in both in vivo and in vitro settings has become a key focus in plant biotechnology and breeding. These strategies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms, identify effective elicitors, and develop efficient protocols that enhance both the yield and quality of bioactive compounds18.

Key phytohormones such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA) modulate biosynthetic pathways by regulating gene expression and facilitating post-translational modifications. These hormones promote the production and accumulation of bioactive secondary metabolites by activating complex transcriptional networks responsive to environmental cues23,24. Through these mechanisms, phytohormones enhance plant metabolic plasticity and strengthen defense capabilities under both biotic and abiotic stress conditions19.

Beyond their classical roles, phytohormones have emerged as dynamic regulators of stress-induced secondary metabolism through multilayered mechanisms. Recent findings indicate that hormones such as methyl jasmonate (MJ) and SA not only directly regulate the expression of biosynthetic genes but also modulate broader stress signaling networks19,29. One such network involves the controlled induction of oxidative stress, in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as signaling intermediates to activate antioxidant defenses and trigger the accumulation of secondary metabolites28(Fig.2).

A schematic illustration depicts the application of phytohormonal elicitor treatments via foliar spraying, along with the complexity of signal transduction cascades associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in response to phytohormone exposure within the glandular trichomes (orange glands) of peppermint. Upon phytohormone treatment, the interaction between plant hormones and cellular components leads to the extensive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)31. These ROS, induced by hormonal signaling, intricately mediate multifaceted responses, including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, Ca²⁺ bursts, modulation of signaling molecules, and enhancement of antioxidant defense mechanisms32. Collectively, these processes may finely regulate transcriptional dynamics associated with secondary metabolism. In response to ROS accumulation, the plant cellular machinery rapidly initiates a well-coordinated defensive response aimed at mitigating ROS-induced damage31. Additionally, the direct regulation of gene expression by phytohormones also plays a significant role in orchestrating these biosynthetic pathways19. The peppermint leaf surface image was obtained from Science Photo Library (www.sciencephoto.com), and the overall diagram was created using BioRender (www.biorender.com).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of four key phytohormones, MJ, ABA, SA, and GA, on oxidative responses, the expression of key transcription factors, and genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of monoterpenes, specifically menthol, menthone, pulegone, and menthofuran, as well as the biosynthesis and accumulation of these metabolites in peppermint. By comparing the effects of these phytohormones, we aimed to explore their influence on molecular and metabolic regulation at both the transcriptional and biosynthetic levels. This research may provide valuable insights into the role of phytohormones in modulating metabolic processes and the synthesis of bioactive compounds, which could contribute to optimizing the production of plant-derived compounds in various industries.

Rhizomes of peppermint were obtained from the Institute of Medicinal Plants (Karaj, Iran). Healthy rhizomes were cut into approximately 10 cm segments and planted in pots filled with loam soil. The pots were maintained in a controlled growth chamber under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod at 25 ± 2 °C. Plants were irrigated at three-day intervals.

The phytohormones used in this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Solutions of four phytohormones MJ, SA, ABA, and GA were prepared by dissolving them in a 0.3% (v/v) ethanol solution. Three molar concentrations (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mM) of each phytohormone were prepared for treatment application. The first foliar spray was applied 60 days after rhizome planting, during the early stages of flowering, ensuring that all leaves were thoroughly coated with the solution. The spraying was performed using a hand pump sprayer to achieve uniform coverage, with a spray volume of approximately 15 mL per pot. The second foliar spray was conducted 7 days after the first, coinciding with 40% flowering of the plants33,34. The control plants received distilled water mixed with 0.3% (v/v) ethanol at the same time as the treatments. For each treatment, three replicates were evaluated. Following the final foliar application, after 48 h, the leaves of the treated seedlings were harvested from approximately 5 cm above the soil surface. The collected samples from each replicate were divided into three portions, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. These samples were subsequently used for RNA extraction, metabolite quantification, and biochemical analyses.

The treated and shade-dried leaf tissue (5 g) was finely powdered to enhance surface area and subsequently subjected to essential oil extraction via the hydro-distillation method. The distillation process was conducted for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus to ensure optimal separation and recovery of volatile compounds17. The collected essential oils were dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) to eliminate all traces of water, then stored in a sealed dark vial at 4 °C until analyzed. The identification of essential oil components was performed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system consisting of an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent 5975 mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, USA). Separation was carried out on an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: the initial temperature was set at 40 °C, then increased at a rate of 5 °C/min to 200 °C, held for 1 min, and then further increased at 10 °C/min to 250 °C and held for 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min and the split ratio was 30:1. The injection volume was 1 µL, and the injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The mass spectrometer operated in electron ionization mode with an energy of 70 eV, and the mass scan range was from 40 to 550 m/z. The identification of essential oil components was carried out using the retention indices and mass spectral analysis. The linear retention indices were calculated using the Van Den Dool and Kratz Eq. 36. Simultaneously, mass spectra were matched with reference libraries National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST) for compound identification37. The relative percentage of each compound was determined based on the chromatographic peak area in the total ion chromatogram (Fig.3).

To assess H₂O₂ content, 500 mg of treated leaf tissue was homogenized in an ice-cooled bath using 5 mL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 0.1% w/v). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 1 mL of 1 M potassium iodide (KI) were added to 0.5 mL of the supernatant. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 390 nm. To quantify the H₂O₂ content in the samples, a standard calibration curve was established using different concentrations of H₂O₂, and the results were expressed as µmol/g fresh weight (FW)38.

Total soluble protein was quantified following the Bradford method39. For enzymatic extraction, 500 mg of treated tissue was thoroughly ground in liquid nitrogen and subjected to extraction at 4 °C. The homogenization was carried out in an extraction buffer (Tris–HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10% glycerol), ensuring optimal protein stability. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was collected for enzymatic assays of CAT, GPX, and APX.

CAT activity was assessed by measuring the decomposition rate of H₂O₂. The reaction mixture consisted of 3 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 µL of 30% H₂O₂, and 50 µL of crude enzyme extract. The decline in absorbance at 240 nm was recorded over a period of 1 min to quantify CAT activity, which was expressed as µmol of H2O2decomposed/ (min mg protein)40.

APX activity was evaluated by monitoring the oxidation of ascorbate. The reaction mixture was composed of 100 µL of crude enzyme extract, 600 µL of 0.1 mM EDTA dissolved in 1.5 mL of 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 400 µL of 0.5 mM ascorbic acid. The reaction was initiated by adding 400 µL of 30% H₂O₂. The decrease in ascorbate concentration was recorded at 290 nm over a 4 min period. APX activity was defined as the amount of ascorbate oxidized (µmol) / (min mg protein)41.

To measure GPX activity, 50 µL of crude enzyme extract was added to a reaction mixture containing 3 µL of guaiacol, 10 µL of 30% H₂O₂, and 3 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Changes in absorbance at 470 nm were recorded over a 1 min period. The activity of GPX was expressed as the amount of guaiacol oxidized (µmol) / (min mg protein)42.

Statistical analysis of the experimental data was performed using SAS 9.3.1 Portable. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted based on a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications. Mean comparisons were carried out using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at a significance level ofP< 0.05. To determine the optimal treatments for gene expression levels and monoterpene accumulation, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied, and the results were visualized through heatmap representation using the ClustVis web-tool43. Additionally, correlations between gene expression levels, monoterpene content, and antioxidant enzymes were assessed utilizing the corrplot function in the RStudio environment (R 4.4.3)44.

Based on the results, each of the applied phytohormones exerted distinct effects on H2O2levels. Among them, MJ and ABA exhibited more pronounced alterations, as their lowest applied concentrations (0.2 mM) led to a slight reduction in H2O2levels, whereas their highest concentrations (0.4 mM) resulted in maximal production and accumulation of H2O2. In contrast, SA and GA demonstrated a divergent pattern compared to the former two phytohormones, wherein increasing their concentrations was associated with a moderate decline in H2O2levels (Fig.4A).

The effects of foliar application of different concentrations of MJ, ABA, SA, and GA phytohormones (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mM) on the H₂O₂ production (a) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes CAT (b), APX (c), and GPX (d) in flowering peppermint plants. Values are means of three replicates. Error bars represent ± SE. Different letters above the columns represent statistically significant differences atP< 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test).

The activity of CAT increased in response to treatments with MJ, ABA, SA, and GA at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mM. The highest CAT activity was observed in the ABA treatment at 0.4 mM, which was significantly greater than that of other treatments. MJ also induced a notable increase in CAT activity, albeit to a lesser extent than ABA. In contrast, SA and GA exhibited weaker effects on CAT activity, although a moderate increase was detected at the higher concentration (0.4 mM). Notably, GA at both concentrations and SA at 0.2 mM did not show a significant difference compared to the control group. The lowest CAT activity was recorded in the control group, showing a significant difference from most phytohormones treatments. Overall, an increase in phytohormones concentration was associated with a progressive rise in CAT activity (Fig.4B).

The activity of APX was assessed in response to treatments with MJ, ABA, SA, and GA at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mM. The highest APX activity was observed in MJ at 0.4 mM, showing a significant increase compared to other treatments. ABA also enhanced APX activity considerably, although to a lesser extent than MJ, with no substantial difference between the two tested concentrations. Notably, SA at 0.2 mM exhibited the lowest APX activity among all treatments, displaying a significant difference from the other groups; however, its activity markedly increased at 0.4 mM. GA treatment led to a moderate elevation in APX activity, with a slight increase at the higher concentration. The lowest APX activity was recorded in the control and SA at 0.2 mM, both significantly lower than other treatments. Overall, increasing phytohormones concentrations, particularly MJ and SA, resulted in a progressive rise in APX activity (Fig.4C).

The activity of GPX significantly increased in response to most hormonal treatments. The highest GPX activity was observed in the MJ treatment at a concentration of 0.4 mM, which showed a significant difference compared to other treatments. The ABA and SA treatments also led to a notable increase in GPX activity, with their highest concentrations reaching levels comparable to MJ. In contrast, different concentrations of GA did not exhibit a significant difference compared to the control. Overall, increasing the concentration from 0.2 to 0.4 mM resulted in a rise in GPX activity across all treatments, highlighting the regulatory role of these phytohormones in the plant’s antioxidant response (Fig.4‌D).

Hormonal treatments exerted diverse effects on the chemical profile of peppermint essential oil. Among the various constituents, the menthol content was particularly responsive, showing significant fluctuations in response to both phytohormone type and concentration.

Treatment with MJ at both 0.2 and 0.4 mM concentrations significantly increased menthol content compared to the control, with the highest accumulation observed in the 0.4 mM MJ treatment. This result highlights the potential of MJ in stimulating menthol biosynthesis and enhancing essential oil quality. SA showed a significant effect only at the 0.4 mM concentration, indicating a concentration-dependent response. In contrast, ABA did not significantly alter menthol content at 0.2 mM, but caused a notable reduction at 0.4 mM, suggesting possible inhibitory effects on menthol-related biosynthetic pathways. GA exhibited no significant influence on menthol levels at either concentration (Fig.5).

The effects of foliar application of different concentrations of MJ, ABA, SA, and GA phytohormones (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mM) on the percentage composition of menthol, menthone, menthofuran, and pulegone in the essential oil of flowering peppermint plants. Values are means of three replicates. Error bars represent ± SE. Different letters above the columns represent statistically significant differences atP< 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test).

Application of MJ at 0.4 mM significantly enhanced menthone accumulation compared to the control, while the lower concentration (0.2 mM) showed no statistically significant effect. ABA at 0.2 mM promoted menthone biosynthesis; however, its effect was diminished at 0.4 mM, with no significant difference from the control group. SA significantly increased menthone levels at both concentrations, whereas GA had no discernible impact. Among the treatments, MJ at 0.4 mM exhibited the most pronounced stimulatory effect on menthone production. Conversely, the reduced effect of ABA at the higher concentration may suggest a redirection of metabolic fluxes away from menthone biosynthesis (Fig.5).

The results revealed that most treatments did not cause statistically significant changes in menthofuran content. However, MJ and SA at a concentration of 0.4 mM significantly reduced its accumulation, while no notable effects were observed with ABA or GA at either concentration. This pattern suggests that MJ and SA lead to a decrease in menthofuran content at elevated concentration (Fig.5).

The results indicate that changes in pulegone content were less pronounced compared to the other three metabolites in response to the hormonal treatments. Most treatments had no significant effect on pulegone levels. The only statistically significant reduction was observed with SA at the 0.4 mM concentration, suggesting a possible downregulatory effect at higher doses (Fig.5).

The relative expression ofMhMYB1was markedly influenced by hormonal treatments. MJ and SA significantly upregulated the expression of this transcription factor at both concentrations, with the most pronounced induction observed at 0.4 mM. In contrast, ABA exhibited a biphasic behavior; at the lower concentration (0.2 mM), it led to a moderate upregulation, whereas at 0.4 mM, it caused a substantial downregulation ofMhMYB1expression. Furthermore, GA induced gene expression at both concentrations, albeit to a lesser extent compared to MJ and SA. These expression patterns highlight the stimulatory role of MJ, SA, and GA in regulatingMhMYB1expression, while ABA at higher concentrations exerts a repressive effect on its transcription (Fig.6).

The effects of foliar application of different concentrations of MJ, ABA, SA, and GA phytohormones (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mM) on the relative expression of genes involved in the menthol biosynthesis pathway. Values are means of three replicates. Error bars represent ± SE. Different letters above the columns represent statistically significant differences atP< 0.05 (Duncan’s multiple range test).

The relative expression of theMhMYB2gene under hormonal treatments exhibited distinct regulatory patterns. MJ and GA followed a similar pattern in increasing gene expression, where an increase in the concentration of these phytohormones led to a greater upregulation of the gene, with the highest induction observed at a concentration of 0.4 mM. In contrast, ABA and SA also induced the expression of the gene, but this increase was concentration-independent; the lower concentration (0.2 mM) resulted in a higher increase in expression compared to the higher concentration (0.4 mM). These findings suggest that MJ and GA act as concentration-dependent positive regulators ofMhMYB2expression, whereas ABA and SA, despite their inducing effect, exhibited reduced effectiveness at higher concentrations. A noteworthy point is that the MJ treatment, at its highest concentration, had a more significant impact on the relative expression of this gene compared to the other treatments (Fig.6).

Based on the results, the lowest concentrations (0.2 mM) of each of the four phytohormones (MJ, ABA, SA, and GA) led to a slight increase in the expression of thePRgene. However, increasing the concentration of ABA resulted in a reduction in transcript accumulation compared to the control. In contrast, higher concentrations (0.4 mM) of the other three phytohormones consistently enhancedPRgene expression, with a marked increase in transcript accumulation. A comparison of the treatments revealed that the highest concentrations of MJ and SA had the greatest impact on the accumulation of thePRgene transcript (Fig.6).

The expression of theMDHgene in peppermint, when treated with varying concentrations of MJ and SA, displayed a significantly different and distinctive pattern compared to the effects observed with the other two phytohormones, ABA and GA. Both MJ and SA at their respective concentrations triggered a clear upregulation in gene expression, with the most pronounced induction observed at the highest concentrations of these two phytohormones. This suggests that MJ and SA play a critical role in enhancing the expression of theMDHgene, which could be linked to their known involvement in secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, ABA and GA appeared to exert an inhibitory effect on the expression of theMDHgene, leading to a significant reduction in its relative expression levels. This suppression indicates that these phytohormones may have a negative regulatory impact on the expression of genes involved in essential oil biosynthesis, particularly in relation to menthol production (Fig.6).

The expression of theMFSgene, in comparison to other genes of the menthol biosynthetic pathway, exhibited a somewhat different pattern under phytohormonal treatments. Specifically, a decreasing trend in the expression of this gene was observed under most treatments compared to the control, and except for the ABA treatments and the GA treatment at the 0.4 mM concentration, the relative expression in other treatments was negative (Fig.6).

The cluster analysis of hormonal treatments indicates that MJ (at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mM) and SA (at 0.4 mM) exhibit similar effects, grouping into a distinct cluster. This clustering is likely due to the activation of shared oxidative signaling and metabolic pathways. Conversely, ABA (at 0.2 mM) and GA (at 0.4 mM) also clustered together, which may reflect similar regulatory effects of these two phytohormones. Interestingly, GA and SA at 0.2 mM closely resemble the control, indicating that at this concentration, these phytohormones exert no significant impact on the studied biosynthetic pathway at the molecular and biochemical levels. These findings suggest that at higher concentrations, MJ and SA activate oxidative stress-related pathways and signaling cascades leading to the induction of the menthol biosynthetic pathway. Notably, ABA at 0.4 mM did not cluster with any other treatment, implying that at this concentration, it exhibits a distinctly different regulatory behavior in modulating the studied biosynthetic pathway compared to the other hormonal treatments (Fig.7).

Heatmap clustering of different phytohormone treatments (MJ, ABA, SA, and GA) at three concentrations (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mM), based on the expression patterns of genes involved in menthol biosynthesis, the relative contents of menthol, menthone, menthofuran, and pulegone, as well as oxidative stress markers in peppermint. Both rows and columns were clustered using maximum distance and average linkage methods.

The antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APX, and GPX) clustered together, indicating a coordinated response to oxidative stress induced by hormonal treatments. Since these enzymes play a crucial role in mitigating oxidative stress by scavenging H2O2, their proximity within this cluster suggests that the applied treatments have enhanced the plant’s antioxidant defense system. Given that H2O2is grouped in a separate cluster, it can be inferred that its levels are regulated by these enzymes, establishing a coordinated balance in response to the hormonal treatments (Fig.7).

Another distinct cluster was formed by the menthol and menthone metabolites. The clustering of these two metabolites suggests a similar production pattern under hormonal treatments. Given that both menthol and menthone are key components of the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway in aromatic plants and function as precursor and product within this pathway, their co-clustering was predictable (Fig.7).

The clustering ofMhMYB1, withMDHandPRgenes suggests a functional association within a regulatory-metabolic pathway. This grouping may indicate thatMhMYB1potentially regulates the expression ofMDHandPRunder hormonal treatments, thereby coordinating their involvement in the menthol biosynthetic pathway in peppermint (Fig.7).

To gain deeper insights into menthol biosynthesis, we calculated the correlations between the expression levels of five selected genes (MhMYB1,MhMYB2,PR,MDH, andMFS), the quantities of pulegone, menthofuran, menthone, and menthol, and oxidative stress factors (H2O2, CAT, APX, and GPX) (Fig.8). Among the 78 correlations obtained from the correlation matrix, 10 positive and prominent correlations were identified. Among these, two strong correlations were observed between antioxidant enzymes APX and CAT (ρ= 0.86,P< 0.01) and GPX and CAT (ρ= 0.82,P< 0.01). Three correlations were found between the studied genes, includingMDHandMhMYB1(ρ= 0.82,P< 0.01),PRandMDH(ρ= 0.83,P< 0.01), andPRandMhMYB1(ρ= 0.97,P< 0.01). Additionally, five correlations were identified between genes and metabolites in the menthol biosynthesis pathway, includingMhMYB1and menthol (ρ= 0.92,P< 0.01),MhMYB1and menthone (ρ= 0.81,P< 0.01),PRand menthol (ρ= 0.93,P< 0.01),PRand menthone (ρ= 0.86,P< 0.01), andMFSand menthofuran (ρ= 0.86,P< 0.01). Furthermore, six negative and notable correlations were observed, which included menthofuran and menthol (ρ= -0.88,P< 0.01),MhMYB1and menthofuran (ρ= -0.94,P< 0.01),PRand menthofuran (ρ= -0.96,P< 0.01),MDHand menthofuran (ρ= -0.91,P< 0.01),MFSand menthol (ρ= -0.84,P< 0.01), andMFSandMDH(ρ= -0.96,P< 0.01) (Fig.8).

A corrplot-based graph was used to visually interpret the potential pairwise correlations among the relative expression levels of genes involved in the menthol biosynthesis pathway, the contents of menthol, menthone, menthofuran, and pulegone, as well as oxidative stress markers (H₂O₂, CAT, APX, and GPX). The size of each circle and the shading volume of the colors are equivalent to the association degrees between each pairwise comparison.

Oxidative stress in plant cells occurs as a result of adverse environmental conditions, including various biotic and abiotic stresses. In response to such conditions, plant cells employ a diverse range of defense mechanisms to mitigate the detrimental effects of oxidative stress and counteract the induced stress conditions. Among the most crucial strategies are the upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activities, stimulation of non-enzymatic antioxidant production, and enhancement of the biosynthesis and accumulation of protective compounds such as secondary metabolites45. Therefore, a precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying stress induction and the cellular processes involved in secondary metabolite production can facilitate the optimization of valuable plant metabolite synthesis in plant cells.

One of the most effective approaches for investigating oxidative stress induced by environmental stress factors is the analysis of ROS production and the assessment of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense systems in plant cells46. Notably, the generation of ROS, particularly H₂O₂, in plant cells is widely recognized as a hallmark of oxidative stress, which subsequently triggers the activation of antioxidant defense mechanisms, enabling cells to mount an adaptive and regulated response under unfavorable environmental conditions47. The findings of this study indicate that foliar application of phytohormones can induce a diverse and dynamic pattern of oxidative stress manifestation and enzymatic antioxidant responses inM. piperita. This pattern is highly variable and appears to be strongly dependent on both the type of phytohormone applied and its concentration. According to the results, ABA and MJ induced a sustained increase in H₂O₂ production and accumulation in plant cells from the final foliar application until the time of sampling, suggesting a prolonged physiological stress perception. In terms of antioxidant responses, all three phytohormones, except GA, significantly enhanced the activity levels of CAT, APX, and GPX compared to the control. Notably, this enzymatic activity increase was concentration-dependent, with a progressive and measurable rise observed up to a concentration of 0.4 mM, indicating a dose-responsive regulatory mechanism.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the application of plant hormones is closely associated with increased oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant activity in plant cells. Notable examples include the upregulation of CAT activity induced by ABA inOrthosiphon stamineusseedlings48as well as the accumulation of H₂O₂ accompanied by elevated CAT and APX activity inZea mays L.seedlings treated with ABA49. Furthermore, GA treatment has been shown to enhance CAT and APX activities inSpinacia oleracea L.seedlings50reinforcing the link between hormone signaling and antioxidant response. In addition, H₂O₂ accumulation along with increased CAT, APX, and GPX activity has been observed inRicinus communisleaves following MJ application51. Similarly, foliar application of SA and MJ has been reported to significantly elevate CAT, APX, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activity inM. piperitaseedlings33,52suggesting that such phytohormones can modulate oxidative balance through the activation of enzymatic defense pathways.

Mounting evidence from studies on the influence of elicitors in plant cell cultures suggests that oxidative stress plays a fundamental and indispensable role in the regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. These studies clearly demonstrate that oxidative stress is not merely a byproduct of elicitation, but rather an integral component of the signaling cascade that activates biosynthetic pathways. The findings indicate that effective elicitors exert at least part of their influence on stimulating secondary metabolite production through the deliberate induction of oxidative stress. Specifically, the treatment ofPapaver orientalecells with copper oxide nanoparticles resulted in increased biosynthesis and accumulation of alkaloids, accompanied by oxidative stress induction53. Similarly, the exposure ofSatureja khuzestanicacallus cultures to carbon-based nanoparticles led to enhanced accumulation of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, along with notable signs of oxidative stress54. Furthermore, the application of fungal elicitors toTaxus chinensiscell cultures stimulated taxol biosynthesis while simultaneously triggering oxidative stress, indicating a concurrent activation of both defense and metabolic pathways55. To further support these findings, it is also noteworthy that several studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress elements, even in isolation and in the absence of any specific elicitor, can initiate signal transduction processes leading to the production and accumulation of secondary metabolites. For instance, exogenous application of H₂O₂ has been reported to enhance rosmarinic acid synthesis inSalvia miltiorrhizacell cultures56increase anthocyanin content inDaucus carota L.hairy root cultures57and improve the quantitative yield of key metabolites inGinkgo biloba L.leaves following H₂O₂ treatment58.

Therefore, it is evident that phytohormones, in addition to their direct influence on the expression of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites19also affect their biosynthesis and accumulation indirectly by simulating stress conditions and inducing oxidative stress. In light of these considerations, plant hormones play a critical role in regulating biological pathways, particularly those involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, through complex and diverse signaling networks. Thus, identifying these pathways, as well as their interactions and cross-talk, is essential for understanding plant cellular responses to various environmental stimuli. Furthermore, elucidating these interactions is crucial for improving the metabolic efficiency of plants, ultimately optimizing the production of valuable secondary metabolites with significant pharmaceutical and industrial applications.

Based on the findings of this study, it is evident that gene expression, as the examined variable, exhibits greater dynamism under phytohormone treatments compared to other assessed factors. The results indicate that the phytohormones MJ and SA, followed by GA, have a more prominent role in inducing the expression of regulatory and biosynthetic genes involved in menthol biosynthesis (MhMYB1,MhMYB2,PR, andMDH) compared to ABA. This suggests that MJ and SA are particularly effective in enhancing the transcription of these genes, while GA also plays a significant role in this process. In contrast, ABA treatment was found to be significantly more effective in enhancing the accumulation of transcripts from theMFSgene, which encodes the key enzyme responsible for menthofuran biosynthesis.

Although research on the simultaneous application of multiple phytohormonal elicitors to induce secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, particularly the menthol biosynthetic pathway, is limited, several studies have reported transcriptional changes in key genes involved in menthol biosynthesis following specific phytohormone treatments. Specifically, treatments with SA and MJ have been associated with the upregulation of thePRandMDHgenes, while theMFSgene, which encodes the key enzyme for menthofuran biosynthesis, is downregulated33,52,59. In contrast, GA treatment has been linked to an increase inPRexpression, whileMDHandMFSgene expressions are significantly reduced59.

In this study, the expression of two MYB family transcription factors (MhMYB1andMhMYB2), which play a regulatory role in the menthol biosynthetic pathway, was examined under various phytohormone treatments. Transcription factors serve as intermediaries, linking signal perception and transduction to the regulatory network that controls gene expression. Thus, analyzing their expression patterns provides valuable insights into the processes of signal reception, transduction, and the downstream effects of signaling, as well as the interactions among key regulatory elements involved in these processes.

MYB transcription factors play a pivotal role in sensing a wide range of upstream signals and relaying them to the gene regulatory network. Previous studies have shown that members of this transcription factor family are involved in the activation of phytohormonal signaling transduction pathways, particularly those associated with SA, ABA, GA, and MJ60–63. In addition, they contribute to plant responses to oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily through the reprogramming of stress-responsive gene expression patterns64.

The findings of this study indicate that the expression of the transcription factorsMhMYB1andMhMYB2is influenced by the applied phytohormones, the oxidative stress induced by these treatments, or a synergistic effect of both phytohormonal signaling and ROS-related stress. This regulatory influence appears to positively modulate downstream genes, as the upregulation ofMhMYB1andMhMYB2was accompanied by increased expression ofMDHandPR, two key genes in the menthol biosynthetic pathway. These observations highlight a strong positive correlation between the expression levels of the MYB transcription factors and the target genesMDHandPR, suggesting a potential transcriptional control mechanism (Fig.8).

Analysis of essential oil composition in phytohormone-treated samples revealed that MJ elicited the most substantial increase in the accumulation of menthol and menthone, suggesting its strong stimulatory effect on the corresponding biosynthetic pathways. SA also promoted the production of these metabolites, though its impact was comparatively moderate. In contrast, GA treatment did not result in any significant changes in the levels of either compound. Notably, ABA exhibited a divergent effect, as its highest concentration was associated with a marked reduction in both menthol and menthone content.

The enhanced biosynthesis of menthol and menthone appears to be closely associated with the upregulation of transcription factors MhMYB1 and MhMYB2, along with increased expression of the genes encoding PR and MDH enzymes. Correlation analysis reinforces this association, demonstrating a strong positive relationship between the accumulation of these monoterpenes and the transcriptional activity of the aforementioned genes (Fig.8). Interestingly, treatment with MJ and SA at their highest concentrations resulted in a significant decrease in menthofuran levels. This observation suggests a possible metabolic redirection within the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway, favoring menthol and menthone production. It is likely that the precursor pulegone, which is also a substrate for PR, is preferentially channeled toward menthol and menthone synthesis under these conditions, thereby limiting its conversion into menthofuran.

Among the analyzed monoterpenes, pulegone displayed the least quantitative variation across different phytohormonal treatments. Within the menthol biosynthetic pathway, pulegone serves a dual role as both a biosynthetic intermediate and a product, being synthesized by the iPI enzyme and subsequently converted into downstream metabolites by the PR enzyme. The observed stability in pulegone levels can be attributed to a dynamic equilibrium between its production and consumption, which likely maintains its relatively constant concentration despite external elicitor stimuli.

Changes in both the quantitative and qualitative profiles of essential oils in peppermint have been reported in several previous studies under the influence of phytohormonal elicitors. These studies emphasize that foliar spraying of MJ within the concentration range of 0.1 to 2 mM leads to a substantial increase in menthol and menthone levels, while concurrently decreasing the amount of menthofuran34,65. Additional reports confirm the stimulatory role of MJ in enhancing menthol accumulation66,67and boosting the biosynthesis of menthone68. Likewise, SA has shown comparable effects, where effective concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mM have been linked with elevated menthol and menthone levels, along with a noticeable reduction in menthofuran content69. Furthermore, similar trends have been observed in other studies, supporting that SA treatment promotes menthol and menthone biosynthesis while repressing menthofuran production33,70thereby reinforcing the regulatory role of these phytohormones in monoterpene metabolism. In contrast to the well-established effects of MJ and SA, studies examining the role of GA and ABA in regulating the menthol biosynthetic pathway at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels are limited. However, available evidence from a few reports indicates that foliar application of GA at concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.15 mM can result in a modest increase in menthol production in peppermint seedlings71,72. These observations imply that GA may exert a regulatory influence, although its effectiveness appears to be relatively low compared to MJ and SA. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that the elicitation efficiency of MJ can be further enhanced through synergistic combinations with other elicitors. For instance, a recent investigation demonstrated that the co-application of MJ with titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles resulted in significantly higher menthol accumulation in peppermint compared to MJ alone73. This synergistic effect may stem from the combined action of MJ-induced transcriptional activation of biosynthetic genes and TiO₂ nanoparticle-mediated enhancement of oxidative signaling, thereby amplifying the elicitation response. Such findings underline the potential of combinatorial elicitation strategies for optimizing secondary metabolite production in medicinal and aromatic plants.

A key finding of this study is that ABA exhibited a distinct regulatory effect compared to the other three phytohormones by channeling the biosynthetic pathway toward menthofuran. This was evidenced by the upregulation of theMFSgene and the corresponding increase in menthofuran production. These results underscore the fact that phytohormonal elicitors, even when acting within the same metabolic pathway, can selectively modulate the expression of target genes and redirect metabolic flux toward the synthesis of specific secondary metabolites. Although ABA did not significantly enhance menthol biosynthesis in our study, recent evidence suggests that it plays an important regulatory role in the production of other secondary metabolites in plants. For instance, exogenous ABA application has been shown to upregulate key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and promote the accumulation of flavonoid compounds in tea plant74. Similarly, Yang et al.75reported that ABA treatment markedly increased flavonoid content inCajanus cajanL. (pigeon pea). In another study, Zhou et al.76demonstrated that ABA positively influenced the accumulation of phenolic acids inRhododendron chrysanthum. These findings indicate that while ABA may not directly stimulate the menthol biosynthetic pathway, it can positively influence other branches of secondary metabolism, particularly those involved in flavonoid and phenolic compound accumulation.

The findings of this study demonstrate that both the type and concentration of the applied phytohormone significantly affect the evaluated parameters. Higher concentrations (0.4 mM) had a more notable influence than lower concentrations (0.2 mM) on antioxidant enzyme activity, gene expression at the transcriptional level, and the biosynthesis and accumulation of monoterpenes involved in menthol production. Moreover, the specific effects of each phytohormone were clearly distinguishable. Among them, MJ and SA had the most substantial impact on the upregulation of genes involved in menthol and menthone biosynthesis, which was reflected in the increased levels of these compounds. Cluster analysis further supported this observation by grouping MJ and SA treatments together in a distinct cluster, separate from other treatments.

The results suggest that, at identical concentrations, MJ and SA had relatively similar effects and were more effective than GA and ABA in modulating the studied parameters. At a concentration of 0.4 mM, both MJ and SA showed the highest efficacy in activating the menthol biosynthetic pathway and shifting the essential oil profile toward increased production of menthol and menthone. In contrast, GA had a limited influence on oxidative stress induction, gene expression, and menthol biosynthesis at both tested concentrations. These findings indicate that, within the evaluated concentration range, GA is not a potent elicitor for redirecting the menthol biosynthetic pathway.

Although the phytohormone ABA demonstrated a significant effect on oxidative stress induction, following MJ, it clearly suppressed the expression of genes involved in menthol biosynthesis. However, in contrast, by increasing the expression of theMFSgene, it directed the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in the menthol biosynthesis pathway towards menthofuran.

In addition to phytohormonal elicitors, recent studies have demonstrated that the menthol biosynthetic pathway inMentha piperitacan also be effectively stimulated by non-phytohormonal elicitors. For instance, the application of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles has been shown to enhance the expression of key genes involved in menthol biosynthesis, suggesting a potential role for abiotic elicitors in activating this metabolic route77. Likewise, biotic elicitors such as cyanobacteria have been reported to significantly upregulate gene expression within this pathway and promote the accumulation of menthone78. These findings imply that the regulation of menthol biosynthesis is not limited to phytohormonal signaling but can also be modulated by diverse elicitor types. Focusing future research on such elicitors—particularly in exploring their synergistic interactions with phytohormones—could provide deeper insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms and offer promising strategies for optimizing menthol production in medicinal and aromatic plants.

This study provides valuable insights into the effects of four phytohormones (MJ, ABA, SA, and GA) at two concentrations (0.2 mM and 0.4 mM) on oxidative stress induction, antioxidant enzyme activity, gene expression, and the biosynthesis and accumulation of menthol and menthone inM. piperita. The results demonstrate that MJ and SA had the most pronounced effects on menthol biosynthesis, primarily by upregulating key genes (MhMYB1,MhMYB2,PR, andMDH) and enhancing menthol and menthone levels while simultaneously reducing menthofuran accumulation. These findings suggest that, particularly at 0.4 mM, MJ and SA effectively redirect metabolic flux toward menthol and menthone production. In contrast, ABA exhibited a distinct regulatory role by promoting menthofuran biosynthesis through upregulation of theMFSgene. Meanwhile, GA showed a comparatively lower influence on oxidative stress responses, gene expression, and monoterpene biosynthesis, indicating a limited role in modulating the menthol biosynthetic pathway under the tested conditions. Overall, this study highlights the complex and diverse regulatory roles of phytohormones in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The differential effects of these elicitors underscore their potential utility in optimizing the production of valuable phytochemicals inM. piperita. Further research is warranted to explore the synergistic effects of combined phytohormone treatments and to assess their long-term influence on metabolic pathways. Additionally, investigating a broader range of concentrations may offer deeper insights into the regulation of biosynthetic processes. These findings lay a foundation for future biotechnological interventions aimed at enhancing the yield of medicinally important.
