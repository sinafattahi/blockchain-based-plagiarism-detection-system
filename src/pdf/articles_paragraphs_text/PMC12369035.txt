The Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system in Japan provides a framework for assessing dementia-related functional decline, enabling the development of predictive models based on daily functional independence. This study aimed to develop and validate risk prediction models for dementia-related functional impairments using data from the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia Cohort Study (IRIDE-CS), integrating multiple cohort studies conducted in urban Japan.

Data, including participant characteristics and dementia-related functional impairments, were collected from 3678 participants in the IRIDE-CS aged 65 and older. These data were separated into a derivation set (n= 2764) and a validation set (n= 914) for model development and validation, based on the independent cohorts that constitute the IRIDE-CS. Dementia-related functional impairments was defined as the first certification of cognitive impairment at Level I or higher in the LTCI system, with follow-up from April 2018 to August 2023. Two models were developed: Model 1, focused on dementia-related functional impairments factors in Japan, whereas Model 2, prioritized social implementation by limiting predictors to self-reportable items. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index).

During follow-up, dementia-related functional impairments occurred in 16.9% of the derivation set and 16.3% of the validation set. Model 1, which included eight predictors (age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, exercise habits, gait speed, grip strength, and albumin), achieved a C-index of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73–0.77) in the derivation dataset and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.82) in the validation dataset. Model 2, which included six predictors (age, history of stroke, history of heart disease, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits), achieved a C-index of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70–0.75) in the derivation dataset and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73–0.81) in the validation dataset.

We developed and validated two predictive models for assessing the risk of dementia-related functional impairments using cohort data from urban Japan, demonstrating comparable performance to existing models. Further studies are needed to assess the applicability of these models in non-urban areas and middle-aged populations to enhance generalizability.

Estimates in 2019 revealed that approximately 57 million older adults worldwide were living with dementia; this number is projected to rise to approximately 152 million by 2050 [1]. The global cost of dementia was 1.3 trillion USD in 2019, with current projections estimating an increase to 2.8 trillion USD by 2030, caused predominantly by increasing caregiving costs [2]. Therefore, the importance of preventive efforts to delay the onset of dementia, as a key strategy in dementia countermeasures, has recently been highlighted. Identifying individuals at high risk of dementia would enable more efficient implementation of currently available preventive measures.

A substantial body of research has identified factors associated with the onset of dementia, including sex [3,4], years of education [5], living alone [6], and a medical history of specific conditions, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and heart failure [7–11]. Physical characteristics, such as low body mass index (BMI) [12,13], slow gait speed [14,15], reduced grip strength [14,16], and fewer remaining teeth [17,18], have also been identified as important contributing factors. Furthermore, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is associated with a reduced risk of dementia [19].

Predictive models have been developed to assess the future risk of dementia based on individual risk factors. Representative models include the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) [20], which predicts the risk of developing dementia approximately 20 years later using midlife vascular risk factors such as age, years of education, sex, blood pressure, BMI, total cholesterol levels, physical activity, and smoking habits. Another example is the Australian National University Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) [21], which is based on self-reported data, incorporating 11 risk factors (e.g., age, sex, low educational attainment, diabetes, traumatic brain injury, depressive symptoms, smoking, and limited social networks) and four protective factors (cognitive stimulation activities, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and fish intake). Additionally, the Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA) emphasizes modifiable midlife risk factors, including depression, hypertension, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, physical inactivity, coronary artery disease, alcohol consumption, and kidney disease [22]. Although slight differences are observed in the factors included in these risk assessment models, many share a common focus on vascular health indicators, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes; physical factors such as BMI; and lifestyle-related factors including physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

Assessing future dementia risk may facilitate early preventive interventions against dementia onset. However, research on predictive models for dementia risk remains insufficient in the Asian region, and further investigation is needed to determine whether the variables used in existing models contribute similarly to prediction across different cultural backgrounds. Additionally, developing predictive models that consider not only the risk of dementia onset but also the degree of independence in daily life may contribute to more practical and early-stage dementia prevention strategies.

Japan’s Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system supports older adults with daily functional impairments [23]. This system assesses the level of care required, including evaluations of functional impairments and dementia severity, for older adults who have received care certification (see Methods for details). Developing a model to predict dementia-related functional impairments enables the early identification of high-risk individuals in community and clinical settings. Such predictions may also provide valuable feedback to encourage behavioral changes that reduce the risk of functional decline and delay the need for long-term care. In this context, this study aimed to develop predictive models for the risk of dementia-related functional impairments using data from multiple cohort studies conducted in urban areas of Japan. To achieve this, two models were constructed: Model 1, which focuses on identifying factors associated with dementia-related functional impairments in Japan, and Model 2, which prioritizes social implementation by limiting predictors to items that can be self-reported by older adults.

This study used data from the Integrated Research Initiative for Living Well with Dementia Cohort Study (IRIDE-CS), an integrated cohort encompassing data from five community-dwelling older adult cohorts in Japan (Otassha study 2011, Otassha study 2017, Otassha study 2019, Takashimadaira study, Septuagenarians, Octogenarians, Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians [SONIC] study, Hatoyama study, and Kusatsu study), primarily located in the Tokyo metropolitan area and its surrounding regions (see [24] for details). Although each cohort conducts periodic follow-up surveys, IRIDE-CS integrates data from participants'initial enrollment. The most recent total sample size is 8180 individuals (Otassha study 2011:n= 1213 [data provision for the IRIDE-CS: 2015–2018]; Otassha study 2017:n= 1363 [2017–2018]; Otassha study 2019:n= 850 [2019–2020]; Takashimadaira study:n= 2053 [2016]; SONIC study:n= 567 [2011–2013]; Hatoyama study:n= 742 [2010]; and Kusatsu study:n= 1392 [2010–2019]). Written and verbal explanations were given to participants in each cohort, and consent was obtained. The aim of the IRIDE-CS, a combined cohort for secondary analysis, was announced on a dedicated website, and participants were allowed to opt out.

For this analysis, we included cohorts in Itabashi City, Tokyo, where long-term care certification data (as described later) were available. Itabashi City, with a population of approximately 590,000, is an urban area and the seventh most populous among Tokyo's 62 wards, towns, and villages. This study used data from the Otassha study 2011, the Otassha study 2017, the Otassha study 2019, and the Takashimadaira Study within IRIDE-CS, which were surveyed between 2015 and 2020.

The LTCI system is designed to support individuals requiring care to lead independent lives, thereby reducing the burden on family caregivers [25]. As one of Japan’s national insurance systems, the LTCI is available to all individuals aged 65 and older who require care. Applicants must apply for LTCI services with their local municipal government, after which a care manager assesses their level of care needs. The municipality subsequently grants a care certification based on this assessment. Care certification is classified into seven levels, reflecting the degree of support required: Support Levels 1 and 2, and Care Levels 1 to 5. These levels range from a minimal level of assistance (Support Level 1) to a stage requiring constant care for all activities of daily living (Care Level 5).

The LTCI system evaluates the level of care certification and the grade of cognitive disability, which reflects the degree of independence in daily life. The levels include"Independent"as well as the following classifications: Level I (having some degree of dementia but being almost independent in daily life, at home and socially), Level IIa/IIb (experiencing some symptoms, behaviors, or communication difficulties that interfere with daily life but maintaining independence with supervision), Level IIIa/IIIb (exhibiting symptoms, behaviors, or communication difficulties that interfere with daily life and requiring care), Level IV (frequently experiencing symptoms, behaviors, or communication difficulties that interfere with daily life and requiring constant care), and Level M (requiring specialized medical care owing to severe psychiatric symptoms, behavioral problems, or serious physical illness).

In this study, dementia-related functional impairments were defined as daily functional impairments attributable to cognitive impairment, as recognized in the long-term care certification process. To identify earlier stages of dementia-related functional impairments, we defined the impairments as the first time an individual was certified at Level I or higher in the cognitive disability grading system, which has been reported to have a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 93% for detecting dementia diagnosed by neuropsychiatrists [26]. This grading system reflects the degree of daily functional independence in older adults with dementia symptoms and can therefore be considered a proxy indicator of dementia-related disability. Its focus on cognitive symptoms helps minimize the inclusion of functional impairments caused by other conditions.　The long-term care certification data from Itabashi City, Tokyo, were available from April 2018 to August 2023. Therefore, for data before April 2018, we verified through subsequent follow-up surveys of each cohort that participants had no history of dementia and were not taking dementia medication. This helped confirm, as much as possible, that dementia onset had not occurred before the certification period.

Survival time was defined as the number of days from participation in the health survey to the development of an event (dementia-related functional impairments) or censoring, including cases of relocation, death, or other reasons. Participants were censored at events such as death or relocation if these occurred during the follow-up period. The follow-up period in the data used in this study ranged from a minimum of 371 days to a maximum of 2870 days.

The following variables were selected as candidate variables for Model 1: age; sex (men/women); living arrangement (living alone/not living alone); years of education; BMI; visual and hearing impairments in daily life (impaired/not impaired); history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, stroke, or heart disease (yes/no); the presence of exercise habits at least once a week (yes/no); frequency of outings (0–2 days/week, 3–6 days/week, every day); drinking and smoking habits (current/withdrawal/never); physical function indicators (grip strength, gait speed, body fat mass, fat-free mass, skeletal muscle mass index [SMI] Mean arterial pressure [MAP], and number of teeth); and blood biomarkers (hemoglobin, albumin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). These variables were chosen from the predictors of dementia-related functional impairments that could be integrated into the IRIDE-CS dataset. Information on medical history (e.g., hypertension, stroke, diabetes), visual and hearing impairments in daily life, lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol habits), exercise habits, and outing frequency was collected through self-administered questionnaires in each cohort. Visual and hearing impairments were assessed based on participants’ usual sensory function, including the use of corrective devices such as eyeglasses and hearing aids. For vision, participants who reported either (1) almost no ability to see or (2) the ability to recognize a person’s face at approximately 1 m but not to read were categorized as having visual impairment. For hearing, participants who reported either (1) almost no ability to hear or (2) difficulty engaging in conversation unless others spoke loudly were categorized as having hearing impairment. Exercise habits were assessed by asking participants whether they engaged in physical activities, including exercise or walking, on a regular basis. Participants who reported engaging in such activities at least once per week on a regular basis were classified as having exercise habits. Outing frequency was assessed by asking how often participants usually went out for purposes such as work, shopping, walking, or visiting healthcare facilities.

Among these variables, some continuous variables were categorized based on previous studies [18,24,27], including years of education (> 12 years, 10–12 years, 0–9 years), BMI (< 18.5, 18.5–24.9, ≥ 25.0 kg/m2), number of teeth (≤ 20 teeth, > 20 teeth), gait speed (< 1 m/s, ≥ 1 m/s), and grip strength (Low: < 18 kg for women, < 28 kg for men; Not Low: ≥ 18 kg for women, ≥ 28 kg for men). MAP was calculated as 0.42 × systolic blood pressure + 0.58 × diastolic blood pressure [28,29].

Additionally, among the variables mentioned above, age, sex, years of education, living arrangement, BMI (which can be calculated from self-reported height and weight), presence of visual and hearing impairments in daily life, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, stroke, or heart disease, drinking and smoking habits, exercise habits, and frequency of outings were considered suitable for self-report as single-item measures. Therefore, these variables were selected as candidate variables for Model 2.

In this study, the following criteria were sequentially applied to exclude participants. First, participants who could not be matched to long-term care certification data were excluded (n= 366). Next, participants with insufficient information on the determination of their need for nursing care and the date of change were excluded (n= 5). Then, participants who had already experienced the event (onset of dementia) at the time of entry into the cohort study were excluded (n= 67). After that, participants with a history of dementia or prior use of anti-dementia medication between the time of participation in the cohort studies and the start of LTCI data collection, or those for whom such information was uncertain (verified through follow-up data from each cohort), were excluded (n= 162). Furthermore, participants who experienced dementia-related functional impairments or whose follow-up was interrupted owing to relocation, death, or other reasons within one year of the cohort study were excluded (n= 106). Finally, participants with missing data on variables used in the analysis were excluded (n= 1095). After applying these exclusion criteria, data from 3678 participants were included in the analysis, accounting for 67% of the four cohorts'dataset. The breakdown of participants by cohort was as follows: Otassha study 2011 (n= 914), Otassha study 2017 (n= 1217), Otassha study 2019 (n= 617), and Takashimadaira study (n= 930) (Fig.1).

A Cox proportional hazards model was estimated to predict survival time from study initiation to event occurrence, based on the features of the candidate variables. To evaluate the model’s generalization performance, the dataset was categorized into derivation and validation datasets. The derivation dataset included data from the Takashimadaira study, the Otassha study 2017, and the Otassha study 2019, whereas the validation dataset included data from the Otassha study 2011. The Otassha study 2011 was selected as the validation dataset because it included participants aged 65 to 84 years, representing a broader and more diverse age range compared to the other cohorts (see [24] for details on each cohort). We considered this cohort appropriate for evaluating the generalizability of the model under conditions approximating external validation. The model was developed using the derivation dataset, and its generalization performance was assessed by comparing the predicted and observed survival times in the validation dataset (details provided below). For Model 1 and Model 2, dimensionality reduction was applied using a stepwise selection method (forward and backward) based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to identify effective features for estimation. The final parsimonious model was evaluated for its performance on the validation dataset. The proportional hazards assumption of the final parsimonious model was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. If a violation of the proportional hazards assumption was detected, the following adjustments were made: categorical variables that violated the assumption were stratified, whereas quantitative variables were transformed into nonlinear terms using penalized smoothing splines.

To compare the predictive accuracy of Model 1 and Model 2, each model’s concordance index (C-index) was calculated using the derivation dataset. The C-index was used to measure the sensitivity and specificity of variables in the model, where values of 1.00 and 0.50 indicate perfect prediction and prediction no better than random chance, respectively [30]. Although no definitive threshold has been established for the C-index, reference values from existing dementia risk prediction models indicate that CAIDE reported a C-index of 0.60 for predicting dementia onset in older adults aged 65 and above, whereas ANU-ADRI reported a C-index of 0.74 [31]. To further assess the discriminatory capacity of each model in a clinically interpretable manner, individual risk scores were calculated from the linear predictors of the Cox model. Participants were then categorized into quartile groups (Q1–Q4) based on these scores. A separate Cox proportional hazards model was subsequently fitted using the quartile groups as categorical predictors, with Q1 (lowest risk) as the reference group. Hazard ratios for Q2 to Q4 were estimated to quantify the gradient of risk for dementia-related functional impairments across quartiles.

All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.2 [32]. The survival package [33,34] was used for Cox proportional hazards model estimation. The survcomp package [35,36] was used to calculate C-index and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using theconcordance.indexfunction based on Noether’s method, and to statistically compare C-index values between models using thecindex.compfunction. Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

In this study, we analyzed data from 3678 participants, divided into the derivation (n= 2764) and validation (n= 914) datasets. In the derivation dataset, 16.9% (n= 467) of participants developed dementia-related functional impairments during the follow-up period, with a median time to dementia-related functional impairments of 1220 days (interquartile range = 874–1710). In the validation dataset, 16.3% (n= 149) of participants developed dementia-related functional impairments, with a median time to event of 1727 days (interquartile range = 1235–2382). Table1summarizes the characteristics of participants in the derivation dataset, whereas the characteristics of participants in the validation dataset are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

In Model 1, a stepwise dimensionality reduction method identified the following predictors: age, years of education, hearing impairment, visual impairment, history of stroke, exercise habits, gait speed, grip strength, and albumin levels. Excluded variables based on AIC were sex, living arrangement, BMI, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, drinking and smoking habits, SMI, number of teeth, fat-free mass, eGFR, and hemoglobin. Among the identified predictors, years of education violated the proportional hazards assumption (Supplementary Table 2) and was stratified accordingly. Significant predictors included age (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.12–1.16), visual impairment (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.08–2.51), hearing impairment (HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.00–1.83), exercise habits (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05–1.74), gait speed (HR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.41–2.27), and grip strength (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.31–1.98) (Table2).

In Model 2, stepwise selection identified age, years of education, history of stroke, history of heart disease, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits as predictors (Table2). Similar to Model 1, excluded variables based on AIC were sex, living arrangement, BMI, history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, drinking and smoking habits, and frequency of going outdoors. As in Model 1, years of education violated the proportional hazards assumption (Supplementary Table 2) and was stratified. Statistically significant predictors were age (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.14–1.18), history of stroke (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04–1.94), visual impairment (HR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.29–2.98), hearing impairment (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.11–2.02), and exercise habits (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.18–1.94).

To assess the predictive performance of the two developed models, we calculated their C-index values using both the derivation and validation datasets (Table3). In the derivation dataset, Model 1 demonstrated significantly better performance than Model 2 (C-index = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.73–0.77 vs. C-index = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.70–0.75,p< 0.001). In contrast, when evaluated using the validation dataset, the difference between the two models was not significant (C-index = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74–0.82 vs. C-index = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.73–0.81,p= 0.118).

Figure2presents cumulative incidence curves by risk score quartiles (Q1–Q4), illustrating a progressive increase in the risk of dementia-related functional impairments over time across the quartiles. For Model 1, the hazard ratios for Q2 to Q4 were 2.44 (95% CI: 1.58–3.75,p< 0.001), 5.32 (95% CI: 3.56–7.97,p< 0.001), and 11.72 (95% CI: 7.95–17.28,p< 0.001), respectively. Similarly, for Model 2, the hazard ratios for Q2 to Q4 were 2.15 (95% CI: 1.47–3.14,p< 0.001), 4.03 (95% CI: 2.81–5.77,p< 0.001), and 8.63 (95% CI: 6.15–12.11,p< 0.001), respectively.

In this study, we developed predictive models for the onset of functional impairments related to dementia using data from multiple cohort studies conducted in urban areas of Japan. Model 1 incorporated a wide range of physiological and physical indicators, focusing on identifying factors associated with dementia-related functional impairments in Japan. Model 2 was designed to prioritize social implementation by limiting variables to self-assessable items.

In Model 1, eight variables were identified as predictors: age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, exercise habits, gait speed, grip strength, and albumin levels. In Model 2, six variables were identified as predictors of dementia dementia-related functional impairments: age, history of stroke, history of heart disease, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits. Although both models shared many common variables, Model 1 demonstrated higher predictive performance than Model 2. This may be attributed to the inclusion of gait speed, grip strength, and albumin levels, which are indicators of physical function and blood biomarkers. The variables age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits, which were selected in both models, have been reported in previous studies as being associated with dementia risk, reinforcing the validity of our model selection. In particular, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits align with the Lancet Commission’s proposed modifiable risk factors, reaffirming their importance [37].

Risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes, which were included in ANU-ADRI and LIBRA, were not incorporated into the predictive models in the present study. These variables are linked to stroke history [38–40] and may have been indirectly reflected through cerebrovascular risk factors. In the validation dataset, the C-index values were 0.77 for Model 1 and 0.78 for Model 2. The ANU-ADRI model has been reported to have a C-index of 0.74 [31] for cohorts aged 65 and older, suggesting that our model demonstrates a predictive accuracy comparable to previously developed risk models for older adults aged 65 and above. Furthermore, in both models, when participants were stratified into quartiles based on their estimated risk scores, the hazard ratios increased progressively across quartiles, with the highest-risk group (Q4) exhibiting a markedly elevated risk compared to the lowest-risk group (Q1). These clear gradients in hazard across quartiles support the predictive validity of both models in identifying individuals at higher risk for dementia-related functional impairments.

In both models of this study, sex was not selected as a predictor. A notable characteristic of the derivation dataset is that, despite previous studies indicating a higher risk of dementia onset in women, the incidence of daily functional impairments associated with dementia was higher in men. This study did not limit its scope to specific underlying diseases but also focused on cognitive impairment's impact on daily functional abilities. As a result, the dataset may have included a higher proportion of cases of vascular dementia, which is known to have a pronounced impact on daily life. Vascular dementia is reported to be more prevalent in men [4], which may explain the higher incidence of dementia among men in our study. Furthermore, the exclusion of sex as a significant predictor in the models may be attributed to the imbalance in sample size between sexes and/or the emphasis on daily functional impairments.

Considering its applicability in public health settings, Model 2 developed in this study has the potential to be implemented as a self-assessment tool that allows individuals concerned about cognitive decline to estimate their future risk of dementia-related functional impairments, as all its variables are limited to self-reportable measures. However, directly applying the hazard ratio coefficients from the model for risk prediction requires complex calculations. Therefore, instead of being used as a paper-based checklist, it would be more practical to integrate the model into a computer-based system capable of automatically calculating risk scores. As of 2023, approximately 70% of Japanese households with adults aged 65 and older own a smartphone [41]. Given this trend, developing a web-based application could enhance accessibility and facilitate its widespread adoption as a self-assessment tool for community-dwelling older adults to evaluate their dementia-related functional impairments risk more easily.

This study has several limitations. The dataset used in this study was constructed based on data from older adults residing in urban areas of Japan, where living environments, including transportation options, housing conditions, and social support systems, are relatively uniform. This study defined an outcome that considers the impact of cognitive impairment on daily life, making the dataset suitable for this purpose. Additionally, considering that approximately half of Japan’s older adult population resides in prefectures classified as major urban areas [42], this model can be considered relatively representative of the Japanese older population. However, as living environments in non-urban areas differ significantly, careful consideration is required when generalizing this model. To address this limitation, future research should examine the applicability of this model in predicting dementia-related functional impairments in non-urban areas, where cognitive impairment risk factors may differ. Furthermore, this study focused on older adults aged 65 and older, and its applicability to middle-aged populations (under 65) has not been examined. Since the impact of aging-related risk factors may vary across age groups, future research should assess this model’s applicability to middle-aged populations and evaluate its generalizability. Another limitation is that detailed information on the severity of underlying diseases (e.g., stroke, heart disease) was not available. These variables were incorporated into the model only as binary self-reported items indicating the presence or absence of each condition. Although this approach allows for simple and scalable data collection in population-based studies, it may limit the model’s capacity to capture variations in risk associated with disease severity. Finally, the sex distribution in the derivation dataset was imbalanced, with a higher proportion of women. Although sex was not selected as a significant predictor in the final models, this imbalance may have influenced the process of variable selection and risk estimation. Therefore, the sex disparity in the analytic sample should be considered a limitation, and future studies should aim for a more balanced representation to examine potential sex-specific risk patterns.

In this study, we developed and evaluated two predictive models for assessing the risk of dementia-related functional decline using data from multiple cohort studies conducted in urban areas of Japan, demonstrating predictive performance comparable to existing models. Model 1 incorporated a broad range of physiological and physical indicators to identify factors associated with dementia-related functional impairments, whereas Model 2 prioritized social implementation by limiting variables to self-assessable items. The common predictors selected in both models—age, history of stroke, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and exercise habits—have also been reported in previous studies as dementia risk factors, supporting the validity of our model selection. Implementing these models as web applications or digital tools to visualize risk could contribute to dementia prevention among community-dwelling older adults. Further research is needed to evaluate the applicability of these models in non-urban areas and among middle-aged populations.
