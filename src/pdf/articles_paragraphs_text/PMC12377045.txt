Flavonoids refer to a large class of secondary metabolites with a unique skeleton comprising two aromatic rings linked together by a C3unit. This class of compounds is largely distributed in plants and rarely occurs in fungi. Some of these compounds are directly bonded to prenyl units. Prenyl groups are C-5 carbon units derived from the mevalonate pathway, are reported to substantially improve the biological activities of diverse classes of secondary metabolites. Prenylated flavonoids display a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic and antiviral activities. Some flavonoids have already been formulated as either medicines or dietary supplements and are currently used in the management of certain medical conditions. The continuous search for bioactive molecules is a global concern; and encapsulating the contribution of each continent and/or country in terms of available resources should be a priority. This paper aims to methodically summarize the bioactive prenylated flavonoids characterized from plants of the genusErythrinagrowing in Africa, as well as their distribution in the genus. Approximately 289 prenylated flavonoids have been isolated and characterized exclusively from plants belonging to the genusErythrinagrowing in Africa, covering all the subclasses of flavonoids bearing prenyl group(s), namely, flavanones, flavones, chalcones, isoflavanones, isoflavones, isoflavans, isoflav-3-enes, pterocarpans and pterocarpenes isolated from 1981 to date. This review encompasses the data gathered from 202 peer-reviewed articles and covers the source, isolation, distribution ofErythrinaplant species throughout the continent, structure elucidation of prenyl moieties, biological activities as well as thein silicotests where available towards some targets in drug discovery.

This paper provides a systematic overview of the bioactive prenylated flavonoids isolated from African species of the genus Erythrina, along with their distribution within the genus.

The search for new hits and leads from any source of secondary metabolites, including plants, fungi, and bacteria, has been a focus of interest for chemists and pharmacists over the last few decades.1–5There is a continuous need to discover novel and more effective active principles, particularly during the emergence of new diseases and infections. This includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the drug resistant phenomena, as well as the existence of diseases without known or effective treatments, such as HIV-AIDS and many forms of cancer.

Natural products such as flavonoids are of paramount importance in drug discovery. Prenylated flavonoids are synthesized by plants as a response to microbial attacks.6Interestingly, these natural compounds are reported to exhibit improved biological activities compared to the original skeleton without the prenyl groups.7The increase in biological activities of prenylated flavonoids is generally ascribed to the increase of their lipophilicity due to the presence of prenyl moieties.7The penetration of prenylated flavonoids into cells is facilitated due to the fact that the cell membrane of microbes is phospholipidic.

While several African species of theErythrinagenus have been extensively investigated, and have resulted in reports of a number of prenylated flavonoids,8,9there is no available report documenting the significance of prenylated flavonoids in these African plant species from theErythrinagenus, or their distribution within the genus in Africa. There have been two review articles world-wide on non-alkaloidic compounds of the genusErythrina, published in 2005 (ref.10) and 2018.11Further, there is one review article, published in 2021, summarizing all isolated flavonoids in general from any investigatedErythrinaspecies,12while a recent review in 2023 (ref.13) reports on prenylated flavonoids from numerous plants, however, this only mentioned 10 species ofErythrina, while about forty species throughout the world have been already studied for their content in prenylated flavonoids.

The aim of this review is to methodically summarize the bioactive prenylated flavonoids isolated during the period 1981 to 2024 from plants of the genusErythrinagrowing in Africa, by providing their source, isolation, distribution, structure elucidation and biological activities, as well as their drug target analysis.

Pterocarpan subclass possesses a specific prenyltransferase which shares 50% of significant similarity with SfN8DTs. The gene has been identified previously in soybeans and was given the name GmG4DT,29–31or more specifically GmPT20.32It attaches DMAPP at C-8 of the native pterocarpan substrate, glycinol and the reaction is catalyzed by G4DT, while GmPT20 encodes for the prenylation on C-6 catalyzed by G2DT. Further cyclization reactions in these prenylated pterocarpan are catalyzed by glyceollin synthase (GS) or P450 cyclase.30The enzyme SfG6DT inserts a prenyl group in genistein on carbon 6 and LaPT1 prenylate the B-rings in isoflavone such as genistein and 2′-hydroxygenistein. The chalcone-specific prenyltransferase SfiLDT has been shown to prenylate isoliquiritigenin.6The prenyltransferase GuA6DT identified fromGlycyrrhiza uralensisspecifically introduces a prenyl group at position 6 of flavones; further studies by these authors showed no prenylated derivative in flavonol and flavone, with no hydroxyl groups at C-5 and C-7 or methoxyl group at C-7.Fig. 3shows the biosynthetic routes of prenylations.

The flavonoids diosmin and hesperidin were isolated fromAgathosma betulina, a South African plant and are also found inCitrus reticulataandHyssopus officinalis.16These flavonoids are used in the management of cholera, prostatitis, fever and many other conditions.48These two molecules are active principles of the medicine sold under the name Diosmin Hesperidin® to treat pain and bleeding of haemorrhoids, chronic venous disease and chronic lymphedema. They are also sold as multivitamins and characterized by their high bioavailability.14–16Some of the previous active ingredients from plants are summarized inFig. 4.

The genusErythrinahas been investigated for prenylated flavonoid since 1981 and these investigations are still ongoing. Prenylated flavonoids represent one of the major classes of secondary metabolites emanated from those studies. As mentioned above, a number of prenylated flavonoids have been studied for their health benefits, and these studies resulted in the formulation of several drugs marketed as dietary supplements. Therefore, summarizing previous studies on the prenylated flavonoids content ofErythrinaplants is of paramount importance. No report had focussed on this subclass of secondary metabolites before from the speciesErythrina. The intention of this work is to attract the attention of pharmacists/pharmaceutics scientists onErythrinaprenylated flavonoids distributed in Africa.

A total of twenty plant species of theErythrinagenus were collected and investigated within African countries (Table 1). It emerges fromTable 1that most chemical studies conducted on theErythrinaspecies have been in Cameroon, followed by Nigeria, Kenya and Botswana.

Maceration appears to have been largely used as an extraction method for the plants reported in this review. Several solvents such as MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc, Acetone, CHCl3,and CH2Cl2were used. While generally a single solvent was used, some authors combined two solvents to perform their extraction. The commonly used combinations were CH2Cl2: MeOH (1 : 1), and CHCl3: MeOH (1 : 1), EtOH : H2O (2 : 1). With regards to the studied plant parts, mostly stem barks were investigated (Fig. 5).

The description follows a specific trend, ranging from prenylated flavanones, flavones, chalcones, isoflavanones, isoflavones, isoflavans, isoflav-3-enes to pterocarpans and pterocarpenes. The structures are also organised in such a way that similar structures within the same subclass are gathered together independently of the species from which they were isolated.

Prenylated flavanones have been largely isolated fromErythrinaplant species growing in Africa. They represent about 31% of compounds reported herein. The roots ofE. abyssinicawere extracted with MeOH, and chemical investigation of the extract led to the isolation of five flavanones, abyssinone I (1), abyssinone II (2), abyssinone III (3), abyssinone IV (4), and abyssinone V (5).113Three flavanones, namely, sigmoidin A–C (6–8) were obtained from the chloroform extract ofE. sigmoideastem bark.60,64,114Further investigation on the same plant materials led to the discovery of sigmoidin D (9).61During continuous studies on the same plant, sigmoidin E (10) and sigmoidin F (11) were also isolated.62,115Sigmoidin G (12), and eriotrinol (13) were reported from the EtOAc extract ofE. sigmoideastem bark.63Unfortunately, no configuration was indicated for the stereocenter C-2, but according to Promsatthaet al.(1989), the C-ring is behind the plane due to the high coupling constant value (J= 12.0 Hz).115Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups on the heterocyclic ring possess either (R,S) or (S,R) configurations due to the value of the coupling constant reported by the authors. Another two prenylated flavanones, namely, sigmoidin L (14), and 3′-prenylnaringinin (15), were obtained from the EtOAc soluble fraction ofE. sigmoideastem bark.116The configuration of the stereocenter was deduced according to the value of the coupling constant (J= 13.6 Hz) and the minimal interactions from the chair conformations. A year later, other sigmoidin derivatives, sigmoidins M (16) and N (17), were characterized from the MeOH extract of the stem bark of the same plant.66From the stem bark MeOH extract ofE. abyssinica, four prenylated flavanones were isolated, with their structures elucidated as abyssinone V 4′-methyl ether (18), abyssinoflavanones IV (19), V (20), and VI (21)87(Fig. 6).

Erythrisenegalone (22) was isolated from the chloroform extract of the stem bark ofE. senegalensis105while a prenylated flavanone named senegalensein (23) was isolated from the CHCl3extract of the same plant.102Similarly, 3′-prenylnaringenin (24) was isolated from the chloroform extract of the stem bark ofE. eriotricha.117Ichimaru and coworkers investigated the chemical constituents of the methanol crude extract of the stem bark ofE. abyssinicaand obtained three new prenylated flavanones, namely, abyssinin I (25), II (26), and III (27).89The acetone extract of the stem bark ofE. caffraThunb was subjected to chemical studies and yielded burttinone (28).8Two prenylated flavanones,i.e., erycaffra D (29), and erycaffra F (30), were isolated from the EtOAc extract of the stem bark ofE. caffra.118From the root bark using an EtOAc extract ofE. mildbraedii, two flavanones were isolated, abyssinone IV-4′-O-methyl ether (31) and 7-hydroxy-4′-methoxy-3′-(3-hydroxy-3-methyl-trans-but-1-enyl)-5′-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)flavanone (32).51Aliet al., in 2012 reported one previously undescribed prenylated flavanone, trivially named mildbone (33), from the methanol extract ofE. mildbraediiroots.54The flavanone licoflavanone-4-O-methyl ether (34) was obtained from the EtOAc crude extract of the root bark ofE. mildbraedii.52Structures 26–34 are reported in Fig. S1 (ESI data†).

A biflavanone namedbis-sigmodiol (35) and a flavanone isobavachin (36) were isolated and characterized from the MeOH extract of the stem bark ofE. sigmoidea,119in addition to 8-prenyl-7,3′,4′-trihydroxyflavanone (37), sigmone (38) and sigmotriol (39).67Unfortunately, the structure ofbis-sigmodiol (35) was not fully characterized,119as the configuration of the stereocenter in the prenyl moieties was not determined. However, as the authors declared that the optical rotation was close to zero and used it to support the dimerization, it is possible that it might be the enantiomeric mixture of both monomers. These monomers have been isolated and characterized as brosimacutins A and B.120Erylatissin C (40) was isolated82from the stem wood ofE. latissima, extracted with the mixture CHCl3: MeOH (1 : 1).121Wanjala and Majinda investigated the CHCl3: MeOH (1 : 1) extract ofE. latissimastem bark which led to the isolation and characterization of 4′,5,7-trihydroxy-3′-methoxy-5′-prenylflavanone (41) and 4′,5,7-trihydroxy-3′,5′-diprenylflavanone (42).83Two flavanones, named abyssinoflavanone VII (43), and 5-deoxyabyssinin II (44), were obtained from the MeOH extract of the stem bark ofE. abyssinica122(Fig. 6).

From the methanol extract of the stem bark ofE. abyssinica, twelve unreported flavanones were characterized, including 2(S)-5,5′,7-trihydroxy-2′-prenyl-(2′′,2′′-dimethylpyrano)-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (45), 2(S)-5,5′,7-trihydroxy-[2′′-(5′′-hydroxy)-methylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (46), 2(S)-5,7-dihydroxy-3′-methoxy-[2′′-(5′′-hydroxy)-methylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (47), 2(S)-5,7-dihydroxy-[(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)-(2′′,2′′-dimethylpyrano)-(5′′′,6′′′:5′,6′)]-(2′′′,2′′′-dimethylpyrano)flavanone (48), 2(S)-5,7-dihydroxy-5′-prenyl-[2′′,2′′-(3′′-hydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (49), 2(S)-5,7-dihydroxy-5′-methoxy-[2′′,2′′-(3′′-hydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (50), 2(S)-5,7-dihydroxy-[2′′,2′′-(3′′,4′′-dihydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (51), 2(S)-5,7-dihydroxy-5′-prenyl-[2′′,2′′-(3′′,4′′-dihydroxy)-dimethylpyrano)]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (52), 2(S)-5,6′,7-trihydroxy-5′-prenyl-[2′′,2′′-(3′′,4′′-dihydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (53), 2(S)-5,5′,7-trihydroxy-[2′′,2′′-(4′′-chromanone)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (54), 2(S)-5′,7-dihydroxy-[2′′,2′′-(3′′-hydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (55) and 2(S)-5′,7-dihydroxy-[2′′,2′′-(3′′,4′′-dihydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (56)90(Fig. 6).

The chemical study of the methanol extract ofE. abyssinicastem bark led to the isolation and characterization of six unknown flavanones identified as (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-3′-prenyl-2′′-(4′′-hydroxyisopropyl)dihydrofurano[1′′,3′′:4′,5']flavanone (57), (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-3′-methoxy-2′′-(4′′-hydroxyisopropyl)dihydrofurano[1′′,3′′:4′,5']flavanone (58), (2S)-5,7,3′-trihydroxy-2′′-(4′′-hydroxyisopropyl)dihydrofurano[1′′,3′′:4′,5']flavanone (59), (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-3′-prenyl-3′′-hydroxy-dihydrofurano[1′′,3′′:4′,5']flavanone (60), (2S)-5,7,3′-trihydroxy-2′′-(4′′-hydroxyisopropyl)-3′′-hydroxy-hydrofurano[1′′,3′′:4′,5']flavanone (61) and (2S)-5,7,3′-trihydroxy-2′-prenyl-2′′-(4′′-hydroxyisopropyl)-3′′-hydroxy-dihydrofurano[1′′,3′′:4′,5']flavanone (62).91A total of nine prenylated flavonoids, namely, erylatissins D, E, G (63–65), dihydroabyssinin I (66), 3′4′-dihydro-3′-hydroxy-8′-methylether of sigmoidin C (67), 4′-O-methylsigmoidin B (68), abyssinoflavone IV (69) and V (70), were obtained from the crude MeOH extract ofE. latissimastem bark.84The chemical investigation of the CHCl3: MeOH (1 : 1) extract of twigs and roots ofE. abyssinicaresulted in the isolation of one unknown flavanone, abyssinone VII (71).86From the EtOAc crude extract ofE. abyssinicaroot bark, several compounds, including 7-hydroxy-2-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)phenyl]chroman-4-one (72), erythribyssin G (73) and erythribyssin I (74)123were reported.

These compounds included addisoniaflavanone I (89), II (90), and III (91) as well as 5,7-dihydroxy-5′-prenyl-[2′′,2′′-(3′′-hydroxy)-dimethylpyrano]-(5′′,6′′:3′,4′)flavanone (92)81(Fig. 6). Structures 65–75 are found in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

As this represents the third largest group of prenylated flavonoids, this section presents the different prenylated pterocarpans. The roots ofE. abyssinicawere extracted with methanol, and the study of its chemical contents revealed the isolation of erythrabyssin I, also named cristacarpin (234), erythrabyssin II (235), phaseollin (236) and phaseollidin (237).113Three new pterocarpans, erybraedins A–C (238–240) and the known isoneorautenol (241) were isolated from the ethanol extract ofE. mildbraediiroots.56Erybraedins D (242) and E (243) were reported from the MeOH extract of the stem bark ofE. eriotricha.144The continuous search of bioactive flavonoids led to the isolation of neorautenol (244).132El-Masry and coworkers reported one pterocarpan, sandwicensin (3-hydroxy-10-dimethylallyl-9-methoxypterocarpan) (245) from the ethanol extract ofE. caffra.50Compound 1-methoxyphaseollidin (246) was isolated from the CH2Cl2root extract ofE. vogelii.58A pterocarpan orientanol A (247) was discovered in the MeOH extract of the stem bark ofE. sigmoidea.119Two pterocarpans, gangetinin (248) and calopocarpin (249) were isolated from the EtOAc extract ofE. sigmoideastem bark68(Fig. 12).

Sophorapterocarpan A (258), and 6α-hydroxyphaseollidin (259) were isolated and characterized from the MeOH extract ofE. sigmoideastem barks.99Nguyen and coworkers studied the chemical composition of the MeOH extract ofE. abyssinica. They identified two new prenylated pterocarpans, erythribyssin A (260) and C (261), along with five known derivatives identified as eryvarin K (262), 3,9-dihydroxy-4-prenyl-[6aR:11 aR]pterocarpan (263), folitenol (264), erysubin E (265) and erystagallin A (266).145The stem and root bark ofE. bruceiwere extracted with CH2Cl2: MeOH (1 : 1) and further chemical investigations resulted in the isolation of eryvarin J (267), 2-prenyl-6α-hydroxyphaseollidin (268), and erycristagallin (269).94The acetone extract of the stem bark ofE. burttiiled to the isolation of 3-O-methylcalopocarpin (270).124Erybraedin F (271) was isolated from the CH2Cl2extract of the stem bark ofE. senegalensis.107The chemical structures 250–271 are reported in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

Considerable chemical studies have been conducted on the plant species ofErythrinagenus (Fabaceae) across the world. Data from previous studies lend to the theory that plants of this genus produce mainly flavonoids10–12and alkaloids.147,148Prenylated flavonoids are relatively dominant in the genus and this section discusses the occurrence of different subclasses of prenylated flavonoids already reported. Some structural differences have often been noted in compounds isolated from the same genus according to geographical location.149In ess ence, there is no difference between the skeletons of prenylated flavonoids occurring in AfricanErythrinaspecies and others worldwide. Focusing the review on AfricanErythrinais only for the purpose of collecting information regarding studies already published. Several structures reported in this review have been equally reported in species growing in Japan, Brazil and India.150–154This section therefore collates the information to support the occurrence of prenylated flavonoids within the genusErythrina. This genus belongs to the Fabaceae family. While the comparison of prenylated flavonoids occurring within theErythrinagenus across the world was not the objective of the present review, during the investigation we did notice the occurrence of isoflavonoids and pterocarpans in the species growing in Asia.150–152,155–157There is no review differentiating these compounds from species of other continents, and further reviews might focus on this. A review by Weiet al.focussed on all prenylated flavonoids in plants kingdom world-wide, but this review only mentioned ten species ofErythrinawith prenylated flavonoids.13Another review targeting therapeutic prenylated flavonoids from the Fabaceae family did not provide enough information on theErythrinagenus, particularly the species from Africa.158In the present review, the phytochemistry of twenty species ofErythrinaoccurring only in Africa is discussed. We limited our investigation only to those species of the genusErythrinain Africa.

Prenylated flavanones represent the higher percentage (31%) of prenylated flavonoids in AfricanErythrina, followed by isoflavones (28%) and pterocarpans (19%) (Fig. 13). Within these three subclasses, certain specific compounds have been isolated several times within the genus.

From this summary of prenylated flavonoids isolated and characterized from the plants of the genusErythrinait appears that abyssinone V (5), sigmoidin A (6), abyssinone V-4′-O-methyl ether (18), warangalone (141), 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149) and phaseollidin (237) can be considered to be their chemical markers. Concerning the subclass of prenylated flavanones, abyssinone V (5) and abyssinone V-4′-O-methyl ether (18) specifically have been reported from more than ten chemical studies within the genus. According to these reported data, twenty-five isoflavones have been isolated and characterized from more than oneErythrinaspecies. Warangalone/scandenone (141), alpinumisoflavone (148), 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149), erysenegalensein E (151), auriculatin (152), neobavaisoflavone (189) and 5′-prenylpratensein (200) are reported here as the chemical markers of the prenylated isoflavones in the genusErythrinagrowing in Africa. Specifically, warangalone/scandenone (141), and 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149) were characterized from ten phytochemical investigations in the genus. These isoflavones are largely distributed in the stem barks of variousErythrinaspecies. As noted from these isolations, pterocarpans represent 19% of compounds isolated from the genusErythrina, with 20 compounds identified in more than oneErythrinaspecies. It emerges from this study that erythrabyssin II (235), phaseollin (236), phaseollidin (237), erybraedin A (238), isoneorautenol (241), cristacarpin (234) and calopocarpin (249) are the chemical markers ofErythrinagenus in Africa for the prenylated pterocarpans, with phaseollidin (237) reported in eleven chemical studies. Regarding the location in erythrina plant parts, in general root bark extracts yielded pterocarpans (Table 2). Pterocarpans were mainly isolated fromE. abyssinica,E. senegalensis,E. burttiiandE. eriotricha, however, these species are distributed across Cameroon, Nigeria, Mali, Kenya and Botswana, and unfortunately this not indicate any specificity regarding their occurrence. The same analysis was deduced from flavanones and isoflavones.

Several spectroscopy methods are commonly used in the characterization of flavonoids, such as Circular Dichroism, Infrared and NMR spectroscopy.162In general, NMR spectroscopy is helpful in the identification of prenyl moieties; this is fundamentally because the characteristics of prenyl groups in UV and IR spectroscopy interfere with those of the flavonoids. The first noticeable characteristics of prenyl groups in1H NMR spectra are the chemical shifts of protons of the hydroxyl groups; these signals resonate between 5 and 8 ppm. In 2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl the configuration of the double bond is usuallytrans, as evidenced by coupling constantsJ= 16 Hz.93In chromans, furanose or any open prenyl groups containing asymmetric carbon, the wide ranges in chemical shifts could be due to the absolute configurations, but unfortunately these configurations were not all determined. Meanwhile the configuration of C-3′′ in sigmoidin D (9) was determined by using the Horeaus' method with (+) 2-phenylbutanoic anhydride, and was attributed to “S”.61In addition, the positions of these prenyl moieties relative to aromatic rings can equally affect the chemical shift values.Tables 3and4provide the chemical shift ranges characterizing some commonly occurring prenyl groups.

Abyssinone V 4′-O-methyl ether (18), 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149), alpinumisoflavone (148) and burttinone (28) were assayed for their effect on bacteria growth using the microdilution method. Results showed that 18 and 148 had significative antibacterial activity onE. coliATCC 11775 andK. pneumonia, with the same MIC value of 3.9 μg mL−1(9.24 and 11.6 μM, respectively) compared to the positive control neomycin (MIC = 1.6 μg mL−1, 2.6 μM). Alpinumisoflavone (148) equally showed the same activity againstS. aureus(neomycin MIC = 0.8 μg mL−1, 1.3 μM) whereas 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149) exhibited an activity of 7.8 μg mL−1(19.2 μM) towards the growth ofS. aureusATCC 12600,E. coli,K. pneumonia(ATCC 13883) and 15.6 againstB. subtilisATCC 6051. The positive control was in the range 0.78 to 1.6 μg mL−1.B. subtiliswas mainly affected by compound 149, only with a MIC of 7.8 μg mL−1(19.2 μM) relative to the MIC value of 1.3 μM exhibited by neomycin. Given that compound 28 was the less active (31 < MIC < 125 μg mL−1), the hydroxylation of the prenyl group at 3′ could have been more negatively affected than 148 which has no hydroxyl on its prenyl groups.8Sandwicensin (245) and 3R(−) erythbidin A (223) when evaluated for their effect onS. aureusATCC6538P both showed a MIC value of 62.5 μg mL−1(183.8 μM) (positive control not indicated).50Abyssinone VII (71), abyssinone IV (4), abyssinone V (5), phaseollidin (237), erythrabyssin II (236), sigmoidin B (7), sigmoidin C (8), sigmoidin D (9), sigmoidin F (11), 5′-prenylpratensein (200), sandwicensin (245), neobavaisoflavone (189), semilicoisoflavone B (212) and licoagrochalcone A (104) were tested against some microbes using the bioautographic agar overlay method, and all these compounds strongly inhibited the growth ofB. subtilisandS. aureuswith MIC values in the range of 0.5 to 4 μg mL−1relative to chloramphenicol (MIC = 0.001 μg mL−1). Only sigmoidin B (7) and Abyssinone VII (71) strongly affected the growth ofE. coli, with a MIC value of 5.0 μg mL−1(14.0 and 14.7 μM) (MIC = 0.05 μg mL−1or 0.05 μM for chloramphenicol). Sigmoidin C (8), abyssinone VII (71), erythrabyssin II (235), phaseollidin (237), sandwicensin (245), neobavaisoflavone (189), 5′-prenylpratensein (200) and semilicoisoflavone B (212) exhibited strong activities againstSaccharomyces cerevisiaewith MIC values of 0.5, 5.0, 2.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, and 3.0 μg mL−1, respectively (MIC = 0.005 μg mL−1for miconazole).86It has been also reported that sigmoidin L (14) inhibited the growth ofS. aureusandP. vulgariswith respective MICs of 4.0 and 7.0 μg mL−1(11.3 and 17.8 μM), however, no positive control was reported in this study.116Additionally, its congener sigmoidin M (16) exhibited significant antibacterial activity againstS. aureuswith a MIC of 4.0 μg mL−1or 10.3 μM (no positive control).66Erybraedins A–C (238–240), erythrabyssin II (235) and isoneorautenol (241) were assayed for their effect on the growth of certain bacteria, and erythrabyssin II (235) potentially inhibited the growth ofS aureusATCC 13709 andMycobacterium smegmatisATCC 607, with MIC values of 3.12 and 0.78 μg mL−1(8.8 and 2.2 μM), respectively, in comparison to tests against streptomycin with MICs of 5.0 and 1.25 μg mL−1(8.6 and 2.1 μM), respectively. Other compounds showed MICs in the range 6.25 and 25 μg mL−1against these two bacteria and none of these compounds affected the growth of,E. coliATCC 9637,Salmonella gallinarumATCC 9184,Klebsiella pneumoniaeATCC 10031,Candida albicansATCC 10231 orPseudomonas aeruginosaATCC 27853.56Erybraedin A (238), erythrabyssin II (235), erystagallin A (266) and erycristagallin (269) exhibited strong antibacterial activities against several species and strains ofStreptococcusandStaphylococcusas well as several strains of MRSA (Multi ResistantStaphylococcus aureus), with MICs ranging from 0.78 to 6.25 μg mL−1, relative to vancomycin and oxacillin (0.09 < MIC < 256 μg mL−1). These are promising results with regard to the fight against antibacterial resistance, and these compounds represent some potential antibiotics isolated from medicinal plants.167Brucein B (130) displayed moderate antibacterial activities, with MIC of 62 μg mL−1or 167.6 μM againstBacillus cereus(ATCC 33019) compared to chloramphenicol (MIC = 15 μg mL−1, 46.4 μM).94The five compounds isolated fromE. livingstonianawere evaluated for their antibacterial activity. Sigmoidin B-4′-methyl ether (68) displayed a good activity with MIC of 5.0 μg mL−1againstE. coli(DSM 1116),B. subtilis(DSM 1088), andE. coli(DSM 682). 7,3 ′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxy-5′-prenylflavanone (78) showed a MIC value of 2.0 μg mL−1or 5.4 μM againstB. subtilis(DSM 1088) in comparison to Streptomycin and gentamycin with MIC = 5.0 μg mL−1or 8.6 μM and 1.0 μg mL−1or 2.1 μM and a MIC of 5 μg mL−1or 13.5 μM against the two strains ofE. coli(streptomycin and gentamycin MIC = 1.0 μg mL−1or 1.7 and 2.1 μM).93Erythrabyssins I (234) and II (235), phaseollin (236), phaseollidin (237), abyssinone I (1), abyssinone II (2), abyssinone III (3), abyssinone IV (4), abyssinone V (5) and abyssinone VI (100) were assessed for their antimicrobial activities. Erythrabyssin I (234) and phaseollin (236) showed MICs of 12.5 and 6.25 μg mL−1, respectively, againstS. aureusandB. subtilis. Erythrabyssin II (235) exhibited strong antibacterial activity againstS. aureus,B. subtilisandMicrococcus lysodeikticuswith a MIC value of 3.13 μg mL−1, whereas abyssinone V (5) showed a MIC of 12.5 μg mL−1againstMicrococcus lysodeikticus(positive control was not reported). Regarding antifungal activity, erythrabyssin I (234) showed a MIC of 6.25 μg mL−1or 18.5 μM againstSclerotinia libertianaand phaseollin (236) displayed an activity of 12.5 μg mL−1or 31.9 μM againstSclerotinia libertiana,Mucor mucedoandRhizopus chinensis. In addition, abyssinones I (1) and II (2) exhibited a MIC of 12.5 μg mL−1(32.1 and 38.6 μM) againstSclerotinia libertiana.113Sigmoidin I (118), corylin (188), neobavaisoflavone (189) and phaseollidin (237) were assessed for their capacity to affect the growth ofCandida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans,Aspergillus fumigatusandS. aureus. Only neobavaisoflavone (189) showed a MIC of 50 μg mL−1or 156.3 μM againstC. neoformansandA. fumigatus,129and neobavaisoflavone (189) displayed a MIC of 3.2 μg mL−1or 10.0 μM againstS. aureus.132Sigmoidin A (6) inhibited the growth ofS. aureus,M. luteus(WS) andM. luteus(IPC) with MICs of 12.5, 25 and 50 μg mL−1(29.5, 59.0 and 117.9 μM); with inhibition diameter varying from 10 to 13 mm; sigmoidin B (7) only affected the growth ofS. aureuswith the same MICs.114Eriotrichin B (110), erybraedins A (238) and C (240) exhibited good antibacterial activities againstS. aureuswith MICs of 8.3, 13.6, and 12.8 μg mL−1(20.3, 42.0 and 32.8 μM), respectively, relative to a MIC = 6 μg mL−1or 18 μM for penicillin.144Abyssinone IV-4′-methylether (31) exhibited an activity of 25 μg mL−1or 63.8 μM againstS. aureus,P. stuartiiATCC 29916 andE. aerogenesATCC1 3048 relative to 8.0, 128 and 32 μg mL−1, respectively, for ciproflaxacin.125Neobavaisoflavone (189) exhibited good to moderate antibacterial activity againstE coliATCC8739 (MIC = 8.0 μg mL−1or 25.0 μM),E. coliAG100 ΔacrAB mutant AG100, with an over-expressing acrF gene (MIC = 32.0 μg mL−1or 100 μM),Enterobacter cloacaeClinical MDR isolates (MIC = 8.0 μg mL−1or 25.0 μM),Klebsiella pneumoniaClinical MDR isolate (MIC = 8 μg mL−1or 25.0 μM),Providencia stuartiiClinical MDR isolate (MIC = 8 μg mL−1or 25.0 μM) andPseudemonas aeruginosa(MIC = 8.0 μg mL−1or 25.0 μM).1684′,5,7-Trihydroxy-6-(2′′-hydroxy-3′′-prenyl)isoflavone (207) exhibited a good antimicrobial activity againstE. coli,S. aureusandCandida mycodermawith respective MICs of 10.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μg mL−1(29.8, 14.9 and 29.8 μM). 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149) inhibited the growth ofS. aureusandC.mycodermaat respective MICs of 1.0 and 5.0 μg mL−1(2.4 and 12.3 μM), erysenegalensein E (151) and isoerysenegalensein E (161) inhibited the growth ofE. coli,B. subtilisandC. mycodermaat MIC values of 10.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μg mL−1, respectively. Sandwicensin (245) showed a MIC of 10.0 μg mL−1or 31.0 μM againstE. colicomparatively to chloramphenicol and miconazole had respective MICs of 0.01 and 1.0 μg mL−1against these microorganisms.72Erysubin E (265) showed an IC50of 1.30 μM againstC. perfringens, cristacarpin (234), and erystagallin A (266) exhibited a good antibacterial activity with IC50values of 2.28 and 2.04 μM againstC. perfringens. In addition, eryvarin D (255) and erythribyssin O (275) exhibited antibacterial activity with IC50s of 2.09 and 1.32 μM, as well as 3.30 and 0.35 μM, respectively, againstC. perfringensandV. choleracomparative to quercetin (IC50= 25.34 μM).146The poor activity of phaseollin (236) could result from the cyclisation of the prenyl group relative to 255 and 275.

Mildbone (33) and mildbenone (102) demonstrated strong scavenging activity with respective IC50values of 20.2 and 28.5 μM compared to the positive control butylated hydroxyanisole (IC50= 44.2 μM).54Sigmoidin A (6) and B (7) showed DPPH scavenging activity at a dose of 100 μM. This activity was found to be better than that of the similar flavonoid (quercetin 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside) with the same hydroxyl pattern, illustrating that the prenyl group might contribute to their scavenging effect.64In addition, these two compounds were assessed for their effect in reducing superoxide anion radicals produced by rat alveolar macrophagesin vivo, and they inhibited the superoxide anion at 90% and 65% respectively for sigmoidins A (6) and B (7) at a concentration of 100 μM each. The high effect of sigmoidin A (6) might be associated with the contribution of its second prenyl group at 6'.169The isolated compounds fromE. brucei, namely, bruceins A (129) and B (130), kenusanone F (131), sophoraisoflavanone A (133), cristacarpin (234), eryvarin J (267) and erycristagallin (269) were equally evaluated for their scavenging capacity, and they showed activities with IC50values of 6.3, 13.3, 22.2, 21.2, 6.4, 1.4, and 1.1 μM relative to trolox (IC50= 0.62 μM).94Similarly, erylivingstone B (75), erylivingstone C (76), 5,7-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxy-5′-(3-methylbut-2-enyl) flavanone (77), sigmoidin B-4′-methyl ether (68) and 7,3′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxy-5′-(3-methylbut-2-enyl) flavanone (78) displayed respective IC50values of 11.9, 11.4, 21.1, 12.9 and 10.7 μM (Trolox IC50= 4.4 μM).93The lower activity of 68 is likely related to its poor number of free hydroxyl groups.

Overcoming insulin resistance is considered to be one of the major challenges for conventional anti-diabetic medication. The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) is recognized as a key element in the regulation of insulin signal transduction pathways, and is unfortunately considered to be a negative regulator of the insulin receptor pathway along with the leptin receptor pathway.183Therefore, inhibiting this enzyme will contribute to overcoming insulin resistance.

The chemical constituents ofE. addisoniae5,2′,4′-trihydroxy-6-(γ,γ-dimethylallyl)-2′′′,2′′′-dimethyldihydropyrano[5′′′,6′′′] isoflavone (121), orientanol E (122), senegalensein (23), warangalone (141), warangalone 4′-methyl ether (205) and 2,3-dihydroauriculatin (117) were assayed for their inhibitory effect on the protein PTP1B, and orientanol E (122), 2,3-dihydroauriculatin (117) and 5,2′,4′-trihydroxy-6-(γ,γ-dimethylallyl)-2′′′,2′′′-dimethyldihydropyrano[5′′′,6′′′]isoflavone (121) exhibited the activities with IC50values of 10.1, 2.6, and 4.1 μM, relative to the reference ursolic acid (IC50= 2.5 μM). In contrast, the weak activity of other compounds might be related to the double 2,3.77Compounds 45, 47, 49, 50, 53 and 54 exhibited good inhibitory effects on PTP1B with IC50values of 13.9, 14.9, 18.2, 19.0, and 18.2 μM, respectively, compared to ursolic acid (3.6 μM).90Additionally, compounds 51–2 and 40 were also assayed for their impact on the protein PTP1B. With the exception of 53 and 55 these metabolites showed dose-dependent activities, with IC50values ranging from 15.2 to 19.6 μM compared to RK-682 (IC50= 4.7 μM).91Erylysin B (251), eryvarin D (255) and erybraedin A (238) also exhibited activity, with IC50values of 6.0, 4.1, and 1.01 μM, respectively (ursolic acid IC50= 2.5 μM).70Neorautenol (244), erybreadin B (239), folitenol (264), erybreadin D (242), erysubin E (265) and erybreadin C (240) exhibited good activities against PTP1B protein with IC50values of 7.6, 4.2, 7.8, 6.4, 8.8, and 7.3 μM, respectively (ursolic acid IC50= 3.6 μM). Further investigation by Nguyenet al.in 2011 aimed to evaluate the activities of erythribyssin E (126), 5-deoxyabyssinin II (44), abyssinone III (3) 7-hydroxy-2-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)phenyl]chroman-4-one (72), abyssinone V (5), abyssinone II (2), prostratol C (128), erythribyssin G (73), erythribyssin I (74) and erythribyssin J (127) against PTP1B. Apart from erythribyssin I (74), the compounds exhibited moderate dose-dependent activities, with the IC50range of 14.9–98.1 μM (IC50= 3.6 μM for ursolic acid).123Additionally, erythraddison II (211), euchrenone b10 (174) and erysubin F (203), as well as erythraddison III and IV (124, 125) showed good inhibitory effect on PTP3B, with the IC50values ranging from 4.6–17.4 μM (ursolic acid: IC50= 3.6 μM).78Compound (3R)-2,7-dihydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-2,2-dimethylpyrano[5,6:4,5]isoflavan (224) exhibited an IC50value of 5.5 μM (ursolic acid: IC50= 3.6 μM).52Some compounds isolated fromE. mildbraediiwere evaluated for their inhibitory activity on the protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) and abyssinone IV (4), and abyssinone VI-4′-O-methyl ether (101) potentially inhibited the activity of this protein with the respective IC50values of 16 and 14.8 μM. Other compounds, abyssinone V-4′-O-methyl ether (18), abyssinone IV-4′-O-methyl ether (31), abyssinone V (5), sigmoidin E (10) and alpinumisoflavone (148) showed IC50values of 26.3, 21.2, 39.7, 39.2, and 41.5 μM, respectively, with ursolic acid used as a positive control (IC50= 3.6 μM). Regarding the activities of 4 and 101 compared to 18, 5, 10, and 148, the carbonyl in 4 and 101 could have improved the activity by chelating the hydrogen atoms in the protein.51It is worthy to note that all the chemical structures of the compounds which exhibited antidiabetic activity beared the unmodified prenyl moieties.

This review therefore encourages more biological assays on prenylated flavonoids fromErythrinaplants and other plant species. We also recommend multiplein vivostudies on the anticancer, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic activities of any prenylated flavonoids.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the pandemic COVID-19. The invasion of the host cells by the virus is facilitated by the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor located at the surface of host cells.199These receptors are expressed in various human organs.200,201A recent study conducted by Herlina and coworkers revealed that erybraedin D (242) and gangetinin (248), out of 18 flavonoids from the genusErythrina, had a better affinity with the ACE2 receptor.202These two compounds were docked against the ACE2 receptor and had respective binding affinities of −7.028 and −6.379 kcal mol−1202(Fig. 15). Therefore, these two flavonoids could play an important function in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

In conclusion, twenty species ofErythrinawere collected and investigated throughout Africa, and these studies resulted in the isolation and characterization of 289 prenylated flavonoids. A high percentage of these compounds proved to be prenylated flavanones. This is not surprising given that other subclasses of flavonoids derive from naringenin (flavanone subclass). According to the distribution, abyssinone V (5) and abyssinone V-4′-O-methyl ether (18), 6,8-diprenylgenistein (149) and phaseollidin (237) can be considered to be the chemical markers of the genusErythrinaas far as prenylated flavonoids are concerned. Pterocarpans were mainly characterized fromE. abyssinica,E. eriotricha,E. burtiiandE. senegalensis. No pterocarpan was isolated fromE. caffraorE. sigmoidea. The flavanone subclass was largely characterized fromE. caffra,E. sigmoidea,E. latissimi,E. addisoniaeandE. burtii. Finally, the subclass isoflavone was mostly isolated fromE. caffra,E. abyssinica,E. burtiiandE. senegalensis. Most of these compounds have been evaluated for their biological effects, and were found to exhibit good antibacterial, anticancer and antidiabetic activities. About 68 prenylated flavonoids summarized in this work exhibited good cytotoxic effects against numerous cancer cell lines. 46 and 44 flavonoids exhibited promising antimicrobial and antidiabetic activities. Of these compounds, 20 prenylated flavanones displayed anti-diabetic properties. As some flavonoids are already marketed as dietary supplements for bacterial infections, antioxidant effect, immune system booster, prostatitis, and many more, the prenylated flavonoids herein reported have exhibited promising biological effects and therefore could be further investigated for their pharmacological activities.

The chemical shift ranges of different prenyl groups were highlighted to assist future structure elucidation or rapid identification of prenyl moieties. However, many prenyl groups possessing stereogenic centres were not fully characterized and further research will be needed to complete their structure elucidation.
