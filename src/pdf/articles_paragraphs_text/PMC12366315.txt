Infective aortitis (IA) with vegetation formation is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication in patients with heart transplantation (HTx). IA caused byCorynebacterium striatum(C. striatum) has scarcely been reported. Herein, we present a case of IA caused by C. striatum in a young man eight months after his second orthotopic HTx.

We present a case of IA caused byC. striatumin a young man eight months after his second orthotopic HTx. The clinical course was complicated by recurrent fever, persistent bacteremia, anemia, and multiple peripheral arterial embolisms. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal cardiac valves and endocardium, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed an intraluminal mass in the anastomotic site of ascending aortic. The patient declined surgical intervention but responded well to medical therapy. He got resolution of infection following 6 weeks of vancomycin and remained well upon 34 months of follow-up without recurrent fever or new embolic events.

This case highlights the importance of evaluating the anastomotic site of ascending aortic in the context of bacteremia for HTx recipients, especially when routine TTE shows no valvular or endocardial involvement.

Infective aortitis (IA) is a rare but potentially fatal complication following heart transplantation (HTx) [1–5]. To our knowledge, IA with vegetation formation caused by Corynebacterium striatum (C. striatum) has been scarcely reported previously. This was a case of IA caused by C. striatum in a young man eight months after his second orthotopic HTx. The clinical course resembled infective endocarditis (IE), including recurrent fever, persistent bacteremia, anemia, and multiple peripheral arterial embolisms. However, conventional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed no valvular or endocardial abnormalities, while a highly mobile mass located at the anastomotic site of ascending aortic was incidentally discovered. Subsequently, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of this mass. This case highlights the importance of screening the frequently overlooked anastomotic site of ascending aortic in HTx patients presenting with signs of infection.

symptoms improved rapidly. However, ten days after admission, he reported acute pain and numbness in his right lower limb, and the right dorsalis pedis artery pulse was absent. Emergency CT angiography revealed thrombosis in the right popliteal artery and tibio-peroneal trunk, and anterior tibial artery (Fig.1A). Bedside TTE confirmed no valvular vegetations. An emergency thrombectomy was performed, removing grayish tissue measuring approximately 15 mm x 3 mm (Fig.1B). Histopathological examination confirmed thrombus formation, and tissue culture grew C. striatum.

Despite the absence of valvular or endocardial abnormalities on TTE, a clinical diagnosis of IE was made. Antibacterial therapy with vancomycin was continued, and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin was initiated. One week later, however, the patient complained of pain in the left upper quadrant. An emergency abdominal CT scan indicated partial splenic infarction (Fig.1C). Repeat TTE, utilizing the high parasternal view, incidentally revealed a highly mobile mass adherent to the anastomotic site of the ascending aortic graft (Fig.1D), measuring approximately 24 mm in length with an irregular surface. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)identified the mass at the upper esophageal level (Fig.1E), while the cardiac valves and endocardium remained clearly uninvolved. The patient declined surgical removal of the vegetation. Medical treatment with vancomycin was continued for a total of 6 weeks. He remained well during a 34-month follow-up period, with no recurrence of fever or new embolic events.

As the number of patients with advanced heart failure increases and cardiac transplant surgery advances, an increasing number of patients are receiving HTx. However, reports ofIA following HTx are scarce, yet the clinical manifestations can be diverse and life-threatening [3,4]. Our PubMed search (terms: “aortitis” AND “heart transplantation”; no date restriction) identified only 6 case reports. No large-scale studies were found, nor were there any specific reports detailing Corynebacterium striatum infection as a cause of aortitis in heart transplant recipients.

While various pathogens have been reported to cause IA in HTx recipients, including mycotic [2,4], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [3], Legionella pneumophila [1] and Pseudomonas derived from the donor [5]. IA caused by C. striatum is exceedingly rare. This is largely because C. striatum is widely distributed in the environment and is generally considered a low-virulence, opportunistic pathogen. In the present case, C. striatum was identified as the causative agent of IA based on its consistent isolation from blood and tissue cultures. This case underscores the emerging role of low-virulence organisms as pathogens in immuno-compromised HTx recipients.

The patient’s recurrent fever, persistent bacteremia, anemia, and multiple peripheral embolisms were highly suggestive of IE. The native or prosthetic cardiac valves are typically the primary sites affected in IE caused by Corynebacterium species [6], and TTE is a valuable tool for both diagnosis and exclusion diagnosis. Isolated involvement of the anastomotic site of ascending aortic in HTx patients is uncommon. Toufan and colleagues [7] reported a case of vegetation formation and IA in a patient with an aortic stent. This suggests that anastomosis in the ascending aorta may increase the risk of bacterial colonization and infection. In patients presenting with fever and suspected cardiogenic embolism, IA should be considered in the differential diagnosis alongside IE, particularly when TTE shows no valvular involvement. During TTE examination in HTx recipients, careful assessment of the anastomosis in the ascending aorta is crucial. TEE offers superior visualization of the aorta and should be employed when TTE findings are inconclusive. Furthermore, the occurrence of multiple peripheral arterial embolic events in this young patient indicates the friable nature of the aortic vegetation.

This case provides valuable insights for clinicians and sonographers who manage HTx patients. First, C. striatum, although rare, is a possible pathogen that must be considered in this vulnerable population. Second, IA should be considered when clinical features strongly mimic IE but TTE reveals no evidence of valvular or endocardial involvement. A comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation, which includes a dedicated assessment of the anastomosis in the ascending aorta, and the utilization of TEE, is essential.
