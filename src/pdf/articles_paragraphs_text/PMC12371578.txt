Screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) are an innovative technology
in
electrochemical sensors, offering advantages such as easy fabrication,
large-scale production, low cost, and potential for miniaturization.
These electrodes can be disposable and customized for various applications.
Due to these advantages, SPEs are gaining attention in fields such
as medicine and pharmacy. In this study, an electrochemical sensor
was developed through screen-printing, using new conductive ink, compounded
with carbon black, Chinese shellac, and acetone. The device was characterized
by different approaches to analyze its characteristics, including
scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, and contact angle. Also, the
electrochemical characterizations were performed by using cyclic voltammetry
and impedance spectroscopy. The sensor was employed to detect melatonin,
a sleep-regulating hormone, and, under optimized parameters, the analytical
curve by differential pulse voltammetry exhibited a linear range from
1.0 to 100 μmol L–1, with a limit of detection
of 0.1 μmol L–1. The device was applied to
synthetic urine samples using the addition and recovery method, yielding
recovery values from 86.7 to 110%. The results indicate that the conductive
ink is suitable for manufacturing printed electrodes, and the device
proved promising for melatonin detection.

As proof
of concept, melatonin was chosen for determination for
being a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, which presents physiological
functions, such as sleep regulation,−aiding in the treatment
of insomnia, and assisting with circadian rhythm disorders and mental
health.−Various techniques are used for melatonin detection,
including electrochemical methods, and are considered effective for
rapid, portable detection at relatively low costs compared to conventional
techniques. Literature includes studies
utilizing electrochemical sensors, such as the work by Lete and collaborators who developed an electrochemical sensor modified
with gold nanoparticles on printed carbon electrodes. Similarly, the
work of Gomez and collaborators developed
a sensor based on carbon nanotubes or graphene showing high sensitivity
for analysis in biological samples.

This study introduces the
development of a novel and environmentally
friendly conductive ink, formulated using Chinese shellac and carbon
black (CB), specifically engineered for the fabrication of cost-effective,
disposable screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). The resulting electrochemical
sensor was successfully employed for the sensitive and selective quantification
of melatonin in synthetic urine samples, utilizing square wave voltammetry
(SWV) as the detection technique.

The reagents were of analytical
grade or high purity, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fluka. All aqueous
solutions were prepared using ultrapure water processed through a
Millipore Milli-Q system (resistivity ≥ 18.2 MΩ cm–1). The CB powder was obtained from VULCAN XC72 carbon
black by CABOT (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), Chinese shellac/maleic
resin (Acrilex, SBC, SP), and melatonin (Alfa Aesar, Massachusetts,
USA). Electrochemical analyses were performed using a 3-electrode
system (working, pseudoreference, and auxiliary). Electrochemical
characterization was carried out using the electrochemical probe ferrocenemethanol
(FcMeOH), in 0.1 mol L–1KCl solution. A phosphate
buffer saline 0.2 mol L–1PBS at pH 7.0 was used
for melatonin determination and sensor optimization, with the salt’s
sodium hydrogen phosphate (NaHPO4·7H2O)
and monobasic potassium phosphate (KH2PO4) being
employed.

The ink was homogenized in a double asymmetric
centrifuge, SpeedMixer Dac 150.1 FVZ-K (FlackTec Inc.). All electrochemical
measurements were performed with an Autolab PGSTAT204 potentiostat/galvanostat
(Eco Chemie) (with FRA32 M module), controlled by NOVA 2.1.3 software.
A pH meter 827 (Metrohm) was used for pH measurements. The characterizations
of the composite and materials was performed using Scanning Electron
Microscopy with field emission, employing a scanning electron microscope
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Prisma E) equipped with an Everhart-Thornley
SE detector, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (Bruker,
TENSOR II)  MULTIUSER, X-ray Powder Diffractometer (Rigaku,
MiniFlex 600)  MULTIUSER, and PerkinElmer TGA 4000 thermogravimetric
analyzer (Norwalk, Connecticut, United States). The contact angle
analysis were carried out adding 100 μL of deionized water and
using a lab-made equipment described in reference.

The conductive ink was prepared
using 83.33% of Chinese shellac and 16.67% of carbon black (CB), with
100 μL of acetone as an additive (Figure-I). This specific formulation, corresponding
to 20% (w/w) CB relative to the shellac mass, was selected after evaluating
other concentrations (5% (w/w), 10% (w/w), and 15%n (w/w). The 20%
CB ink showed the best electrochemical performance. The resulting
mixture,Figure-II,
was homogenized for 3 cycles of 3500 rpm for 90 s in a double asymmetric
SpeedMixer,Figure-III. The ink was then applied on the sanded transparent acetate,
using an adhesive paper sheet with the design outlined by a Silhouette
Cameo 4 cutting printer,Figure-IV. After the ink dried for 30 min at room temperature,
the SPE was prepared to use for the electrochemical analyses, Figure
V. This device was denominated as ChineseSHL-CB/Acetate, and its image
is shown in theSupporting Information,
inFigure S1, in real proportions of approximately
2.0 per 1.0 cm.

The morphological characterizations were made using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) with a Prisma E microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
operating in high vacuum at 10 kV. For the structural characterizations
were used a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with a
Tensor II spectrophotometer (Bruker), at a resolution of 4.0 cm–1and a scanning range from 400 to 4000 cm–1(n = 64). KBr pellets in a 1:100 ratio was prepared for the conductive
ink, CB and Chinese shellac. Crystallographic analyses were carried
out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray
powder diffractometer, employing a CuKα radiation source (λ
= 0.15406 nm). Measurements were taken across an angular range of
2° to 90°, with a step size of 0.01° and a scanning
speed of 10° min–1. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was made in a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 mL
min–1. The temperature was varied from 30 to 800
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Electrochemical
characterizations were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with 1.0 mmol L–1FcMeOH
as the redox probe and 0.1 mol L–1KCl as the supporting
electrolyte. The EIS technique parameters applied were: frequency
range of 1.0 × 105to 1.0 × 10–1Hz, at 10 points per decade, 10 mV of amplitude, sinusoidal
type waves and the potential applied were the half-wave potential
(E1/2).

The electrochemical
determination of melatonin was investigated using SWV. Chemical and
the specific parameters of the technique, such as pH, step (s), amplitude (a), and frequency (f), were optimized, in 100 μmol L–1melatonin, in 0.2 mol L–1PBS, pH 7.0. Once the
analysis conditions were established, the calibration curve was constructed
in the concentration range from 1.0 to 100 μmol L–1to acquire analytical parameters for SWV, including the linear concentration
range, limit of detection (LOD).

The synthetic urine sample was prepared
according to Campos Anderson and collaborators, with 0.25g of urea, 0.35g of KH2PO4, 0.73g of NaCl, 0.27g of CaCl2·2H2O,
and 25g of NH4Cl in 250 mL of 0.2 mol L–1PBS (pH 7.0). The melatonin sample was prepared using an addition
and recovery method by using a melatonin stock solution.

The morphological characterization
of the conductive ink was performed by SEM for SPE, sanded acetate,
and Chinese shellac film, in magnifications 500×, 1000×
and 2000×, present inFigure. For the SPE surface,FigureC1–3, it is possible observed an irregular
surface with a homogeneous dispersion of CB particles in the polymer
matrix, as well as possible observed the formation of agglomerates,
mainly inFigureC3.
In all magnifications the presence of grooves caused by the sanding
in the acetate substrate,FigureA. For the Chinese shellac sample, the magnifications
showed a homogeneous surface, as shown inFigureB.

(B) Chinese shellac,
and (C) screen-printed electrode (working electrode), with magnifications

InFigureA, we
can observe the spectra obtained by FTIR analysis for the CB (blue),
Chinese shellac (red), and conductive ink (black) samples. In the
Chinese shellac spectrum was possible to identify bands in 2800 cm–1associated with symmetric and asymmetric stretching
of C–H bonds. Also, can be observed
an intense band in 1730 cm–1of the anhydride symmetric
stretching can be observed, which matches with the chemical structure
of the polymer. Also, in the same spectrum, we observe bands in 1500–1450
cm–1and 530 cm–1related to the
bonding of CH2and CH3bonds and the presence
of long chains, respectively. The bands
present in the range from 1600 to 400 cm–1, can
be related to carboxylic, hydroxyl and ketone groups, which in the
conductive ink can auxiliary on the dispersion of carbon material. For the CB, a band in 1600 cm–1, characteristic of C = C bonds, is
observed. On the other hand, for the conductive ink, the spectrum
obtained was similar to CB, where it is possible to observe some shellac
bands from 1600 to 400 cm–1with lower intensity.
This result can be associated with some characteristics of the CB,
such as the dark and low-density, which interfere in the analysis,
besides the availability of CB on dispersion in ink. Furthermore,
we observed in all analyses that the band in 3490 cm–1was associated with the O–H bonds, which can be caused by
humidity or O–H interactions.

XRD patterns were obtained for the same samples
analyzed in FTIR,
being present inFigureB (red for Chinese shellac, blue for CB, and black for the conductive
ink). The pattern of CB (blue line) presented an asymmetrical crystalline
peak proximal to 20°, referent to the 002 plane, revealing the
presence of characteristic planes of the amorphous material. Chinese shellac (red line), showed an amorphous
pattern, with no characteristic peak of crystallinity, as seen in
the literature for the maleic resin, Chinese shellac resin. Likewise, the conductive ink (black line) also
presents an amorphous pattern, similar to the polymer pattern, as
expected by its composition.

Furthermore, the TGA analysis were
also made for the CB (blue),
Chinese shellac (red) and conductive ink (black), as demonstrated
inFigureC and D,
for the percentage of degradation of these samples (FigureC) and its equivalent derivate
(FigureD), to analyze
the maximus degradation for each sample. InFigureC, it is possible to observe a small degradation
in the conductive ink, starting at proximally 100 °C, possibly
by the water evaporation. The conductive ink demonstrated a percentage
of degradation of 69%, and the Chinese shellac of 99.68%, of their
total mass, as seen inFigureC. Otherwise, the CB did not show a significative degradation
in the thermal range analyzed. These results show that the degradation
of the conductive ink is mostly referent to the presence of the Chinese
shellac in its composition. InFigureD, it is more evident the maximus degradation peak
in both samples, were the conductive ink exhibited the maximus degradation
in 404 °C, and the Chinese shellac in 412 °C. Supposedly,
this variation can be related to the heat concentrated for the presence
of CB in the conductive ink, making its polymer degrade more easily.

Finally, the contact angle measurement was performed to evaluate
the wettability of the ink on the 3-electrode system and substrate,
providing information on the adhesion and spreadability of the ink
formulation, which are essential factors for applications in flexible
electronics and printed sensors. The measured contact angles were
80°, 97°, and 100° for the substrate,FigureE-I, conductive ink, 3E-II,
and ChineseSHL-CB/Acetate sensor, 3E-III, respectively, indicating
a varying degree of wettability. The substrate (FigureE-I) can be classified as a hydrophilic material,
as its measured angle is lower than 90°. Otherwise, the conductive
ink and device (FigureE-II and III), presented a similar angle, characteristic of hydrophobic
materials, represented by their contact angle major to 90°. This
similarity can be justified by the larger contact with the conductive
ink than the substrate in the device system.

To obtain the final
ink formulation, different compositions were tested by varying the
amount of carbon black (CB) relative to the shellac mass. The studied
formulations contained 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (w/w) of CB. All formulations
yielded conductive inks that were used to fabricate screen-printed
electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were then performed
using these electrodes in the presence of 0.1 mol L–1FcMeOH in 0.1 mol L–1KCl, at a scan rate of 50
mV s–1. As shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2), increasing the CB content resulted
in higher anodic and cathodic current responses, along with improved
electrochemical behavior, evidenced by a decreased peak-to-peak separation.
Based on these results, the selected formulation consisted of 83.33%
Chinese shellac and 16.67% CB, corresponding to the 20% (w/w) composition.

To observe the electrochemical profile of the device, we performed
CV measurements in the presence of 0.1 mol L–1FcMeOH,
in 0.1 mol L–1KCl, at a scan rate (ν) of
50 mV s–1, showing the characteristic peaks of the
electrochemical probe. InFigure, an oxidation peak can be observed at 160 mV and a
reduction peak at – 52 mV. From this, a ΔEp of 238 mV
was calculated, and a ratio of Ipa/Ipc of 1.22 was obtained, indicating
aquasi-reversible behavior for the electrochemical
process.

who found an electroactive area of 0.172 cm2in an ink
made from CB and poly­(vinyl alcohol).

The electrochemical stability of the sensor was
evaluated under
different storage conditions by comparing the CV of freshly prepared
electrodes and those stored for 14 days at room temperature or under
refrigeration. As shown inFigure S3, all
electrodes maintained a well-defined redox response, with only slight
variations in peak current. These results indicate that the sensor
preserves its electrochemical performance for at least 2 weeks under
both storage conditions.

The EIS technique was used to analyze
the electrochemical behavior
of the sensor from the interaction of the surface and the solution,
as shown inFigure. This data was obtained with the technique parameters shown in the
experimental section, and the potential applied was the calculatedE1/2of 0.1 V. The Nyquist diagram showed a majority
capacitive interaction in higher frequencies, related to the displacement
parallel to thex-axis, followed by two decrescent
capacitive interactions until the mass transport is majority controlled
by diffusion, represented by the Warburg impedance, present in the
circuit. So, this device behavior is represented by a modification
of the Randles circuit, where two pairs of resistance and capacitance
are present, attributed to two different phases. The first phase can
be attributed to a thin layer of the shellac, and the second to the
CB and Chinese shellac interaction.

The ability of
melatonin to cross biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier,
gives it neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. Because of this,
it becomes a promising therapeutic target for various neurological
conditions, ranging from sleep disorders to neurodegenerative diseases.

The electrochemical behavior of melatonin
was initially evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in the absence and presence
of 100 μmol L–1melatonin, in 0.2 mol L–1PBS (pH = 7.0). InFigureA, an oxidation peak is observed at approximately
0.8 V. The response mechanism of melatonin is illustrated inFigureB, where the substance
undergoes an irreversible oxidation reaction, likely involving the
transfer of two electrons and one proton, resulting in the formation
of a radical cation. This pattern of behavior has been previously
described in the literature by Camargo et al. and Freitas et al.

of melatonin.

The melatonin determination was carried out using
the SWV, to define
the best conditions for melatonin quantification. Optimization studies
of chemical and specific parameters of the technique were conducted,
with the results presented in theSupporting Information, asTable S1. Using the SWV technique,
the behavior of the analyte was studied at different pH values in
PBS, in the pH range of 5.0 to 8.0. This study indicates that the
peak potential tends to increase as the pH increases. Therefore, to
achieve greater sensitivity of the sensor, the ideal pH of the supporting
electrolyte was determined to be 7.0, which was chosen for future
studies. The specific parameters of the technique that influenced
the current response in SWV were also evaluated to obtain the highest
currents and best voltammetric profiles. The parameters analyzed werea,f, ands. Its studied
range forawas from 10 mV to 100 mV,ffrom 10 to 100 Hz, andsfrom 1 mV to 10 mV. The
optimized values found for these parameters were:a= 80 mV,f= 20 Hz, ands= 6
mV, present inTable S1.

With the defined
parameters, an analytical curve was constructed using SWV by varying
the melatonin concentration, using 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 30.0,
50.0, 70.0, and 100 μmol L–1, in a 0.2 mol
L–1PBS (pH = 7.0). InFigureA, the square wave voltammograms showed a
progressive increase in the anodic current signal with the increase
in concentration, demonstrating a linear relationship between the
peak current and the melatonin concentration within the studied range,FigureB. From this relationship,
the linear equation obtained was I = 0.01883 C(Melatonin)– 2.92533 × 10–8, with an r2= 0.996. The LOD was calculated by 3 × RSD of blank divided
by slope, resulting in 0.11 μmol L–1. A slight
displacement for higher potentials can be observed, with the increase
of concentration, which is possibly associated with an adsorption
process. Additionally, studies on repeatability and reproducibility
were performed, with results showing an RSD = 3.81% (n = 5) and RSD
= 7.80% (n = 5), respectively.

L–1, in 0.2 mol L–1PBS (pH =
7.0); parameters:a= 80 mV,f=
20 Hz, ands= 6.0 mV. (B) Relation current vs concentration

The determination of melatonin was performed in
synthetic urine
samples using the addition and recovery method.Tablepresents the results obtained, with values
ranging from 86.7% to 110%. This demonstrates the feasibility of using
the proposed device for the detection of the hormone in this biological
fluid.

To evaluate the selectivity of the proposed sensor,
interference
studies were carried out using common biomolecules found in biological
fluids, namely uric acid, urea, dopamine, and ascorbic acid. Although
some variations in signal intensity were observed, the sensor maintained
a distinguishable response in the presence of all interferents. The
highest interference was recorded for ascorbic acid (33.64%) and uric
acid (28.24%), while urea and dopamine exhibited the lowest interference
of 9.61% and 9.01% respectively. Detailed results, including average
current responses, standard deviations, and relative deviations, are
presented inTable S2. Also, to decrease
this interference, electrode modification should be performed, which
can be used in further works.

For a fair comparison, we present
some works from the literature,
also for electrochemical melatonin determination, presented inTable. For instance, the
device produced by Freitas et al., a
disposable self-adhesive inked paper electrode, exhibited a higher
LOD, if compared with this work, and its linear range starts also
at higher values, if compared with all the analyzed devices. Otherwise,
the Camargo et al. showed the lower LOD,
followed by the one developed in this work, with a waterproof paper-based
electrode. And the Gomez et al., covered
a broader linear range, using CNTs and graphene-based, though with
a higher LOD. Satianram et al. developed
a Tween-coated h-BDD modified screen-printed electrodes for melatonin,
and showed a lower LOD in relation the other works cited in the table.
Some sensors used modified glassy carbon electrodes for the determination
of melatonin, as Dung et al., who present
a wide linear range for detection, and Lete et al. who obtained a linear range with lower concentration values
of melatonin. However, both of them are modified with metallic nanoparticles,
as FeCo alloy nanoparticles and Au nanoparticles, respectively. So,
it is possible to conclude that the performance of ChineseSHL-CB/Acetate,
developed in this work, can be considered analytically appreciable
when compared to other systems. Therefore, we present a new sensor,
which has great characteristics such as a simple fabrication process
and potential for widespread use.

A new screen-printed electrochemical sensor
has been successfully
developed, offering a rapid, sensitive, and practical approach for
detecting melatonin. The fabrication process of the sensor was notably
straightforward and cost-efficient, leveraging a conductive ink formulated
from Chinese shellac and carbon black (CB). This ink was engineered
to possess optimal viscosity for printing, thereby simplifying the
production process and reducing overall manufacturing costs. The sensor
demonstrated a broad and effective detection range, reliably measuring
melatonin concentrations from 1.0 to 100 μmol L–1. Employing square wave voltammetry (SWV), the sensor exhibited excellent
performance in analyzing biological samples, specifically synthetic
urine. Accuracy was assessed using the standard addition and recovery
method, yielding recovery rates between 86.7% and 110%, which confirms
the method’s robustness and reliability. In addition to its
sensitivity and affordability, the device showed strong stability,
repeatability, and reproducibility across multiple tests. These characteristics
highlight its significant potential for real-world applications in
clinical diagnostics and biological fluid analysis, making it a promising
tool for consistent and dependable melatonin detection.
