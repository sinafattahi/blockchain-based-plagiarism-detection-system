With the ongoing advancement of nasal endoscopic surgical techniques, rhinologists are increasingly tasked with addressing not only nasal sinus lesions but also exploring transnasal approaches for managing lesions involving the eyes and skull base. The complex anatomy of the nose, adjacent to the skull base superiorly and the medial orbital walls bilaterally, supports the use of artificial materials during surgical procedures for repair or reconstruction. Furthermore, artificial materials aid in the regeneration of nasal mucous membranes, promoting healing. This article reviews the selection of artificial materials used in nasal surgery and recent advancements in related research.

Nasal endoscopy technology was introduced to China in the 1980s, initially used primarily for diagnosing nasal diseases. Over time, with advancements in China’s nasal endoscopy technology, its applications have expanded significantly. This evolution now includes various surgical fields involving the nose, eyes, and skull base. Nasal surgery can be categorized into two main types based on its purpose: conventional and reconstructive surgery. Conventional surgery focuses on treating lesions in the nasal cavity and sinuses, while reconstructive surgery is dedicated to repairing and reconstructing the skull base, orbital wall, and adjacent structures through an intranasal approach. In modern practice, materials used in endonasal surgery are mainly classified into 2 groups: autologous and synthetic materials. Autologous materials, such as bone, fat, and fascia, are highly effective in preventing cerebrospinal fluid leakage. However, harvesting these tissues not only prolongs the surgical procedure but also increases the risk of postoperative complications.1The intraoperative use of appropriate artificial materials facilitates defect repair, promotes tissue healing, and ensures optimal surgical outcomes while minimizing the damage associated with additional tissue extraction. The use of commonly employed artificial materials in nasal surgery is now being reviewed.

The rapid advancement of nasal endoscopic surgical technology has introduced a novel approach for treating skull base lesions. Nasal endoscopes, available in various angles, provide an excellent field of vision during surgery, facilitating exposure of the complex tissue structures at the skull base. Compared with traditional craniotomy, transnasal endoscopic surgery causes less trauma, reduces operation time, and leads to quicker postoperative recovery.2Consequently, an increasing number of rhinologists are addressing skull base space-occupying lesions through the nasal approach. However, intraoperative reconstruction of the skull base is crucial to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage, which is essential for ensuring treatment efficacy. While the use of autologous materials for repair supports postoperative vascularization and material integration, extracting these materials inevitably leads to scarring and hematoma formation at the donor site.3In addition, patients with prior surgeries at the extraction site may not have sufficient material available. Therefore, the use of artificial materials in transnasal skull base surgery is becoming increasingly common.

Injectable hydroxyapatite (HXA) is a widely used bone substitute that provides robust support for defects at the skull base.4Composed of calcium phosphate, HXA forms a cement-like substance when exposed to water or sodium phosphate solution, gradually solidifying after application to the bone defect. This makes HXA straightforward to use during nasal endoscopic skull base repairs.

However, the curing time of HXA is prolonged when it comes into contact with water. Therefore, it is crucial to apply HXA to a completely dry bone surface. Continuous bleeding or cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the surgical wound can further extend the curing time, potentially impacting both the duration of surgery and postoperative outcomes.5In modern rhinology, multilayer repair techniques are predominantly employed to address these challenges. The use of multilayer materials in these repairs helps minimize HXA’s direct contact with fluids, significantly reducing its curing time whenever possible.6Nevertheless, certain unavoidable issues remain with the use of HXA for skull base repair, including an increased risk of postoperative nasal sinus infections.

The close anatomic relationship between the nose and the eye allows rhinologists to effectively manage diseases in both regions through nasal endoscopy. This includes procedures such as transnasal optic nerve decompression, lacrimal sac-nasal anastomosis, and transnasal orbital tumor resection. Based on the anatomic relationship between the sinonasal complex (OMC) and the orbit, transnasal endoscopic surgery is the preferred approach for treating lesions in the adjacent medial orbital region.14Nasal sinus masses, such as mucous cysts of the ethmoid sinus, maxillary sinus carcinoma, intranasal papillomas, and osteoproliferative disorders, including osteofibroblastic syndromes, may encroach on the orbital wall as they progress laterally. Therefore, it is essential for the rhinologist to not only remove the nasal sinus lesion completely but also repair or reconstruct the orbital wall. As a result, an increasing number of artificial materials are being used in nasal and ocular surgeries.

Patients with nasal septum perforation often experience symptoms such as nasal dryness, congestion, and recurrent rhinorrhea. Those with anterior septal perforations may also hear a whistling sound during breathing, which can significantly impact their quality of life. Therefore, once a septal perforation is identified, prompt surgical intervention is necessary. In patients with a deviated septum or with a spur of nasal septum, separating the mucosa on both sides of the septum may result in mucosal perforation. Consequently, any septal perforation must be addressed and repaired simultaneously. While autologous tissue remains the preferred choice for septal repair, artificial materials are increasingly used due to the limited availability of suitable cartilage. Common artificial materials for septal repair include polydioxanone (PDS), polycaprolactone (PCL), titanium, and acellular dermal matrix (ADM).

Due to the unique anatomy of the nasal sinuses, complete excision of lesions in these cavities may lead to the loss of mucosal coverage over the bone surface. This increases the risk of postoperative complications such as adhesions, stenosis, or even atresia of the sinus openings. ADM provides structural support for the injured mucosa, effectively reducing the time required for postoperative epithelialization.31ADM also minimizes the risk of scar sclerosis and contracture while reducing secretion production. In patients with specific autoimmune diseases, mucosal healing in surgical areas is often delayed, making ADM the preferred option for repairing these challenging wounds.32To ensure optimal outcomes, it is essential to provide a well-vascularized graft bed for ADM. In addition, nasal tamponade should be applied to exert appropriate pressure, immobilizing the ADM. Maintaining moisture in the operative cavity post-surgery is also crucial to prevent desiccation of the repair membrane.

With advancements in biotechnology, artificial materials are increasingly used in nasal surgery. Selecting the appropriate material is key to achieving optimal surgical outcomes, as each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the choice of material type, shape, and size should be customized to meet the specific needs of the procedure. In addition, various artificial materials can complement each other, and their combination can significantly enhance surgical outcomes. As the use of artificial materials expands, more patients are expected to benefit from their application.
