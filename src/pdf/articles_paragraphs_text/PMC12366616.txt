Hospital-based nurses and midwives play a pivotal role in promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding. However, variation in preservice education, in-service training and institutional policies contributes to inconsistent breastfeeding support across healthcare systems. Given the global push toward improving breastfeeding outcomes and the centrality of skilled nursing support, this scoping review protocol aims to systematically map the breadth, characteristics and reported outcomes of breastfeeding education and training initiatives targeting hospital-based nurses and midwives.

This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and advanced by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). A systematic search will be conducted across major databases including OVID Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science, as well as grey literature sources. Studies will be selected using the Population–Concept–Context (PCC) framework, focusing on breastfeeding-related education and training interventions designed for nurses and midwives in hospital settings. Two independent reviewers will screen all titles, abstracts and full texts, extract data using a standardised tool and resolve discrepancies via discussion or third-party consultation. The extracted data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic synthesis to identify trends, gaps and directions for future research. The literature search will be conducted between August and October 2025.

This scoping review involves the analysis of existing literature and does not require ethical approval. The findings will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at nursing and maternal–child health conferences to inform educators, hospital administrators and policy makers involved in breastfeeding support and clinical education.

This scoping review follows the Joanna Briggs Institute and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, ensuring a rigorous and transparent approach to evidence identification, selection and synthesis.

Inclusion of both peer-reviewed and grey literature allows for a comprehensive understanding of current practices and policies.

Two reviewers will independently screen studies, and any disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer, enhancing the reliability and consistency of the selection process.

Restricting the review to English and Chinese language studies may limit the generalisability of the findings.

Despite this pivotal role, research has consistently shown that many hospital-based nurses and midwives feel inadequately prepared to support breastfeeding mothers.9 11 12Gaps in both preservice education and in-service training contribute to insufficient knowledge of breastfeeding physiology, inadequate clinical skills in managing latch difficulties and milk expression, and low confidence in offering individualised support. Research on nursing curricula have highlighted that breastfeeding education is often fragmented, with insufficient coverage of practical skills and clinical application.13,15Even where basic concepts are taught, practical competencies—such as assessing infant feeding cues or troubleshooting breastfeeding complications—are often omitted or under-emphasised.16In hospital settings, clinical staff frequently face additional barriers to providing breastfeeding support, including time constraints, lack of institutional encouragement and inconsistent messaging among healthcare providers.17 18These limitations may result in suboptimal support during a critical window, undermining mothers’ breastfeeding self-efficacy and leading to early cessation.

In response, a growing number of breastfeeding education and training programmes have been developed and implemented globally.19,24These programmes span university-based curricula, continuing professional development, hospital-led in-service training, simulation-based instruction and online learning modules. They vary considerably in scope, instructional format, pedagogical design and evaluation methods. Some interventions emphasise foundational knowledge and technical skills, while others incorporate competencies in communication, counselling and cultural responsiveness. A subset of programmes is aligned with the WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, which emphasises staff training as a key component in achieving the ten steps to successful breastfeeding.

While the diversity of training models has increased, the global landscape of breastfeeding education for nurses and midwives remains poorly synthesised.9 19Most existing reviews have concentrated on maternal education or general breastfeeding promotion and have not systematically examined provider-focused training within hospital settings. Furthermore, there has been limited exploration of how institutional, cultural or health system factors influence the design, delivery and uptake of such training programmes. A recent systematic review by Mulcahyet alexamined skills-based breastfeeding education for a broad range of healthcare professionals.19While this review offered important insights, it was limited to skills-focused interventions and grouped nurses and midwives together with physicians and students, thereby restricting profession-specific conclusions. It also did not explore system-level or contextual influences on implementation and excluded knowledge-based or blended approaches. Most of the included studies were assessed as having high or serious risk of bias. In contrast, the present scoping review will focus exclusively on hospital-based nurses and midwives and include a broader range of education and training models, including preservice, in-service and continuing professional development. It will also incorporate literature published since 2021, thereby capturing postpandemic innovations in digital, hybrid and simulation-based learning. By mapping not only the characteristics and outcomes of interventions but also the institutional and contextual factors that shape them, this review aims to offer comprehensive, profession-specific insights. These findings will inform the development of evidence-based strategies to improve breastfeeding education for nurses and midwives and support the advancement of maternal–child health globally.

Identify and characterise the types, formats and pedagogical approaches used in breastfeeding education and training programmes targeting hospital-based nurses and midwives.

Synthesise reported outcomes of these interventions in relation to knowledge acquisition, skill development, clinical practice, professional confidence and maternal–infant outcomes.

Explore contextual factors—including institutional, cultural and health system-level influences—that shape the design, delivery and uptake of breastfeeding training in hospital settings.

Identify gaps in the literature to inform future research, curriculum development and policy formulation aimed at strengthening breastfeeding support competencies in hospital-based nursing and midwifery practice.

This scoping review will apply the Population–Concept–Context (PCC) framework to define inclusion and exclusion criteria, ensuring alignment with the objectives of mapping the scope and nature of breastfeeding education and training for hospital-based nurses and midwives globally.

This review will include studies involving hospital-based nurses and midwives as the primary recipients or participants of breastfeeding-related education and training interventions. Both preservice students (eg, undergraduate nursing or midwifery students in clinical placements) and in-service professionals (eg, registered nurses, licensed midwives or nurse–midwives employed in hospital settings) will be considered. Studies focusing on other healthcare professionals (eg, physicians, lactation consultants and community health workers) will be excluded unless nurses or midwives are separately and explicitly analysed.

Certification programmes (eg, WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly training).

In-service hospital training or mentorship programmes.

Interventions that focus on breastfeeding in the context of neonatal care, postpartum care, maternal–child nursing or public health promotion will be included if they include training components applicable to hospital-based nursing or midwifery care. Studies will be excluded if they assess breastfeeding knowledge or attitudes without describing an educational intervention, or if they focus solely on maternal education without provider training.

The review will focus on hospital and inpatient clinical settings, including general hospitals, maternity units, obstetric wards, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and other inpatient services where nurses and midwives provide direct maternal and newborn care. Studies conducted in outpatient clinics, community-based settings or home care will be excluded because these contexts differ substantially in scope, resources and organisational structures from hospital-based breastfeeding support. Training initiatives conducted exclusively in academic classroom environments will also be excluded unless they demonstrate direct clinical relevance to hospital practice. There will be no restrictions on geographic location, healthcare system type or income level of countries. The review will include studies from both high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to capture a wide range of training models and contextual challenges.

Quantitative studies (eg, randomised controlled trials, quasiexperimental studies, cohort studies and cross-sectional studies).

Qualitative studies (eg, phenomenology, grounded theory, qualitative description and thematic analysis).

Relevant grey literature, including reports from governmental or non-governmental organisations, training programme descriptions and institutional publications.

Systematic reviews or scoping reviews will be included if they specifically address breastfeeding education for nurses or midwives and meet the other inclusion criteria. Editorials, commentaries, opinion pieces, unpublished theses and non-peer-reviewed conference abstracts will be excluded unless they provide substantial empirical or descriptive detail on relevant training programmes.

Only studies published in English or Chinese will be included due to language resource constraints. The review will include literature published from January 2000 onward to reflect contemporary practices and health system developments in maternal–child care.

The scoping review will follow the six recommended stages: (1) identifying the research questions; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction; (5) collating, summarising and reporting the results and (6) optional consultation with experts.

An initial limited search of MEDLINE (via PubMed) and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost) will be undertaken to identify relevant articles on breastfeeding education and training for nurses and midwives. Keywords and index terms from the titles, abstracts and subject headings of retrieved articles will be analysed to inform the full search strategy.

The search will be adapted for each database and will include a combination of controlled vocabulary (eg, MeSH terms) and free-text terms (eg, “breastfeeding education,” “lactation training,” “nursing,” “midwifery,” “hospital-based”). Boolean operators and truncation will be applied as appropriate. The complete draft search strategy for MEDLINE is presented inonline supplemental file 1and will be peer-reviewed by a health sciences librarian.

Grey literature will be searched through targeted searches of institutional websites (eg, WHO, UNICEF, La Leche League International, International Confederation of Midwives) and open-access digital repositories. Reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews will be manually screened to identify additional eligible studies.

Data will be extracted using a standardised data extraction form developed by the review team. The form will be pilot-tested on a subset of studies and revised as necessary. Two reviewers will independently extract data from the included studies. Any discrepancies will be discussed and resolved by consensus, with involvement of a third reviewer if needed.

Study characteristics: author(s), year, country, study design and publication type.

Population details: nurse/midwife role, level of training and hospital context.

Description of the education/training intervention: content, duration, format, theoretical basis and delivery mode (eg, face-to-face, online and blended).

Outcome measures: changes in knowledge, skills, confidence, attitudes, clinical practice and maternal–infant outcomes.

Contextual factors: institutional characteristics, facilitators/barriers to implementation and cultural or systemic influences.

The data will be analysed using both descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis. Quantitative data (eg, intervention frequency, settings and outcome measures) will be summarised using frequency counts and percentages. Qualitative data (eg, participant experiences, implementation facilitators, and cultural factors) will undergo inductive thematic analysis to identify emergent themes across studies. Findings will be presented in tabular and graphical formats, organised by region, type of intervention or training outcomes where applicable. A narrative summary will accompany the visual data to contextualise the findings, highlight patterns and identify knowledge gaps. Differences across geographic regions, income settings and nursing roles (eg, midwives vs general nurses) will be explored where data permit.

If feasible, an optional expert consultation phase will be incorporated to strengthen the relevance, interpretive validity and practical applicability of the review findings. Experts will be recruited through purposive sampling, based on demonstrated expertise in nursing education, lactation support and maternal–child health in clinical, academic or policy settings. We aim to include a diverse group of reviewers, such as clinical educators, midwifery faculty, neonatal nurses and breastfeeding programme leaders from both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. Experts will be invited to review preliminary findings, provide feedback on emerging themes and offer critical insight into practice implications, implementation challenges and priorities for future research and policy development. The consultation process will be conducted via structured correspondence (eg, email or survey) or virtual discussion. It will serve to contextualise the findings within contemporary healthcare practice and ensure that recommendations are profession-specific and implementation-relevant.

As this scoping review involves the collection and synthesis of data from publicly available sources, it does not require ethical approval. No primary data will be collected, and there will be no involvement of human participants. The conduct and reporting of this review will adhere to the PRISMA-ScR checklist to ensure methodological transparency and completeness. The findings of the review will be disseminated through submission to a peer-reviewed journal, with preference for platforms focused on nursing, medical education and maternal–child health. In addition, results will be shared at relevant academic conferences to engage educators, professional development leaders, curriculum designers and healthcare policymakers. This multichannel dissemination strategy aims to support evidence-informed improvements in breastfeeding education and training for hospital-based nurses and midwives globally.

Patients and members of the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of this scoping review.
