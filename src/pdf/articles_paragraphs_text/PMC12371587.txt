High-precision measurement of peak parameters such as
intensity
(I), peak position (ωc), full width at half-maximum (Γ), and area (A) is pivotally important for advancing scientific research.
Achieving high-precision requires elucidating the physical principles
governing measurement precision and establishing guidelines for optimizing
analytical conditions. Although the pseudo-Voigt profile is a widely
used line-shape model, the underlying principles governing the precision
of its parameter estimation remained unclear. For this study, we developed
a model to quantify the parameter estimation precision under arbitrary
conditions by integrating theoretical analysis, numerical calculations,
and Monte Carlo simulations. Our quantification results indicate that
when the mixing parameter (η) is fixed, the precision ofI, Γ, andAis proportional to {Δx/ΓI}0.5, whereas the
precision of ωcis proportional
to {ΓΔx/I}0.5, where Δxdenotes the sampling interval.
Furthermore, the analytical precision exhibits η-dependence:
forIand Γ, when the profile becomes more
Lorentzian, the absolute value of the covariance between Γ and
η as well as betweenIand η increases,
thereby degrading their estimation precision. This finding suggests
that in addition to conventional methods such as improving the signal-to-noise
ratio and reducing sampling interval, appropriately controlling η
can be an effective strategy for optimizing precision. For instance,
if broadening effects (e.g., instrumental or Doppler broadening) are
deliberately introduced to tune η from 1 to 0, then this alone
improves Γ estimation precision by a factor of 3.7, equivalent
to a 14-fold increase in signal intensity. Furthermore, when the effect
of increased Γ due to broadening is considered, even greater
improvements in precision can be achieved. Overall, our model provides
a foundational framework for research on peak parameter estimation.
It serves as an alternative approach to error estimation when experimental
evaluation is challenging and as a quantitative tool for assessing
precision gain from instrument upgrades.

Across a broad range of fields, peak parameters extracted from
signal data, such as intensity (I), peak position
(ωc), full width at half-maximum
(Γ), and area (A), serve as key indices for
evaluating the physicochemical properties of materials. These parameters
must be estimated with the highest possible precision to identify
subtle phenomena that are difficult to discern and to facilitate more
rapid analyses with minimal sample quantities. These demands underscore
the importance and challenges of achieving precise estimation in various
fields and analytical techniques.

In practice, observed line
profiles result from the simultaneous
contributions of multiple factors, including Doppler broadening caused
by thermal motion, instrumental broadening, crystal size or lattice strain broadening,,and natural, pressure, or power broadening.,Consequently,
neither a purely Gaussian profile nor a purely Lorentzian profile
describes these profiles adequately; instead, the Voigt profile, defined
as the convolution of the two functions, emerges as the most appropriate
model.−However, because the Voigt profile lacks a closed-form
analytical expression, its use in data analysis and curve fitting
incurs high computational costs.

To address this issue, the
pseudo-Voigt profile (eq) has been employed as a computationally
efficient approximation that retains the essential characteristics
of the original Voigt profile.−Numerous studies have specifically
examined the accuracy of the approximation of the pseudo-Voigt profile
and development of methods to estimate the original physical parameters
more accurately from the extracted parameters.,−However, to achieve high-precision measurements efficiently, it
is imperative not only to assess the approximation accuracy but also
to elucidate the underlying physical principles that define the limits
of peak parameter estimation precision, thereby providing guidelines
for optimizing analytical instruments and measurement conditions.
To date, no study has investigated the physical principles that establish
these limits for the pseudo-Voigt profile.

Accordingly, this study has three main objectives: (1) to
elucidate
the physical principles which define the limits of precision in estimating
each peak parameter of the pseudo-Voigt profile under the Poisson
noise limit, (2) to clarify the effect of optimizing the mixing parameter
η on high-precision analysis, alongside conventional strategies
such as increasing the SNR and using a finer sampling interval, thereby
proposing new guidelines for precision enhancement, and (3) to provide
a definitive answer to the longstanding question in analytical chemistry
of whether intensity ratios or area ratios serve as more precise indicators. To achieve these objectives, we have developed
a model to quantify the estimation precision of each peak parameter,
in addition to their ratios and differences, for the pseudo-Voigt
profile under the Poisson noise limit, integratively employing theoretical
analyses based on the Cramér–Rao inequality and Fisher
information, numerical calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations.
For this study, we use general peak parameters such asI, Γ, the sampling interval (Δx), and
η to establish a methodology that is independent of any specific
analytical technique or field. Furthermore, we take advantage of a
unique opportunity to compare the estimation precision of peak parameters
for the pseudo-Voigt profile directly with those for Gaussian and
Lorentzian profiles, thereby elucidating how profile shape differences
affect the parameter estimation precision.

The model for peak
parameter estimation precision derived in this
study is expected to serve as a foundation for extensive research
on analytical precision, with various applications including the following:
(1) providing an alternative method for estimating errors when experimental
error determination is challenging because of limited data;,,(2) enabling the quantitative
assessment of precision improvements resulting from instrumentation
upgrades by integrating our model with analyses of the relationship
between peak parameters and analytical device performance; (3) providing guidelines for system improvement
by determining whether analytical precision has reached its theoretical
limit or is constrained by external factors, thereby identifying bottlenecks
in precision enhancement; and (4) serving as a benchmark for evaluating
novel analytical methods.

Analytical expressions for the Fisher information
matrix are derived
under the following seven assumptions: (1) the noise variance equals
the signal intensity at all data points. (2) The data sampling interval
(Δx) remains constant throughout the analysis
region. (3) The peak intensity is zero outside the sampling range.
(4) The profile is sampled finely enough for summation to be approximated
by integration. (5) The baseline is constant. (6) Peaks do not mutually
interfere. (7) Noise at each data point is statistically independent.
It can be approximated by a Gaussian probability density function
because of the high mean intensity. This approximation is justified
by the central limit theorem, which allows the Poisson noise distribution
to approximate a Gaussian distribution when the signal intensity is
high.

Here, the parameter vector is defined
as θ = (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) = (I, ωc, Γ,
and η). The unit ofIis not a digital count
but an absolute physical unit that reflects the characteristics of
Poisson noise (e.g., photons or electrons). Mixing parameter η
represents the contribution of the Lorentzian component, where η
= 0 corresponds to a purely Gaussian profile and η = 1 corresponds
to a purely Lorentzian profile.

It is noteworthy that, for the Gaussian
profile, the calculations
ofFG,CG, andσθk*Gwere performed after correcting the coefficient
error in theF33term reported by Hagiwara
and Kuwatani (details are provided in
another report of our work).Figurepresents the values
of the matrix elementsFklcalculated for the Gaussian, Lorentzian, and pseudo-Voigt profiles

profiles (eqsand ) are in agreement with results of our numerical
calculations (Figures S1 and S2).

with their corresponding fitted curves. All numerical calculations
were performed withI= 1000, ωc= 0, Γ = 10, Δx= 0.1,
and η of 0.001–0.999 (Table S1).

Light blue crosses represent the numerically computedCklfor the pseudo-Voigt profile, along

We then note that the standard deviation of each
peak parameter
σθkis given asCkk. Using standard error propagation, we compute
the relative or absolute standard deviations forI, ωc, Γ, and η, as
well as for the intensity ratio (RI=Iw/Is), peak position difference
(Δω = |ωw– ωs|), full width at half maximum (fwhm) ratio
(RΓ= Γw/Γs), and η ratio (Rη = ηw/ηs). Here, subscriptswandsstand for the weaker and stronger peaks. Because an analytical
solution forCklis not
available for the pseudo-Voigt profile, the standard deviations cannot
be expressed in terms of elementary functions. In contrast, for the
Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, the standard deviations can be expressed
analytically, as presented below.

Here, the asterisk denotes the relative standard
deviation.

simulations, with corresponding data inTable S2. Error bars show the 95% confidence intervals computed usingeqs S15 and S16.

The precision of peak parameter estimation for
Gaussian profiles
under the Poisson noise limit was derived earlier by Hagen et al. and by Hagiwara and Kuwatani. However, their formulations differ in both the coefficients
and the variable terms. This discrepancy likely arises from differences
in the definition of Poisson noise: Hagen et al. defined the variance as σi= ΔxγG(ωi;θ̂), whereas Hagiwara and Kuwatani usedγG(ωi;θ̂). As a result, the analytical expression
for precision derived by Hagen et al. lacks a Δxterm, implying that the sampling
interval does not influence precision. This conclusion contradicts
both the qualitative reasoning and our simulation results. In contrast,
the precision of peak parameter estimation for Lorentzian profiles
under the Poisson noise limit has only been derived by Hagiwara and
Kuwatani. Hagiwara and Kuwatani verified the consistency ofeqs– and – using
Monte Carlo simulations, whereas for this study, we further confirm
their agreement with numerical calculations (Figures S2 and S4). No report of an earlier study has described the
examination of the precision of peak parameter estimation for the
pseudo-Voigt profile. Therefore, this study offers a unique opportunity
for systematic comparison of the estimation precision of peak parameters
for pseudo-Voigt, Gaussian, and Lorentzian profiles.

For verification of the consistency
between the analytical solutions and the numerical results, and for
numerical evaluation of the matrix elements of the pseudo-Voigt profile
that cannot be expressed in closed form, we performed numerical calculations
of the Fisher information matrixFand its inverse, the covariance matrixC. These computations were implemented by
using the Python programming language. The matrix elementsFklwere computed according
toeqandS1–S4as the integral:(∂γ(ωi;θ)∂θk∂γ(ωi;θ)∂θl)σi−2, where integration was performed numerically
over the interval [−50,000, 50,000] using the function scipy.integrate.quad.
The calculations were conducted under the conditions ofI= 1000, ωc= 0, Γ = 10,
and Δx= 0.1, with η varied from 0.0001
to 0.9999, resulting in a total of 42 distinct parameter sets forFPV. In addition, the inverse ofFwas computed via the numpy.linalg.inv function
to obtainC, thereby evaluating the lower bound of
the precision in parameter estimation as stipulated by the Cramér–Rao
inequality. The relative standard deviations of the area and area
ratio were calculated by combining the obtained variance–covariance
matrix witheqs–.

The results obtained forFPVandCPVare depicted inFiguresand , where they
are represented by light blue cross symbols and corresponding approximation
curves. The standard deviation for each peak parameter, computed asσθk=Ckk, is presented inFigurewith light blue cross symbols and fitted
curves. All numerical data forF,C, and σθkare presented inTable S1.

To validate the precision of
peak parameter estimates obtained from theoretical and numerical calculations,
we performed Monte Carlo simulations. For this approach, we generated
synthetic signal data and conducted curve fitting to extract the peak
parameters. The standard deviations were then computed from the dispersion
of the fitted parameter values.

In the simulation, two pseudo-Voigt
profiles were generated with peak positions set as ωc,w= 4000 and ωc,s= 12,000. The expected
intensities of the two peaks were fixed respectively asIw= 1000 andIs= 10,000. A sampling interval of Δx= 0.1 and a bandwidth of Γ = 10 were used, whereas
η was varied in increments of 0.1 from 0.1 to 0.9, yielding
data under nine different conditions. Under these simulation conditions,
the separation ratio Δω/Γ exceeded 800 in every
case. For the Lorentzian function, the intensity at a distance of
800Γ from the peak center decreases to approximately 4 ×
10–7of the peak intensity. For the Gaussian function,
the intensity at a distance of 3Γ drops to about 1 × 10–11of the peak intensity, indicating that interference
between the peaks is negligible.

For each condition, 999 data
sets were generated. Then peak parameter
extraction was performed using Python’s nonlinear fitting library
(scipy.optimize.curve_fit). To facilitate
rapid convergence to the global minimum, known parameter values were
used as initial estimates. A cost function minimizing the weighted
sum of the squared residuals was employed. This approach is analogous
to those used in widely adopted curve-fitting software such as Fityk and GRAMS/AI (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).
The convergence tolerances (xtol =gtol =ftol) were initially set to 1 × 10–15. If convergence was not achieved, then the tolerances
were relaxed incrementally by 2 orders of magnitude. The trust region
reflective algorithm was adopted as the optimization method, with
the maximum number of iterations set to 10,000.

A total of 8991
signal data sets yielded extracted peak parameters,
which are presented inTable S2. The mean
values and standard deviations of the peak parameters across the nine
conditions are presented inTable S3.

Figurea–j
displays the η dependence of the Fisher information matrix elementsFklas obtained from both theoretical
derivations and numerical calculations. ForF11,F12,F13,F14,F23, andF24, all elements with available
analytical solutions, and the theoretical and numerical results are
in excellent agreement, confirming the high reliability of both methods.
Moreover, the values ofF11,F12,F13, andF23can be expressed as a weighted sum of the Gaussian and Lorentzian
components, i.e.,Fkl= (1 – η)Fkl+ ηFkl. In contrast,F22andF33cannot be expressed in this form. However, in the limits as η
→ 0 and η → 1,Fklconverges respectively toFklandFkl. Additionally,F34andF44increase exponentially in the vicinity of
η ≈ 0, indicating that as η → 0, the information
content for η is high, allowing it to be estimated with high
precision.

Figurea–j
presents a comparison of the variance–covariance matrix elementsCklobtained from theory and
numerical calculations. It is noteworthy that forC11,C13, andC33, the values converge to those of the Gaussian
profile,Ckl, in the limit
as η → 0. In contrast, for η → 1, the absolute
values satisfy |Ckl| > |Ckl|, which indicates that the
effect of mixing Gaussian and Lorentzian components on the estimation
precision is asymmetric with respect to η. Furthermore, althoughC22does not correspond exactly to a weighted sum ofC22andC22, it converges toC22andC22, respectively, in the
limits as η → 0 and η → 1. As with the pure
Gaussian and Lorentzian cases,C22is given simply as the reciprocal
ofF22.,With the exception ofC12,C23, andC24, which are identically zero, no element of
the covariance matrixCPVcan be expressed as a weighted sum ofCklandCkl.

Figurepresents
a comparison of the estimation precision of the peak parameters, as
found using theoretical analysis, numerical calculations, and Monte
Carlo simulations. For all parameters, the numerical and simulation
results agree very well. Moreover, for all parameters (with the exception
of those pertaining to η), the relative standard deviationσθk*PVfor the pseudo-Voigt profile converges
to that of the Gaussian profile,σθk*G, in the limit as η → 0. However,
in the limit as η → 1,σθk*PVmatchesσθk*Lonly for ωc, Δω,A, andRA. For these parameters,σθk*PVcan be reasonably approximated using a
weighted sum ofσθk*Gandσθk*L(i.e.,σθk*G+Llinear=(1−η)σθk*G+ησθk*L, as shown inFigureb,e,h,k). In contrast, forI,RI, Γ, andRΓ, in the limit as η → 1,σθk*PVis up to 2.26 times larger (for Γ
andRΓ;Figurec,i) and 1.22 times larger (forIandRI;Figurea,g) than the values predicted
by the weighted sum approximation. The estimation precision for η
itself exhibits marked asymmetry with respect to its value, approaching
near-zero precision as η → 0 (Figured). Moreover, for the Gaussian and Lorentzian
profiles, the precision values ofRA(orA) are superior to those forRI(orI),
respectively, by factors of3/2and3(eqsand ). In the case of the
pseudo-Voigt profile, in the limit as η → 1, the ratiosσRI*PV/σRA*PVand σ*I/σ*Aapproach 2.11, indicating that the precision ofRA(orA) is up to 2.11
times better than that ofRI(orI) (Figuresf,l). This finding implies that usingRA(orA) instead
ofRI(orI) allows for precision equivalent to that obtained with a signal
that is up to 4.45 times stronger.

Figurepresents
the relative error distributions of the parameters obtained from Monte
Carlo simulations alongside the standard deviation ellipses computed
numerically fromeqs–, demonstrating excellent agreement
between the two approaches. It is noteworthy that a negative correlation
betweenIand Γ is observed, which is consistent
with the negative value ofC13(Figurec). In other words, asIincreases, Γ tends to decrease; asIdecreases,
Γ tends to increase. This tendency is more pronounced for the
Lorentzian profile than for the Gaussian profile. In fact, it becomes
even stronger for the pseudo-Voigt profile at η > 0.42 (Figuresc and b). In the pseudo-Voigt profile, as η → 1,C13decreases further below that of the Lorentzian profile (Figurec), thereby leading
to a stronger correlation betweenIand Γ (Figureb). The observed
positive correlation betweenIand η (Figurec) is consistent
with the positive value ofC14(Figured), indicating that
asIincreases, η also increases. This finding
suggests that in the pseudo-Voigt profile, a larger η corresponds
to a stronger contribution from the Lorentzian component, which, in
turn, results in a higher peak intensity. By contrast, the negative
correlation between Γ and η (Figuref) corresponds to the negative value ofC34(Figurei) and indicates that as η increases, Γ
tends to decrease. Finally, no significant correlation is observed
amongIand ωc,
ωcand Γ, or ωcand η, which is consistent with the fact thatC12,C23, andC24are all zero (Figurea,d,e).

Blue symbols represent 999 data points obtained from simulated signal
data under the conditionsI= 1000, ωc= 4000, Γ = 10, Δx=
0.1, and η = 0.5. Black solid, dashed, and dotted lines respectively
show covariance ellipses corresponding to 1σ, 2σ, and
3σ levels, computed from the Fisher information matrix under
these conditions. Green and pink dotted lines respectively show the
3σ covariance ellipses for the Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles,
calculated underI= 1000, ωc= 0, Γ = 10, and Δx= 0.1. Simulation
data are presented inTable S2.

For Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles,
the estimation precision of peak parameters can be derived analytically
as functions ofI, Γ, and Δx(eqs–). However, for the pseudo-Voigt profile, elementsF22,F33,F34, andF44cannot
be expressed in terms of elementary functions (eqs–). Consequently,
an analytical solution for the standard deviation is not available.
For this subsection, we therefore derive an empirical expression for
the estimation precision of peak parameters in the pseudo-Voigt profile.

Because the pseudo-Voigt profile is a weighted sum of Gaussian
and Lorentzian functions (eq), one of the most straightforward methods for expressing
the estimation precision of peak parameters is to approximate it as
a weighted sum of the analytical solutions for the precision of the
Gaussian and Lorentzian components (i.e.,σθk*G+Llinear=(1−η)σθk*G+ησθk*L). Indeed, for ωc, Δω,A, andRA, it has been confirmed thatσθk*PVcan be reasonably approximated byσθk*G+Llinear(Figureb,e,h,k). Becauseσθk*Gandσθk*Lare known (eqs–), an empirical
formula for estimatingσθk*PVunder arbitrary conditions ofI, Γ, Δx, and η is obtainable if
the ratio betweenσθk*PVandσθk*G+Llinearcan be modeled. To ascertain the relation
betweenI, Γ, Δx, η,
andσθk*PV, we performed numerical calculations ofσθk*PVover a total of 237,600 conditions withI= 103–106, Γ = 1–10,
Δx= 0.01–1.0, and η = 0.001–0.999.
The results were compared withσθk*G+Llinear(Table S4presents
related details). These calculations were performed for values of
Γ/Δxranging from 1 to 1000, corresponding
to cases where between 1 and 1000 data points are included within
the fwhm: a range that covers many practical scenarios in chemical
analysis.

Figurepresents
that, for all peak parameters, the ratioσθk*PV/σθk*G+Llineardepends solely on η: it is independent
of Γ and Δx. To model the η dependence
of this ratio, we performed curve fitting using various candidate
models, including first–24th order polynomials, exponential
functions, logarithmic functions, rational functions, and combinations
of polynomials with other functions. Particularly, numerical calculations
demonstrated that forIand Γ, the model function
must satisfyfθk(0) = 1. For ωcandA, it must satisfy bothgθk(0) = 1 andgθk(1) = 1. Also, for η,
it must satisfyhθk(0) = 0. Consequently, we selected model functions that
fulfill these boundary constraints. To avoid convergence to local
minima, the fitting procedure was repeated with random initial guesses
for the parameters. The model was selected by comparing the residual
sum of squares, Akaike’s information criterion, Bayesian information
criterion, and 5-fold cross-validation results for all candidate models.
Detailed information related to the evaluated model functions, the
model selection procedure, and the fitting results is provided in
theSupporting InformationandTable S5. As a result, forIand Γ, the function defined byeqwas chosen, whereas for ωcandA, the function defined byeqwas adopted, as presented
below.

Dependence of the normalized standard deviation
of peak parameters
in the pseudo-Voigt profile’s peak parameters on the mixing
parameter η, together with the best-fit model. The normalized
standard deviation is defined as the ratioσθk*PV/σθk*G+Llinear, where the predicted standard deviation
based on the weighted sum of the Gaussian and Lorentzian contributions
isσθk*G+Llinear=(1−η)σθk*G+ησθk*L. (a–d) respectively present results
for (a) intensity, (b) peak position, (c) full width at half-maximum
(fwhm), and (d) area. Blue symbols are values ofσθk*PV/σθk*G+Llinearobtained from numerical calculations performed
under 237,600 conditions spanning the parameter rangesI= 103–106, Γ = 1–10, Δx= 0.01–1.0, and η = 0.001–0.999 (Table S4). The best-fit model is described byeqsand , with corresponding model parameters presented inTable.

For these equations, the maximum relative errors,
defined as 100
×max1≤i≤n|σθk*PVi−σθk*PVi^|/σθk*PVi, are 0.26%, 0.05%, 0.89%, and 0.002%, respectively,
foreqs–, which is sufficiently precise for practical purposes.
By combiningeqs– with standard error propagation, we can calculate
the η-dependence of the standard deviations forI, ωc, Γ, andA, as well as forRI,
Δω,RΓ, andRA(Figure).

Dependence of standard deviations of various
parameters on Γ/Δxor ΓΔxin the pseudo-Voigt
profile. Panels show the standard deviations of intensity, peak position,
bandwidth, area, intensity ratio, peak position difference, bandwidth
ratio, and area ratio as predicted using the empirical equations (eqs–). Green and pink dashed lines respectively show theoretical
solutions for pure Gaussian and pure Lorentzian cases (eqs– and –). Results
are presented for four values of the mixing parameter: η = 0.01,
0.33, 0.66, and 0.99.

Because η is a parameter that is not present
in the Gaussian
or Lorentzian profiles, its standard deviation cannot be expressed
as a weighted sum ofσθk*Gandσθk*Las ineqs–. However, based on
the same 237,600 data sets, we determined empirically that the standard
deviation of η, ση, is proportional to
(Δx/ΓI)0.5, similar toI, Γ, andA.
To account for the effect of η on ση,
we tested several models, which revealed that the functionhη(η) defined by the following equation
performed best.

The parameters forhη(η)
obtained from the fitting are presented inTable. As shown inFigure, the numerical results for σηagree extremely well with those ineq. The maximum relative error was 8.6% at
η = 0.001 and 0.7% for η ≥ 0.01, demonstrating
that the model explains the numerical results with practically sufficient
precision.

Comparison of the standard deviations of the mixing parameter (η)
for the pseudo-Voigt profile obtained from the empirical formula (eq) and numerical calculations.
Results were obtained under five conditions with η = 0.01, 0.25,
0.5, 0.75, and 0.99. Cross symbols denoteσηvalues obtained from numerical calculations under
the conditionsI= 1000, Γ = 1–10, Δx= 0.01–1.0, and η = 0.001–0.999 (Table S4).

The deviation betweenσωcPVandσωcG+Llinearreaches a maximum of 2.7% at η ≈
0.33, whereas that between σ*Aand σ*Areaches a maximum of 1.4% at η
≈ 0.48 (Figureb,d). Because uncertainties are generally reported to one or two
significant digits, these minor deviations
are practically negligible. Consequently, for ωc, Δω,A, andRA, it is acceptable to approximateσθk*PVbyσθk*G+Llinear. In contrast, forI(orRI), in the limit η →
1, σ*Iis up to 22% larger than σ*I(Figurea). Moreover, the
uncertainties predicted by the weighted-sum model are up to ten times
worse than those for ωcorA. Even so, because uncertainties are typically reported
to one or two significant digits, an increase by a factor of approximately
1.22 is generally negligible. Therefore, the estimation precision
forIandRIcan also be approximated asσθk*PV∼ σ*Iwithout any important practical issue.
By contrast, the deviation between σ*Γand σ*Γreaches a maximum of 126% in the limit as η
→ 1 (Figuresc and c), implying that the signal intensity
required to achieve a given target precision could be underestimated
by as much as a factor of 2.262(∼5.11). Consequently,
we recommend usingeqinstead of the simple weighted-sum model for estimating σ*Γ.

This paper presents a novel approach
that extends conventional strategies for optimizing instrumentation
and measurement conditions for the high-precision estimation of peak
parametersI, ωc, Γ, andA. Traditionally, under the Poisson
noise limit for Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, it has been considered
that a wide bandwidth, fine sampling interval, and high signal intensity,
i.e., minimizing Δx/ΓI, are key factors for improving the precision ofI, Γ, andAestimation.,From the present study, we have demonstrated that this principle
also applies to the pseudo-Voigt profile when the shape parameter
η remains constant, as shown byeqs, , and  andFigure. Furthermore, when the condition Δxw/Γw≫RIΔxs/Γsis satisfied, the precision of the estimated intensity ratio,
fwhm ratio, and area ratio is governed primarily by two factors: the
number of sampling intervals spanning the fwhm of the weaker peak
(quantified by Γw/Δxw) and the intensity of the
weaker peak (Iw). Consequently,
achieving high precision requires minimizing the Δxw/ΓwIw. However, if the
bandwidth of the stronger peak is exceptionally narrow, the sampling
interval for the stronger peak is coarse, or the intensity ratio approaches
unity, then the characteristics of the stronger peak might also strongly
influence the precision ofRI,RΓ, andRAestimations.

Similarly to the
optimization ofI, Γ, andA, for Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, the precision of ωcis enhanced by refining the sampling interval
and increasing the signal intensity. However, in contrast, a narrower
bandwidth is preferable for ωcestimation.,For our study, we demonstrated further that, for the pseudo-Voigt
profile, minimizing ΓΔx/Iis effective for reducingσωcPV(eq;Figure).
Moreover, regarding the precision of the peak position difference
Δω, if the condition ΓwΔxw≫RIΓsΔxsis met,
then minimizing ΓwΔxw/Iwis effective for enhancing precision. However, if
the bandwidth of the stronger peak is exceptionally wide, its sampling
interval is coarse, or the intensity ratio is nearly 1, then the characteristics
of the stronger peak might strongly affect the precision of the Δω
estimation.

A central finding of this study is that even whenI, Γ, and Δxare held constant,
the precision
of parameter estimation varies significantly with η (Figure). Particularly as
η approaches 1, as the profile becomes increasingly Lorentzian,
the precision of both the Γ andIestimation
deteriorates considerably (Figurea,c). Traditional approaches have primarily emphasized
improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio and refining the sampling
interval to enhance precision. Our results suggest that appropriate
control of η provides a novel strategy for precision improvement.

Parameters Γ and η in the signal data are influenced
by various broadening effects. For instance, when Doppler or instrumental
broadening predominates, the profile tends to be Gaussian.,In contrast, when natural, pressure, or power broadening is dominant,
the profile becomes more Lorentzian.,These effects
can be modulated by adjusting the sample’s temperature and
pressure conditions,as well as the analytical settings
(e.g., slit width, grating constant, focal length of spectrometer,
and detector pixel size).,Consequently, deliberately
inducing broadening that yields a more Gaussian-like profile is particularly
effective at enhancing the precision ofIand Γ
estimations (Figurea,c).

Specifically, changing η from 1 to 0 improves the
precision
of Γ estimation by up to 3.7-fold, an effect that is equivalent
to increasing the signal intensity by approximately 14-fold. Similarly,
the precision of both intensity and intensity ratio estimations improves
by a factor of 1.4 when η is altered from 1 to 0, which is comparable
to doubling the signal intensity. Moreover, because the precision
ofIand Γ estimation is proportional to (Δx/ΓI)0.5(eqs, , and ), an increase in Γ because of broadening
also enhances precision. For example, if Γ doubles, then the
precision improves further by a factor of2, which is equivalent to the improvement
achieved by doubling the signal intensity.

In many analytical
applications, such as comparison of the concentration
or isotope ratios between two substances, the primary goal is to achieve
a high-precision estimation of peak parameters rather than determine
their absolute values directly. In these cases, any broadening-induced
modifications to peak shape are of little consequence because calibration
using standard samples ensures that the absolute parameter values
remain reliable for comparative purposes.

Nonetheless, these
high-precision measurement strategies have inherent
limitations. For instance, in practical analyses, adjusting η
is not always feasible due to methodological constraints and analyte-specific
behaviors. In addition, factors such as fluctuations inIcaused by changes in analytical conditions and the impact of increased
Γ on peak interference must be addressed comprehensively to
maintain precision. Despite these limitations, this study’s
insights reveal that controlling η beyond conventional methods
such as enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and refining the sampling
interval offers a deeper understanding of the impact of analytical
conditions on precision. Ultimately, this approach provides effective
guidelines for optimizing analytical systems.

the width of the slit image on the detector, determined by the entrance
slit widthbentand the optical configuration. By substituting these expressions for Δxand Γ into our precision models (eqs– and ), we provide a method for quantitatively
predicting how instrumental changes, such as pixel size, slit width,
grating groove density, and focal length, affect the precision ofI, ωc, Γ, andA. While the above example assumes a grating-based spectrometer
with area detection, the procedure is equally applicable to other
analytical systems: one needs only to express Δxand Γ as functions of the instrument’s performance
parameters and substitute them into our models to derive a direct
relationship between measurement precision and hardware specifications.
For a concrete illustration of how variations in focal length, pixel
size, grating groove density, and slit width influence the precision
of area ratios in Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, seeFigureof Hagiwara and Kuwatani. These relationships are particularly valuable
for guiding instrument design and upgrades to meet specific precision
requirements as well as for optimizing research budgets by identifying
cost-effective performance enhancements.

The question of whether the intensity
ratio (RI) or the area
ratio (RA) yields higher
estimation precision has been a longstanding debate in analytical
chemistry because this choice directly influences researchers’
decision-making regarding the precise estimation of target variables
during data analysis.,−Because of various factors, including noise and instrumental differences,
distortions in signal data, and large uncertainties associated with
variance estimation, earlier experimental studies undertaken to address
this issue faced challenges in drawing definitive conclusions. To
minimize the effects of experimental uncertainties and to provide
a more definitive answer, a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical
calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations is highly effective.

Using a theoretical approach, we demonstrated that, for Gaussian
and Lorentzian profiles, the relative standard deviations of the intensity
ratio and area ratio are given respectively asσRI*G/σRA*G=3/2andσRI*L/σRA*L=3(eqsand ), confirming that the
estimation precision of the area ratio is superior. In practical terms, using the area ratio instead of the
intensity ratio is equivalent to achieving the same precision under
signal conditions that are 1.5 and 3 times stronger. For this study,
we extended this analysis to the pseudo-Voigt profile and showed that
in the limit as η → 1, the ratioσRI*PV/σRA*PVto 2.11 suggests that the precision advantage
of the area ratio is even greater, corresponding to a precision equivalent
to that achieved under signal conditions up to 4.45 times stronger
(Figurel). In this
subsection, we discuss (1) why the estimation precision ofRAis superior to that ofRIand (2) why, as η approaches
1, the ratioσRI*G/σRA*Gexceeds the values3/2and3observed respectively for Gaussian and
Lorentzian profiles.

Earlier studies,have demonstrated that, for Gaussian
and Lorentzian profiles, the superior precision of the area ratio
over the intensity ratio is attributable to the negative covariance
betweenIand Γ. Specifically, whenIincreases, Γ tends to decrease and vice versa. Therefore,
the productIΓ, which is proportional to the
area, remains approximately constant (Figureb). However, this negative covariance also
means that the uncertainty in one parameter amplifies the uncertainty
in the other, making it difficult to estimateIor
Γ independently with high precision. This interplay among the
peak parameters ultimately results inRAbeing estimated more precisely thanRI.

For the pseudo-Voigt profile,
the influence of η must also
be considered. In the limit of η → 0, the correlations
betweenIand η and between Γ and η
vanish (Figured,i),
meaning that η does not affect the estimation of other parameters.
Consequently, the estimation precision of the pseudo-Voigt profile
converges to that of the Gaussian profile in this limit. The ratioσRI*PV/σRA*PVasymptotically approaches3/2. Conversely, as η approaches 1, the
correlation betweenIand η increases monotonically
(Figured), whereas
the correlation between Γ and η decreases monotonically
(Figurei). Therefore,
near η = 1, η begins to influence the estimation of bothIand Γ considerably. Particularly in the limit as
η → 1, the correlation coefficient between Γ and
η (i.e.,C13/C11C33) reaches −0.90, indicating a very
strong negative correlation that degrades the precision of independently
estimating Γ (Figuresc,f and c).
Moreover, the correlation coefficient betweenIand
η (i.e.,C14/C11C44) reaches 0.57 in this limit, signifying
a moderate correlation that also adversely affects the precision ofIestimation (Figuresa,c and a). As a consequence, the precision of the intensity ratio worsens,
causing the ratioσRI*PV/σRA*PVto increase. In contrast, the estimation
precision of the area and area ratio remains unaffected because the
negative covariances betweenIand Γ and between
Γ and η tend to preserve the productIΓη (i.e., the area remains nearly constant). In fact,
when comparing the contributions of individual terms ineqto the precision of the area,
the covariance terms∂APV∂I∂APV∂ΓC13PVand∂APV∂Γ∂APV∂ηC34PVcontribute greatly to the improvement in
precision (Figure S5). Therefore, to maximize
the estimation precision of the target variable, it is imperative
not only to control the mixing parameter η but also to judiciously
select the peak parameters.

For this study, we employed a multifaceted
approach combining theoretical
analysis, numerical calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate
the physical principles governing the estimation precision of pseudo-Voigt
profile parameters: intensity (I), peak position
(ωc), full width at half-maximum
(Γ), mixing parameter (η), and area (A). We developed a model that expresses estimation precision in terms
ofI, Γ, η, and the sampling interval
(Δx), providing a comprehensive framework that
bridges theoretical precision limits with practical experiment parameters.

Our analysis revealed that under constant η, the precision
ofI, Γ, andAimproves as
the ratio Δx/ΓIis minimized,
whereas the precision of ωcis enhanced
by reducing ΓΔx/I. Furthermore,
our investigation into the η-dependence of peak parameter estimations
demonstrated that decreasing η from 1 to 0 improves the estimation
precision of Γ by up to 3.7-fold: an effect equivalent to increasing
the signal intensity by approximately 14-fold. Similarly, the precision
of theIestimation increases by a factor of 1.4,
which is comparable to the effect of doubling the signal intensity.

These findings underscore that beyond conventional strategies such
as enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and optimizing the sampling
interval, controlling the mixing parameter η offers a useful
approach to precision optimization. For instance, inducing controlled
Doppler or instrument-induced broadening to shift the profile toward
a more Gaussian shape (i.e., reducing η) can simultaneously
improve the precision of bothIand Γ. Furthermore,
because the estimation precision ofIand Γ
is proportional to (Δx/ΓI)0.5, any increase in Γ caused by such broadening
further enhances the precision. This strategy provides practical guidelines
for designing and optimizing analytical instruments and experiment
conditions.

In summary, findings from our study not only deepen
the understanding
of the interplay between analytical parameters and estimation precision
but also pave the way for novel optimization strategies in high-precision
quantitative analysis. The precision model derived herein is anticipated
to serve as a foundational tool for further research related to measurement
precision, providing an alternative method for error estimation in
cases where direct experimental error quantification is challenging
and offering a means for quantitative assessment of improvements in
precision resulting from instrument upgrades.
