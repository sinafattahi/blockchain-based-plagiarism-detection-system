This study explores the factors affecting self-reported occupational health problems among improved traditional shrimp farmers in Southwestern Bangladesh. Data was collected from 270 farmers in the districts of Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat using a structured questionnaire. According to stepwise and hierarchical logistic regression analyses, health problem reporting was associated with district of residence, education level, training, self-rated health, and occupational health awareness. Health problems were more frequently reported among farmers in Satkhira (aOR = 4.41, 95% CI: 2.06–9.75,p< 0.001) and Khulna (aOR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.47–6.39,p< 0.01) than in Bagerhat. Poor self-rated health (aOR = 25.46,p< 0.001) and those with less than secondary education (aOR = 16.72,p< 0.01) were associated with reported issues. Knowledge of occupational safety measures significantly increased the probability of reporting health problems (aOR = 87.13,p< 0.001); trained farmers reported higher health difficulties most likely due to increased awareness (aOR = 0.13 for untrained farmers,p< 0.001). Environmental hazards and incorrect chemical handling continue even with hygienic procedures and personal protection equipment (PPE) laws usually embraced (99.26% of individuals used masks and gloves, for example). These results underscore the need for education-sensitive, locally directed health-safety efforts and imply that more accurate health reporting could follow from better awareness.

Shrimp farming is an essential part of Bangladesh’s economy, especially along the coast in the Southwest, where shrimp is one of the main exports [1,2]. Over the past few decades, the sector has seen notable expansion; Bangladesh is among the top shrimp exporters worldwide [3–6]. Bangladesh’s agricultural systems have developed from conventional to more advanced, resulting in an enormous variety of farming practices and related health hazards for farmers [7]. A major intermediate system that combines aspects of conventional aquaculture methods with some new technologies to boost shrimp output without the high expenses connected with entirely intensive farming systems is improved traditional shrimp farming [7,8]. Unlike semi-intensive or intensive systems, which need high stocking densities, external feeding, and mechanical aeration, the improved traditional setup usually maintains lower stocking densities. It integrates superior management techniques and low-technology interventions; however, it mostly depends on natural inputs, including water exchange and natural feed sources [9]. To increase the sustainability of shrimp farming, this method usually consists of basic changes such as improved water quality monitoring, better pond management, and more efficient disease control [10].

Although these developments have financial advantages, they also bring new challenges, particularly concerning the occupational health of shrimp farmers, as those related to aquaculture [11–15]. Among the several physical, chemical, and biological threats, farmers face pathogenic illnesses from shrimp farming conditions, as well as injuries from handling equipment and chemical exposure [12,14]. Furthermore, contributing to the frequency of health-related issues are inadequate working environment, improper protective gear, and low knowledge of occupational health hazards [13].

Though various studies on occupational health in aquaculture have been conducted in Bangladesh, most have concentrated on general farming conditions or intensive systems. Now accounting for a sizable portion of shrimp output in the nation, a lack of research has investigated the particular occupational health dynamics within improved traditional shrimp farming systems.

Particularly concerning their self-reported health state, the health and safety circumstances of shrimp farmers in Bangladesh sometimes lack documentation. In epidemiological research, self-reported health status is a commonly used indicator to evaluate an individual’s perceived health, which may not necessarily coincide with clinical diagnosis but offers insightful information on an individual’s perceived quality of life and health issues [16,17]. Age, education, training, exposure to occupational hazards, and other factors can heavily affect self-reported health status. Interpreting data requires a knowledge of these factors [18,19]. For instance, older persons routinely assessed their health as poorer than younger cohorts, which reflects age-related health issues and higher morbidity risk [20]. People from lower socioeconomic origins can encounter obstacles such as limited access to health care, poor living circumstances, and more stress, all of which help to create bad impressions of their health [21]. Self-reported health issues in the context of shrimp farming often include musculoskeletal diseases, respiratory problems, skin diseases, and stress-related symptoms [13].

Studies in many different agricultural industries, including aquaculture, have extensively applied the idea of self-reported health-related concerns to capture the subjective health status of workers in various sectors [22,23]. Water treatment and disease control in shrimp farming depend on several substances. Many farmers claim health concerns connected to their drug use, which could include skin illnesses, respiratory problems, and other chronic diseases [24]. The ignorance of the safe handling of these substances aggravates the health hazards these employees expose. Nevertheless, because of their exposure to dangerous chemicals, lack of protective gear, and insufficient health training, self-reported health status among Bangladeshi shrimp farmers is generally poor [24].

Although working conditions and health outcomes in aquaculture have a clear link [12,14], research especially addressing factors affecting self-reported health issues among improved traditional shrimp farmers in Bangladesh is lacking. Examining how health-safety training, perception, and geographical variations interact to comprehend the self-reported health status of shrimp farmers utilizing improved traditional methods still leaves a void. Our study addresses this neglected junction and offers actual data based on quantitative analysis and region-specific insights. While occupational health hazards and their factors are still understudied, most current research on shrimp farming in Bangladesh concentrates on production efficiency, environmental sustainability, or export market dynamics [2,7]. Research on aquaculture-related occupational health concerns [11,15] shows substantial risks, including waterborne infections, musculoskeletal problems, and chemical exposure. Still, few comparable empirical studies have been conducted in the Bangladeshi shrimp farming industry. Moreover, self-reported health conditions have been extensively employed in epidemiology research as a useful indicator of health outcomes [16,17]. However, its use in the framework of shrimp farming is still rare. Developing focused interventions, improving farmer well-being, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the shrimp industry in Bangladesh depend on an awareness of the occupational health consequences within this farming model, given the growing reliance on improved traditional shrimp farming as a sustainable alternative to intense systems [8].

This study contributes to the literature by focusing on improved traditional shrimp farming, analyzing health-related perceptions and behaviors considering district-level variations and training exposure. Using hierarchical and stepwise regression models provides further depth, offering a comprehensive picture largely missing in past research.

This study explored the factors affecting self-reported occupational health issues among improved traditional shrimp farmers in Southwestern Bangladesh. We have used a cross-sectional method since it allows us to evaluate interactions among several factors at one point. Identifying the key factors affecting health perceptions and safety measures among shrimp farmers is appropriate. The study region included three key areas of Bangladesh’s shrimp-producing districts: Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat, which were chosen depending on their relevance in shrimp farming (Fig.1). These places were primarily selected because of their economic importance, large number of shrimp farms, and diverse environmental factors influencing occupational health hazards. Three sub-districts were selected inside every district depending on their accessibility and degree of shrimp production; local fisheries officials confirmed representativeness through validation. The chosen sub-districts were Dakope, Paikgacha, and Botiaghata in Khulna District; the Satkhira District comprises Shyamnagar, Ashashuni, Kaliganj; the Bagerhat District comprises Bagerhat Sadar, Mongla, Rampal.

A purposive stratified sampling method was used to ensure a balanced representation. The stratified and deliberate approach ensured the study included a broad spectrum of geographic, financial, and environmental conditions. Respondents were equally spread across Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat to represent regional differences in health conditions. Each district was split into three sub-districts (Upazilas), producing nine sub-districts with thirty respondents each. Based on adopting improved traditional shrimp farming techniques, 270 shrimp farmers, 30 of each Upazila-were selected (Table1). This approach ensured that the studies fairly reflected the experiences of farmers engaged in the chosen farming approach.

Data were acquired from August to September 2022 using a structured questionnaire survey. The survey was conducted in local Bengali language. It focused on the factors that might affect the self-reported health problems of shrimp farmers. Developed based on earlier studies on occupational health and aquaculture, the questionnaire (please see supplementary file) was verified by an expert review and a pilot study.

The structured questionnaire included five sections: demographic data, health-safety training, health-safety perspectives, health-safety practices, and self-reported occupational health problems. With binary response options (Yes/No), the last section comprised the dependent variable-contained the statement, “I think I have an occupational health-related problem”.

Initially provided through a pilot survey with a limited sample of shrimp farms, the questionnaire was used to assess the questions’ clarity, validity, and relevance. Small changes generated by the pilot survey ensured that the final version appropriately identified the key factors affecting self-reported health problems. In addition, subject-matter experts in occupational health and shrimp farming contributed to the content validity.

Self-reported health assessments are subjective even if they provide an interesting analysis of occupational hazards to health and perceived well-being. Both individual health attitudes and memory bias could affect them. This study conducted no objective health assessments, that is, medical tests, clinical diagnosis, or biomarker testing. Although this limitation is recognized, future research should include physiological testing or clinical evaluations to support self-reported data and provide a more complete understanding of occupational health risks in improved traditional shrimp farming.

We used the ‘R’ program, version 4.2.2 [25], for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated as appropriate. Binary responses for the dependent variable were coded as 1 for “Yes” and 0 for “No”. Around 36% of the study population reported occupational-related health problems. Independent variables were selected based on theoretical relevance, empirical evidence, and statistical considerations. Key demographic factors such as district, age, marital status, education, income, and work experience were included due to their established influence on occupational health in aquaculture and agriculture [24]. Additionally, health safety training, perception, and practices were considered based on prior research suggesting their impact on self-reported health outcomes [26–29]. The dependent variable, self-reported occupational health-related problems, was measured using a binary response (Yes/No), reflecting farmers’ perceptions of their occupational health status.

A stepwise logistic regression model was employed to identify significant predictors of self-reported occupational health-related problems among shrimp farmers. This approach ensured optimal model selection by iteratively adding and removing variables based on statistical significance (p< 0.05), minimizing collinearity, and retaining only the most relevant factors. Before performing logistic regression, we tested model assumptions. Multicollinearity analysis was conducted to ensure that highly correlated variables were excluded, and since data were collected from independent shrimp farmers, the assumption of independence was not violated.

We also performed hierarchical logistic regression to assess the incremental impact of different predictor variables and enhance robustness. This method allowed us to evaluate how much additional variance was explained by each set of variables concerning occupational health problems. The stepwise approach identified key predictors, while the hierarchical model helped assess the relative contribution of sociodemographic factors, training, and perceptions in explaining health-related outcomes. We used both regression techniques to ensure statistical rigor and theoretical relevance in our analysis.

The study adhered to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later revisions, safeguarding respondent confidentiality and ensuring voluntary participation [30]. This study received approval from the ethical clearance committee of Khulna University, Bangladesh (Reference number: KUECC-2021/01/01). Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and no incentives were provided for participation in the survey.

Table2presents the study population. The respondents were evenly distributed across three districts: Bagerhat, Khulna, and Satkhira, with 33.33% from each district, reflecting a balanced regional representation. Many participants were between the ages of 26–35 (40%) and 36–45 (37.78%). The younger (18–25) and older (> 45) age groups comprised smaller portions, 9.26%, and 12.96%, respectively. 85.93% were married, and the remaining 14.07% were single. Most respondents had smaller families; 50.74% had less than four family members, and 41.85% had five to six members. Only a small proportion (7.41%) had families of more than 6 members. A considerable majority (55.93%) of respondents had education beyond the secondary level, while 38.52% had completed secondary education. Only a small fraction (5.56%) had less than secondary education. The study concentrated on literate farmers to ensure correct responses on occupational health, training participation, and health safety. Understanding important issues and Likert-scale responses requires literacy. Oral explanations were provided in Bengali to reduce bias, with enumerators assisting as needed. Future studies may use oral interviews or pictorial surveys to include non-literate respondents and examine their health perceptions.

The vast majority (90.74%) earned more than BDT 10,000 per month, indicating a relatively high income level among the shrimp farmers. The remaining 9.26% earned less than BDT 10,000. Most small-scale Bangladeshi shrimp farmers had low- or moderate incomes. Based on past economic evaluations, the BDT 10,000 cutoff separates subsistence farmers from those with consistent income. It is relevant for examining income-related health disparities since it fits local earnings and living standards. Future research should improve income categories to provide a more accurate evaluation of economic effects on perceptions of health.

With smaller groups having fewer than 5 years (28.89%), 11–15 years (12.59%), and more than 15 years of experience (7.04%), most participants (51.48%) had between 6 and 10 years of experience in shrimp farming. The data points generally to middle-aged, married, educated, and moderately experienced shrimp farmers in the research area. Especially in rural Bangladesh, their earnings show a relatively steady financial base.

Table3shows that the health and safety training makes it possible to reduce occupational health hazards among shrimp farmers. While 64.44% have undergone health safety training, 35.56% have not. Driven largely by NGOs (30.37%) and the Upazila Fisheries Office (29.26%), it demonstrates notable participation in training projects.

Despite these programs, many farmers still lack official hygiene, sanitation, and chemical control instructions. This difference highlights how urgently training outreach should be increased, especially in isolated or underdeveloped areas. Published by the Bangladesh Shrimp and Fish Foundation, a Code of Conduct seeks to increase food safety and sustainability in the aquaculture industry of shrimp [31]. This initiative emphasizes the need for health and safety education among shrimp farmers since it underlines the need for training at all production phases to guarantee compliance with international criteria.

The overall agreement on the need for training is clear: 99.63% of respondents agree that training in hygiene practices is required, and 100% acknowledge the need for sanitation training. Such strong agreement corresponds with earlier research [32,33] underlining the apparent link between improved farming methods and product quality concerning hygienic education. The wish to participate in further training courses is equally strong, as 99.63% of respondents claim they are ready for more educational possibilities. Farmers display a proactive attitude towards improving their methods in keeping with trends observed in similar research, whereby farmer participation in training corresponds strongly with improved production techniques and general farm management [33,34].

The large degree of agreement among respondents on the relevance of hygiene and sanitation training points to the areas that should receive initial priority in the following educational initiatives. Furthermore, given the great interest in participating in such projects, government agencies, NGOs, and stakeholders should design targeted training courses addressing specific challenges experienced by local shrimp farmers.

There are still significant gaps even if the shrimp farmers in Southwestern Bangladesh have upgraded their health safety instructions. The results of this study highlight the urgent need for more training courses to make sure every farmer has the information and instruments to ensure that their farming methods are sustainable. Closing these variations will increase the national shrimp output average and improve individual farmers’ quality of life. Through improved matching of international quality and safety criteria, Bangladesh might raise its profile in the worldwide shrimp market.

Table4on health-safety perception among shrimp farmers exposes several important perspectives on their knowledge and opinions about health and safety policies. 100% indicated awareness of health safety issues, and 69.26% said they knew about occupational health safety policies. This general understanding is encouraging since it offers a solid basis for putting more ordered safety precautions on shrimp farms to be followed.

Only 8.15% of respondents stated their health was poor; most responded as either good (64.81%) or moderately well (27.04%). These self-evaluations align with the results of related studies, which imply that farmers who have had training in health and hygiene are more likely to be confident with their condition. More favorable impressions of health often follow from better cleanliness, safer handling of inputs, and less exposure to toxic chemicals [32].

Although many (69.26%) of the respondents reported they knew occupational health safety strategies, a noteworthy fraction (30.74%) did not. This disparity emphasizes the requirement of ongoing education and training programs to guarantee that every farmer has the necessary knowledge to reduce the hazards of shrimp farming. In Vietnam, a project aimed at organic farming methods and environmental hygiene included thorough training classes for shrimp farmers [35]. This initiative sought to teach farmers environmentally friendly methods to safeguard their health and the ecology. The effectiveness of such training programs shows how focused educational efforts may significantly improve farmers’ knowledge and practices, therefore underlining the need for continuous training to solve issues in health safety awareness among shrimp farmers. Adapting and growing such models could help Bangladesh’s shrimp industry.

Strong awareness of the hazards connected with chemical exposure is shown by the overwhelming agreement among respondents on wearing face masks while using chemicals (99.63%) and preserving sanitation before and after chemical usage (99.63%). These findings reflect a clear understanding of chemical exposure risks, and they align with earlier research showing that poor protective measures often lead to respiratory and skin-related illnesses among shrimp workers [13]. Furthermore, the unanimous agreement on the dangers posed by consuming infected fish (98.52%) underscores an acute awareness of food safety risks that can arise from improper handling and management practices.

This general agreement on fundamental health and hygiene standards points to many farmers safeguarding their work environment, products, and selves. It is consistent with earlier studies showing that training courses significantly increase farmers’ knowledge and application of health safety precautions, improving farm management results [33]. For example, farmers in Bangladesh’s shrimp industry have noted significant gains in output once better management techniques were adopted because of their improved understanding and follow-through to safety procedures.

Although the data shows that shrimp farmers have a solid awareness and good view of health safety, there is still room for improvement in occupational health initiatives employing more education. Constant funding for training initiatives will ensure every farmer can apply preventative actions, providing better health results and safer working conditions within the shrimp farming community.

Table5shows information about Southwestern Bangladesh’s shrimp farmers’ health and safety practices. Although certain areas show space for development, responses show a dedication to safety precautions.

When handling pesticides, fertilizers, and insecticides, a large proportion of participants (99.26%) reported they wore masks, gloves, and other safety gear. It is a positive outcome that shows farmers’ rising knowledge of the possible health hazards connected to chemical exposure. Shrimp aquaculture maintains pond conditions employing fertilizers, antibiotics, and disinfectants. Extended use of these drugs might cause chronic poisoning, skin disorders, and respiratory problems.

According to previous research, these results emphasize the need to employ personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce occupational health hazards in aquaculture [32]. According to the study, correct PPE use among shrimp farmers substantially reduces the health hazards related to chemical exposure. It emphasizes that farmers who receive safety training are more likely to implement preventive actions, reducing their risk of occupational diseases such as skin irritations and respiratory issues brought on by chemical contact during farming operations. It corresponds with our results that many farmers handle dangerous chemicals using PPE.

Every farmer said they followed simple hygienic standards, including washing their hands, legs, and face following daily tasks and hand washing before and after applying feeds, pesticides, and fertilizers. This worldwide acceptance of personal hygiene habits is evidence of knowledge and discipline, which are vital in preventing disease spread and contamination. According to prior research, maintaining cleanliness in aquaculture settings significantly lowers the risk of illnesses among aquatic species and humans [32].

Most farmers (94.07%) keep fish feed in dry conditions to avoid spoiling and contamination. Feed that gets wet can produce chemicals dangerous for humans and shrimp, including mycotoxins, which substantially compromise health. Fish feed kept dry helps avoid mold development and contamination from harmful microbes, preventing spoiling. Mycotoxins produced by mold harm shrimp health and cause major farmer financial losses. Furthermore, tainted feed puts human health in danger; if personnel handling the shrimp eat it, foodborne diseases could result [36]. Farmers fed moldy food could have allergic responses and respiratory problems. Good storage of feed helps farmers reduce these health hazards. It is especially pertinent in humid areas such as Bangladesh, where moisture control is essential to stop mold spread [37].

Almost all respondents (99.63%) follow suitable safety precautions when handling raw foods. It shows an excellent understanding of food safety criteria, including the prevention of foodborne diseases and cross-contamination avoidance. Foodborne diseases can have major medical effects on consumers; producers can have major financial ones. Farmers and employees may substantially reduce the danger of spreading microorganisms that cause these diseases by implementing suitable safety precautions, including hand washing, using separate utensils for raw and cooked food, and keeping clean working surroundings. According to our survey, most farmers (98.89%) also wash cars and transportation items using clean water following use. This method helps avoid contamination between markets and farms.

Every respondent said they guard their health by consulting reliable information sources. It shows that farmers are open to advice from training courses, extension services, or seasoned colleagues and know safety procedures. Likewise, a majority (99.26%) indicated they advise others and ask for a break when sick, preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

While most (93.70%) of respondents disagreed with this behavior, a small fraction (1.85%) admitted eating or promoting contaminated fish. Although this is encouraging, it emphasizes the need for ongoing education on the hazards connected with eating or selling contaminated fish, especially concerning consumer health and food safety.

All things considered, many of the shrimp farmers in our survey show excellent respect for safety and hygienic standards. Still, training in areas such as food safety, chemical handling, and correct feed storage is much needed. Through focused instruction and continuous monitoring, building on current practices helps to lower occupational hazards and enhance human health and product quality in the shrimp farming industry of Bangladesh.

Table6presents the results of a stepwise-backward multiple logistic regression predicting the likelihood of occupational health-related problems among shrimp farmers. The model evaluates several sociodemographic, training, and health safety-related factors. The district of residence was a significant predictor of health-related problems. Farmers in Khulna (aOR = 3.02, CI:1.47–6.39,p< 0.01) and Satkhira (aOR = 4.41, CI:2.06–9.75,p< 0.001) are notably more likely to report health problems than those in Bagerhat. This regional variation can reflect operational, environmental, and infrastructure aspects. For instance, Khulna and Satkhira are well-known for more rigorous farming methods involving higher stocking densities and increased chemical use. These methods raise the possibility of pesticide exposure, compromising farmers’ health. Variations may also influence farmers’ frequency of diseases and health issues in water quality, soil composition, and climate. Studies have shown that shrimp farming can increase soil and groundwater salinity and pollution, which might be prevalent in regions like Khulna and Satkhira [38,39]. Rising sea levels and increased salinity due to climate change have been linked to higher waterborne diseases and skin infections among shrimp farmers. Extreme weather like floods and cyclones worsen already hazardous working conditions and expose farms to polluted water supplies. Among farmers, these environmental pressures could aggravate health issues. More studies are required to identify the elements that cause these regional variations.

Marital status showed a statistically significant association. Unmarried people reported health-related issues (aOR = 0.35, CI: 0.11–0.94,p= 0.05) far less often. One could explain this by differences in health-seeking behavior. Married people usually feel more accountable for the welfare of their family. They might be more conscious of their health or more likely to be urged for treatment by partners. On the other hand, single farmers could put income or jobs before their health and have fewer support networks, pushing them to seek treatment. These dynamics have been noted in previous health studies that link marital status to care utilization and reporting behavior [40,41].

Education level was another strong predictor. Farmers with less than secondary education (aOR = 16.72, CI: 2.90- 320.16,p< 0.01) were likelier to report health-related problems than those with higher than secondary education. It implies that reduced degrees of formal education could limit a farmer’s capacity to grasp and apply safe techniques. On the other hand, it could also show less educated farmers’ increased sensitivity to health hazards since they might operate in less controlled or higher-risk surroundings. Studies from other settings, including Egypt, have indicated that improved interpretation of health warnings and safer management of pesticides correspond with education [42]. After educational training, an intervention study revealed notable increases in safe pesticide usage among farmers, suggesting that education can alter attitudes and practices connected with health and safety [43]. It implies that focused educational programs can help reduce the health hazards that less educated farmers operate [44]. Furthermore, customized training courses that fit farmers’ educational backgrounds could improve knowledge retention and useful application.

Farmers without official health-safety training reported occupational health problems less often (aOR = 0.13, CI: 0.06–0.27,p= 0.001). Though initially contradictory, this could mean that training increases awareness, enabling farmers to be more able to identify and record symptoms. On the other hand, Untrained farmers could undervalue or ignore symptoms, normalizing them. Moreover, skilled people may often work in potentially hazardous surroundings, which increases the possibility of reporting health issues.

Farmers who rated their health as moderately good (aOR = 3.43, CI: 1.79–6.72,p< 0.001) and poor (aOR = 25.46, CI: 5.95-203.59,p< 0.001) were significantly more likely to report health-related problems compared to those who rated their health as good. This finding aligns with previous studies [16,18] showing that self-perception of health strongly predicts morbidity and healthcare utilization. Those who already view their health as compromised are more likely to be vigilant about symptoms and seek help or report concerns.

Finally, farmers with knowledge of occupational health safety strategies had a substantially higher likelihood of reporting health problems (aOR = 87.13, CI: 17.24-1630.78,p< 0.001). This result supports the idea that awareness does not increase the number of health problems but improves a farmer’s ability to recognize and report them. Growing consciousness helps one to identify symptoms, know their causes, and respond appropriately.

The model stresses several crucial factors influencing the understanding and reporting of health problems among shrimp farmers. Geography, education, training, and personal health perspectives contribute meaningfully. Furthermore, a personal situation that includes awareness and marital status affects the way hazards are found and reduced. These realizations guide policy and intervention development in responding to the hazards farmers encounter and the challenges in recognizing and documenting such hazards.

Table7shows the outcomes of a hierarchical multiple logistic regression model estimating self-reported occupational health-related issues among Bangladesh’s shrimp farmers. Three analysis steps are undertaken, adding more specific variables to the model: Control factors comprise Step 1; health-safety training is added in Step 2; knowledge and health-safety perceptions are included in Step 3.

Several sociodemographic factors in the first model revealed notable associations with reporting health issues. Health problems were more commonly reported by farmers from Khulna (aOR = 3.01, CI: 1.47–6.39,p= 0.01) and Satkhira (aOR = 4.40, CI: 2.06–9.75,p= 0.001) than by those from Bagerhat. However, in Steps 2 and 3, when training and perception variables were included, the relevance of regional variations lessened. It implies that variations in exposure, awareness, or availability of training resources may rather be responsible for the higher reporting in Khulna and Satkhira than geography alone.

Married farmers were much less likely to report health problems in Step 1 (aOR = 0.35, CI = 0.11 to 0.94,p= 0.05). However, this effect disappeared from the newer models. It implies that marital status may indirectly affect health reporting, maybe through variations in social support or health-seeking behavior. Once factors like training and awareness are considered, marital status loses importance in explaining reporting patterns.

Educational background also showed a strong effect in the first two models. Farmers with less than secondary education had much higher odds of reporting health problems (Model I: aOR = 16.72, CI: 2.90–320.16,p< 0.01; Model II: aOR = 37.71, CI: 5.57–89.54,p< 0.01). However, this association weakened considerably in Model III (aOR = 6.37, CI: 0.84–133.70,p< 0.01), suggesting that the influence of education may be partly mediated by health-safety training and awareness. In other words, lower education levels may increase risk exposure, but knowledge and training can help compensate for those limitations.

Monthly income was not a significant predictor in any of the three models. It indicates that income level alone may not determine whether farmers report health problems. While income can influence access to care or protective gear, those aspects were not directly captured in this model.

When health-safety training was added in Step 2, it emerged as a powerful predictor. Farmers without training were significantly less likely to report health issues (aOR = 0.10, CI: 0.03–0.27,p< 0.001). This finding reinforces that training increases awareness and improves farmers’ ability to identify and acknowledge occupational health problems. Without such training, farmers may fail to recognize or attribute their symptoms to workplace exposure.

Step 3 introduced two additional factors: self-rated health and knowledge of occupational health strategies. Farmers who rated their health as moderately good (aOR = 3.58, CI: 1.66–7.99,p< 0.001) or poor (aOR = 17.46, CI: 3.01–179.64,p< 0.001) were far more likely to report health issues compared to those who rated their health as good. It is consistent with expectations, as those with declining health are naturally more likely to report symptoms and seek help.

Farmers who knew occupational health safety strategies had an extraordinarily high likelihood of reporting health problems (aOR = 51.19, CI: 6.52- 1115.47,p< 0.01). It suggests that knowledge does not lead to more health problems but enables better recognition and self-reporting of symptoms. Farmers who understand the risks are more likely to monitor their health and acknowledge potential issues.

In summary, the hierarchical regression analysis highlights the importance of education, training, and safety awareness in shaping how shrimp farmers perceive and report occupational health risks. While certain sociodemographic factors influence the initial model, their impact decreases when introducing health knowledge and perception variables. This pattern reinforces the critical role of targeted education and safety programs in improving health outcomes in the shrimp farming sector.

This study provides some essential policy recommendations for improving the occupational health standards among Bangladeshi shrimp farmers. Training courses are crucial but cannot run effectively without more general institutional and constitutional support.

Initiatives for training shouldn’t stop with just increasing awareness. They must provide practical, hands-on instruction in areas including proper use of protective gear, safe chemical handling, and excellent hygienic standards. The long-term impact of these initiatives will be assured by well-defined government policies and regular follow-up visits from local agriculture or fisheries officials who can provide direction and ensure that safety measures are followed.

Stronger occupational health and safety regulations are needed in high-risk locations like Khulna and Satkhira. Local occupational health rules should include a more exact application of safety criteria and regular health inspections in these domains. Early risk detection, made possible by on-site inspections and consistent health monitoring, helps farmers prevent long-term health problems.

Support strategies should also consider the social and economic concerns many farmers run upon. Educational materials must be simple, clear, and logical for those with less education. Safety knowledge should be readily available using spoken instructions in local dialects, visual aids, or community events. Among the financial measures that could motivate farmers to use safer practices and reduce their exposure to health risks are low-cost safety gear or free health exams. Improving occupational health in shrimp farming calls for a complete plan covering education, control, financial aid, and local involvement. It is possible to build a safer and more sustainable future for shrimp farmers throughout Bangladesh through combined efforts in many spheres.

This study shows valuable insights into the occupational health concerns of traditional shrimp farmers in Bangladesh. However, several significant limitations need to be acknowledged. The most important limitation is that the findings are based entirely on information reported by the farmers themselves. While this method helps capture their understanding and experience of health problems, the data may be affected by memory lapses, personal interpretation, or the tendency to answer in a socially acceptable way. We included clear examples in the survey to help respondents understand the questions more easily, but their answers still reflect personal beliefs rather than medical evaluations. The study excluded any physical health assessments or clinical diagnostics. Future studies should consider producing more consistent and fair conclusions by combining expert health assessments with personal reports.

The sampling technique presents still another restriction. We chose farmers from numerous districts and sub-districts based on particular criteria, such as farming experience and participation in enhanced traditional methods. This approach enabled us to incorporate several farming settings; the choice was not random. Consequently, the results should be seen as indicative rather than accurately reflecting all Bangladeshi shrimp farmers. In future research, random sample techniques would help to lower probable selection bias and enhance general conclusions.

Additionally, this was a cross-sectional study, meaning data were collected at only one point. Because of this, we cannot determine whether certain factors cause the health problems reported. A longer study that follows farmers over a while would help explain how health risks develop and how farming practices may influence them.

We used logistic regression techniques to identify important factors related to reported health issues. While this method supports a focused and organized analysis, its findings must be interpreted carefully because of the sampling method. The relationships between certain variables and health outcomes should be considered associations rather than direct causes. Future research may employ more sophisticated statistical methods accounting for these constraints.

While the study concentrated on three major areas, farming conditions, and environmental hazards varied substantially throughout the nation. Farmers in other areas may have different health conditions depending on variations in water salinity, soil quality, farming intensity, and healthcare availability. Future research should include more areas to build a broader understanding of the health risks facing shrimp farmers nationwide.

Despite these limitations, the study has several strengths that make its findings valuable. The inclusion of farmers from different locations allowed us to observe patterns across a range of farming situations. The questionnaire was carefully developed and tested before data collection, ensuring consistent and clear responses. Using more than one statistical model helped identify important social and health-related factors affecting farmer’s experience and report occupational health problems. Ethical standards were strictly followed throughout the study, and all participants took part willingly and with full awareness. Most importantly, the study focuses on a group of farmers often left out of research. By examining improved traditional shrimp farming, we offer useful information and guidance for future training programs and health policies that aim to protect and support this important workforce.

This research is significant in that it highlights the health challenges that shrimp farmers in Bangladesh encounter daily, particularly those engaged in improved traditional farming methods. The results demonstrate that farmers’ recognition and reporting of health issues is significantly influenced by education, practical training, and a clear understanding of health hazards. It is comforting to observe that many producers practice good hygiene and wear protective gear; however, safety protocols still have substantial deficiencies. The effects of these issues are particularly apparent in regions such as Khulna and Satkhira, where the working conditions are more rigorous. General awareness campaigns alone are inadequate to confront these obstacles. Local institutions must provide farmers with support, reliable access to safety apparatus, and training tailored to their unique environment. Research conducted in the future should not exclusively depend on personal accounts of health conditions. Including clinical assessments and long-term observations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of cultivation on health. Also crucial is the examination of how environmental conditions and changing weather contribute to health hazards. There is potential for farmers to enhance their health and implement safer practices in their daily work through the implementation of innovative strategies, such as locally designed training programs or mobile applications.
