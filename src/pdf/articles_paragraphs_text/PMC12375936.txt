Aggression and violence toward nurses is a growing problem in Canadian emergency departments. Existing literature often examines this issue through an individualistic lens, focusing primarily on individual behaviors of patients and staff, with limited attention to organizational and structural factors contributing to root causes. This paper presents a secondary analysis of a larger data set – including interviews with hospital staff, observational field notes, and open‐ended patient survey responses – to explore the structural and contextual factors shaping aggression and violence in emergency departments. Using a structural lens informed by critical theoretical perspectives and guided by interpretive description, the research team conducted a thematic analysis to identify recurrent patterns across the data sources. The analysis reveals how policies, power relations, and institutional norms shape the conditions that give rise to violence, moving beyond individual‐level explanations. Three themes were identified: (a) significant stress and frustration is the contextual backdrop, (b) dominant norms and a culture of efficiency in the emergency department create and maintain a stressful environment, and (c) widespread health and social inequities and a lack of community resources exacerbate stress and frustration. This analysis demonstrates that addressing aggression and violence requires multi‐pronged strategies that engage with the structural contexts shaping these events.

Aggression and violence toward healthcare staff is a growing problem in Canadian healthcare settings. Nurses, who represent the largest segment of healthcare professionals in Canada (Canadian Institute for Health Information2022), reportedly experience aggression and violence at rates four times higher than other professional groups (Havaei et al.2020). A study by Havaei et al. conducted in 2020 with nurses in British Columbia, Canada, indicates that nurses encounter a continuum of violent acts at alarming rates. Approximately 83% of nurses have experienced emotional abuse, 78% have faced threats of assault, and 67% have encountered physical assault at least once in their careers (Havaei et al.2020). These rates were highest for nurses working in emergency departments (EDs), where up to 97% of ED nurses reported experiencing violence at least once during their careers (Havaei et al.2020).

Aggression and violence has been shown to contribute to a myriad of multifaceted, short‐ and long‐term effects. These include physical harm to staff, burnout, reduced job satisfaction, compromised patient care, and significant financial costs from increased staff absences (Blando et al.2013; Havaei et al.2020; Provost et al.2021). Despite Canada's international reputation for having a robust, nationally funded healthcare system, all sectors are functioning under extreme pressure, exacerbated by widening social inequities, the toxic drug crisis, the enduring impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic, an aging population with high rates of multi‐morbidity, and critical shortages in health human resources, resulting in a dire staffing crisis (Public Health Agency of Canada2020,2021; Canadian Academy of Health Sciences2023; Health Canada2024). Discussions of aggression and violence toward nurses must be situated within these broader systemic conditions and recognize their detrimental impact not only on individual healthcare workers but also on the health system as a whole.

This paper explores factors contributing to aggression and violence experienced by nurses through a secondary analysis of a subset of data from a larger, mixed‐methods study known asEQUIP Emergency(Varcoe et al.2019). Given the high prevalence of aggression and violence in EDs (Havaei et al.2020), this paper specifically examines this issue within the ED setting. The authors examine contributing factors at individual, organizational1, and structural2levels to provide a comprehensive understanding of aggression and violence in EDs. While the presence of aggression and violence in EDs is well established in existing literature – and was a prominent theme raised by both patients and staff in the larger study – this analysis does not aim to provide evidence that aggression and violence occurs. Instead, it critically examines how organizational and structural conditions create environments in which aggression and violence is more likely to arise. Through a thematic analysis of patient responses to open‐ended survey questions, observational field notes, and interviews with ED staff, the research team identifies how complex multifaceted factors intersect to contribute to aggression and violence. Drawing from these insights, the authors conclude by offering recommendations to prevent and better manage aggression and violence in EDs.

Terms such as “workplace violence” and “aggression and violence” are often used interchangeably in the literature, and no single definition exists to define this phenomenon of interest. The International Council of Nurses defines workplace violence in their position statement as any “actual and attempted incidents of physical and verbal violence which may be in the form of sexual, physical and/or verbal assault or abuse, bullying and harassment in circumstances related to work” (International Council of Nurses2017, 1). In their article from nearly two decades ago, Wand and Coulson (2006) use the combined term “aggression and violence in the workplace,” which captures a continuum of acts, verbal and non‐verbal, both intentional and unintentional, that may or may not result in actual harm.

Both definitions focus mainly on individual behaviors and lack recognition that individuals may feel unsafe in their workplace even in the absence of explicit “incidents of aggression and violence”. Nurses might experience practices that have become norms in healthcare settings, such as unsafe staffing practices and the pervasive pressure to expedite patient care (Canadian Academy of Health Sciences2023; Health Canada2024; International Council of Nurses2017). These structural conditions can contribute to environments where aggression and violence is more likely to occur. For example, unsafe staffing might lead to a situation where nurses are responsible for many patients with little time and support. As a result, patients and families can feel frustrated, which has been shown in the literature to be a common reason as to why aggression or violence might develop (Lown and Setnik2018). Even in the absence of explicit physical or verbal abuse, nurses working within environments characterized by these systemic issues can experience a sense of vulnerability and a general lack of safety (Havaei et al.2020). Thus, to encompass a broader understanding of the phenomenon, in this paper, the authors use the term “aggression and violence” to refer not only to explicit behaviors of individuals but also to organizational norms within healthcare settings, such as a culture of efficiency, that create potentially unsafe environments in which nurses work.

This study employs a structural lens guided by critical theoretical perspectives to investigate the organizational and structural factors that extend beyond individual behaviors of patients and staff, or their interactions (Browne and Reimer‐Kirkham2014; Kirkham and Browne2006; Varcoe et al.2022). Critical theoretical perspectives encompass a range of theories that highlight power relations and various intersecting oppressions which advantage specific individuals while disadvantaging others (Browne and Reimer‐Kirkham2014; Kirkham and Browne2006). In alignment with a critical paradigm, the concept of equity‐oriented healthcare has been articulated to reorient healthcare systems in a way that recognizes structural violence and how intersectional inequities related to racism, poverty, gender, substance use stigma, or other forms of discrimination, influence a person's opportunities for health and access to healthcare (Browne and Reimer‐Kirkham2014; Ford‐Gilboe et al.2018; Kirkham and Browne2006). A structural lens prompts researchers to examine the broader social, economic, and political systems that shape the conditions in which aggression and violence toward nurses occurs. Rather than focusing solely on individual behaviors, this perspective highlights how organizational policies, workplace hierarchies, resource distribution, and systemic inequities contribute to the persistence of violence, shaping both its occurrence and the responses to it (Mental Health Commission of Canada2023; Crammond and Carey2017). These perspectives are invaluable in challenging the current “status quo” in how aggression or violence is perceived and responded to in EDs (Doane and Varcoe2021; Ford‐Gilboe et al.2018; Kirkham and Browne2006; Varcoe et al.2019). This analysis aims to facilitate a deeper comprehension of the underlying causes of aggression and violence by shifting beyond the primary focus on individuals to consider the influence of broader structural factors.

The literature on aggression and violence in healthcare frequently reflects an individualistic perspective focusing primarily on individual behaviors, actions, or characteristics as the main factors contributing to aggression and violence. An individualistic approach may result in assigning blame to either the patient or the nurse as the sole reason for the development of aggression or violence (Browne2001; Doane and Varcoe2021). For example, Nowrouzi‐Kia et al. (2019) explored the antecedent factors of aggression and violence toward nurses in EDs. This systematic review identifies “patients who have a mental health disorder, use alcohol and drugs, have a history of stress and aggression and/or feel a sense of powerlessness” as precipitating factors for aggression and violence (Nowrouzi‐Kia et al.2019, 6). Additionally, this study reports that “patients who were administered incorrect medication or disregarded by nurses with their medical questions bullied their nurses through intimidating behaviors” (Nowrouzi‐Kia et al.2019, 6). In these quotes, aggression or violence are being attributed to the patient or the nurse, inadvertently assigning blame, whether intentional or not. The intent is not to criticize the study findings presented by Nowrouzi‐Kia et al. (2019) or others but rather to emphasize the prevalence of individualistic discourses in current discussions about aggression and violence toward nurses.

Often missing from assessments rooted in individualistic perspectives are analyses of the contexts that contribute to aggression and violence at the organizational, societal, and broader systemic levels (Browne2001). For example, in a study by Spelten et al. (2020) conducted in Australia, the authors held focus groups with nurses to identify categories of perpetrators of workplace violence. These categories include “violence related to underlying mental health issues,” “violence related to substance abuse and addiction,” and “violence related to physical health issues.” While the study acknowledges how factors such as increased wait times and staff experience levels might influence the occurrence of aggression and violence, the primary focus is on identifying traits of perpetrators, offering limited exploration of the broader organizational or systemic contexts in which these incidents occur.

A limitation of studies that focus solely on individual‐level contributing factors to aggression and violence is that they often lead to individual‐level recommendations for response strategies. For instance, much of the literature offering strategies to prevent and manage aggression and violence suggests response strategies that focus on individual‐level factors, such as increasing security presence and equipping staff with personal panic alarms (Blando et al.2013; Taylor and Rew2011). These approaches are reactive rather than preventive, and their effectiveness in improving nurses' perceptions of workplace safety has been limited (Havaei et al.2020; Wand and Coulson2006).

To address this gap, this paper employs a structural approach grounded in critical theoretical perspectives to better understand why aggression and violence directed at nurses occurs. The following research question guided this analysis: How do individual, organizational, and structural factors influence the occurrence of aggression and violence experienced by nurses in EDs? Considering the influence of broader structures offers insights regarding potential upstream response strategies for preventing and managing aggression and violence, thus more effectively ensuring safer environments for nurses and patients.

The analysis presented in this paper is based on a secondary analysis of data originally collected for a larger, mixed‐methods study known asEQUIP Emergency.EQUIP Emergencyis a multi‐site project focused on studying the effectiveness of an organizational intervention designed to enhance the delivery of equity‐oriented healthcare in three diverse EDs in British Columbia, Canada (Varcoe et al.2019). An inner‐city hospital, a suburban hospital, and a northern region hospital, each from different health authorities, were selected to maximize the diversity of settings. The intervention was tailored and implemented by direct care staff to address needs identified within each unique ED context. The impact of the intervention was assessed using various measures including open‐ended and closed‐ended questions in a patient survey collected pre‐ and post‐intervention, in‐depth interviews with ED staff, observational field notes collected by research staff throughout the implementation timeline from 2017 to 2021, and analyses of administrative data. Findings from responses to the closed‐ended patient survey questions, and analyses of administrative data are discussed in prior publications (Varcoe et al.2022; Varcoe et al.2022). The research team gathered observational data about the ED's general milieu and environment. Within theEQUIP Emergencydata, the authors recognized that the context of EDs was influenced by issues related to aggression and violence, catalyzing the idea for this secondary analysis study.

The primary methodology guiding the secondary qualitative data analysis presented in this paper is a thematic analysis informed by interpretive description (ID) (Thorne2017). Initially designed for nursing research, ID aims to generate clinically applicable knowledge. It is a flexible approach enabling the identification of common themes while respecting the unique context of individual experiences. ID supports data triangulation with various sources, allowing the researchers to capture diverse perspectives and in‐depth contextual exploration of aggression and violence. Employing ID for this study enhances both the depth and breadth of the analysis, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of aggression and violence experienced by nurses in EDs.

The authors assessed the rigor of the research discussed in this paper using Lincoln and Guba's criteria for “trustworthiness,” including credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability, and authenticity (Morse2018; Schwandt et al.2007). The data collected fromEQUIP Emergency, spanning varying sites and time points, ensures an extensive, comprehensive data set that captures multiple events overtime. The first author, who led the analysis presented in this paper, employed reflexivity strategies to acknowledge their influence, collaborated with the team to explore bias during coding, and adhered to ethical considerations outlined by Canadian health and social science funding bodies (Canadian Institutes of Health Research2018). Ethical approval for this study was provided by the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board (approval number: H21‐01850).

This study is based on a secondary analysis of data collected for a larger study calledEQUIP Emergency(Varcoe et al.2019). The findings presented in this current paper stem from examining three specific data sources fromEQUIP Emergency: (1) qualitative responses to open‐ended questions in a patient survey about their experiences of care, (2) observational field notes recorded by researchers (including the authors of this paper and trained research staff), and (3) in‐depth interviews with ED staff. These data were collected at various timepoints between 2017 and 2021 (Varcoe et al.2022; Varcoe et al.2022).

For the largerEQUIP Emergencystudy, the primary author (C.C.) of this study and co‐authors (A.J.B. and C.V.) were responsible for coding these data sets, and thus, all the primary data in their complete forms were read, and the authors had established familiarity with the content of the data in each data source. NVivo, a qualitative data management software (SAGE Research Methods2021), was used to create coding categories for each data source within the larger study. Given theEQUIP Emergencyresearch team members' comprehensive understanding of the larger data set's themes, the authors recognized aggression and violence as prominent, prompting the idea for this secondary analysis study.

In this study, the authors analyzed a subset of data from the three mentioned sources. Leveraging their familiarity with the original data sets, the authors extracted specific codes deemed relevant to the study's aims from each source. Importantly, the coding strategy varied slightly across the three data sources to align with the distinct content and focus of each data set. For instance, data from interviews with ED staff were retrieved by filtering for codes such as “context of the ED,” “violence and security,” “people who use substances,” “mental health concerns,” and “discourses about Indigenous people.” For the patient open‐ended survey responses, codes relevant to patients' descriptions of their experiences, such as “staff‐patient interactions,” “safety concerns,” and “feelings of being judged or mistreated,” were used. Similarly, observational field notes were retrieved using codes such as “aggression,” “violence,” “security surveillance,” and “general milieu of the ED.” This tailored coding approach ensured that each data set was analyzed in a manner that captured the unique aspects of the data while remaining aligned with the study's objectives.

Patient surveys were conducted during planned intervals throughout theEQUIP Emergencystudy period to evaluate patients' experiences at each ED site. Research staff were present in the ED for approximately 2 weeks at each time point, ensuring diverse coverage throughout the day. Observation and survey recruitment occurred during a range of hours, including daytime, evening, and overnight shifts, to ensure data collection reflected variability in ED operations and patient volume. The objective was to invite every adult patient presenting to the ED during data collection time blocks to participate in the study. Every patient presenting to the EDs who was over the age of 18 and appeared able to consent (e.g., was conscious) was approached to participate (Varcoe et al.2022). Upon consent, participants completed a survey comprised of closed‐ended and open‐ended questions about their demographic characteristics and current ED visit experiences. These recruitment efforts resulted in a sample that is diverse and generally representative of the broader population. A detailed description of patients' demographic characteristics is provided in Varcoe et al. (2022). The research discussed in the current paper focuses on analyzing the responses provided by patients to the following two open‐ended questions: (a) What stood out to you about your experience during your most recent visit to the ED? and (b) What do you hope is different the next time you come to the ED? Analysis of responses to closed‐ended questions is reported in Varcoe et al. (2022).

For the purpose of this secondary analysis, the authors examined the qualitative patient survey responses collected before the intervention period. A total of 1692 patients completed the survey. After selecting specific codes within this data set, as described above, 443 patient responses were deemed relevant to aggression and violence and re‐examined for the purpose of this study.

In total, 26 interviews were conducted with 24 ED staff members involved in theEQUIP Emergencyintervention across the three sites. These staff members held various roles, spanning from direct patient care to executive leadership, encompassing both nursing and non‐nursing positions. Table1shows the variety of roles of the in‐depth interview participants.

Direct patient care roles include staff who provide direct patient care in any form. Nursing roles include both Registered Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses. Non‐nursing roles include social workers, healthcare aides, volunteers, and an elder.

Nursing leadership roles include roles such as nurse educator, nurse clinician, or nurse manager.

Executive leadership roles include leadership roles at the higher hospital or health authority level.

While not all interviews were re‐examined in their entirety, this study focuses on segments that contribute to a better understanding of aggression and violence toward nurses. After filtering through the interview content using the described process, 97 passages from 21 interviews were re‐examined for this study. It's important to note that despite focusing on specific segments, the authors still had a comprehensive understanding of the transcripts as a whole, given their involvement in the original coding of the data sets forEQUIP Emergency.

Throughout data collection periods at each ED site, observational data were collected by research staff in the form of observational field notes. Research staff recorded observations about the day‐to‐day operations of the ED, general milieu, or observations of care provided to patients. Observations were conducted in the ED waiting room, at the reception desks, in team meetings, and during clinical interactions between patients and providers. All field notes fromEQUIP Emergency(N= 785) were reviewed and coded based on their content and 228 were deemed relevant and included for this secondary analysis through the process described above. Table2provides a summary of the data selected fromEQUIP Emergencythat was included for this secondary analysis.

Summary of data from EQUIP Emergency included for secondary analysis.

The select narrative data were then read repeatedly with a lens specific to the aims of this study. Guided by the principles of ID, another level of manual coding of the data was conducted (Thorne2017). The coding categories for this level of analysis were refined and clarified through continuous discussions with the research team. The three data sources were analyzed separately and together to identify similarities and differences in perspectives among ED staff and research staff. This process aimed to achieve a comprehensive understanding that integrates these varied viewpoints. Ultimately, three themes were identified and are discussed below to broaden the understanding of what contributes to varying forms of aggression and violence in EDs.

The analysis of the patient survey responses, observational field notes, and interviews with ED staff reveals that aggression and violence are influenced by a series of complex, intersecting individual, organizational, and structural factors. An overview of findings is depicted in Figure1. As the analysis proceeded, three themes were identified: (a) significant stress and frustration are the contextual backdrop, (b) dominant norms and a culture of efficiency in the ED create and maintain a stressful environment, and (c) widespread health and social inequities and a lack of community resources exacerbate stress and frustration. Following an interpretive approach, the discussion of the findings incorporates literature throughout to contextualize the findings, drawing connections between the data, existing research, and broader contexts. These themes are discussed below with the intent to broaden understanding of aggression and violence in EDs.

Summary of individual, organizational, and structural contributing factors to aggression and violence toward nurses in emergency departments.

An analysis of the data illustrates that stress and frustration, experienced by both patients and nurses during care in the ED, are major contributors to aggression and violence. The confluence of stress and frustration impacts patients and nurses in unique yet interrelated ways, as discussed below.

Patients may experience stress or frustration for various reasons while accessing care in the ED. Patients' lack of understanding of care processes, dismissal of their concerns by healthcare staff, receiving poor communication about their care plans, and experiencing stigma or discrimination while accessing care are reasons cited by patients for experiencing distress while accessing care in the ED.

My experience was awful. The nurses and doctors failed to convey what was going on with my condition. They tried to tell me I was fine and said it was shift‐change, so they were going to discharge me. I tried to convey that I did not feel comfortable since I was immobile. The nurse responded by saying ‘call a cab.’ I asked her to call one for me. Then they told me several more times that I could not stay and had to go… I was terribly frustrated and in pain. It was very awful.

The admitting clerk talked down to me. She knows my history, that I used to drink, and she just treated me like a drunk. She did not treat me like a human being. It made me feel bad, ashamed, and angry. But I needed the care so I didn't want to speak up. I didn't want them to kick me out. I know I'm not the first person who had that experience, being First Nations. It's gotta change; we're not living in 1950 anymore.

Participant: How they get treated is another one. They feel like they are not treated well, because they feel that first thing that, impression that they get is they're racist, people are being racist. That is how they see us [Indigenous peoples] and is the first impression. For example, maybe there is a security guard there, and sitting there waiting too long and then when you get to the first desk they're already feeling kind of intimidated.

When people come into the emergency department, they are at their most vulnerable, whether they're already considered vulnerable because they're living on the streets and they're suffering from addictions etcetera, but it is your most vulnerable moment when you come into an emergency department most times. That is the place that, the bottom line is you have to be treated with kindness, caring and compassion, and be treated fairly and with full respect. And if that is not happening, we have to find ways to make sure it does.

The perspectives revealed by patients and nurses highlight a shared concern about the stresses and frustrations that patients may experience in the ED and how this stress might contribute to aggression and violence. The findings indicate that stress and frustration are heightened for patients who experience stigma and discrimination. This highlights the need for stronger equity‐oriented healthcare practices. As expressed by the ED staff member, the “bottom line” ought to be that all patients are treated with kindness, compassion, and respect. However, it is essential to recognize that the dynamics in the ED are complex, and the responsibility for ensuring a supportive environment extends beyond any individual or specific role and should not fall upon nurses alone.

The significant stress levels experienced by nurses in the ED are widely acknowledged in the literature and public discourses. Factors such as inadequate staffing levels, resource shortages, and the rising acuity of patients have been extensively documented as contributors to the challenging work environment for ED nurses (Canadian Academy of Health Sciences2023; Dyrbye et al.2017; Health Canada2024). Although these elements were frequently identified in the explored data sets, this analysis deliberately refrains from reiterating them to avoid redundancy. Instead, the paper directs attention to a distinctive focus, emphasizing how recurrent exposure to aggression and violence significantly compounds nurses' stress and frustration in the workplace, and may contribute to a cycle that perpetuates aggression and violence in the ED.

Being a nurse sometimes and you just get tired, and you see the same people every day […] violence is so prominent, people are verbally and physically aggressive towards you, and it's enough to drive even like a saint mad.

As suggested in the literature, continuous exposure to aggression and violence is a key factor contributing to burnout among direct‐care staff, which is associated with negative patient care outcomes and diminished patient satisfaction (Dyrbye et al.2017; Lown and Setnik2018; Tsukamoto et al.2022). This, in turn, may lead to heightened stress, frustration, or aggression in patients, perpetuating a detrimental cycle.

The waiting room is a horrific experience. I equate that with an inner‐city bus station waiting area. The care I received by doctors and nurses in triage was great, however while I was waiting, I had to see/hear/smell a lot of things I did not want to see/hear/smell […] I did not feel very safe.

While this account does not describe violence directed at nurses, it highlights environmental stressors that contribute to a broader climate of tension and frustration in the ED – conditions under which aggression and violence may become more likely. Other phrases used by patients to describe the ED environment include: “not quiet or peaceful” and “a less predictable environment”.

Additionally, one ED nurse leader reflected on how the culture of efficiency in the ED and time constraints can prevent staff from engaging in practices that might prevent aggression and violence, like trauma‐informed care, despite recognizing their value. As they put it, “sometimes all you can do is stop the bleeding. Patch them up and go, right?” When nurses are forced to prioritize speed over connection, the quality of patient care may suffer, and opportunities to de‐escalate or prevent frustration are lost – conditions that can escalate tensions and contribute to incidents of aggression and violence.

This sentiment was echoed by another ED staff member in a nursing executive leadership role, who describes how, despite prevention efforts, aggression and violence persist: “We've done some safe care training, cultural sensitivity training – we've done all of that. We've equipped people with how to deescalate, but at the end of the day, we're still constantly faced with violent acts.” The acceptance that aggression and violence are unavoidable aspects of nursing in the ED may lead to a sense of hopelessness, with a belief that nothing can ever change.

We […] sort of prided ourselves, and we do have many patients that are vulnerable people that live around the hospital; some of them have lived on the grounds of the hospital in tents and other means for years, and that is their home, and they use the [hospital] and emergency department as part of their home, with coming in and using bathroom facilities and in some cases utilizing food that is around the hospital, etc.

And that all stopped of course when we went into the controlled access, where again it was partly the fear, but it was partly the Ministry [of Health] mandate where we had a no visitation policy, and so that put the vulnerable people more at risk than normal because we were physically preventing them from coming in, and so that had a huge negative [impact].

The patient was requesting a dose of an opioid that they been prescribed and received in the community, however since the ED nurses are not frequently equipped with the same substance use treatment policies and education as community substance treatment centers, they were unable to meet this patient's needs, resulting in stress, frustration, and aggression for both the patient and the staff member. Although this encounter did not escalate to physical violence, it highlights how systemic mismatches between patient needs and ED protocols can lead to heightened tensions, frustration, and behaviors that staff may experience as aggressive.

They made me leave at 2 am, and it was very cold outside. I waited for the cab for 15 min and it never showed up, so I called the hospital and they told me to go back to emergency, so I did, and the nurse there that kicked me out called security to remove me.

This analysis reveals that structural challenges such as the lack of resources for housing, mental health and substance use treatment, as well as access to primary care, significantly contribute to aggression and violence toward nurses in EDs. When patients cannot access appropriate community resources, they may turn to the ED as part of their social safety net, increasing the volume of patients accessing care at EDs (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health2023). This rise in patient volume reinforces the pressure to be “efficient,” creating a cycle of high demand and strain on emergency services. Compounded by organizational structures, policies, and a general lack of resources, this efficiency‐driven culture often limits nurses' ability to effectively meet patients' needs. The resulting mismatch between patient needs and the ED's capacity leads to significant stress for both patients and nurses, which can contribute to increased aggression and violence.

Analyzing the three data sets together and separately allowed the research team to identify both converging and diverging perspectives on aggression and violence in EDs. While staff interviews emphasized institutional challenges and emotional impacts, patient responses shed light on experiences of marginalization and unmet needs, and observational data offered a real‐time view of systemic tensions playing out in everyday interactions. These layered perspectives underscored a shared concern with safety, stigma, and strained care environments, while also revealing important differences in how these issues are perceived and experienced. Integrating these viewpoints provided a more holistic understanding of the issue and supports the need for multi‐level interventions.

These findings draw attention to several interconnected implications for nursing practice. First, this analysis shows that the factors contributing to aggression and violence directed toward nurses extend beyond conventional, individualistic discourses, where blame is placed on patients and/or nurses for individual behaviors leading to aggression or violence. Instead, these findings show that contributing factors are more likely multifactorial, stemming from various, intersecting individual, organizational, and structural level factors. However, as outlined in the introduction, predominant strategies for managing aggression and violence primarily focus on the individual level (such as security measures, panic alarms, and de‐escalation techniques). While these individual‐level responses are more concrete and easier to track (e.g., through code white calls) or may appear to be more cost‐effective to implement, this focus may detract from addressing the broader organizational and structural factors influencing aggression and violence. The lack of comprehensive consideration for factors beyond the individual level in current response strategies might explain their limited effectiveness, suggesting that without broader organizational and structural reforms, aggression and violence against nurses will persist in ED settings. A recent report from the Chief Nursing Officer of Canada reinforced this need for systemic approaches, highlighting that policies alone are insufficient for preventing aggression and violence, and advocating for wrap‐around supports to address nurses' needs holistically (Health Canada2024). Figure2presents a summary diagram of the factors contributing to aggression and violence, along with a diagram that highlights the need for individual, organizational, and structural‐level responses to address the root causes. This figure emphasizes that individual‐level responses alone are insufficient, and to effectively prevent aggression and violence, multi‐pronged strategies must be implemented concurrently across individual, organizational, and structural levels.

Summary of contributing factors to aggression and violence and recommendations for improving EDs' responses to aggression and violence.

Secondly, this analysis underscores the importance of adopting an equity lens to prevent and manage aggression and violence toward nurses. Patients and nurses alike highlighted how experiences of stigma and discrimination contribute to aggression and violence, while health and social inequities exacerbate these patterns at the point of care. Practice standards in Canada mandate that nursing align with social justice aims, particularly emphasizing antiracism and anti‐discriminatory care approaches (British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives2021). Given nursing's commitment to social justice and health equity, improving ED approaches to aggression and violence requires an explicit focus on equity‐oriented solutions, addressing stigma and discrimination across all levels of care (individual, organizational, and structural) (Varcoe et al.2019; Wathen and Varcoe2023). Trauma‐ and violence‐informed care (TVIC) may offer a valuable approach, recognizing the pervasive impact of trauma and violence (including structural and systemic violence) on individuals' lives (MacPherson and Wathen2022).

The ideas underpinning TVIC are defined by Wathen and Varcoe (2023) as a comprehensive approach to healthcare that recognizes the complex impacts of trauma and violence on individuals' lives, behaviors, and healthcare experiences. TVIC represents a notable departure from traditional trauma‐informed care by broadening its scope to encompass both trauma and violence (interpersonal and structural), thereby acknowledging the ongoing and structural nature of violence rather than solely focusing on past traumatic events. Four foundational principles are the pillars of TVIC: understanding trauma and violence and their impacts, creating safe environments, fostering choice and collaboration, and providing strengths‐based support (Wathen and Varcoe2023). This framework underscores the profound effects of systemic and interpersonal violence, as well as structural inequities, on individuals' lives and behaviors, while also providing language to help shift the discourse around violence and aggression away from solely focusing on the interpersonal level. By shifting the focus from individual shortcomings to a contextualized understanding of trauma, TVIC highlights the predictable consequences of highly threatening events and experiences, particularly in the presence of stigma and inequities. TVIC recognizes the ongoing nature of trauma and violence, necessitating practices and policies aimed at preventing further harm. These principles, adaptable to various practice and organizational contexts, advocate for both personalized care and systemic changes to ensure safety, equity, and effectiveness in healthcare provision for individuals with trauma and violence experiences (Wathen and Varcoe2023).

Within the context of EDs, where patients often arrive under extreme stress and in crisis, the impacts of trauma and violence are especially pronounced and might lead to patterns of behavior that are often misunderstood or stigmatized. For example, a patient with a history of trauma may react aggressively not out of malice but as a survival response, influenced by previous experiences of violence. Introducing TVIC into discussions about aggression and violence toward nurses is valuable for several reasons. At the individual level, TVIC equips healthcare providers with essential tools to interact more safely, equitably, and effectively with patients who have experienced trauma and violence, irrespective of whether these experiences have been disclosed (Wathen and Varcoe2023). This proactive approach may help mitigate stress and frustration, which are known precursors to aggression and violence, and ultimately prevent incidents of aggression and violence. Moreover, responsibility for implementing TVIC principles must be shared among individuals at all levels within organizations, collaborating to ensure that interventions address physical spaces, policies (including staffing levels), and processes. This approach requires robust support from resources, policies, and systems to create emotionally, culturally, and physically safe environments for both service users and providers (Wathen and Varcoe2023). This approach aligns with the overarching goal of our paper, which seeks to shift away from individualistic and blame‐placing narratives surrounding aggression and violence in healthcare settings.

Finally, as a discipline directly impacted by the effects of aggression and violence, and one committed to applying a health equity lens to improve conditions for both nurses and patients, nursing is well‐positioned to take a leading role in addressing aggression and violence in EDs. Havaei et al. (2020) advocate for nurse involvement in developing workplace violence interventions; we extend this by calling on nurses across all practice domains totake the leadin driving solutions. Based on this analysis, the authors outline specific recommendations and actionable strategies for nurses to advance equity‐oriented approaches to prevent and manage aggression and violence (see Table3).

Recommendations for nurse leaders, nursing researchers, nursing educators, and direct‐care nurses.

As a study based on secondary analysis, the findings presented in this paper are inherently limited by the reliance on pre‐existing data, which were originally collected with different aims and may not perfectly align with the objectives of this study. While most participants were nurses, direct care nurses were underrepresented in the sample, with greater representation from nursing leadership and executive roles. Additionally, we examined only three EDs, which, while offering valuable insights, reflects the contexts and realities of these specific sites. Although similarities exist between these settings and other EDs or hospital units, it is crucial to recognize the importance of understanding unique contexts. We hope that a key takeaway from this study is the need to invest time in understanding the specific individual, organizational, and structural factors contributing to aggression and violence within unique environments to develop effective, tailored solutions.

This paper contributes to an ongoing and increasingly relevant dialogue regarding the impact of aggression and violence in healthcare settings, especially for nurses in EDs. The analysis presented used critical theoretical perspectives and a structural lens to understand the broader contributing factors to aggression and violence experienced by nurses in EDs, emphasizing the need for strategies that go beyond individual‐level responses and address organizational and structural issues. While individual‐level strategies (such as security presence, use of panic alarms, etc.) remain crucial, they should not be the sole approach adopted by EDs. Instead, significantly more attention ought to be placed on finding effective, equity‐oriented strategies at the organizational and structural level for preventing and managing aggression and violence toward nurses in EDs. Based on these findings, this paper provides concrete, actionable recommendations for nurses to implement such strategies, positioning them to take a leading role in driving these necessary changes.
