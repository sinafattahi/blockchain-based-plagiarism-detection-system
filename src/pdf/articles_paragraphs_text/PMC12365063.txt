This study presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of PD-L1-In-1 (C21H23N5O2) using the B3LYP functional with the 6-311G(d) basis set, focusing on its structural, electronic, and spectroscopic properties. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Raman, and UV–Vis spectra were simulated, and vibrational modes were assigned via potential energy distribution (PED) analysis using the VEDA 4 program. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis revealed hyperconjugative interactions (E2) and provided insights into donor–acceptor electron densities. The energy band gap was obtained from HOMO–LUMO calculations and further analyzed through the density of states (DOS) spectrum. Electron Localization Function (ELF) and Localized Orbital Locator (LOL) analyses, performed using Multiwfn, highlighted regions of electron localization and orbital overlap. Reduced Density Gradient (RDG) analysis uncovered non-covalent interactions. Ground-state1H and13C NMR chemical shifts were predicted using the Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) method. Fukui function analysis identified reactive sites and evaluated the chemical reactivity of the molecule. Molecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina explored interactions between PD-L1-In-1 and the PD-L1 checkpoint protein, shedding light on its potential biological activity. Notably, the simulations indicated strong ligand–protein interactions, positioning PD-L1-In-1 as a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.

The interaction between Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 is a key mechanism by which cancer cells evade immune detection, allowing tumors to escape the host’s immune response1. This PD-1/PD-L1 pathway impairs T-lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic function, ultimately leading to the exhaustion and apoptosis of tumor-specific T cells2. In recent years, checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have achieved remarkable success, driving significant advancements in immunotherapy3–5. These inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy across various tumor types, treatment routes, drug combinations, and therapeutic regimens, positioning them as promising agents in cancer treatment6,7.

Our study centers on PD-L1-In-1 (C21H23N5O2), a biphenyl-based small-molecule inhibitor targeting PD-L1. Initially identified by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), biphenyl-derived PD-L1 inhibitors have shown efficacy in disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions through a unique mechanism involving protein dimer formation8–13. Small-molecule inhibitors like PD-L1-In-1 offer an attractive alternative to antibody-based immunotherapies, potentially mitigating some of their associated drawbacks, such as immune-related adverse events, high production costs, limited stability, poor tumor penetration, inability for oral administration and immunogenicity concerns14,15. Moreover, unlike other small-molecule inhibitors that struggle to target the relatively flat and highly hydrophobic PD-1/PD-L1 surface, the BMS-developed PD-L1 inhibitors overcome these challenges, offering enhanced binding affinity and stability11,16.

Despite the promising potential of PD-L1-In-1, it has not yet been the subject of a thorough theoretical investigation. This study aims to address this gap by employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict the structural, molecular, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of PD-L1-In-1. We utilized the B3LYP hybrid exchange-correlation functional, known for its efficiency and reliability in examining conjugated systems and species containing lone pairs17–19. Additionally, we analyzed the molecule in different charge states and in the solvent DMSO to better understand its chemical reactivity and stability in various environments. Moreover, we explored interactions between PD-L1-In-1 and the PD-L1 checkpoint protein, providing insights into its potential biological activity. Our theoretical findings offer valuable insights that may guide future experimental research.

All spectroscopic and quantum chemical calculations for the title compound were performed using the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G(d) level of theory with Gaussian 09W20. In this study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to predict the optimized molecular structure, harmonic vibrational frequencies, UV–Vis spectra,1H NMR and13C NMR spectra, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, Mulliken atomic charges, Fukui functions, and thermodynamic properties of the title molecule. The 6-311G(d) basis set was selected for its balance between computational cost and accuracy21,22. Multiwfn23was used for the analysis of localized orbital locator (LOL), electron localization function (ELF), and reduced density gradient (RDG) of the title molecule. The density of states (DOS) spectra were generated using GaussSum24. Potential energy distribution (PED) assignments were made using VEDA 425. Additionally, molecular docking studies were carried out with AutoDock Vina26. Data processing, statistical analyses, and visualization were conducted using Python and Microsoft Excel. All calculations and software executions were performed on an MSI GL65 9SEK personal laptop.

The geometrical optimization of the PD-L1-1-In-1 structure is performed using the Gaussian 09W. The optimized geometry configuration of the title molecule is presented in Fig.1with labeled atoms and their respective symbols.

A potential energy surface (PES) scan was performed focusing on the dihedral angle C26–N4–C20–C19. To balance computational efficiency with resolution, the dihedral angle was varied from 0º to 360º in 10º increments. At each increment, the energy was calculated, resulting in a detailed energy profile, as illustrated in Fig.2. The minima for the selected dihedral angles were observed at 90º, − 110º, and 150º for the neutral, anionic, and cationic states, respectively, indicating the most stable conformations in these charged states as seen in Table1.

In a non-linear molecule withNatoms, the total number of potentially active observable fundamentals is given by 3N −6 normal modes of vibration27. The PD-L1-In-1 molecule, which consists of 51 atoms, exhibits 147 typical vibrational modes. The vibrational spectrum of PD-L1-In-1 in its neutral, cationic, and anionic forms, both in the gas phase and in DMSO solvent, was calculated using the B3LYP/6-311G(d) method. Harmonic frequencies of vibration were scaled using the scale factors recommended in the literature28–30. Vibrational assignments of the computed harmonic frequencies were performed based on potential energy distribution analysis. The Raman and IR spectra are provided in Figs.3and4respectively. The computed vibrational frequencies, IR intensities, Raman intensities, and vibrational assignments in neutral gas are presented in the Table2for the range 4000–500 cm−1. P.E.D. contributions below 10 are not reported. Tables for other states are provided in the supplementary materials.

N–H stretching vibrations are typically observed in the region between 3100 and 3500 cm−131. In our study, the N–H stretching modes (Mode Numbers 147 and 146) were found at harmonic frequencies of 3530.44 cm−1and 3487.75 cm−1in the gaseous neutral state. In DMSO solution, these modes appeared at 3532.90 cm−1and 3488.40 cm−1for the neutral state. For the gaseous anionic state, the N–H stretching vibrations were identified at 3489.69 cm−1and 3453.76 cm−1; in DMSO solution, they were observed at 3490.70 cm−1and 3450.70 cm−1. In the gaseous cationic state, the harmonic frequencies were noted at 3517.63 cm−1and 3466.14 cm−1; in DMSO, they were detected at 3520.92 cm−1and 3467.37 cm−1. These assignments have a 100% PED value. Despite variations in the physical state of the molecule, the observed spectra are remarkably consistent, as corroborated by the literature30. Slight differences were noted when comparing spectra across different charged states.

Typically, CH stretching vibrations in aromatic compounds are observed as multiple weak and strong bands in the range of 3100–3000 cm−132. In our study, all CH stretching vibrations (Mode Numbers 145–125) were detected within this expected range. For the title molecule in the neutral state, the CH stretching bands were observed from 3097.09 to 2923.84 cm−1in the gas phase, and from 3096.14 to 2925.16 cm−1in DMSO solution. In the anionic state, the CH stretching bands were found in the range 3084.82–2904.51 cm−1in the gas phase and 3086.72–2912.25 cm−1in DMSO solution. Similarly, in the cationic state, the CH stretching bands were identified in the range 3124.25–2929.32 cm−1in the gas phase and 3126.00–2933.29 cm−1in DMSO. The best PED values for the neutral, cationic, and anionic states, in both the gas phase and DMSO, ranged between 85 and 100%. Notably, the peaks corresponding to CH stretching vibrations in the Raman spectra were more prominent compared to those in the IR spectra.

The region between 1870 and 1540 cm−1is characteristic of the C=O stretching mode. The C=O stretching vibrations are influenced by the physical state, electronic effects, mass effects of neighboring substituents, conjugations, and intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding33–36. In PD-L1-In-1, the C=O stretching mode (mode 124) is observed at 1716.37 cm−1in the gas phase and 1705.08 cm−1in DMSO for the neutral state. For the anionic state, it appears at 1701.62 cm−1in the gas phase and 1687.13 cm−1in DMSO. In the cationic state, the C=O stretching mode is detected at 1645.78 cm−1in the gas phase and 1704.30 cm−1in DMSO. These assignments exhibit PED values in the range of 75–80%. The peaks corresponding to C=O stretching vibrations are more intense in the IR spectra compared to the Raman spectra. Additionally, C=O stretching vibrations with small PED contributions (< 25%) were observed at various harmonic frequencies across all charged states in both the gas phase and DMSO solvent.

C–C ring stretching vibrations in aromatic groups typically appear in the regions of 1280–1380 cm−1, 1430–1465 cm−1, 1470–1540 cm−1, 1575–1590 cm−1, and 1590–1625 cm−1with variable intensity32. For the title molecule, C–C ring vibrations in the neutral, cationic, and anionic states, both in the gas phase and in DMSO solvent, were observed within these expected ranges, with PED contributions exceeding 30%.

In our study, the C=N stretching vibrations were assigned to the region of 1450–1580 cm−1for all neutral, cationic, and anionic states, both in the gas phase and in DMSO solvent. This range generally aligns with the assignment by Silverstein36, which is 1500–1600 cm−1. In these regions, C=N stretching vibrations were often accompanied by HCN bending vibrations. Moderate to strong intensities of C=N stretching vibrations with PED values around 60% were observed. Additionally, C–N stretching vibrations were detected in the region of 1100–1390 cm−1, frequently in conjunction with HCN bending vibrations, HCH bending vibrations, and other modes. The overlap of several bands in the region 1270–1440 cm−1made the identification and classification of different vibrations challenging.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides comprehensive insights into molecular structure, chemical environment, dynamics, and concentration by analyzing the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei37–40. NMR calculations were performed on the PD-L1-IN-1 molecule in its neutral gas phase using the SCF GIAO method at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level of theory. The theoretical1H and13C NMR chemical shifts for PD-L1-In-1, as detailed in Fig.5, reveal a broad distribution of signals. The1H chemical shifts range from 23.78 to 30.64 ppm, while the13C shifts span from 7.08 to 167.53 ppm. This wide range of13C shifts suggests diverse carbon environments within the molecule. Particularly, the highest13C shift of 167.53 ppm is indicative of a carbonyl group, and the shifts between 115 and 139 ppm are characteristic of aromatic or unsaturated carbons. The1H spectrum shows multiple instances of equivalent protons, with notable degeneracies observed at 24.79 ppm (degeneracy 4) and 24.99 ppm (degeneracy 3).

The Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) procedure provides an efficient method for identifying the bond and lone pairs that compose an optimized Lewis structure of a molecule41. The set of orthonormal NBOs offers a compact and stable representation of the electron density in a molecule42and serves as a useful basis for investigating charge-transfer or hyperconjugative interactions43. Delocalization of electron density between occupied (bond or lone pair) NBOs and formally unoccupied (antibond or Rydberg) NBOs corresponds to stabilizing interactions that often influence the features of the potential energy surface41.

A largerE(2)value indicates a more intense interaction between electron donors and acceptors, reflecting a greater donating tendency and an increased degree of conjugation within the system. The second-order perturbation theory analysis of the Fock Matrix in the NBO basis for PD-L1-In-1, summarized in Table3, demonstrates significant electron delocalization within the triazine ring system. Strong donor-acceptor interactions between the N–C bonds of the ring were identified, exhibiting energies ranging from 37.04 to 43.8 kcal/mol. Notably, the interaction from BD N7–C25 to BD* N6–C27 showed the highest stabilization energy of 43.8 kcal/mol, indicating substantial electron delocalization and confirming the highly conjugated nature of the triazine rings, characterized by a nearly symmetrical distribution of interaction energies around the ring. Additionally, significant lone pair interactions involving the carbonyl group were observed, with the lone pair on oxygen (O2) exhibiting strong interactions with adjacent bonds, specifically BD* N4–C26 (24.43 kcal/mol) and BD* C26–C28 (19.91 kcal/mol), which underscores the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group. Furthermore, notable lone pair interactions were found for nitrogen atoms N3 and N4; LP N3 to BD* N7–C25 displayed a high stabilization energy of 64.8 kcal/mol, while LP N4 to BD* O2–C26 showed 59.63 kcal/mol, suggesting that nitrogen lone pairs play a crucial role in the overall electronic structure of the molecule. The NBO analysis also revealed multiple interactions between carbon-carbon bonds with energies around 20 kcal/mol, characteristic of aromatic systems (e.g., BD C8–C9 to BD* C10–C14 at 21.03 kcal/mol and BD C11–C18 to BD* C22–C23 at 21.19 kcal/mol). Notably, two exceptionally high-energy interactions were identified: BD N5–C24 to BD* N6–C27 at 241.65 kcal/mol and BD N7–C25 to BD* N6–C27 at 179.56 kcal/mol, which merit further investigation, as they may represent artifacts of the computational method, necessitating additional calculations or experimental validation.

The UV–Vis calculations for the title molecule were performed using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with the B3LYP functional and the 6-311G(d) basis set. According to the Franck-Condon principle, the maximum absorption peak λmaxin a UV–Vis spectrum corresponds to a vertical excitation. This electronic absorption is attributed to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state and is characterized as one-electron excitation from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO)45.

For the neutral state, the maximum wavelengths were calculated to be 248.21 nm (in the gas phase) and 253.45 nm (in DMSO), with oscillator strengths of 0.001 and 0.0653, respectively. In the neutral gas phase, the major contribution to the maximum wavelength is 60% from the HOMO to LUMO transition. In DMSO, it is 85% from the second highest occupied molecular orbital to the LUMO. The UV–Vis spectra for the title molecule in the anionic and cationic states have also been calculated. A complete summary of the results is provided in Table4.

Real space function analysis is one of the most important functions of Multiwfn especially ELF and LOL for locating high localization regions. ELF explains the electron pair density whereas LOL explains maximum localized orbitals overlapping due to gradient of orbitals46.ELF is within the range of [0,1]. A large ELF value means that the electrons are greatly localized, indicating that there is a covalent bond, a lone pair or inner shells of the atom involved. The value range of LOL is identical to ELF, namely [0,1]. Small (large) LOL value usually appears in boundary (inner) region of localized orbitals because the gradient of orbital wave function is large (small) in this area. From ELF plot in Fig.6, high ELF regions are seen around hydrogen atoms, indicating the presence of higly localized bonding and non-bonding electrons. The blue regions around few carbon atoms show the delocalized electron cloud. In LOL plot shown in Fig.7, covalent regions between hydrogen and nitrogen atoms are highlighted by red areas, signifying high LOL values. The electron-depleted regions between valence shell and inner shell are depicted as blue circles around the carbon and oxygen nuclei.

Weak interactions have a significant influence on the conformation of macromolecules and the binding modes of proteins and ligands. RDG and sign(λ2)ρ are a pair of very important functions employed in Multiwfn for revealing weak interaction regions. The strength of weak interactions has a positive correlation with electron density ρ in the corresponding region. Van der Waals interaction regions typically have very small ρ, while the regions corresponding to strong steric effects or evident attractive weak interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds) generally have relatively large ρ47,48. A graphical representation of ρ(r) versus sign(λ2)ρ, where sign(λ2)ρ shown in Fig.8is derived from the second eigenvalue of the electron density Hessian matrix, provides convenient information regarding the strength and nature of these interactions. Strong attractive interactions, arising from hydrogen bonds, are indicated by the blue regions at negative sign(λ2)ρ values (<−0.02 a.u.). The extensive green areas (−0.01 < sign(λ2)ρ < 0.01 a.u.) suggest prevalent weak van der Waals interactions, which likely contribute to the overall structural stability. Notably, significant red regions at positive sign(λ2)ρ values (> 0.02 a.u.) indicate the presence of repulsive steric interactions.

The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) is a valuable descriptor for identifying sites of potential electronic attacks, nucleophilic reactions, and hydrogen-bonding interactions49–51. On the MEP map, the highest positive and negative regions are typically represented by blue and red colors, respectively, indicating favored sites for nucelophilic and electrophilic attacks.

To predict the reactive sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks in the title molecule, the MEP was calculated using the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level of theory. In the neutral state, the PD-L1-In-1 molecule shows a minimum electrostatic potential primarily localized around the oxygen atoms, suggesting these regions are more reactive towards electrophilic attacks. Conversely, the maximum electrostatic potential is concentrated around hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms, highlighting these areas as highly reactive for nucleophilic attacks. In the anionic state, most atoms become favorable for electrophilic attacks, while in the cationic state, they are more inclined to nucleophilic attacks, as illustrated in Fig.9.

The contour lines shown in Fig.10, which vary in color from yellow to red, represent regions of equal electron density. Red lines indicate higher electron density, while yellow lines denote lower values. In the neutral state, contour lines are densely packed around oxygen (O1, O2) and nitrogen atoms (N1–N7), indicating high electron density due to their electronegativity. In the anionic state, the contour lines become denser and more concentrated, reflecting an increased electron density as the molecule gains an electron, leading to a redistribution of electron density. Conversely, in the cationic state, the contour lines are less dense and more widely spaced, particularly around oxygen (O1), indicating a decrease in electron density due to the loss of an electron. The nitrogen atoms (N1–N7) also show less dense lines, reflecting an overall reduction in electron density.

The charge distributions over the atoms in the molecule suggest the formation of donor and acceptor pairs, indicative of charge transfer within the structure. Mulliken atomic charge calculations are pivotal in quantum chemistry, as charge distribution significantly impacts the electronic structure, dipole moment, polarizability, and various molecular properties52,53.

In this study, Mulliken atomic charges were computed using the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G(d) basis set. The computed Mulliken charge values are illustrated in Fig.11. The oxygen atoms exhibit negative charges of − 0.301192 and − 0.360124, reflecting their high electronegativity. Nitrogen atoms show a range of negative charges from − 0.307841 to − 0.594492, with N3 being the most negatively charged at − 0.594492. Carbon atoms display a range of both positive and negative charges, indicating their diverse bonding environments. Notably, three carbon atoms (C24, C25, and C26) have significant positive charges of 0.442890, 0.520029, and 0.435166, respectively. In contrast, two carbon atoms (C15 and C28) exhibit highly negative charges of − 0.743074 and − 0.748378. All hydrogen atoms possess positive charges, ranging from 0.192155 to 0.354549.

The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) are critical frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) that play a pivotal role in determining the chemical stability of a molecule54. The HOMO primarily acts as an electron donor, while the LUMO functions as an electron acceptor55. The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO characterizes the molecular chemical stability56.

In this study, we evaluated the frontier molecular orbitals of the PD-L1-In-1 molecule in both the gaseous phase and DMSO solvent using the 6-311G(d) basis set, as illustrated in Figs.12and13. The plots indicate positive regions in green and negative regions in red. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) reflects the molecule’s kinetic stability and chemical reactivity57. Furthermore, the effectiveness of PD-L1 inhibitors is influenced by the energies and spatial distributions of their HOMOs and LUMOs58.

HOMO, LUMO and their energy gap (eV) in neutral state.

HOMO, LUMO, and their energy gap (eV) in anion and cation states.

For the neutral state, the energy gap remains relatively constant, with values of 0.20173 eV in the gas phase and 0.20296 eV in DMSO, indicating minimal solvent influence. In the anionic state, the alpha energy gap increases from 0.02259 to 0.05017 eV, and the beta energy gap rises from 0.02448 to 0.18409 eV upon transitioning from the gas phase to DMSO. This suggests enhanced stability and reduced reactivity in the solvent. Conversely, in the cationic state, the alpha energy gap slightly narrows from 0.16893 to 0.15324 eV, indicating a slight increase in reactivity, while the beta energy gap increases from 0.01017 to 0.03348 eV, reflecting greater stability in DMSO. These results summarized in Table5highlight the significant impact of the solvent on the electronic properties of the molecule, suggesting a stabilizing effect.

HOMO, LUMO and their energy gap (eV) in neutral, anion and cation states for PD-L1-In-1 molecule in gas phase and solvent (DMSO).

**In the neutral state, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for alpha and beta spin states are identical, meaning there is no distinction between them. This is why the table uses asterisks to indicate the absence of separate beta values. In contrast, for the anion and cation states, the alpha and beta spin orbitals differ, leading to distinct HOMO and LUMO values for each spin state.

Since nearby orbitals in the boundary region may have quasi-degenerate energy levels, relying solely on the HOMO and LUMO to describe the frontier orbitals might be unrealistic59. Therefore, the Density of States (DOS) spectrum was generated using the Gauss Sum 3.0 program with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.3 eV. The DOS spectra for the PD-L1-In-1 molecule in different phases and states are presented in Figs.14,15, and16spanning the energy range from − 15 to 15 eV.

The Density of States (DOS) plot aids in identifying whether interactions between orbitals are bonding or anti-bonding. High-intensity peaks in the DOS spectrum at specific energy levels indicate multiple available states for occupation, while zero intensity signifies the absence of available states. Negative intensity, on the other hand, is indicative of anti-bonding interactions45. The energy values obtained from the HOMO-LUMO analysis are consistent with the energy gaps depicted in the DOS spectrum, corresponding to the gaps between occupied and virtual orbitals.

whereqk(N) represents the electronic population of atomkin the molecule. The condensed Fukui function is a local reactivity descriptor and is used primarily for comparing reactive atomic centers within the same molecule62.

In this study, the Fukui function analysis was performed to identify reactive sites within the molecule, focusing on the nucleophilic and electrophilic nature of each atom. Atoms with higherf+values, such as C14 and C23, show a pronounced tendency towards electrophilic attack, as indicated by their positive dual descriptor values. Conversely, atoms like N4 and C8, with higherf−values and negative dual descriptors, are more prone to nucleophilic attack. Most hydrogen atoms exhibit relatively small dual descriptor values, reflecting their limited involvement in the molecule’s reactive sites. These findings as seen in Table6align with the expected chemical behavior based on the molecular structure.

The standard thermodynamic functions, including heat capacity (), entropy (), enthalpy (), rotational constants, temperature, and zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE), for the PD-L1 molecule were computed using the B3LYP/6-311G(d) basis set. These calculations were performed at room temperature (298.15 K) and under 1 atm pressure in a vacuum. The results are summarized in the Table7. Furthermore, the Moltran software was utilized to illustrate the relationship between thermodynamic variables and temperature as seen in Fig.17. The observed behavior of these variables aligns with classical thermodynamic principles, indicating stable molecular responses across the studied temperature range.

**The asterisks are used to indicate that specific heat and entropy are not defined for zero-point vibrational energy because ZPVE is a constant energy present even at absolute zero. Since specific heat measures energy change with temperature and entropy reflects the number of accessible states, neither property applies to ZPVE, as it remains unchanged regardless of temperature variations.

Docking is a powerful computational technique used to study molecular interactions between ligands and proteins, which are crucial in biological processes such as tumor progression and bacterial diseases. This process involves docking small molecule compounds into a receptor’s binding site and estimating the binding affinity of the resulting complex, making it a vital component of structure-based drug design63.

To investigate the interaction between the PD-L1-In-1 molecule and the PD-L1 protein, the structure of PD-1 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: PDB-CPX-192774). Molecular docking studies were then conducted using AutoDock Vina. The simulations identified nine distinct binding modes for the ligand, with binding affinities ranging from − 9.2494 to − 8.9602 kcal/mol, as shown in Table8. The most energetically favorable pose, with an affinity of − 9.2494 kcal/mol, is illustrated in Fig.18and was chosen as the reference for RMSD calculations. This pose represents the optimal conformation based on energy minimization.

Binding modes, affinities, and RMSD values from molecular docking simulation.

Subsequent docking modes displayed slightly lower binding affinities and higher RMSD values, indicating increasing structural deviation from the optimal pose. Notably, modes 2 through 5 exhibited closely related affinities (− 9.2167 to − 9.0961 kcal/mol) and lower RMSD values, suggesting a cluster of energetically competitive conformations. This clustering points to consistent and stable binding within the active site, which supports the reliability of the predicted interactions. Overall, the strong and consistent binding of the ligand to the target protein is reinforced by these results.

This study presents the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of the PD-L1-In-1 molecule in various charged states, examined both in the gas phase and in DMSO solvent. Using a range of computational methods, we performed virtual structural analysis, simulated spectroscopic studies (IR, Raman, NMR, UV–Vis), and applied theoretical techniques such as PES scan, MEP mapping, Mulliken charge analysis, FMO, DOS, ELF, LOL, RDG, and Fukui function analysis. This multi-faceted computational approach provided a detailed characterization of the molecule’s properties, offering valuable insights for drug design applications.

Key computational findings from our analysis include subtle structural variations in PD-L1-In-1 driven by solvent effects, the identification of its key vibrational modes and electronic transitions, and a deeper understanding of its charge distribution and reactivity patterns. Additionally, thermodynamic parameters were calculated, and their temperature-dependent behavior was analyzed, highlighting the molecule’s stability and adaptability across temperatures relevant to biological systems. Notably, our simulations revealed strong ligand-protein interactions between PD-L1-In-1 and PD-L1, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for cancer immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Furthermore, our findings indicate that PD-L1-In-1 may serve as a valuable candidate for the development of orally bioavailable immune checkpoint blockade therapies in cancer treatment.

Our findings establish a robust theoretical foundation for understanding PD-L1-In-1 and lay the groundwork for future experimental investigations to validate its efficacy. These results underscore the importance of integrating computational approaches into cancer immunotherapy to facilitate the rational design of next-generation immunotherapeutic agents, thereby advancing precision oncology. While this study offers comprehensive theoretical insights into PD-L1-In-1, the lack of experimental validation remains a limitation. Future research should focus on experimental studies to corroborate our findings and further explore the therapeutic potential of this molecule.
