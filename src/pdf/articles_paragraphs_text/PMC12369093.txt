Intestinal anastomosis is a common surgical procedure, but anastomotic leaks remain significant postoperative complications, causing morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and readmissions. This study aimed to identify the rate, determinant factors, and outcomes associated with anastomotic leakage for patients undergo gastrointestinal anastomoses in two major hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. 206 patients who underwent bowel anastomosis between 2016 and 2019 GC. To assess determinant factors first bivariate analysis was done for all independent variables and for variables withp-value < 0.2 multiple logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of anastomotic leakage. Odds ratios were computed; and ap-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was run to ascertain the fitness of the model.

The clinical anastomotic leakage (AL) rate in this study was 8.3% (95%CI; 5.4–9.1). A total of 14 patients died in the study sites making the mortality rate was 6.8%. The presence of gangrenous bowel at the time of surgery was a strong independent predictor of AL (AOR 4.88; 95% CI: 1.62–14.69;p< 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss greater than 500 mL was also significantly associated with an increased risk of leakage (AOR 3.13; 95% CI: 1.07–9.17;p= 0.029). Moreover, patients who developed anastomotic leakage had a higher risk of mortality (AOR 5.495; 95% CI: 1.517–20.00;p= 0.004). AL was also associated with prolonged hospital stay beyond 20 days (AOR 5.49; 95% CI: 1.99–7.12;p= 0.000). 3.13; (1.07–9.17).

In this study, anastomotic leakage was found to be higher than expected. Bowel viability and the amount of Blood loss was significant predictors of clinical anastomotic leakage. Additionally, the presence of anastomotic leakage was associated with increased mortality and prolonged hospitalization.

Intestinal anastomosis plays a vital role in restoring bowel continuity after resection and is frequently utilized in various surgical scenarios. Both elective and emergency procedures rely heavily on the integrity of the anastomosis for favourable outcomes. Pioneering surgical techniques, refined over time, have aimed to optimize healing and minimize complications such as leakage [1,2].

Nevertheless, Intestinal anastomotic leakage (AL) continues to be among the most serious and feared complications following gastrointestinal surgery. It is typically defined as a breakdown at the anastomotic site leading to leakage of intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity. This event is not only a major cause of surgical morbidity but also significantly contributes to mortality and resource utilization [3,4].

Multiple factors contribute to the risk of AL, including impaired perfusion, infection, tension on the anastomosis, and systemic conditions such as anaemia, malnutrition, and diabetes mellitus. Technical errors during surgery may further exacerbate the risk [5–7]. The incidence of AL varies considerably by procedure type, with colorectal surgeries often having the highest risk for some estimates reporting up to 26% leakage rates ERAS Society [8]. These leaks may range in presentation from fulminant peritonitis to insidious signs such as fever or delayed gastrointestinal function, typically surfacing around the fifth to seventh postoperative day [9,10].

Delayed diagnosis is particularly problematic in settings with limited diagnostic resources, where subtle clinical changes may be overlooked. Furthermore, early discharge in cost-conscious systems may prevent timely recognition and intervention, increasing the likelihood of complications and readmissions [11,12].

The scarcity of context-specific data in Ethiopia has hindered progress in understanding and managing AL. This research aims to fill that gap by evaluating the frequency and associated clinical factors of AL in two major referral hospitals in Addis Ababa. The findings are expected to provide a foundational understanding for improving clinical decision-making, reducing postoperative complications, and guiding policy reforms aimed at enhancing surgical care quality.

This study was conducted in two major referral hospitals located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH) and Yekatit 12 Hospital (YMH). These institutions were chosen due to their high surgical case volume and their critical role in serving a large population in both urban and peri-urban areas.

ZMH, situated on Taitu Street, is a public hospital offering a range of medical services, including approximately 10 major surgical procedures per day. With more than 6,000 outpatient visits each month, it is a key facility for the city and its surroundings. YMH is a specialized tertiary care center that manages complex surgical cases and provides multidisciplinary care involving departments such as surgery, internal medicine, and intensive care. It serves an estimated catchment population of over five million people.

A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted and data collection was undergone from March 2021to June 2021. The study reviewed patients who underwent intestinal anastomosis surgery between 2016 and 2019.

All patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the study period at ZMH and YMH.

We used consecutive sampling and included all eligible patients who met the inclusion criteria during the study period.

Two facilities were randomly selected by using a lottery method from six high-volume facilities. Subsequently, a consecutive sampling technique conducted among eligible patients presented during the study period to maximize the available sample size and ensure adequate representation until required sample size reached.

The dependent variable was clinical anastomotic leakage (AL), defined as a leak diagnosed by a physician and confirmed by documentation of re-laparotomy or discharge records.

Socio-demographic: Age, sex, marital status, alcohol and smoking history.

Pre-operative: Comorbidities, ASA classification, diagnosis, hematocrit, and creatinine levels.

Intra-operative: Type and duration of surgery, blood transfusions, surgical technique, anastomosis location and number, drain usage.

Post-operative: Complications, hematocrit, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels.

Clinical anastomosis leakage: Leakage identified by the attending physician with supporting documentation of reoperation or discharge notes Guillaume et al. [3].

Data were collected using a structured checklist developed after reviewing relevant literature and sample patient charts. The checklist was pretested on 5% of the intended sample size to identify and correct ambiguities. Feedback led to refinements in the tool. Six trained data collectors and three supervisors participated, following a one-day training workshop. The principal investigator conducted regular supervision and data quality audits.

Data were entered and cleaned using EpiData version 4.6 and then exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were generated for key variables first. Binary logistic regressions was employed to identify the relationship between dependent and independent variables. The assumptions of logistic regressions (LR) like, absence of multicollinearity by using variance inflation factor (VIF) which was 3 and the good fitness of model was checked by Hosmer–Lemeshow tests withp-value = 0.42. The possible confounding variable were controlled by multivariable analysis. To assess determinant factors for AL, all independent variables were analyzed using enter method bivariate analysis, and variables with ap-value < 0.2 were included into multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance was determined atp< 0.05. Results were reported using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Among a total of 224 study participants 206 patients who had anastomotic surgery were included in this study with response rate of 92%. Male participants accounted for 146 (70.1%) of cases while females made up the remaining 60 (29.9%). About one-fourth of the participant's age was categorized 40–60 years interval (Table 1 inAppendix).

Patients underwent intestinal anastomosis surgery between 2016 and 2019 at ZMH and YMH.

We conducted a comparison of key baseline characteristics between the 206 included patients and the 18 excluded patients with no clear final outcome to assess for potential selection bias. Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, and type of surgery showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Although the excluded patients represented 8% of the initial cohort, this analysis suggests that their exclusion is unlikely to have introduced systematic bias or significantly impacted the study findings. These results support the representativeness of the final sample.

Medical comorbidities were present among 47 (22.8%), (95%CI: 19.2–24.7) of the patients. Among the comorbidities, hypertension (HTN) made up the commonest incidence, occurring in 32 (68%) of the patients followed by Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in 15 (32%) of patients. Previous history of abdominal surgery was elicited in 52 (25.2%) of patients. (Table 2 inAppendix).

Among study participants 24 (11.7%) of patients were anemic with hemoglobin (HgB) levels below 11 mg/dl. Most patients 196 (95.2%) are ASA Class I and II. The proportion of patients in ASA class III and IV were found to be 6 (3%) and 4 (2%) respectively. 87(42.2%) of the evaluated cases were operated without bowel preparation. All the emergency operations were performed without bowel preparation. From the elective operations, 21.2% of cases were operated without bowel preparation. 55(27.2%) of the cases were operated on an emergency basis while the rest of 155(72.8%) were operated on an elective basis. (Table 3 inAppendix).

Anastomotic closure was most commonly done for redundant sigmoid colon in 63(30.6%) of the cases, for colostomy closure in 28(13.6%) for Common Bile Duct (CBD) stone in 23(11.2%) and for colorectal cancers in 19(9.2%). (Table4inAppendix).

The level of anastomosis was in the large bowel among 129 (62.6%) of the patients and in the small bowel in the remaining 77 (37.4%) of the patients. The most common site of CIA in the large bowel was colo-colic 78 (60.5%), with the commonest sites in the small bowel being ileo-ileal (36.4%) (n= 28) and hepatico-jejunostomy 22 (28.6%). On intraoperative assessment of bowel viability, 11 (20.0%) had gangrenous bowel segments. Prolonged anesthesia time (as defined by time under anesthesia beyond 04 h) was noted among 14.1% of the operations. Intraoperative blood loss (as defined by loss above 500 ml) was noted in 34(16.5%) of the operations. (Table 5 inAppendix).

Clinical anastomotic leakage rate in this study was 8.3% (95%CI; 5.4–9.1). (Fig.1).

The median postoperative hospital stay of the study population was 7 days (25%- 75% percentile of 5–103 days). The majority of patients were 164 (80.6%) discharged within 10 days, 18 (11.7%) stayed between 10–20 days, and the remaining 7(7.8%) had stayed more than 20 days postoperatively (Table 6 inAppendix). A total of 14 patients died in the study sites making the mortality rate 6.8% (95%CI, 4.8–9.9).

Patient’s clinical outcome like postoperative hospital stay and treatment outcome were strongly associated to AL. The odds of developing AL were 5.5 times higher among patients who stayed hospital for more than 20 days when compared to those discharged < 10 days (AOR; 95% CI: 1.99–7.12,P= 0.000). When compared to discharged patients, died patients 5.5 times more likely to develop AL with (AOR 5.495; 95% CI: 1.517–20.00, P = 0.004) (Table 7 inAppendix).

Both patient’s socio-demographic characteristics and pre-operative parameters were not statistically associated. We have observed the higher proportion of AL among emergency operation compared to elective operation (14.5% vs 6%). Even though the association did not cross the range for statistical significance in an absolute sense (p= 0.054), it is very close to the cutoff point of 0.05 and can be considered a significant difference in a practical sense. The relative proportions and the values of their statistical significance for other variables are further described. (Table 7 inAppendix).

In the analysis for the association of intraoperative parameters with the occurrence of AL, the viability of the bowel and the amount of intraoperative Blood loss was significantly associated with AL. The relative proportion of AL in those with gangrenous bowel was 54.5% compared to 4.5% in those with viable bowel (P< 0.001, AOR = 4.88, 95% CI = 1.62–14.69). This indicates that the presence of bowel gangrene increases the risk of AL by 4.9 times. Blood loss of > 500 ml were increased risk of AL (AOR 3.13; 95% CI: 1.07–9.17;p= 0.029) ((Table 7 inAppendix).

This study evaluated the incidence, clinical outcomes, and associated risk factors for clinical anastomotic leakage (AL) among patients who underwent intestinal anastomosis in two major referral hospitals in Ethiopia. The overall leakage rate identified was 8.3%, which is slightly higher than the commonly reported range of 4.9%–7.2% in the general population [13,14], but in alignment with findings from other studies in resource-limited settings [15, 50].

AL remains a significant complication due to its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported AL as a major contributor to postoperative complications and patient deterioration [4,13]. The observed 23.5% mortality rate among patients with AL is also in line with other studies emphasizing the severity of this complication [14,16,17].

Risk factor analysis revealed several important associations. Notably, the presence of gangrenous bowel significantly increased the risk of leakage. This can be attributed to compromised tissue viability at the anastomotic site, which impairs healing and predisposes patients to dehiscence [14,18]. Similarly, intraoperative blood loss of more than 500 ml was found to be associated with AL. Although some studies have suggested that excessive blood loss compromises perfusion and tissue oxygenation, leading to poor healing [19], in our study this variable showed an inverse relationship with AL, potentially due to more cautious intraoperative management in patients with significant bleeding.

Emergency surgeries had a higher rate of leakage compared to elective operations. While this association did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.054), it is clinically relevant. Emergency surgeries are often performed in suboptimal conditions, such as inadequate bowel preparation, hemodynamic instability, or delayed presentation, which may contribute to poor anastomotic healing [14,20]. This observation underscores the importance of optimizing preoperative conditions whenever possible.

Bowel preparation emerged as another contributing factor. Most emergency surgeries were performed without mechanical preparation, and a higher rate of AL was observed in these patients. Though the literature presents mixed views on the effectiveness of mechanical bowel cleansing, some evidence supports its role in reducing infection and leakage risks, particularly when combined with oral antibiotics [21,22].

While several comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes have been implicated in previous studies as risk factors for AL [14,23,24], our study did not find a statistically significant correlation. This might be due to the relatively low number of patients with documented comorbidities or differences in documentation and follow-up.

Our findings are consistent with studies that have emphasized the complexity of AL and its multifactorial etiology [4,6,7]. Bowel viability, operative timing, and intraoperative blood loss are all modifiable risk factors that should be addressed through targeted perioperative planning and careful surgical technique.

The study’s results highlight the need for improved preoperative assessment and intraoperative decision-making in high-risk patients. In particular, patients presenting with ischemic or gangrenous bowel segments should be carefully evaluated before primary anastomosis is attempted. In some cases, diversion may be a safer option to reduce the risk of leakage.

Our analysis also demonstrated that AL significantly prolongs postoperative hospital stay and is associated with increased mortality, findings that emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and timely intervention. Monitoring for clinical signs such as fever, abdominal pain, and changes in vital signs remains crucial, especially in facilities with limited access to advanced imaging and laboratory diagnostics [11,12].

While this study provides valuable insights, its limitations should be acknowledged. It was conducted in two hospitals and based on retrospective chart reviews, which may introduce selection bias or underreporting. Additionally, diagnostic confirmation of AL relied primarily on clinical and intraoperative findings, which may differ from radiologically confirmed leakages used in other settings.

Recent literature underscores the persistent burden of anastomotic leakage (AL) in both high- and low-resource settings, with growing efforts to identify predictive markers and system-based interventions. A 2023 meta-analysis by Choi et al. emphasized the utility of postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) trends within Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols to predict AL, offering potential for early detection even before clinical signs emerge [25] However, such monitoring tools remain scarce in low-resource environments. A 2022 retrospective cohort study from Ethiopia by Abebe et al. reported an AL rate of 11.4% and highlighted delayed diagnosis and limited critical care support as significant contributors to mortality in colorectal surgery patients [26]. These findings resonate with our own observations and underscore the critical need to contextualize perioperative care pathways, invest in affordable monitoring tools, and develop evidence-based surgical protocols tailored to resource-limited settings.

In conclusion, clinical anastomotic leakage in intestinal surgery remains a substantial burden in Ethiopian hospitals. The findings suggest that bowel viability and blood loss are significant factors associated with AL. These insights can help guide risk stratification, improve patient outcomes, and inform future prospective studies that further explore optimal management strategies for high-risk surgical populations.

In this study Clinical anastomotic leakage was found to be higher than the expected rate. Bowel viability and Blood loss was associated with increased risk of clinical anastomotic leakage. Additionally, presence of anastomotic leaks are associated with increased mortality and extended hospitalization.

Surgeons should assess patientspreoperatively for risk factors associated with anastomotic leakage, focusing on comorbid conditions and bowel viability. Minimizing intraoperative blood loss through meticulous surgical technique is essential. In patients with gangrenous bowel, the decision to perform primary anastomosis should be made cautiously. Given the increased risk of leakage in emergency procedures, hospitals should develop and implement clear surgical protocols. When feasible, high-risk or unstable patients should be managed with staged or delayed procedures. Early and vigilant postoperative monitoring is crucial, particularly within the first week, to enable prompt detection of leakage. Hospitals must ensure the availability of diagnostic tools such as imaging equipment and adopt standardized discharge protocols based on patient recovery. Ongoing training and education for surgical teams on anastomosis techniques and complication management should be prioritized.

This retrospective study relied on physician diagnosis and operative or discharge documentation to identify anastomotic leakage, which may have led to underreporting of mild or conservatively managed cases. The lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and limited access to imaging may have reduced consistency and accuracy in detecting leaks. Several important risk factors were not assessed, including detailed nutritional status, smoking history, use of steroids or immunosuppressants, specific surgical techniques such as hand-sewn versus stapled anastomosis, anastomotic tension, and the use of protective stomas. The absence of post-discharge follow-up likely contributed to missed late-onset leaks, which commonly occur after the first week. Incomplete or inconsistent medical records may have introduced information bias, and the lack of a formal sample size calculation limited the power to detect associations, especially for uncommon variables. The small number of leakage events reduced the strength of multivariable analysis. Differences in surgical technique, perioperative care, and hospital resources could not be controlled, increasing the potential for confounding. Additionally, unmeasured factors such as surgeon experience, patient volume, intensive care capacity, nursing coverage, and socioeconomic status limit the completeness of risk assessment and the generalizability of findings beyond the two hospitals in Addis Ababa.
