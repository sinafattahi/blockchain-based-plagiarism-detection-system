many publishedradiation biology studies lack critical information on experimental procedures, equipment, and physics parameters (Stern et al. 2022,2024aandb;Draeger et al. 2020;Stark 2018;Baker 2016;Desrosiers et al. 2013).

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) seeks to assist and support all partners in the fields of radiobiology, health physics, radiation physics, and related areas to transition from cesium-137 chloride-based technologies, which can potentially be used in an act of terrorism, to x-ray technologies. The absence of information on experimental procedures, equipment, and irradiation parameters directly and negatively impacts the reproducibility and translatability of a sizable portion of radiation biology studies. It also discourages researchers from adopting new tools that eliminate the risks of a radiological dispersal device.

Ongoing discussions on reproducibility have not had a significant impact on publishing practices. The lack of agreement on minimum standards for disclosure of irradiation parameters results in the need to repeat costly studies, yielding uncertainty in observed effects and producing difficulty in validating characterized animal models. The lack of standard reporting measures also contributes to the confusion and reluctance that researchers may experience when considering whether they should transition to alternatives to gamma irradiation. This reluctance is despite the many advantages these alternatives provide, including technological innovations such as guided imaging that mirror clinical applications (which cesium-137 irradiators simply cannot accommodate), significantly decreased regulatory burdens, and eliminating potential terror threats, among others. Forty-one percent of researchers that transitioned to x-ray irradiators surveyed by Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) reported that the advantages of x-ray irradiators allowed them to pursue new lines of research.

Both BNL’s recentAlternative Technologies Meta Study(Stern et al. 2022) and the work ofDraeger et al. (2020), on which it builds, reaffirm that many radiation biology studies lack information on experimental procedures, equipment, and physics parameters that would allow other researchers to compare and reproduce the outcomes of the studies. These literature reviews demonstrate that, although source specifications (e.g., model, energy, and spectra) are well reported, experimental methodologies and irradiation protocols are not. For example, there are significant information gaps in reporting dosimetry, geometry, filtration, and experimental error of uncertainty. Thus, replication of reported values across studies and users is problematic. For studies where the critical biological endpoints measured have a narrow range (±5% or less), knowing the parameters that control the dosimetry is critical. However, most published studies do not provide enough information on experimental results to reproduce the study or experiment.

Two recent initiatives have attempted to bring about consensus on minimum standards for disclosure of irradiation methods and protocols. The AAPM empowered Task Group No. 319 to work on creating guidelines for accurate dosimetry in radiation biology experiments, and its findings are eagerly awaited. A second initiative, the Compatibility in Irradiation Research Protocols Expert Roundtable (CIRPER), began in October 2022 on the margins of the Radiation Research Society’s annual conference. Sponsored by the NNSA through its Office of Radiological Security and BNL, the roundtable invited radiation biologists, medical physicists, health physicists, federal grant managers, and device manufacturers to agree on a standardized set of parameters that radiation biologists working with x-ray cabinet irradiators should include when publishing their work. Such inclusion of parameters would allow other researchers to determine their work’s comparability to similar studies using different irradiation modalities, as well as facilitate reproducibility of their experimental results.

Over two days of discussion, CIRPER participants agreed that, at a minimum, the methods sections of radiation biology papers must reference irradiation protocols, providing details on device specifications, dosimetry, experimental setup, and calibration. The CIRPER Recommended Methodological Disclosure Requirements are listed in Table1. Summarizing the minimum recommended methodological information following Table1would provide for consistent, efficient, and standardized submissions to peer-reviewed research journals and federal funding agencies.

CIRPER recommended methodological disclosure requirements.

However, the importance of health physicists in this effort cannot be understated. Health physicists can provide an understanding of the differences between energy spectra of 662 keV gamma rays and x-ray spectra and the associated penetrability. Health physicists also understand the health and psychosocial consequences of cesium-137 chloride dispersion if such a source is dispersed. In addition, many health physicists, especially those serving as radiation safety officers for research hospitals and universities, understand the differences in protection and security requirements for irradiators and have participated in the process for replacement.

A consensus on inclusion of irradiation protocols in published papers will only impact the quality of peer-reviewed and federally funded research if there is a commitment to enforcing these expectations. Imposition of unified expectations for reporting methodological information will require a concerted effort to make researchers and reviewers aware of these requirements.

The CIRPER participants urgeHealth Physicsto adopt their recommendations and include them in their article acceptance and review policies.
