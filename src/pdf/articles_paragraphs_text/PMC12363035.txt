This study aimed to evaluate the predictive capacity of the Body Roundness Index (BRI), Abdominal Body Shape Index (ABSI), Waist-to-Weight Index (WWI), and Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) for sarcopenic obesity (SO) incidence among older adults in China using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). The cohort included 3,919 participants aged 65 and older, with a mean follow-up of 2.79 years. Sarcopenic obesity was defined by low muscle mass and high body fat. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) based on the Poisson distribution were used to assess the associations and predictive performance of these indices. After adjustment, BRI (HR: 1.037, 95% CI: 1.014, 1.060), ABSI (HR: 13.247, 95% CI: 1.677, 104.660), WWI (HR: 1.023, 95% CI: 1.006, 1.040), and WHtR (HR: 1.007, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.010) were significant predictors of SO incidence. Threshold effect analyses revealed non-linear relationships for BRI and WHtR. The predictive model based on GAMs demonstrated strong discrimination (C-index: 0.879 for the modeling set and 0.876 for the validation set) and good clinical utility. These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for individuals with abdominal obesity to prevent future sarcopenic obesity, thereby reducing disease and social burdens and improving the quality of life for the elderly.

As the global population ages, the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity (SO) has risen markedly. This condition is defined by the concurrent presence of low muscle mass and high body fat [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of SO ranges from 13 to 23% across diverse populations, underscoring its emergence as a significant global health challenge [2–4]. Although there is still no consensus in the academic community on the diagnostic criteria for SO, particularly regarding the relationship between skeletal muscle grip strength and muscle and fat estimates. The consensus established by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and the recently emerging Asia-Pacific consensus show significant differences in the definition and thresholds for skeletal muscle assessment when estimating Asian populations. The Asian consensus suggests that skeletal muscle measurement should follow the same definition as sarcopenia (ASM/Height²), There are also differences in the definition of obesity (Asia uses BMI definition), while ESPEN and EASO argue that the definition of sarcopenia should not be directly applied to the diagnosis of SO [1,5]. However, its role as an independent risk factor for frailty and mortality has been widely recognized [6–8]. This is particularly evident among older adults with chronic diseases, where SO has been shown to have a pronounced adverse effect on health outcomes [9]. These findings highlight the urgent need for early identification and intervention strategies to address this complex condition.

Despite the well-documented adverse effects on health, high prevalence, and significant potential for therapeutic intervention associated with sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, their screening and diagnosis are frequently overlooked in routine clinical practice [9,10]. Additionally, the SO diagnostic process is constrained by its inherent limitations, with diagnostic tools being costly and less accessible in restricted areas. At present, therapeutic interventions for sarcopenic obesity are still limited [11]. Given these challenges, early prediction and preemptive intervention for SO are of paramount importance, particularly among the elderly population.

Prior research has demonstrated that the waist height ratio (WHtR) is strongly associated with changes in body fat and muscle mass, establishing it as an effective screening tool [12]. Additionally, the A body shape index (ABSI) has been validated as a reliable measure of lean body mass [13]. The Body round index (BRI) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic alternative, successfully utilized in prior studies to identify patients with metabolic syndrome [14]. More recently, cross-sectional studies have shown that the weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) can effectively differentiate SO patients within the population of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Specifically, WWI is positively correlated with trunk fat mass and negatively correlated with appendicular skeletal muscle mass, thereby serving as a robust indicator for predicting cardiometabolic risk factors [15].

This study was conducted based on the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) as a cohort investigation. The primary objective was to examine the predictive capacity of the Body Roundness Index (BRI), Abdominal Body Shape Index (ABSI), Waist-to-Weight Index (WWI), and Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) for the future incidence of sarcopenic obesity within the elderly population. Additionally, the study aimed to develop a model that could predict the risk of disease onset. A random forest model was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of each variable’s predictions.

CLHLS is a prospective cohort study focusing on individuals aged 65 and older in China. Utilizing a multi-stage cluster sampling approach, the study randomly selects participants from 23 out of China’s 31 provinces, encompassing approximately 85% of the country’s total population. This sampling strategy ensures the representativeness and broad coverage of the sample, thereby enabling the study to effectively capture the health status and relevant influencing factors among China’s elderly population [16,17]. This study utilized cohort data from CLHLS spanning from 2008 to 2018. Follow-up surveys were administered in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008/2009, 2011/2012, 2014, and 2018 via face-to-face interviews, commencing in 1998. For this study, the baseline data were drawn from the 2011 survey, and follow-up data from 2011 to 2014 were incorporated into the analysis (Fig.1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The CLHLS study has been approved by the Peking University Medical Ethics Committee (IRB00001052-13074).

In the CLHLS, the height, weight, and waist circumference of the elderly participants were measured following stringent standardized protocols. Detailed information regarding the quality control measures can be accessed via the project’s website. (The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS)-Longitudinal Data(1998–2018) - Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity and Happy Family Study (CLHLS-HF)) [18].

Muscle mass is primarily assessed using appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), which is measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), according to the criteria established by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) [19]. However, the use of these methods is limited in community settings due to the high cost and bulkiness of the required equipment, as well as the need for specialized training. To address these limitations, the consensus equation[20].

Sarcopenic obesity is defined as appendicular lean mass to weight ratio (ALM/W) < 32.2% for males and < 25.5% for females [1] in conjunction with a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m² [21].

Sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and medical histories were considered to control for potential biases. Sociodemographic characteristics included age (continuous variable), gender (male or female), place of residence (urban, town, or rural), and marital status (currently married and living with spouse, separated, divorced, widowed, or never married). Health behaviors included physical exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Physical exercise (yes or no) was assessed by asking, “Do you currently exercise regularly?” Smoking (yes or no) was evaluated by asking, “Do you currently smoke?” Alcohol consumption (yes or no) was assessed by asking, “Do you currently drink alcohol?” Medical histories were based on self-reported hypertension, diabetes and stroke.

Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the baseline characteristics. Continuous variables were analyzed using t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed to evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between four waist circumference-related indices and the risk of sarcopenic obesity (SO) incidence. Three Cox models were developed: Model 1 was unadjusted for covariates; Model 2 adjusted for age, sex, residence, and marital status; Model 3 further included health behaviors and medical history. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (time-ROC) curves were generated based on the multivariate Cox regression to assess the predictive ability of the predictors for SO incidence risk at different time points, with the x-axis time unit set to days.

To investigate both linear and non-linear relationships between variables, we utilized generalized additive models (GAMs) based on the Poisson distribution, adjusting for exposure time and conducting further analyses. Compared to traditional linear regression models, GAMs provide greater flexibility by allowing smooth, non-parametric functions of the predictors. This flexibility is particularly advantageous in reducing the risk of model misspecification when the relationships between predictors and outcomes are complex or not fully understood [22,23]. The GAMs were fitted using the ‘mgcv’ package in R, with smoothing parameters selected using generalized cross-validation (GCV) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). An ANOVA test was performed to compare generalized linear models with GAMs, thereby assessing the significance of the smooth terms. For variables exhibiting significant non-linear relationships, we employed the segmented package to conduct threshold effect analysis.

We then constructed a disease incidence model for SO using generalized additive models (GAMs) based on the Poisson distribution. Initially, we conducted univariate Cox regression analyses and included variables withP< 0.6 into the multivariate Cox regression. The multivariate Cox regression was performed using three stepwise selection methods: “forward,” “backward,” and “both.” ANOVA tests were conducted among the three models based on the AIC to assess differences. Since no significant differences were observed, we retained the variables from the model with the lowest AIC.

Subsequently, we employed the “foreign” package to perform Lasso regression with 10-fold cross-validation, using the minimum lambda value as the selection criterion, which ultimately identified six variables (sex, weight, height, WC, WHtR, BRI). Based on the statistically significant variables identified in the multivariate Cox regression, we included sex, weight, WHtR, and waist circumference (WC). We then generated a correlation matrix and excluded WC due to multicollinearity, leaving sex, weight, and WHtR for inclusion in the GAMs for prediction. Internal validation was performed using the Bootstrap method. Although Cox regression models are highly effective for analyzing time-to-event data, they may have limitations in constructing disease incidence risk prediction models. To address these limitations, GAMs based on the Poisson distribution offer a flexible alternative [24].

Ultimately, we employed a random forest model to assess the relative importance of each variable, thereby ranking their predictive efficacy in forecasting SO.

At the conclusion of the study, we incorporated stroke as a potential covariate to ascertain whether it exerted any influence on the potential causal relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome.

R software, version 4.1.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform all statistical analyses.

The cohort comprised 3,919 participants: 2,197 females (56.1%) and 1,722 males (43.9%) (Table1). Females were older (mean age 82.5 ± 10.3 vs. 80.5 ± 8.9 years;P< 0.001) and had higher mean values for waist-to-height ratio (54.7 ± 9.4 vs. 50.4 ± 13.4;P< 0.001), body roundness index (4.5 ± 2.1 vs. 3.5 ± 2.5;P< 0.001), body mass index (22.0 ± 4.9 vs. 20.7 ± 2.5;P< 0.001), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (20.0 ± 3.0 vs. 18.3 ± 2.3;P< 0.001), and weight-adjusted waist index (11.8 ± 1.7 vs. 11.1 ± 3.1;P< 0.001).No sex-based differences were observed in baseline metabolic equivalents (P= 0.78), waist circumference (P= 0.87), or a body shape index (P= 0.35).

Males had higher rates of current smoking (62.4% vs. 10.0%;P< 0.001), alcohol consumption (51.2% vs. 10.4%;P< 0.001), and regular exercise (45.6% vs. 40.7%;P= 0.002). Females more frequently reported hypertension (33.0% vs. 25.6%;P< 0.001) and diabetes (5.6% vs. 3.1%;P< 0.001). Sarcopenic obesity was more prevalent in males (9.1% vs. 0.2%;P< 0.001). Marital status differed significantly (P< 0.001), with fewer males married (33.1% vs. 66.8%) and more single (61.7% vs. 31.4%). Residential distribution was similar between sexes (P= 0.34).

After a mean follow-up period of 2.79 years, 161 new cases of incidence (4.11%) were observed. In Model 1, neither BRI nor WWI reached statistical significance. After full adjustment, BRI (HR: 1.037, 95% CI: 1.014, 1.060), ABSI (HR: 13.247, 95% CI: 1.677, 104.660), WWI (HR: 1.023, 95% CI: 1.006, 1.040), and WHtR (HR: 1.007, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.010) were all statistically significant (Table2).

The results of the time-ROC curves are depicted in Fig.2, with the reference line (dashed black) set at a C-index of 0.87. The analysis reveals that, with the exception of WHtR, the C-index values for the remaining predictive indicators are lower than 0.87.

The results of the generalized additive models (GAMs) analysis are presented in Fig.3. The ANOVA test comparing GAMs with generalized linear models (GLM) revealed that BRI and WHtR exhibited non-linear relationships, while ABSI and WWI demonstrated linear relationships. For variables with non-linear relationships, we conducted threshold effect analysis, and the results are summarized in Tables3and4. BRI was associated with sarcopenic obesity (SO) with a threshold effect (Pfor likelihood test < 0.001). Overall, BRI was positively associated with SO [HR (95% CI): 1.04 (1.01–1.06)]. When BRI was below 5.314, BRI was strongly positively associated with SO [HR (95% CI): 1.90 (1.56–2.31)]. No association was found between BRI and SO when BRI was above 5.314. Similarly, WHtR was associated with SO incidence with a threshold effect (Pfor likelihood test < 0.001). Overall, WHtR was positively associated with SO incidence [HR (95% CI): 1.01 (1.00–1.01)]. When WHtR was below 59.494, WHtR was positively associated with SO [HR (95% CI): 1.12 (1.08–1.17)]. No association was found between WHtR and SO when WHtR was above 59.494.

The statistical analysis methods are detailed in the Statistical Methods section. The results of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses are provided in the supplementary materials (Table S1). Subsequently, Lasso regression was conducted with a penalty term and validated using 10-fold cross-validation, as illustrated in supplementary Figure S1. Using the minimum lambda as the threshold, six variables were ultimately selected. Based on the results of the multivariate Cox regression and due to collinearity between WC and WHtR, we retained WHtR for model construction. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test results for both the modeling and validation sets had p-values greater than 0.05, indicating good model fit.

The model discrimination results are depicted in Fig.4, with a C-index of 0.879 for the modeling set and 0.876 for the validation set. The ROC results based on the Bootstrap method demonstrate good discrimination performance.

The model calibration curve results are presented in Fig.5, revealing that the predictive performance was underestimated in the validation set.

The decision curve analysis (DCA) results are shown in Fig.6, indicating that the model retains good clinical utility.

The results of the random forest analysis are presented in Fig.7. Among the four predictive variables, ABSI exhibited the highest relative importance. BRI and WHtR shared the same level of relative importance, followed by WWI.

Sensitivity analysis results showed that there was no statistical difference in stroke incidence between men and women in the baseline analysis (n= 3881, 38 missing values deleted, See supplementary materials, Table S2). To ensure its impact on the Cox regression results in the study, we included it in the multivariate Cox regression to examine its potential impact on the results (See supplementary materials, Table S3). The results showed that the inclusion of stroke did not change the direction of the study results.

In this prospective cohort study of 3,919 Chinese older adults who were free of sarcopenic obesity (SO) at baseline, we observed that higher levels of BRI, ABSI, WWI, and WHtR were associated with an increased risk of SO incidence. The time-ROC analysis revealed that all four predictors demonstrated good discrimination across different time points. The stepwise Cox regression analysis ultimately included WHtR in the prediction model. The random forest analysis also indicated that the predictive performance of the four predictors was superior to that of WC. Our findings suggest that WHtR may be the most effective predictor of future SO incidence among Chinese older adults, while ABSI shows potential for further development.

It is noteworthy that the baseline table section of the results demonstrated significant disparities between men and women in the incidence of SO (with a lower incidence observed in women). These substantial disparities may be associated with gender-based variations in metabolic syndrome [25,26]. As indicated by the findings of preceding studies, gender-related disparities in fat distribution appear to be associated with a reduced likelihood of sarcopenia and obesity in women [27]. Furthermore, women exhibit heightened protective mechanisms in energy storage and metabolic regulation, particularly during the childbearing years. This heightened protection renders them more resistant to obesity and metabolic abnormalities under similar conditions [28]. However, postmenopausal women exhibit an increased propensity to develop metabolic syndrome, a condition attributable to alterations in fat distribution and hormonal levels [29].

A high BRI is indicative of visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome [30] which can increase the risk of sarcopenic obesity in older adults by promoting inflammatory responses, reducing muscle mass, and impairing metabolic function [31]. Previous research has shown that individuals with high ABSI often have larger waists but lower BMI, and are strongly associated with the high cardiovascular disease risk observed in Japanese obese patients with metabolic syndrome and sarcopenia, independent of BMI [32]. High ABSI is also typically associated with increased abdominal fat, which can lead to chronic low-grade inflammation. This inflammatory state may negatively impact muscle tissue, resulting in reduced muscle mass [33,34]. Studies have shown that ABSI is positively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, an inflammatory marker, suggesting that high ABSI may increase the risk of sarcopenic obesity by promoting inflammation or reducing insulin sensitivity [33]. High ABSI is also associated with a lower fat-free mass index (FFMI), indicating reduced muscle mass, which is a key feature of sarcopenic obesity in older adults. Research has found that ABSI is negatively correlated with FFMI, particularly in men, suggesting that high ABSI may be an indicator of reduced muscle mass [35]. Related studies have shown that WWI is positively correlated with trunk fat mass (TFA) and negatively correlated with appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) [36] which may explain the effectiveness of WWI in predicting future sarcopenic obesity incidence among Chinese older adults. WHtR, as a highly relevant factor for sarcopenic obesity, has demonstrated acceptable discrimination in previous cross-sectional studies [37]. While previous studies explored the diagnostic value of these indices using cross-sectional approaches, our study further determined their predictive value for future disease incidence, as well as their linear or non-linear relationships and threshold effects, through a cohort study design.

Despite being ranked as the most important predictor in the random forest analysis, likely due to its higher HR value and linear relationship, the robustness of this result is questionable (owing to the wide confidence interval). Consequently, during the predictor selection phase for the prediction model, the more significant WHtR was chosen. The prediction model we constructed exhibited strong predictive performance, with a C-index higher than 0.87, as evidenced by the time-ROC analysis of the four predictors in the multivariate Cox regression. Since no other prediction models for disease incidence risk have been established in current research, our study results currently lack a basis for comparison. However, this also provides a direction for future research.

A multitude of related studies have demonstrated that regular aerobic exercise (including but not limited to brisk walking, running, and cycling) can lead to a substantial reduction in waist circumference and WHtR, with high-intensity aerobic exercise exhibiting greater efficacy compared to moderate-intensity exercise [38]. Furthermore, the incorporation of daily physical activity, encompassing components such as school physical education classes and domestic exercise regimens, has been demonstrated to be an efficacious strategy for reducing WHtR in children and adolescents [39]. This approach has been shown to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength, and flexibility. Additionally, it serves as a preventative measure against the onset of SO. A number of studies have indicated that a Mediterranean diet, characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, olive oil, fish, and nuts, may contribute to a reduction in abdominal fat and WHtR [40]. The integration of nutritional counsel and behavioral interventions, encompassing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with physical activity has been demonstrated to result in a reduction in waist circumference and WHtR, enhanced dietary habits, and a concomitant improvement in the prevention of SO [41]. Moreover, the utilization of traditional Chinese medicine or nutritional supplements has been demonstrated to enhance patients’ nutritional status and facilitate the recovery of body composition [42].

In reality, elevated BRI, ABSI, WWI, and WHtR all indicate abdominal obesity characterized primarily by increased visceral fat accumulation [43]. Visceral fat tissue secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP), which activate the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in skeletal muscle cells. This induces the expression of genes related to muscle protein breakdown, promoting muscle protein degradation and leading to muscle atrophy [44,45]. Additionally, visceral obesity can induce the infiltration of immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, releasing more inflammatory mediators. This creates a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that continuously affects muscle tissue metabolism and function, promoting the development of sarcopenic obesity [46]. This chronic inflammation caused by immune cell infiltration suggests that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could be a potential biomarker [47].

Concurrently, visceral obesity accelerates lipolysis in adipose tissue, leading to the release of large amounts of free fatty acids into the bloodstream and their subsequent uptake by skeletal muscle cells [48,49]. However, the capacity for fatty acid oxidation within skeletal muscle cells is limited. Excess fatty acids that cannot be oxidized in a timely manner accumulate within muscle cells, forming intramyocellular lipid deposits [50]. These deposits interfere with mitochondrial function, inhibit the process of oxidative phosphorylation, and affect energy metabolism, thereby impairing normal muscle cell function and protein synthesis, and promoting muscle atrophy [51,52].

Mitochondria, serving as the cell’s energy factories, play a crucial role in energy metabolism and cellular respiration. Visceral obesity can lead to a decrease in mitochondrial number, abnormal morphology, and impaired respiratory chain function within skeletal muscle cell [53]. Mitochondrial dysfunction not only impairs energy metabolism in skeletal muscle cells, resulting in inadequate energy production and reduced muscle strength, but also induces excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which overwhelms the cell’s antioxidant capacity and leads to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress damages cellular biomolecules (proteins, lipids, and DNA), thereby disrupting normal cellular functions and promoting muscle cell apoptosis and muscle atrophy [54]. This further leads to sarcopenia [55].

As age increases, levels of sex hormones decline, and visceral obesity further exacerbates this hormonal imbalance. Testosterone, which promotes protein synthesis and muscle growth to maintain muscle mass, decreases with age, leading to reduced muscle protein synthesis and muscle mass [56]. Estrogen, which regulates fat distribution and metabolism, also declines with age, making fat more likely to accumulate in the visceral and abdominal regions. This contributes to visceral obesity and adversely affects skeletal muscle [57]. Additionally, both visceral obesity and aging lead to decreased levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which play key roles in skeletal muscle growth and repair. Reduced levels of these hormones inhibit the proliferation of skeletal muscle cells and protein synthesis, promoting muscle atrophy and muscle mass reduction, and significantly increasing the risk of sarcopenic obesity [45]. These findings appear to provide a reasonable explanation for the variables included in our prediction model.

The present study is subject to the following limitations. The estimates were calculated using a formula rather than measured directly by DXA, as the database did not include DXA-related data. While the predictive formula exhibited superior accuracy, it is important to note that this method may lead to reduced precision in muscle mass estimation. This study was subject to certain limitations. Firstly, the assessment of muscle function was constrained by the available measures. Secondly, the adjustment for chronic diseases was not possible due to the absence of relevant covariates. Furthermore, health behaviors (e.g., physical exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption) were assessed as self-reported dichotomous variables. The limitations of the predictive model stem from insufficient available data, leading to overfitting in the validation set due to data missingness. It is imperative that future studies incorporate rigorous external validation procedures to assess the model’s predictive capability. In the development of future predictive models, it is imperative to consider the incorporation of inflammatory markers extracted from blood samples. This integration is expected to enhance the interpretability of the model, thereby enabling more precise and actionable predictions.

In summary, this cohort study based on the Chinese elderly population demonstrates that BRI, ABSI, WWI, and WHtR are all effective predictors of future sarcopenic obesity incidence. Given that the WHtR is the most stable and easily interpretable indicator, its practicality is particularly valuable. The prediction model based on the Poisson distribution using GAMs achieves good predictive performance. Therefore, for individuals with abdominal obesity, early attention and effective intervention are essential to prevent future sarcopenic obesity, thereby reducing future disease and social burdens and improving the quality of life for the elderly.

BRI, ABSI, WWI, and WHtR are all effective predictors of future sarcopenic obesity incidence among older adults.
