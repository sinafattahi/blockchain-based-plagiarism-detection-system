Oxypalmatine (OPT), a small molecule alkaloid isolated from Phellodendron amurense, is a bioactive compound with promising anticancer potential. We evaluated the efficacy of OPT using four lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and four patient-derived organoid tissues. Additionally, the anticancer effects of OPT were further validated through in vivo experiments. We investigated the impact of OPT on apoptosis in the A549 cell line and observed that OPT induced apoptotic cell death. Subsequently, western blotting and transmission electron microscopy revealed that OPT promoted autophagy in A549 lung cancer cells. Through network pharmacology analysis, we identified the potential involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the action of OPT. Molecular docking studies with PIK3R1 and AKT1 suggested that OPT may directly interact with this pathway. Western blot analysis further confirmed that OPT resulted in the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. Furthermore, treatment with the PI3K/AKT agonist SC79 partially mitigated the pro-apoptotic effects of OPT. Co-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and OPT enhanced OPT-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells, indicating that OPT triggers protective autophagy in lung cancer cells. Co-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor CQ markedly enhanced OPT-induced apoptosis, suggesting that inhibition of autophagy sensitizes cells to OPT. These findings highlight that OPT triggers a protective autophagy response, and that combining OPT with autophagy inhibitors such as CQ may serve as a more effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.

In the male population, lung cancer accounts for the highest incidence and mortality rate of malignant tumours, and in the female population, lung cancer is second only to breast cancer in terms of incidence and mortality [1]. Many lung cancer patients are detected at an advanced stage, at which point surgical intervention is no longer a viable treatment option. Conventional chemoradiotherapy often fails to control the disease progression, so in most parts of the world, the 5-year survival rate for individuals diagnosed with lung cancer remains dismally low, ranging between 10% and 20% [2]. Despite the recent progresses in therapeutic modalities for lung cancer, transitioning from chemotherapy to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, yet certain limitations persist [3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel anti-cancer agents that can complement existing treatments and enhance outcomes for patients with lung cancer.

Ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine, a therapeutic system with a long history, has recently gained widespread recognition as a viable alternative method for cancer therapy [4]. Over the past few decades, a growing number of natural products and their bioactive derivatives have been have been recognized for their therapeutic potential in the therapy of lung cancer [5]. For instance, Naringenin exerts strong anticancer activity against lung cancer cells by promoting apoptosis and triggering autophagic cell death [6]. Aloperine inhibits lung cancer progression by targeting VPS4A, thereby disrupting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and impairing the autophagic process [7]. Oxypalmatine was isolated from Phellodendron amurense [8]. OPT has been proven to modulate the growth and trigger apoptosis of breast cancer cells through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway [9]. Currently, there are no published studies investigating the role of OPT in cancers other than breast cancer. Despite its structural similarity to palmatine and berberine, two well-studied alkaloids with broad anticancer properties, OPT’s pharmacological effects in other tumor types, especially lung cancer, have not been explored. This knowledge gap highlights the novelty of our research and positions our study as the first to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and mechanisms of OPT in lung cancer.

The patient-derived tumor organoid (PDO) is a three-dimensional cellular aggregate constructed through in vitro culture, possessing the advantage of self-renewal and maintaining similar structure and functionality with the source tissue. Organoids can accurately recapitulate the functionality of in vivo tissues, while maintaining stable genetic specificity throughout long-term cultivation and passaging [10]. The anticancer effect of OPT has yet to be validated at lung cancer organoids, and the its molecular mechanism remains unknown.

Promotion of apoptosis is a common anti-tumor mechanism for many drugs. Autophagy is a type II programmed cell death pathway related to apoptosis [11]. Initial discoveries pointed to autophagy’s dual-faceted role in cancer, and ongoing research continues to enrich our comprehension of the intricate mechanisms by which autophagy modulates both the onset and progression of cancer. There is now a consensus that autophagy acts as a suppressor during tumor initiation. However, studies have also highlighted the necessity of the autophagic process in established tumors, which promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation and increased metabolic demands, thus making tumors dependent on autophagy to survive [12].

A significant genetic alteration in lung cancer involves the mutation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, which serve as primary activators of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, mutations in the KRAS gene can independently trigger this pathway [13]. Researchers are increasingly focusing on the development of therapies that target the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Clinical trials are actively exploring the efficacy of various PI3K/AKT inhibitors, including MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor), buparlisib (PI3K inhibitor), and perifosine (dual PI3K/AKT inhibitor). These therapies are currently being evaluated for their potential to treat lung cancer [14–16].

In this study, we demonstrated that OPT reduces cell proliferation and triggers apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, We aimed to investigate how OPT-induced autophagy affects apoptosis. Our findings provide the first evidence of OPT’s anti-lung cancer activity and offer mechanistic insights into its therapeutic potential.

The reagents employed in the process are as follows: Oxypalmatine (CAS:19716-59-7, TargetMol); SC79(CAS:305834-79-1, TargetMol); Chloroquine (CAS:54-05-7, TargetMol); Bcl-2 (12789-1-AP, Proteintech), Bax (50599-2-Ig, Proteintech), cleaved caspase-3 (25128-1-AP, Proteintech), LC3AB (Cat# 4108 S, Cell Signaling Technology), Beclin-1 (Cat# 3738 S, CST), PI3K (Cat# 4249 T, CST), pPI3K (Cat# 17366 T, CST), Akt (Cat# 9272 S, CST), p-Akt (Cat# 9271 T, CST).

Lung cancer cell lines A549, H1975, H1299, and PC9 were supplied by the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum at a temperature of 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and treated with varying concentrations of OPT (1.11 µM, 3.33 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, and 90 µM). Each concentration was tested in five replicate wells. Lung cancer cells were exposed to the drug for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Following incubation, cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 reagent (Biosharp, China). After 2 h of incubation with the reagent, absorbance was measured using a microplate reader.

Untreated A549 cells and those treated with OPT for 48 h were incubated with EdU for 2 h, then fixed with pre-cooled methanol for 15 min, permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with Azide488 and Hoechst. Cell proliferation was assessed by evaluating the number of EdU-positive cells observed under a fluorescence microscope.

Approximately 500 cells were seeded into each well of a six-well plate. The cells were cultured for two weeks in medium containing 5 µM OPT or OPT-free medium until cell clusters formed. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. A colony was defined as a non-overlapping cell cluster containing at least 50 cells. The number of colonies was quantified using ImageJ, with each experiment performed in triplicate to ensure data reliability.

Tumor samples were collected at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, China, with full approval from the hospital’s Human Ethics Committee. Consent adhering strictly to the principles of animal ethics was obtained from all participating patients diagnosed with lung cancer, as detailed in Table S1, which includes their clinical profiles. Following resection, tumor tissues were immediately immersed in pre-cold advanced DMEM/F12 culture medium and transported on ice to the laboratory within one hour for subsequent processing.

The surgical specimen was thoroughly washed with PBS containing a dual antibiotic solution, then minced into small pieces. It was digested with type II collagenase at 37 °C for 1 h with intermittent shaking to aid in tissue dissociation. After digestion, the mixture was filtered using a 100 μm cell strainer. The lung cancer organoids were subsequently cultured in complete medium (Oumel, China).

PDOs and surgical specimens were first fixed in pre-cooled 4% paraformaldehyde. They were then embedded in a 3% agarose solution, which was dissolved in TAE buffer, and the mixture was heated to boiling. The specimens were embedded in paraffin and sectioned into continuous thin layers using a microtome. The sections were placed on a tissue floating bath and subsequently transferred to the center of the slides. They were then dried in a slide dryer. Deparaffinization was carried out using xylene, followed by rehydration with ethanol gradients and distilled water. Primary antibodies (including TTF1, napsin A, and CK7) were applied and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were applied to the sections, followed by incubation. Freshly prepared DAB substrate solution was added for chromogenic detection, and the sections were observed under a microscope.

Treated with 5 µM OPT for 48 h, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS, followed by fixation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed with a sucrose solution and left overnight. The cells were embedded in agarose and fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. They were then dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol solutions and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were prepared from the resin blocks using an ultramicrotome and treated with a saturated solution of uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate staining. Autophagosomes were visualized and examined with a transmission electron microscope.

A549 cells were seeded in six-well plates and treated with medium containing 5 µM OPT to extract cellular proteins. After loading the proteins, electrophoresis was performed, followed by transfer to a membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 3 h, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the corresponding primary antibody. The next day, the membrane was washed three times with TBST for 5 min each, followed by a 2-hour incubation at room temperature with the corresponding secondary antibody, and then observed for the target bands using an imaging system.

A549 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10⁴ cells/well in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with DMSO (control), OPT (5 µM), CQ (5 µM), or OPT combined with CQ (5 µM each) for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the Beyotime Live/Dead Cell Staining Kit (C2015S). After treatment, the culture medium was aspirated and cells were gently washed once with PBS. A 300 µL working solution containing 2.5 µM Calcein-AM and 5 µM Pi was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C in the dark for 15 min. Cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope, where live cells labeled with Calcein-AM exhibited green fluorescence (Ex/Em: 490/515 nm) and dead cells labeled with PI showed red fluorescence (Ex/Em: 535/617 nm). The numbers of live and dead cells were quantified using ImageJ software to calculate cell viability.

PDOs were exposed to OPT for 72 h. Following the treatment, the samples were washed three times with PBS. A staining solution was prepared by mixing calcein-AM (1µM) and Pi (5µM) in 200 µl of PBS. Lung cancer organoids were subsequently incubated with calcein-AM and Pi for 15 min, while shielded from light. After staining, the organoids were imaged using a fluorescence microscope.

A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight, then treated with various concentrations of OPT (5 µM, 10 µM, and 20 µM) for 24 h. The control group received an equal volume of DMSO (final concentration 0.1%). After treatment, floating cells in the culture medium were collected, and the adherent cells were washed with PBS and gently trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin without EDTA. All cells were combined and washed with PBS. Approximately 1 × 10⁵ cells were resuspended in 100 µL of 1× Binding Buffer, followed by the addition of 5 µL Annexin V-FITC and 5 µL PI. The mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10–15 min and then diluted with 400 µL Binding Buffer. Fluorescence was analyzed using a flow cytometer, and the percentages of early (Annexin V⁺/PI⁻) and late (Annexin V⁺/PI⁺) apoptotic cells were quantified using FlowJo software.

To identify the targets of OPT, the 2D structure of the small molecule was retrieved from the PubChem database. Potential targets were then predicted based on the 2D structure using the SEA and SwissTargetPrediction databases. Additionally, lung cancer-related targets were obtained by merging and deduplicating search results from the DisGeNET, Therapeutic Target Database, and GeneCards databases. A Venn diagram was used to intersect the lung cancer targets with the drug targets, identifying common targets as the potential therapeutic targets of OPT for lung cancer. The identified OPT targets for lung cancer were uploaded to the STRING database, where the species was set to Homo sapiens, the confidence threshold was set to 0.9, and isolated nodes were removed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the OPT targets was then constructed. Furthermore, key targets were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, withP< 0.05 considered statistically significant. The functions enriched by GO analysis and the pathways identified by KEGG analysis were visualized.

Select core targets from the PPI network relationship diagram as receptor proteins for molecular docking, 13 in total. Use OPT as the ligand molecule for molecular docking. Check the ID of the receptor protein through Uniprot database, import it into the Protein Crystal Structure Database (PDB) to obtain the crystal structure formula of the corresponding protein, select ‘Human sapiens’ as the species, download the pdb file of the receptor protein, and search for the ligand molecule by querying the CAS number of the ligand molecule through the PubChem database. With the help of PubChem database, we searched for the 3D model of the ligand molecule by querying the CAS number of the ligand molecule, downloaded it into SDF file, and transformed the ligand molecule in SDF file into pdb file by OpenBabelGUI software. The pdb format files of receptor proteins and ligand molecules were imported into AutoDockTools-1.5.7 for pre-processing of molecular docking, after which molecular docking was carried out, and the resultant data of molecular docking was saved and visualised in PyMOL software.

Fourteen male ICR mice at 4 weeks of age were randomly assigned to either the control or treatment groups. All mice received a subcutaneous injection on the back with 3 × 10⁵ lewis cells (LLC) in a 200 µL cell suspension. Based on preliminary experimental findings, the treatment group was administered OPT intraperitoneally at a dose of 20 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks, while the control group received an equivalent volume of normal saline via the same route. Body weight was measured on post-treatment days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. On day 15, the mice were euthanized, and tumor tissues were excised and individually weighed. The experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Center at Nantong University.

The experimental results were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10.0. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons between two groups were performed using a t-test, while comparisons among multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Lung cancer cells were treated for 24 h and 48 h with 0, 1.11, 3.33, 10, 30, 100 µM concentrations of OPT. The CCK8 assay revealed a dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxic effect of OPT on lung cancer cells (Fig.1A). The selected concentrations of OPT (1.11, 3.33, 10, 30, and 90 µM) were based on preliminary dose–response experiments using CCK-8 assays, which revealed a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on lung cancer cell viability. The lower doses (1.11 and 3.33 µM) were chosen to evaluate subtle biological effects near the threshold of activity, while the intermediate and higher doses (10, 30, and 90 µM) were selected to delineate the full dose–response curve and to determine the IC50 values. This range also allowed us to observe both the pharmacological effects and potential cytotoxicity of OPT across a broad concentration spectrum. The OPT treatment groups exhibited significantly inhibited cell viability compared with control group. The IC50 values of OPT for A549, H1299, H1975 and PC9 cells were approximately 17.42 µM, 25.48 µM, 15.36 µM, and 20.10 µM, respectively, after 24 h of treatment and 3.747 µM, 4.215 µM, 3.811 µM and 12.22 µM after 48 h. Therefore, 5 µM OPT for 48 h was mainly used in subsequent experiments unless specified otherwise. EdU assays showed that OPT treatment attenuated the growth of A549 and H1299 cells (Fig.1B-E). In order to further corroborate the anti-tumor effect, we also conducted a colony formation assay. The results were consistent with those of the CCK-8 assays mentioned above, showing a significant decrease in colony numbers compared to control groups (Fig.1F-H).

To replicate the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment in vitro, we established lung cancer organoid models. This research included a total of 4 patients with lung cancer (Table S1). PDOs were successfully generated from surgically removed patients’ tumors. Throughout the cultivation phase, the emergence of tiny PDOs became apparent four days post-culturing, followed by a notable rise in organoid volume six days after culture. PDOs were passaged approximately once every seven days. Successful cryopreservation and recovery have been achieved for these organoids with serial passages. The organoids were designated as PDO1 through PDO4. Next, we stained PDO1 and primary tumor tissues with HE and studied lung adenocarcinoma-related molecules, such as TTF-1, CK7, and Napsin A, using immunohistochemistry.The staining results demonstrated that the histological characteristics and expression patterns of lung adenocarcinoma markers in the tumor tissues were faithfully maintained in the derived organoids (Fig.2A).

We applied CCK-8 assays to evaluate the influence of OPT on 4 derived PDOs. PDOs were treated with 0, 1.11, 3.33, 10, 30, and 90 µM of OPT. Thus, CCK-8 assays indicated OPT suppressed the survival of PDOs in a dose-dependent way (Fig.2B-E). Therefore, for a preliminary evaluation of OPT safety, organoids were derived from normal lung tissues of individuals and treated with 10 µM OPT for 7 days. The results showed that the number and size of normal PDOs were not reduced after 10 µM OPT intervention (Fig. S1). At the IC50 concentration, the drugs reduced the viable area of organoids derived from the first patient’s tumor tissue (PDO1) by more than 50% within one week, as indicated by live/dead cell staining (Fig.2F). ADMETlab-3.0 predictions indicated that OPT exhibits multiple organ toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, respiratory toxicity cardiotoxicity, carcinogenicity and immunotoxicity. In general, toxicological assessments indicate that OPT possesses limited systemic toxicity in humans, while displaying comparatively higher immunotoxicity, a feature commonly observed in many chemotherapeutic drugs (Fig.S2).

To further confirm the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of OPT, an tumour syngeneic model was developed in ICR mice by implanting luciferase-transfected Lewis lung cancer cells. Experimental mice were divided into two groups: a control group and an OPT treatment group. Tumor fuorescence signals were accessed in each group prior to treatment initiation to guarantee that each mouse was inoculated with the same tumor size. After two weeks of drug treatment, tumor fluorescence signals were once again observed and detected. As depicted in Fig.3A-B, the OPT treatment reduced the tumor fuorescence intensity, and Fig.3C-D also confirmed this conclusion. This finding further demonstrated the ability of OPT to significantly suppress tumor cell growth. We also measured the body weight of the mice and found no significant differences between the control and treatment groups, indicating that OPT had no overt toxicity (Fig.3E).

From the analysis of the GeneCards, TTD, and DisGeNET databases, a total of 2,622 relevant targets associated with lung cancer were identified (Fig.4A). Additionally, 126 targets for OPT were predicted using PharmMapper and SwissTargetPrediction databases. This analysis revealed 63 overlapping targets between OPT and lung cancer, which were illustrated in a Venn diagram. The common targets were then entered into the STRING database to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (Fig.4B). The top 10 genes were AKT1, CCND1, ABCG2, CDC42, ABCB1, SIRT1, CYP1A1, NTRK1, PRKCB, CYP3A4, besides, 63 nodes and 328 edges were obtained after hiding disconnected nodes in the network. The core targets were then screened, AKT1, CCND1, ABCB1, KIT, MET, CDK4, ABCG2, CDC42, PIK3R1, CDK2, CYP1A1, SIRT1 and CYP3A4 were identified as the core targets (Fig.4C).

In this study,P< 0.05 was adjusted as the screening condition for the GO functional enrichment analysis. Figure5A displayed the top 10 most significant terms at the molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC) levels. Additionally, the results of the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were presented in Fig.5B, highlighting the 20 most significant KEGG pathways. In the KEGG analysis, we focused on the 11th ranked pathway: the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, a classic pathway related to tumor proliferation. Thus, in the subsequent study, we explored its potential impact on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, by conducting in vitro experiments. The molecular docking of 13 core molecules with OPT showed lower binding energies (kcal/mol), indicating stable interactions between the ligand and the receptor, with lower values signifying stronger binding affinity (Fig.5C). The binding sites of OPT with the core proteins AKT1 and PIK3R1 were visualized using Pymol software, highlighting the amino acids involved, as well as the number and distances of hydrogen bonds (Fig.5D-E).

To investigate the pro-apoptotic effect of OPT on lung cancer A549 cells, flow cytometry was performed following treatment with varying concentrations of OPT (5 µM, 10 µM, and 20 µM) (Fig.6A). OPT induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. A limited apoptotic response was observed at 5 µM, while treatment with 10 µM and especially 20 µM OPT led to a marked increase in apoptotic cell populations. These findings indicate that OPT promotes apoptosis in A549 cells at higher concentrations. We used western blotting to analyze changes in the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 following OPT treatment of A549 cells. We observed increased expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, with a corresponding decrease in Bcl-2 expression, further indicating that OPT induces apoptosis in A549 cells (Fig.6C). In addition, we hypothesised that there is a correlation between OPT and autophagy. We used transmission electron microscopy to identify autophagosomes in A549 cells of the treatment group (Fig.6B). Following this, it was established that OPT effectively promoted the process of autophagy. The level of Beclin-1 and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II could reflect the autophagic activity of the cells. Therefore, we detected changes in the expression of Beclin-1, LC3-I and LC3-II in A549 cells treated with OPT using western blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed that Beclin-1, a core regulatory gene in autophagy, was increased and the ratio of LC3-I to LC3-II was decreased after OPT treatment (Fig.6D).

Previous pathway enrichment analysis and molecular docking predicted that OPT interacts with both PI3K and AKT as potential targets. We subsequently analyzed the effect of OPT on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway using western blotting, since PI3K/AKT is a crucial pathway regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. After treatment with OPT, the expression levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT were significantly downregulated in A549 cells (Fig.7A). Therefore, these results indicate that the anticancer effect of OPT is mediated by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to the suppression of lung cancer cell proliferation and the promotion of apoptosis. Following intervention with the PI3K/Akt agonist sc79, Western blotting demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic effect of OPT was significantly inhibited (Fig.7B). To investigate the relationship between OPT-induced autophagy and apoptosis, cells were treated with 5 µM OPT for 24 h, followed by a 30-minute pre-treatment with either a blank control or 10 µM chloroquine. Western blotting revealed that chloroquine (CQ) increased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, while decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 (Fig.7C). In summary, OPT triggered apoptosis and promoted protective autophagy by suppressing the PI3K/AKT pathway (Fig.8).

To further investigate the functional role of autophagy in OPT-induced cytotoxicity, we performed live/dead staining in A549 cells treated with DMSO (vehicle control), OPT (5 µM), CQ (5 µM) or a combination of OPT and CQ (5 µM, respectively). OPT treatment alone moderately increased the proportion of dead cells compared to the control group, while CQ alone had minimal cytotoxic effects. Notably, co-treatment with OPT and CQ significantly enhanced cell death, as evidenced by an increased number of PI-positive cells and reduced Calcein-AM-positive cells.

Certain compounds extracted from traditional Chinese medicine exhibit antitumor properties with minimal side effects. For instance, Aloperine is a natural alkaloid primarily isolated from Sophora alopecuroides and other plants. Some studies have indicated its potential in combating tumors such as lung cancer and liver cancer, possibly through the regulation of signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT [7]. Andrographolide inhibits tumor cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms, including suppressing JAK2/STAT3 signaling to reduce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC and enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 mAb immunotherapy by promoting CD8 + T cell infiltration and function [17]. The OPT was isolated from Phellodendron amurense (Rutaceae), and its cytotoxic activity against lung cancer A549 cells has not been evaluated [8]. Studies have indicated that OPT can regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells [9]. However, the antitumor effects of OPT in lung cancer have yet to be investigated. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the potential antitumor activity of OPT in lung cancer.

In the evaluation of the antitumor effects of oxypalmatine (OPT), tumor organoid models were employed to assess its therapeutic efficacy. Although traditional 2D cell line models are simple to operate and exhibit short experimental timelines, they fail to accurately reflect the physiological characteristics of primary tumors. In contrast, tumor organoids can effectively recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment of human tissues, providing more valuable models for assessing the pharmacological activity of traditional Chinese medicines and their extracts. For instance, by establishing tumor organoid models, the inhibitory effects of traditional Chinese medicines on tumor cells can be rapidly screened, and their underlying mechanisms of action can be further investigated [18]. Tumor organoids can be derived from patient tissues to construct personalized disease models. By utilizing PDOs, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicines or herbal formulations can be tested for specific patients, providing personalized therapeutic guidance. It has been reported that the drug phenotypes of PDOs can effectively reflect the patient’s prior treatment responses. In our study, tumor organoids from four cases of lung cancer were successfully established from surgical specimens.

Network pharmacology and molecular docking are important approaches in the prediction of targets for traditional Chinese medicine, bridging the gap between traditional Chinese medicine theory and contemporary pharmacological research [19]. We conducted a network pharmacology analysis and constructed a PPI network. KEGG analysis indicated that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is a key mechanism through which OPT exerts its effects on lung cancer cells. Molecular docking was performed between OPT and 13 core protein molecules, with PIK3R1 and AKT1 ranking second and eighth, respectively. This further supports the close association between the antitumor effects of OPT and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Genomic studies have revealed that approximately 2–5% of NSCLC cases harbor PIK3CA mutations, while PTEN loss and AKT hyperactivation are observed in a broader subset of patients. According to immunohistochemical analysis, it was demonstrated that 51% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibited Akt overactivation. Notably, this overactivation in human NSCLC cells may be attributed to the induction of activating mutations in EGFR and PIK3CA, as well as the loss of PTEN [20]. These alterations are associated with enhanced cell proliferation, survival, and therapeutic resistance, underscoring the PI3K/AKT pathway as a promising therapeutic target. Our findings suggest that OPT exerts its antitumor effects, at least in part, through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, indicating potential therapeutic benefits for NSCLC patients with PI3K/AKT-driven tumors.

The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell apoptosis [21]. Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is an oncogenic protein that plays a pivotal role in cell survival, proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and glucose metabolism [22]. Activation of AKT can suppress apoptosis through multiple mechanisms: AKT directly phosphorylates and inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins within the Bcl-2 family, such as BAD, rendering them inactive, which prevents the increase in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and inhibits the initiation of apoptosis [23]. AKT can upregulate the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, enhancing cell survival [24]. Additionally, AKT phosphorylates and inhibits key apoptotic effector molecules, such as caspase-9, thereby directly blocking the execution phase of the apoptotic pathway.

There exists a complex interaction between the AKT pathway and autophagy, with both positive and negative regulatory relationships influencing autophagy [25]. The autophagy mediated by the AKT pathway plays a crucial role in the initiation, progression, and therapeutic response of tumors [26]. In cancer, autophagy can be either suppressed or promoted, depending on the type of cancer, its stage of progression and the microenvironment. The role of autophagy is dualistic: it may inhibit tumor initiation, but it can also promote tumor growth and survival [27]. The mechanism by which autophagy helps cells maintain survival under stress conditions is termed protective autophagy. In the tumor microenvironment, characterized by hypoxia or low nutrients, protective autophagy supports tumor cell survival by providing energy and clearing toxic components. During chemotherapy (such as cisplatin or paclitaxel) or targeted therapy (such as EGFR-TKI), protective autophagy is activated as an adaptive mechanism in tumor cells to counteract drug-induced apoptosis [28].

During cancer treatment, many anticancer drugs can simultaneously induce both apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells. However, the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy is complex and varied. Ideally, both autophagy and apoptosis play antitumor roles: autophagy eliminates tumor cells, while apoptosis prevents tumor cell survival. Licarin A induces cell death in lung cancer cells through the activation of both autophagy and apoptosis [29]. Transmembrane protein 100 is a potential tumor suppressor that enhances autophagy and synergistically induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells [30]. Some anticancer drugs inevitably induce protective autophagy in cancer cells during treatment. This process helps the cells cope with drug-induced stress. As a result, apoptosis is inhibited and cell survival is promoted, which can lead to drug resistance. For example, autophagy induced by Almonertinib has cytoprotective effects in lung cancer cells.

In summary, our findings highlight the therapeutic promise of combining OPT with autophagy inhibitors as an innovative approach to enhance tumor cell killing and improve treatment outcomes in lung cancer. Furthermore, they emphasize autophagy’s role as a key downstream mediator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby justifying the pursuit of dual targeting—encompassing both signaling cascades and adaptive stress responses—in subsequent preclinical investigations.

Despite these findings, some limitations should be acknowledged. One notable limitation of our study pertains to the use of animal models. In the in vivo experiments, we employed Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, which are of murine origin, to evaluate tumor growth and therapeutic efficacy in syngeneic mouse models. This approach allowed for the assessment of immune-mediated responses in an immunocompetent setting, which is a strength of the model. However, the in vitro experiments primarily utilized human lung cancer cell lines (e.g. A549, H1299), introducing a species mismatch between the preclinical models. Species differences in tumor biology, pharmacokinetics, and immune system interactions could potentially influence the translatability of our findings to human disease.

For instance, murine tumors may exhibit distinct metabolic profiles, receptor expression patterns, or responses to therapeutic agents compared to their human counterparts, which might overestimate or underestimate the efficacy observed in our experiments. While the LLC model has been widely validated for studying lung cancer progression and immunotherapy, it does not fully recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity and microenvironmental complexity of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To address this, future studies could incorporate patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which preserve human tumor architecture and stromal components in immunodeficient mice, providing a more clinically relevant platform for validating our results. Nonetheless, the consistency between our in vitro human cell data and in vivo murine outcomes supports the potential therapeutic relevance, albeit warranting cautious interpretation until corroborated in humanized or PDX systems.

Based on the above, our results indicated that OPT may promote apoptosis in lung cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, while OPT-induced autophagy exerts a protective effect on these cells. We further validated the antitumor activity of OPT using organoid and mouse models. These findings suggested that OPT may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer, deserving further investigation.
