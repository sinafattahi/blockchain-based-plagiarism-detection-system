To improve the routing and data transmission of wireless sensor networks, this study recommends utilising a new clustering mechanism that is energy efficient and intelligent. First, the positions of the sensor nodes in the network and energy values are acquired. Harris hawks optimization, a meta-heuristic that considers the distance, dispersion, and energy balance of sensors, is then used to do energy-aware clustering. To select the cluster head, a new reinforcement learning technique has been created. A fuzzy logic system that has been trained using the concepts of reinforcement learning is used to illustrate this approach. It seeks to select the cluster head with the greatest remaining energy, the fewest neighbouring nodes, and the shortest path to the information station’s centre. The fuzzy rules for cluster head selection have been established using the wild horse optimization method. These rules take into account two criteria: maximum energy and lowest distance between neighbouring nodes. The results showed that the suggested strategy resulted in a 29% increase in network lifetime and a 46% increase in the volume of data delivered to the station when the simulation was repeated on many networks and compared to the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy approach.

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) were created as a result of recent developments in the design and manufacturing of small, inexpensive, low-power sensors1. Many different kinds of applications rely on wireless sensor networks (WSNs), including smart homes, environmental monitoring, and combat surveillance2–4. Given that WSNs are composed of tiny devices that have limited resources, it is crucial to deploy nodes efficiently in order to maximize power and network lifetime, ensure enough coverage, and connectivity. In a typical WSN, a number of sensors are used to measure various characteristics. In places where human labour is challenging or impossible, these sensors can be employed. When processing is complete, all of the data packets gathered from the surroundings are sent to a network node known as a base station. Naturally, these networks have hundreds or thousands of nodes since scattered nodes are particularly vulnerable. A sensor network’s energy consumption determines how long it will last. Algorithms for routing and clustering provide hope for improving network efficiency and resolving the issue. Most significantly, wireless networks face the problem of limited energy resources. Data aggregation, resource allocation through mutual layer design, sleep and wake period planning, mobile sink use, optimal deployment, clustering, and multi-step routing are just a few of the many solutions offered to address these networks’ energy restriction. One such technique that is thought to be scalable and energy-efficient for WSNs is clustering. Sensors in WSN networks are grouped into unique groups or clusters for the purpose of clustering; each cluster has a cluster head (CH). Cluster heads receive pertinent data from sensors in each cluster either on a periodic basis or following an incident (fire, etc.). The data is then sent to the base station either directly or in a multi-step process by the cluster heads2. Indeed, clustering methods extend the network lifetime by stabilizing the topology, reducing energy consumption, and reducing communication overhead by confining node interactions to the cluster head. However, one of the most critical criteria for optimal performance in such networks is appropriate routing with minimal latency. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face the NP-hard optimization problem of energy-efficient clustering, which can be addressed by optimization and soft computing. This is the foundation for the numerous energy-saving clustering and routing algorithms for sensor networks that have been introduced in the last few years. These algorithms can be used by a variety of computational intelligence (CI) systems, such as artificial immune systems (AIS), evolutionary algorithms (EAs), reinforcement learning (RL), and the LEACH, AFSRP, and ERA clustering methods5–8. Low convergence speed, high processing cost, and computational complexity are some of the issues that arise with such algorithms, despite their many benefits. Another issue that occasionally arises is the lack of harmony between local and global search. When this happens, algorithms could behave erratically during the position update step, leading to blind reactions in certain cases and, ultimately, an increased likelihood of becoming stuck in the local optimum8. However, the energy-related aspects of clustering are under-discussed, and relatively little effort is made to improve the acceptable distribution of energy within clusters.

Efficient energy utilization in wireless sensor networks can be achieved by intelligent routing and clustering. The majority of current routing protocols address this issue by utilizing heuristic or meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Cluster head selection and routing are often seen as separate issues by most protocols. There is a clear connection between the two steps, and picking the cluster heads facilitates route selection. Consequently, the solution that is obtained may not be the best solution in the network when these two issues are considered separately. Furthermore, most current routing protocols still use antiquated clustering and multi-hop network communication, which is detrimental to node energy efficiency2.

Several meta-heuristic methods have been employed in the literature in the optimization field. Our method is innovative in that it does not employ a particular meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the routing problem. Actually, we have combined two relatively robust and novel algorithms to solve a data transmission problem. Our innovation is using the HHO algorithm to choose the path based on energy-aware clustering, followed by a fuzzy logic-based reinforcement learning system to choose the cluster head. This program was optimized using the WHO algorithm, which will result in a way for lowering power losses by combining meta-heuristic algorithms with fuzzy reinforcement learning techniques. Thus, our novel approach in this work is to use these methods for a clustering system in a wireless sensor network and fuzzy reinforcement learning for the selection of sub-clusters, as well as other meta-heuristic algorithms.

A wireless sensor network information transmission system based on energy-aware routing is presented.

The proposed system uses a completely new clustering method based on the HHO algorithm, which is able to work by creating an energy balance and the number and density between the nodes of each cluster.

Following clustering, cluster head nodes are chosen using a fuzzy reinforcement learning technique that modifies the fuzzy cluster head selection rules using the WHO algorithm.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, this work is compared with the LEACH method.

This article is organized as follows: The research background and prior research on the problem of reducing energy usage in WSN networks and the use of reinforcement learning techniques are presented in the second section of the paper. The meta-heuristic algorithm-based energy-conscious clustering method and the fuzzy logic-based reinforcement learning system will be examined in the third section. The fourth section contains the simulation results for the suggested algorithm. The ending is finally covered in the fifth segment.

To establish transient flying networks, a large number of drones collaborate in an ad hoc system. These operating systems have presented numerous obstacles as well as new opportunities for a variety of industries, including the military, household use, and industry. Because of their excellent performance and observable advantages, meta-heuristic techniques can now be used to solve a variety of routing-related problems. A new cluster routing algorithm for temporary flight networks is proposed as a means to solve connectivity bottlenecks. Finding inspiration from the habits of southern flying squirrels, paper9employs the swarm intelligence technique, a potent instrument for resolving optimization issues. According to the suggested approach, the drone’s confidence, degree of differentiation, distance, momentum, and remaining power after doing its missions are all factors in the fitness function that chooses the cluster head. Information about the optimal data transmission path is found using the path recognition objective function, which takes residual energy and distance into account. The suggested routing is evaluated in comparison to BICSF and MFO for its effectiveness. On average, energy consumption is reduced by 29% and throughput is improved by 17% with the suggested strategy. A major concern with this plan is the lack of protection during data transmission, which is crucial for use in the military.

Additionally, a new technique to determine the link lifetime between two unmanned aerial vehicles based on variables including their distance from one another, relative speed, and direction of travel is proposed in paper10, along with a delay-aware routing protocol for ad hoc flying networks. A method for choosing multipoint relay nodes using the Emperor Penguin Colony Algorithm is provided. Based on a node’s neighbor degree, eagerness, link lifetime, and remaining energy, it can function as a multipoint relay node. The suggested method, in summary, develops routes between nodes while taking lifetime and energy into account. The suggested routing is evaluated in terms of performance versus ML-OLSR and MP-OLSR. Using the suggested method resulted in a minimum 15% and 32% improvement in delay and energy consumption, respectively. However, the issue with this approach is that it fails to account for unforeseen circumstances and flight uncertainty.

The vast array of potential uses for wireless sensor networks has prompted substantial investment in their study. WSNs are subject to a number of constraints, such as difficulties with communication, cluster administration, and the limited battery life of nodes and, eventually, the lifetime of the network. Energy conservation is therefore crucial in these kinds of networks. The biggest energy consumption among sensor nodes happens during data transmission because of the continuous energy consumption rate during information sensing and reception. Arranging WSNs in clusters is one of the promising ways to lower energy usage. The goal of wireless sensor network (WSN) clustering is to improve the network’s data aggregation, communication, and management by arranging sensor nodes into groups. This structure aids in optimizing energy usage, improving scalability, and extending the lifetime of the WSN. However, finding the best criteria for cluster head selection is difficult since it requires balancing grid connectivity, load distribution, and energy efficiency. This area, which we have covered in previous articles, has been the focus of numerous studies. In article11, a two-stage method is suggested. Initially, a reinforcement learning (RL) technique is employed for WSN clustering. This method allows nodes to freely modify their clustering techniques, resulting in more efficient network designs and adaptation. Afterwards, WSN cluster heads can be chosen using particle swarm optimization (PSO) for optimal cluster formation. To achieve a more harmonious and effective clustering solution, the suggested method takes into account both local and global viewpoints. When compared to more conventional clustering methods, the experimental results demonstrate that the integrated technique outperforms them all while increasing the residual energy of individual nodes.

Cooperative learning and meta-heuristic algorithms (CRLM) are suggested in paper12, with the goal of improving the meta-heuristic algorithm’s performance through the use of reinforcement learning. Network communication techniques, such as clustering and simultaneous routing, have also been solved using the algorithm in this research. In addition to pruning to enable load balancing of network clusters, the communication system employs a novel multi-hop model to decrease energy loss in the network. The suggested approach has significantly increased the network’s lifetime. To improve the effectiveness of wireless sensor networks and to lengthen the life of sensor nodes, a new clustering approach called PSO-EECS was introduced13. This scheme integrates a particle swarm optimization method. The selection of a Cluster Head (CH) to aid in data collection, aggregation, and forwarding inside the cluster-based routing pattern is the primary focus of this article. Energy ratio, distance, node density, load balancing, average network energy, and other fitness factors are optimized for CH selection using the PSO-EECS algorithm. In comparison to existing solutions, the suggested approach considerably improves network stability and operating time, according to the simulation results.

One helpful method for determining the optimal route is reinforcement learning (RL). In article14, RL is used to optimize SDWSN routing. All the necessary requirements for energy efficiency and network QoS are included in a proposed reward function. While the SDWSN controller enhances the routing path using past experience, the agent receives the incentive and acts accordingly. In order to improve coverage and connection with reinforcement learning, an intelligent satin bower optimizer (ISBO-RL) is introduced in paper15. By employing the optimal position finding (OPF) approach to determine critical positions of sensor nodes, ISBO-RL aims to arrange sensors optimally to improve coverage and connectivity. The ISBO algorithm incorporates reinforcement learning, which enables nodes to adjust according to performance and evolving circumstances. Experiments conducted on several platforms have shown that ISBO-RL outperforms competing algorithms in terms of efficiency, coverage, and connection.

An essential technique to break the bottleneck caused by the increasing expansion of sensors in WSN is through peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, which minimizes energy consumption needs. Nevertheless, the advancement of WSN is severely constrained by power constraints and interference from several sensors using the same frequency. Hence, for P2P communication in WSN, an optimization of energy usage utilizing deep reinforcement learning is suggested16. P2P sensors, in particular, are thought of as agents that can share the range of authorized sensors. A P2P sensor connects directly with other sensors, eliminating the need for a central server, whereas a permissioned sensor grants access to specified data or systems. Further, the agent is assisted in learning more specifics about the interference by means of a deep Q network (DDQN) method. By reducing energy consumption for P2P communication in WSN, the suggested algorithm outperforms both the deep Q network scheme and the conventional algorithm, according to the simulation findings.

Secure and Energy Efficient Routing (MHSEER), a protocol for WSN-IoT based on meta-heuristics, is presented in paper17. Utilizing hop counts, link integrity attributes, and accumulated residual energy, the protocol learns how to make forwarding judgments. Along with an anti-encryption mode, this protocol encrypts the data to further strengthen the method’s security. The proposed procedure makes use of a meta-heuristic study that aims to accomplish reliable learning. There are two steps in the protocol. The first phase enhances the choice for dependable data routing by applying a heuristic technique. The second level is security based on a basic and random computational CEM. The Heuristic-Based Energy-Efficient Routing (HBEER), Secure Energy-Aware Heuristic-Based Routing (SEHR), Secure Energy, and Secure Trust Routing for Low Power (Sectrust-RPL) are contrasted with the proposed MHSEER protocol. SEAMHR reduces packet drop ratio by 6.51%. It also reduces energy usage, defective routes, network latency, and throughput by 95.81%, 5.12%, 0.10 ms, and 0.0102 mJ, respectively.

Scientists are interested in emerging viral infections like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 because they pose a serious threat to public health. Vital signs including blood pressure, oxygen saturation levels, patient temperature, and pulse are infrequently transmitted over the Internet of Things. Reports from the patient’s body that require minimal power are routinely sent to the medical centre. It can be difficult to send data to data centres because nodes need different amounts of power. A dependable routing protocol is necessary to provide effective communication and lower device power consumption. Clustering is one of the greatest routing strategies for lowering power consumption and extending system lifetime. In paper18, the NP-HARD clustering format is used to determine the average and cluster head nodes needed for routing, respectively, using a whale optimization approach and a harmony search strategy. According to the NS-3 simulator’s results, the suggested approach outperforms the standard algorithm in terms of lifetime, energy usage, and the number of active and idle nodes in the system. The suggested approach achieves both delay reduction and system energy consumption reduction when compared to traditional clustering methods. However, this strategy has certain issues with the issue of safe and dependable routing. Additionally, paper19develops a black widow optimization technique and a harmony search algorithm to pick cluster head nodes and cluster search, respectively, which are necessary for routing, taking into account the NP-hard structure of clustering. The results of the NS-3 simulation shown that the suggested method, multiple link state optimization routing, outperforms the grey wolf optimization techniques and genetic algorithm in terms of network lifetime, power consumption, delay, and active and inactive nodes. When compared to the existing clustering algorithms, the suggested approach lowers the network’s energy consumption and delay by at least 10% and 11%, respectively. Nevertheless, this method lacks an energy-conscious methodology.

Table1briefly discusses the technique, advantages, and disadvantages of each of the aforementioned strategies.

In this research field, we are faced with a problem of information transmission through a wireless sensor network. Different strategies for clustering and cluster head selection and secure and low-power routing for data transmission in WSN have been presented and many efforts have been made to increase the network lifetime. But these methods face a common problem, which is the reduction of the performance of these techniques against different environments and uncertainties in different conditions. Therefore, we have used a new energy-aware clustering pattern and cluster head selection with the help of a fuzzy reinforcement learning system. Therefore, this system will be adaptable to the environments and conditions governing it with a fuzzy reinforcement learning approach and can be adapted to real environments.

This section presents a suggested strategy that uses HHO to provide an energy-aware clustering method and WHO to help train fuzzy rules and create a reinforcement learning system based on fuzzy logic. As a result, the components and procedures of the suggested clustering technique will be presented initially. In this instance, the ideas of reinforcement learning, fuzzy logic, and WHO, HHO meta-heuristic algorithms have all been explored.

Information fuzzification, membership value modification, and, if necessary, output defuzzification are the three primary components of the fuzzy logic technique. The first phase in fuzzification is encoding the picture data, and the second is de-fuzzification, which involves decoding the results. Following these procedures makes it possible to process images using the fuzzy approach. Figure1shows the outcomes of using fuzzy approaches to manage cluster vertex selection. The most crucial processes in this process are fuzzification of the input data and defuzzification of the results20.

The middle phase, which modifies the membership values, is where we may observe the most successful factor of fuzzy clustering selection. This step, which separates the approach from the other step, is also known as the smart step. There are many different membership functions in fuzzy logic, and each one has a unique consequence. Gaussian, bell, trapezoidal, and triangle functions are among them. The method’s efficiency is increased through the application of appropriate membership by fuzzy system inference. The data that can be utilized by fuzzy logic technology needs to be transformed into a membership function (fuzzification stage) and then into a specific range. After that, the fuzzy technology may be employed to set the membership function. Fuzzy fusion, fuzzy rule-based technique, and fuzzy clustering are all terms that describe this method. To find uncertainty data, a fuzzy system is required.

The most common methods for expressing and processing the cluster head node selection criteria are fuzzy techniques.

It gives us a means of controlling energy and optimizing network performance.

Concepts of fuzzy logic handle uncertainty in WSN with ease.

Fuzzy logic is superior to other forms of logic because it considers structure when developing its understanding, whereas other forms of logic suffer from imprecision. Fuzzy meeting theory can supply if-then rules, which are the basis for human logic that is recommended to be used in fuzzy rules20.

Agents’ natural behaviour serves as a common source of inspiration for optimization algorithms. Agents can be anything from humans and animals to plants and even physical or chemical entities. The actions of animals have served as inspiration for several algorithms introduced in the past ten years. Based on observations of how wild horses interact with one another, this research employs a novel optimization technique termed the wild horse optimizer (WHO). Stallions, mares, and foals make up the majority of a horse herd. Grazing, pursuing, dominance, leadership, and mating are just a few of the numerous activities exhibited by horses. One endearing quality that sets horses apart from other animals is their courtesy. Foals of horses typically branch off from their mother herds before they reach maturity, according to horse upbringing practices. To avoid father-daughter or sibling pairings, this exit is in place. Horses’ courteous demeanour served as the primary motivation for the suggested algorithm21.

Establishing a starting population, establishing horse groups, and selecting leaders.

group leadership and management by the leader (Narayan).

Decision issues can be framed using reinforcement learning techniques. A mathematical model of the interaction between an agent and its environment is called a Markov decision process (MDP). A formal representation of MDP is a polynomial consisting of five elements: S, A, P, R, and γ. S stands for the state space, or the collection of potential states. A represents the action space (i.e. the set of possible actions, P : S×A×S → [0, 1] represents the probability of transition from one state to another according to a specific action, R : S×A×S → Ṙ denotes the reward function, and γ is the discount factor where the importance of future rewards, γ is the subset [0,1]. The agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps, determines t = 0, 1, 2,… At each time step t, the agent receives a representation of the environmental state Stof member S, performs an action at Atmember A, moves to the next state St+1, and receives a scalar reward Rt+1of member R. Figure3shows the standard RL framework.

Where γ is typically the [0,1] member and g is the discount factor. The ideal policy is the conduct that maximizes the reward over time by choosing the optimum course of action in each condition.

In RL, there are several different techniques. They fall into two categories: model-based and model-free. Value-based and policy-based approaches are two categories of model-free approaches. Figure4shows a condensed version of the RL categorization.

Classification of reinforcement learning algorithms23.

RL algorithms can be broadly classified into two types: model-free RL and model-based RL. The distinction between the two types of RL algorithms is based on whether the agent makes use of a presentation or learning model of the dynamics of the environment. The reward function R and the transfer function P are described by this model. Model-based techniques fall into two categories: those that employ pre-existing models (e.g., transfer and reward function models that the agent can learn) and those that involve the agent learning an environment model23. In the second method, the agent gains knowledge about a model that it utilizes to enhance policies. Through activity, the agent can take samples of the surroundings. Supervised learning can be used to forecast state transitions and rewards based on those examples. The environmental model can be directly programmed with techniques. Instead of attempting to create a model of the environment, the agent in the model-free approach interacts with the environment to choose the best course of action through trial and error. Compared to model-based procedures, model-free methods are simpler to implement. In situations where it is challenging to build a model that is sufficiently accurate, these approaches may be preferable to more complicated ones22.

Heydari et al.6introduced Harris-Hawks optimization (HHO) as a technique for swarm optimization. Additionally, the behaviour of Harris’s hawks is influenced by tracking and capturing prey, which is an experimental method that is inspired by nature. In terms of energy consumption during prey escape employing HHO tactics, the following formulae might be used mathematically.

Where E is the runaway prey’s strength, E0is the original prey’s strength, which is a random number between − 1 and 1, t is the starting iteration number, T is the top iteration number, and r1is a random number between 0 and 1.

The intensity of escape hunting determines the rate of reduction of E in each cycle. Thus, when |E| ≥ 1, hawks use an exploratory search strategy to look for prey in various locations. On the other hand, when |E| < 1, hawks are more likely to use an exploitative search strategy to capture prey. Additional information is displayed below. Harris Hawkes optimization algorithm flowchart is shown in Fig.5.

Flowchart of Harris Hawkes optimization algorithm25.

Finding and following the prey in various places is the initial stage of a Harris’s hawk hunt. Thus, the present solutions are the probability of locating the prey, or accomplishing the objective. Consequently, the closest bait is probably the best option right now. Importantly, when spotting prey, Harris’s hawks can do one of two things: (1) go closer together as a group to grab it, or (2) randomly choose different areas to hunt. The following equations provide a mathematical demonstration of these two points.

Where Xpreydenotes the location of the prey, Xmis the population’s mean current position, and Xranddenotes the falcon that was randomly selected. X(t + 1) are the falcons with new locations based on iteration t. The hawks’ current position, denoted by X(t), can be obtained using the following equation. In (0,1), random numbers are represented by r2, r3, r4, r5, and q. Lastly, the terms Upper and Lower denote the upper and lower bounds.

Here are four scenarios that could occur. Prey capture, gentle, hard, and escape are a few examples of prey management techniques. In the HHO algorithm, these probabilities are represented using the prey energy E and the random number r. The first state is indicated if (r< 0.5), the second state is indicated if (r≥ 0.5), the third state is indicated if |E| ≥ 0.5, and the fourth case is shown if |E| is < 0.5. Article24provides further information.

Clustering strategies for WSNs are crucial for extending the life of networks in a number of ways. Subsequently, among deployed sensor nodes, WSN cluster head selection approaches identify the optimal cluster heads (CHs) based on their computational power, energy consumption, and BS connectivity. Because of the increased work load associated with receiving messages from other cluster heads and cluster members, collecting all messages, and delivering them to the base station with the assistance of non-cluster head nodes in the layered sensor network, CH nodes consume more energy than ordinary sensor nodes. Consequently, creating a reliable CHs selection method is a top priority. We have broken down our methods into two sections in this study. An energy-aware clustering using the HHO algorithm is the first component. The energy-efficient clustering strategy’s flowchart is displayed in Fig.6. Below, we will go over the many stages of this approach.

Flowchart of the proposed strategy for WSN energy aware clustering.

First, using the meta-heuristic algorithm suggested by HHO optimization, the network is clustered according to the number of nodes dispersed, their location concentration, and the total remaining energy dispersed in each cluster for each period of WSN implementation. Two ideas form the basis of this node classification. Every cluster’s energy and the distribution of the nodes inside each cluster make up the balanced distribution. We have utilized a relationship to determine the distance of nodes to the cluster centre in order to compute the concentration of nodes in clusters. We have utilized the function equations of the K-means clustering technique in accordance with formula 5 to represent this relationship. After sorting the data into k groups, the K-means algorithm minimizes a statistic known as inertia, which is the sum of squares of the within-cluster variance.

S:sets of observations;k:number of sets of predictors;x: observation data point;µi: mean of points inSi.

Our observations in this work include the nodes’ positions with respect to the x and y axes’ coordinates. The cluster centre is represented by the mean positions, denoted by µi.

This work is a new approach to the clustering problem. For example, the number of classes for each node in a 10-sensor network with three sample clusters is defined with the variable X equal to [1 2 2 2 1 1 3 3 3 3]. This means that the population of the variable X for the HHO algorithm includes nodes 1, 5, and 6 for the first cluster, nodes 2, 3, and 4 for the second cluster, and nodes 7, 8, 9, and 10 for the third cluster. The correct selection of nodes in each cluster leads to increased security and energy exchange between nodes.

The pseudo code of the objective function in this clustering is provided below.

S is the distance between nodes and each cluster’s centre, NC is the number of nodes in each cluster, and EC is the total energy set of all the nodes in each cluster. Selecting the cluster head for each cluster comes next after defining the nodes in the various clusters. The first line introduces the clustering objective function based on the network structure and the number of nodes and clusters. In line 2, integer conversion is performed to solve the integer problem. In lines 3 to 9, dead nodes are identified and removed from the total clustering nodes with an energy value of zero. Line 10 displays the position of the nodes. For lines 11 to 25, three parameters are expressed: the number of nodes in each cluster, the average energy of each cluster, and the average distance of the nodes of each cluster to the center of the cluster in the cluster iteration loop. Finally, in line 26, the output of the objective function is defined according to the three criteria calculated in the clusters. It should be noted that we perform clustering based on a balanced energy distribution between clusters and a balanced number of nodes for all clusters, and the concentration of nodes in each cluster is performed by calculating the average distance to the cluster centre.

Residual energy: The amount of energy left in each sensor node inside the network. The more the remaining energy of a sensor node is, the more chance it has for clustering.

Here, NDi < = Ds represents the number of nodes within a distance that is less than the threshold distance Ds. The investigated network has a threshold value of 30 m. This node’s merit for selection as cluster head increases as the number of nodes increases.

The distance between the cluster head and the BS destination node: A sensor node’s likelihood of being a cluster head increases with decreasing distance.

The reinforcement learning method uses these characteristics as considerations for rewards. To prioritize the nodes and master the uncertainty, the fuzzy logic approach and the if-then rules taught with the wild horse optimization algorithm, as shown in Table2, are utilized. This is because the selection of the node as the leader of the cluster depends on multiple parameters. Figure7provides a detailed flowchart of this reinforcement learning-based cluster head selection strategy. Ultimately, the fuzzy prioritizing mechanism connects all of the nodes in a cluster to the node with the highest probability value, making that node the cluster head. By utilizing the rules of reinforcement learning provided by the WHO, cluster heads are created in fuzzy sets for fuzzy language variables. With the aid of wild horse optimization, these rules can be applied to the output of the fuzzy system as rule definition variables, as shown in Fig.7-b. This leads to the introduction of a fuzzy logic system that has nine triangular membership functions in its prioritizing output. To choose the optimal cluster head, the output functions for each conditional statement must be specified in order to yield the optimum response to the real input data. The range of surrounding nodes (0–40), residual power (0–0.5) watts, and the node’s distance from the base station (0–150) meters are taken into consideration for this reinforcement learning system’s training. The membership functions for the fuzzy input and output are displayed in Fig.8. The input variables take into account the set of “low, medium, high” values, and the output variables use the triangle membership functions to choose distinct values from 1 to 9. The results of using the WHO method to train the fuzzy RL system are displayed in Fig.9. The fuzzy rules derived from the best response are presented in Table2. Priority means the value of cluster head selection for each node in the cluster that is considered in the output of the fuzzy reinforcement learning system. The lower this value, the higher the chance of selecting the node as the cluster head. The input and output properties of this trained fuzzy system are displayed in Fig.9-b.

A fuzzy reinforcement learning system is used for the cluster head selection problem. The population for the WHO algorithm includes the number of rules defined for the fuzzy logic system for cluster head selection. For this, the system consists of 27 fuzzy rules that take values ​​between 1 and 9 to define the degree of selection for different input values. In this case, the population, for example, includes x = [1 1 5 2.. 3 8 9.. 3 5] is a matrix with 27 members with rules numbered 1 to 9. Choosing the right rules leads to a perfectly ideal cluster head selection in the wireless sensor network, which reduces power consumption and increases the network lifetime.

Where O is the values ​​of the test data of the inputs powerN, Distance, NH. In the first line, the objective function of the reinforcement learning system is introduced. In the second line, the integer analysis of the problem solution is calculated and valued from the real input X. In lines 3 to 5, fuzzy rules are defined for the input rules. In line 6, the fuzzy prioritization function is loaded for the new rules. Finally, the output of the objective function is calculated based on the calculation of the prioritization error to achieve the maximum cluster head lifetime based on the training data, and the WHO algorithm is used to minimize it.

The HHO algorithm is used to solve the clustering problem and minimize the objective function of pseudo code (1) The WHO algorithm is used to define the fuzzy rules of the RL reinforcement learning system for cluster head selection and minimize the objective function of pseudo code (2) The proposed fuzzy learning system optimized with WHO performs the cluster head node selection operation based on three criteria: the distance of the node to the station, the number of neighbourhood nodes, and the residual energy of the node.

As previously mentioned, the probability of cluster head is determined for every node in the network by integrating fuzzy sets with the fuzzy inference system of the specified if-then rules. The suggested technique employs Mamdani’s fuzzy inference model. Using the cluster head selection parameters, fuzzing the inputs, and establishing the degree of membership of the inputs and outputs are all steps in the inference mechanism. Then, membership functions apply pre-trained rules to each fuzzy set. The resulting fuzzy set is cut using the minimum approach, which is the fuzzy “AND” operator, as shown in Fig.8b. The maximum technique, which is a fuzzy “OR” operator, is used to aggregate the outputs of all the rules in order to reach a judgment. To get the node’s chance value for being chosen as the cluster head, the output is de-fuzzified using the centre of gravity approach and then transformed to a numerical value. In a fuzzy system, all of the fuzzy rules are run in parallel with each other. When the inputs to the problem match a rule, that rule is activated and computations are carried out.

Based on the cluster topology and the fuzzy selection cluster heads, non-cluster nodes are produced in each cluster after the cluster heads are selected. The fuzzy technique is used to select the best cluster heads, as previously stated. The network topology is extracted from each execution round by identifying the cluster heads, and the objective function described in pseudo-code algorithm 1 is used to evaluate the network performance. Energy and cluster node dispersion occur in each period as a result of this action. The above objective function can be minimized by selecting the most appropriate cluster heads and, in turn, the most appropriate network topology, based on the average distance between the nodes in a cluster and the cluster head. The estimation results of the fuzzy system trained using the target fuzzy rules for 100 distinct nodes with varying prioritization values are displayed in Fig.10. As can be seen, we were able to lower the desired error with the aid of the fuzzy rule learning system.

Displaying the results of the data under the training of the reinforcement learning system to define the prioritization rules.

When choosing a cluster head, factors such as the node’s remaining energy, the maximum number of nodes in the neighbourhood, and the distance to the base station are taken into account. To determine how far a sensor node is from a base station, Euclidean distance is utilized. The likelihood of a sensor node being chosen as a cluster head increases with its proximity to the base station. The computation of the cluster head formation value is achieved by merging the fuzzy sets of input variables with the fuzzy inference system of if-then rules specified in Table2. In every next round, clusters are formed and structured accordingly. Fuzzy cluster head selection is the next process. Each period’s number of clusters is determined by a factor of 1 < P. In the last periods, nodes with less than P are not clustered; instead, each node acts as the cluster head and conducts data transfers independently. Repetition of this process continues until the final sensor node dies. Using a factor of 0.1, we have selected the number of clusters from the total number of nodes in the simulation.

Table3states a comprehensive list of notations used in the document, along with succinct explanations for each.

The simulation results of two LEACH protocols and the suggested clustering and cluster head selection technique are presented in the set of results below.P= 10 is the number of clusters that were defined in this study for 100 nodes. The simulation of this work was carried out in Matlab2019b software under Intel Core i5 CPU 2.67 GHz RAM 4GB system.

In this paper, the multi-objective function is devised for node clustering while simultaneously optimizing for the two objectives of energy dispersion and node dispersion. One goal was to reduce the distance between the cluster’s nodes and their centres, while the other two set out to guarantee high residual energy by averaging out the clusters’ energies and introducing uniform dispersion among them. The optimization value of the objective function for each algorithm during the first period is displayed in Fig.11. The graphic illustrates how the WHO protocol was able to arrive at the final number at a good rate of convergence. Based on the simulation findings, an acceptable uniform distribution for the number of nodes in each cluster and cluster energy has been produced using this method. The outcomes of this clustering are displayed in Fig.12, along with the cluster heads chosen for the 100 node network under study.

Performance demonstration of HHO algorithm for cluster optimization in the first round.

Clustering and cluster head selection in WSN through the proposed approach for the first round.

In terms of clustering, this work compares and evaluates the performance of two popular optimization algorithms: Harris Hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm and Wild Horse Optimization (WHO). Matlab R2019b was used to test the algorithms that were suggested. Optimal clustering selections Fitness function, live node count, throughput, and residual energy were some of the major criteria considered for the evaluation procedure. The Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol was subsequently used to compare the fastest algorithm. Overall, the simulation results demonstrated that the wild horse algorithm outperformed the other method on two metrics (node dispersion and energy dispersion) as well as exploration and exploitation. The next step is to use the suggested fuzzy logic system to choose a cluster head.

As seen in Fig.12, the simulations were run on a network consisting of 100 and 30 sensor nodes placed in a field measuring 100 m by 100 m. This can lower the energy dissipation of sensor nodes and greatly increase the rate of data transfer. Each period, a new set of cluster heads was chosen. When the current cluster head’s energy level drops below a specific threshold, the period length is defined. This decision was not based on a temporary gain. The algorithms in this paper had a population of 20 and an iteration count of 100. Table4displays the parameters that were utilized for the simulation.

Using the WSN case study from Table4as a guide, we will compare the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method and the LEACH algorithm in terms of network energy, including the quantity of sent packets, dead nodes, and leftover energy. The goal and concept, the operational and process structure, and the routing category are among the crucial elements that the LEACH protocol has in common with other algorithms. Every sensor node in the network aims to spin as a cluster head in order to disperse the substantial energy loss that occurs when connecting with the base station. This means that each round, they generate a new clustering, rotate CH responsibilities, and maintain a balanced energy usage. Noteworthy is the fact that the taught fuzzy logic reinforcement learning system is used to assist in the cluster head selection. According to their structure and operational procedure, the suggested techniques and LEACH both run on a regular basis. The two phases of each cycle are clustering and cluster head selection. The first stage involves organizing the clusters, and the cluster head selection step involves transferring the data. Furthermore, each topology describes the energy dissipation through electronic components including the transmitter, power amplifier, and receiver using a basic radio model26–28. Every technique falls into the same group of active routing protocols in terms of classification (centralized, resource-oriented). In both cases, the routing protocol is link-state, wherein every node ascertains the network topology and channel conditions, forwarding the information to a central location that generates a routing table for every node in the network29. Hierarchical protocols for data communication can also be used by the network to conduct dependable operations while saving energy on network nodes30.

The LEACH protocol clustering makes the network more resilient and reduces the energy needed for communication between sensor nodes and BSs.

CH data aggregation saves a substantial amount of energy by minimizing locally relevant data.

Sleep mode is applied to network nodes. Cluster collisions are prevented and the sensor node’s battery life is extended as a result.

It is guaranteed that every sensor node will have an equal opportunity to become a CH in the LEACH protocol. With this CH random rotation, the network lifetime is enhanced.

Next, we will compare the simulation results for several case studies and look at the benefits of the suggested approach over the LEACH technique.

The clustering in the suggested method is based on an energy-aware approach, which takes into account not only the number of nodes and the density of nodes within a cluster in relation to the dispersion of total energy, but also the formation of clusters within the network. Concurrently, the LEACH technique is content with the cluster’s node density and placement alone.

In contrast to the suggested technique, which selects the cluster head based on a number of standard parameters to maximize lifetime and optimal information transmission, the LEACH method just selects the cluster head at random based on probability.

In comparison to the random approach in LEACH, the reinforcement learning method in this suggested method is characterized as a strong benefit for cluster head selection.

Figure13illustrates how well the suggested approach and LEACH algorithms perform in terms of sent packets, dead nodes, and total network energy remaining based on the number of cycles. The suggested algorithm outperformed LEACH in terms of performance. These outcomes are based on a simulation involving 100 sensor nodes. The network’s lifetime during the time interval (0, 815) is displayed in Fig.13a. About 2380 packets were transferred by the nodes to the WHO algorithm, as seen in Fig.13b. Based on the performance comparison, it was found that the suggested algorithm works noticeably better. Based on the initial node death time in several protocols, the suggested algorithm outperformed the LEACH approach. Furthermore, the last node in the LEACH approach was destroyed earlier than the last node in the suggested strategy, as seen in Fig.13b. Furthermore, compared to the LEACH approach, the suggested algorithm’s lifetime was substantially longer. Plotting the network throughput for the protocols according to the number of rounds is shown in Fig.13c. The suggested algorithm’s clustering preserved the nodes’ residual energy, extending the network’s lifetime. As Fig.13c illustrates, the throughput of the suggested approach was greater than that of the LEACH method.

Number of rounds versus number of live nodes in the proposed protocol and LEACH.

In Table5, the death times of the nodes (the first, half, and last nodes) and the calculation time are displayed to help visualize the effectiveness of the techniques used. As can be observed, the suggested approaches have the largest execution time, and the LEACH method has the lowest. The application of the suggested method has the most computational overhead, based on the table’s findings. It is reasonable to justify the suggested method’s performance because fuzzy logic-based methods find optimal solutions with more temporal complexity.

This study compares the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol with a suggested clustering method that uses the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO) algorithm combined with reinforcement learning and fuzzy logic for cluster head (CH) selection in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with 100 nodes spread across a 100 × 100 m field. Simulation results demonstrate the higher performance of the suggested strategy. The evaluation focuses on network longevity (based on node death times), throughput (number of packets successfully sent to the base station), residual energy, and computational overhead (execution time).

Network longevity: The suggested approach considerably increases network longevity as measured by the first, half, and last node death times (Table5). In LEACH, the first node death improves from 213 rounds to 378 rounds (a 77.5% improvement or 165 rounds delay), the half node death improves from 575 to 987 rounds (a 71.7% improvement or 412 rounds delay), and the last node death improves from 1089 to 1415 rounds (a 29.9% increment or 326 rounds delay). The energy-aware clustering of WHO, which maximizes energy distribution and node dispersion, and fuzzy logic-based CH selection that takes residual energy, neighborhood density, and base station (BS) distance into account are the driving forces behind this. On the other hand, LEACH’s random CH selection, which lacks energy awareness, causes early energy depletion, particularly in nodes that are far away or have low energy.

Throughput: The suggested approach surpasses LEACH’s lower throughput (Fig.13c) by transferring roughly 2380 packets (Fig.13b). WHO’s balanced clustering reduces packet loss due to node failures, and fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning improve transmission efficiency by giving priority to CHs that are close to the BS and have high residual energy. This position is frequently given to suboptimal nodes (such as remote or low-energy nodes) by LEACH’s random CH selection, which lowers throughput and increases packet loss.

Residual Energy: Because of its effective CH selection and balanced energy allocation among clusters, the suggested approach optimizes consumption during data aggregation and transmission while preserving more residual energy (Fig.13c). However, because LEACH’s random CH assignment usually burdens low-energy nodes while ignoring overall energy distribution, it shows faster energy depletion due to uneven energy use.

Computational Overhead: Compared to LEACH, which has a computational overhead of 874 s, the suggested method has a higher computational overhead of 2131 s. This results from the fuzzy logic system’s assessment of 27 rules across three parameters: residual energy, node neighborhood, and distance to BS, as well as WHO’s iterative optimization across a population of solutions. Nevertheless, considering the significant improvements in network lifetime, throughput, and energy efficiency, the longer execution time is a fair trade-off.

In comparison to LEACH, the suggested approach produces a better balanced, energy-efficient, and durable network by combining WHO, reinforcement learning, and fuzzy logic. Despite the higher computational cost, which is a reasonable trade-off for the improved performance, its benefits in increasing network lifetime, increasing throughput, and conserving residual energy make it the perfect option for WSN applications needing dependable data transmission and optimal energy management.

The suggested approach, which uses fuzzy logic for cluster head (CH) selection and the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO) algorithm for clustering with reinforcement learning, finally outperforms the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol across key Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) performance metrics. Energy-aware clustering and intelligent CH selection greatly increase network lifetime, increasing first node death by 77.5% (from 213 to 378 rounds), half node death by 71.7% (from 575 to 987 rounds), and last node death by 29.9% (from 1089 to 1415 rounds). Higher packet transmission is made possible by energy-efficient CH selection and optimized cluster formation, reaching about 2380 packets. Network functionality is extended with balanced clustering and careful CH selection, which retain more residual energy. Due to complex optimization and fuzzy logic computations, the approach takes longer to execute (2131 s) than LEACH (874 s); however, this trade-off is offset by improved performance in other metrics. The suggested method’s sophisticated clustering and CH selection strategy offers significant advantages over LEACH, making it a more viable option for energy-efficient WSNs even if it demands more processing power.

To assess how well the suggested plan performed in this study, several procedures for the requirements listed in Table4for varying values of the number of nodes 80 and 50 have been implemented, as well as the clustering operation and cluster head selection and implementation. Comparison of the outcomes, including packet transmitted, network death, and total energy left in all operations, is shown in Fig.14. The suggested approach has demonstrated a notable enhancement in terms of lifetime and energy efficiency.

Comparing the performance results of the proposed method for the number of different nodes.

Enhancements to the fuzzy protocol have led to the development of the suggested fuzzy reinforcement learning protocol. Both approaches choose CH in the network using a criterion rule mechanism. On the other hand, EEUCB is enhanced further when the reinforcement learning process is taken into account. The suggested protocol also takes the environment’s energy density and the node’s distance from the BS into account when choosing the best CH, as well as the node’s ID, position, energy, and the number of nearby nodes. Furthermore, layering computations distribute the cluster nodes’ distance throughout the network. The BS in our protocol determines the cluster head using a fuzzy reinforcement learning algorithm, taking into account the distance between the nearest and farthest nodes as well as other metrics like residual energy and the quantity of neighbouring nodes. A fuzzy system trained using a reinforcement learning method with real data is utilized to select the CH node, which is a benefit of this method. This technique addresses network uncertainty. Furthermore, to extend network lifetime and preserve node energy, energy-aware clustering mode is employed. This problem considers not only the concentration of clusters for nodes, but also the number of nodes in each cluster and their energy dispersion, in addition to the nodes’ location.

Clustering and cluster head selection algorithms play an important role in improving the performance of wireless sensor networks and reducing energy consumption. Before studying efficient routing protocols and cluster head selection, we first looked at the structure of wireless sensor networks. Then, the techniques used in this field, including meta-heuristic and intelligent techniques, were evaluated. In this work, a new approach based on the HHO algorithm for the clustering problem and a cluster head selection strategy based on fuzzy reinforcement learning and the WHO algorithm were presented and evaluated to increase the network lifetime. Fitness, network lifetime, energy, and the number of transmitted packets were the four criteria used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with the LEACH clustering algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperformed the LEACH protocol in terms of performance thanks to the new energy-aware clustering method with optimization algorithms and the cluster head selection system based on fuzzy reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm increased the network throughput, extended the sensor network lifetime, and reduced the energy consumption of the node. In this study, the cluster head was selected using real-world network data retrieved using a training method. It also found appropriate fuzzy rules to adapt to network uncertainty, which achieved a good improvement in the evaluation criteria as a reward with the help of a reinforcement learning system. The proposed strategy was able to increase the network lifetime by 29.9% compared to the conventional LEACH method. In the future, we will apply a security framework to solve clustering and routing problems using chaotic approaches, with a view to increasing the network lifetime through energy optimization.
