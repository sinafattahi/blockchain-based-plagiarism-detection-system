Nursing students frequently encounter significant psychological stressors during their education, placing them at increased risk for reduced subjective well-being and mental health challenges. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs have emerged as promising interventions to enhance psychological resilience and well-being in this vulnerable population.

This experimental study utilized a pretest–posttest design with experimental and control groups. A total of 60 nursing students participated, with 30 assigned to the experimental group and 30 to the control group. Nursing students’ subjective well-being was assessed using the Subjective Well-Being Scale before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program adapted from Kabat-Zinn’s model, consisting of two 30-40-minute sessions per week, while the control group received no intervention. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests to compare differences between groups and paired samples t-tests for within-group changes.

No significant difference was observed in pretest subjective well-being scores between the groups (p> 0.05). Post-intervention analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in subjective well-being scores in the experimental group compared to the control group (p< 0.001). Within-group comparisons showed a significant improvement in subjective well-being for the experimental group, while the control group exhibited a decline (p< 0.001).

Participation in an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program significantly improved the subjective well-being of nursing students, suggesting its potential as an accessible and effective intervention for supporting their mental health. These findings underscore the importance of integrating mindfulness-based programs into nursing education to promote resilience and prevent emotional exhaustion.

In recent years, mindfulness has gained substantial attention in psychological and health sciences due to its demonstrated benefits for mental well-being, stress management, and emotional resilience [1–5]. Mindfulness is commonly described as the capacity to focus one’s attention on present-moment experiences with an attitude of openness, curiosity, and acceptance [5]. Rather than controlling or suppressing thoughts and emotions, mindfulness encourages individuals to relate differently to their internal experiences, fostering greater psychological flexibility and reducing automatic reactivity to stress [4,6].

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), originally developed by Kabat-Zinn (1990), systematically incorporates mindfulness meditation, body scanning, and breathing techniques to cultivate present-moment awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of thoughts and feelings [6]. Empirical evidence has demonstrated that mindfulness-based interventions exert positive effects on psychological processes such as emotion regulation, attentional control, cognitive flexibility, and stress resilience [1,4,7]. These mechanisms, in turn, have been associated with reductions in anxiety, depression, and psychological distress, alongside improvements in subjective well-being [2,8–10].

Subjective well-being (SWB)—an individual’s evaluation of life satisfaction and emotional balance—is increasingly recognized as a critical component of mental health and quality of life [10–12]. Beyond transient happiness, SWB reflects deeper psychological resources such as autonomy, personal growth, and resilience, which can be cultivated through mindfulness-based practices [3,12].

The university years represent a developmental period marked by identity formation, academic pressure, and social transitions, all of which can challenge students’ psychological resilience [13]. Nursing students, in particular, encounter additional stressors related to clinical practice, exposure to patient suffering, fear of making errors, and the emotional demands of caregiving [14]. These unique challenges make nursing students especially vulnerable to stress, burnout, compassion fatigue, and emotional exhaustion [14,15].

Recent literature has consistently highlighted the mental health challenges facing nursing students. For instance, Mazalová et al. (2022) identified elevated stress levels and the risk of emotional fatigue during clinical education [14], while Juanamasta et al. (2022) emphasized that low psychological well-being in nursing students is closely linked to insufficient social support and heightened emotional distress [15]. These challenges not only undermine students’ well-being and academic performance but also pose risks for their future professional competence and the quality of patient care they will deliver.

A growing body of research underscores the role of mindfulness as a protective factor against these stressors. Studies have demonstrated that mindfulness practices enhance emotional regulation, resilience, and self-compassion while reducing anxiety and stress [1,2,4,8]. For example, Aktepe et al. (2020) underscored that mindfulness strengthens emotion regulation capacities and stress management skills [1], and Orosa-Duarte et al. (2021) showed that mindfulness-based mobile applications improved self-compassion and reduced anxiety among healthcare students [2]. Similarly, Heinrich et al. (2024) found that mindfulness buffered the impact of stress on mental health outcomes in healthcare professionals [4], while Conversano et al. (2020) reported that mindfulness and self-compassion are key to protecting healthcare workers from psychological distress [8].

Given this background, there is a clear need to identify and implement effective interventions that enhance the well-being of nursing students and equip them with psychological resources to navigate academic and professional challenges. This study aims to address this need by evaluating the effectiveness of an MBSR program in enhancing subjective well-being among nursing students, who are at elevated risk for psychological distress and burnout.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program in enhancing the subjective well-being of nursing students.

It was hypothesized that participation in the MBSR program would lead to a statistically significant increase in subjective well-being scores among students in the experimental group compared to the control group.

This study was an experimental, quasi-experimental design with pretest-posttest and follow-up phases including an experimental group and a control group.

The study was conducted between October 2021 and June 2022 at two faculties of nursing located in a province in Eastern Turkey. Each university has its own faculty of nursing, and both are located within the same city. There were 60 nursing students in one university and 66 nursing students in the other. One university was randomly assigned to the experimental group, and the other to the control group. It is important to note that randomization occurred at the institutional level, not the individual level, which may introduce potential institutional biases such as differences in curriculum or student demographics. This limitation is acknowledged.

While Browne’s (1995) guideline suggesting a minimum sample size of 30 for pilot studies provided an initial reference, the sample size in this study was further determined by including all eligible first-year nursing students from each institution to enhance statistical power. To ensure methodological rigor, a formal a priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power software (version 3.1). Based on an expected medium effect size (d = 0.50), an alpha level of 0.05, and a desired power of 0.80 for independent samples t-tests, the minimum required sample size was calculated to be approximately 64 participants (32 per group) (Faul et al., 2009). The final sample exceeded this requirement, thus providing sufficient power to detect statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups.

However, the absence of randomization at the individual level remains a potential limitation that could influence the internal validity of the findings.

To avoid contamination between groups, students from two different institutions were used for the experimental and control groups.

In the experimental group, two students withdrew due to illness.

In the control group, four students provided incomplete data and were excluded.

Thus, the final sample consisted of 58 students in the experimental group and 60 in the control group (N= 118). The demographic characteristics of both groups were comparable and are presented in Table1. Students were included in the study if they were first-year nursing students with no prior training in mindfulness practices, had no diagnosed physical or psychiatric disorders, were not taking any psychotropic medications, provided written informed consent, and committed to attending all mindfulness sessions.

Data were collected using the Sociodemographic Variables Form and the Subjective Well-Being Scale (SWBS).

This form, developed by the researchers based on the literature, includes 8 items regarding participants’ age, gender, marital status, parental education level, and other personal details.

The SWBS, developed by Tuzgöl Dost (2004), consists of 46 items designed to assess individuals’ subjective well-being, including cognitive evaluations of life satisfaction and the frequency and intensity of positive and negative experiences [16]. The scale uses a 5-point Likert-type response format.

Twenty items are reverse-scored. The total score ranges from 46 to 230, with higher scores indicating higher subjective well-being. The original reliability coefficient was Cronbach’s α = 0.93. In the present study, internal consistency reliability was excellent (Cronbach’s α = 0.98) for the post-test administration.

Students in the experimental group attended an initial introductory session, during which the study’s purpose, procedures, and voluntary nature were explained. Written informed consent was obtained, and participants completed baseline questionnaires.

The experimental group participated in an 8-week structured Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, adapted from Kabat-Zinn’s (1990) original model. The intervention consisted of two 40-minute sessions per week over eight weeks (total 16 sessions). The sessions were conducted in coordination with the nursing faculty’s schedule to avoid disrupting academic activities.

The program was delivered by certified mindfulness facilitators with formal training in MBSR and experience in leading mindfulness-based interventions. Adherence to the protocol was monitored through attendance sheets and weekly self-reports on home practice. Participants were encouraged to engage in daily home practice (30–40 min), and written homework assignments were provided weekly to reinforce the skills learned in each session.

The control group completed the same assessments (pre- and post-intervention) but did not receive any intervention during the study period. No incentives were provided.

Ethical approval was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of XX University Medical Faculty (Approval No: 411, Date: 01.10.2020). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 24 for Windows. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the data distribution. Independent samples t-tests were applied to compare differences between the experimental and control groups both before and after the intervention, while paired samples t-tests were used to examine within-group pre–post changes. Additionally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to control for potential baseline differences. The level of statistical significance was set atp< 0.05, and missing data were handled using listwise deletion, with only complete cases included in the analysis.

As shown in Tables1and 55.2% of the participants in the experimental group are women, all of them are single, and the families of 48.3% live in the city. Of the education level of the participants’ mothers, 34.5% completed primary school, whereas the fathers of 31% completed secondary school, and the parents of 46.6% were reported to exhibit authoritarian attitudes. 77.6% of the participants were accommodating in the dormitory at the time of the study. 59.3% of the participants in the control group are women, all of them are single, and the families of 55.9% live in the city. Of the education level of the participants’ mothers, 32.2% completed secondary school, whereas the fathers of 27.1% completed high school, and the parents of 39% of the participants were reported to exhibit authoritarian attitudes. 79.7% of the participants were accommodating in the dormitory at the time of the study. Experimental and control groups exhibited similarities in terms of all demographic variables (p> 0.05).

There was no statistically significant difference in the mean SWB scores between the experimental and control groups before the application (p> 0.05). In the pre-test, the experimental and control groups exhibited similar results. A statistically significant difference was observed in the mean SWB scores between the experimental and control groups after the application (p< 0.001). In the posttest, the experimental group exhibited a higher mean score (Table2).

Intra-group analyses revealed a significant difference in the mean SWB scores of the experimental group before and after the application (p< 0.001). The mean SWB score was observed to increase after the application. On the other hand, a significant difference was also observed in the mean SWB scores of the control group before and after the application (p< 0.001). The mean SWB score was observed to decrease after the application in the control group (Table3).

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program in enhancing the subjective well-being (SWB) of nursing students. In the study, the mean SWB score of the experimental group was 83.91 ± 9.47, while the control group’s mean SWB score was 80.73 ± 8.09. Given the possible range of scores on the SWB scale (minimum 46, maximum 230), these results indicate that both groups exhibited relatively low levels of subjective well-being. However, it is important to note that no clinical or normative cutoff values for this scale are currently established in the literature, which limits definitive conclusions about the “low” or “high” nature of these scores.

University life is a critical period involving new experiences, identity exploration, and significant life decisions. Subjective well-being plays a crucial role in shaping these experiences, particularly during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Previous studies have highlighted that nursing students are particularly vulnerable to stress and often report low to moderate levels of well-being [3,11,17]. This vulnerability can be attributed to the unique challenges associated with nursing education, including exposure to patient suffering, high academic demands, and the pressure of clinical responsibilities.

Interestingly, some studies conducted among Turkish nursing students have reported higher levels of subjective well-being compared to the present study [18]. A key contextual factor potentially explaining this discrepancy is the timing of data collection: our study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period associated with increased psychological distress, particularly among healthcare workers and students in health-related fields [19]. The pandemic may have amplified feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and fear, contributing to the overall lower SWB scores observed.

The current findings support previous literature emphasizing the need for educational interventions to promote well-being among nursing students [20,21]. Our study specifically focused on first-year nursing students to improve their subjective well-being before the onset of professional practice. Following participation in the MBSR program, the experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement in SWB scores compared to the control group (p< 0.001), confirming the effectiveness of the intervention.

Mindfulness-based practices have been consistently shown to enhance psychological outcomes such as self-understanding, resilience, and emotional regulation while reducing stress and anxiety [2,3,22]. However, there remains a scarcity of research specifically examining the impact of MBSR on subjective well-being in nursing students. Studies conducted with university students from various countries—including Pakistan, Russia, the Philippines, and Sweden—have demonstrated that mindfulness improves subjective well-being and psychological adjustment [3,23]. The current study’s findings align with this international evidence.

Furthermore, nursing students face higher levels of psychological distress compared to students in other disciplines, underscoring the need for targeted interventions [14]. Notably, the conscious selection of nursing as a career has been identified as a significant predictor of subjective well-being, suggesting that career motivation may interact with psychological resilience and well-being outcomes [18]. These findings highlight the importance of early interventions in fostering not only the mental health but also the professional identity of future nurses.

Consistent with prior research, our study observed that participants who did not receive any intervention exhibited a significant decline in SWB scores over time (p< 0.001). This deterioration suggests that in the absence of proactive support, nursing students’ well-being may erode during their academic journey. Such findings emphasize the necessity of providing practical, accessible, and evidence-based interventions within university settings.

Mindfulness-based interventions, including MBSR, are characterized by their time-efficiency, scalability, and low implementation costs. These features make them particularly suitable for integration into nursing curricula. Previous studies have demonstrated that mindfulness-based programs are associated with improved stress management, resilience, and emotion regulation among university students [3,24,25]. Although direct studies on the impact of MBSR on SWB remain limited, the broader literature on mindfulness supports the observed benefits on psychological well-being and mental health [26–28].

The present findings also reinforce the critical role of psychological resources such as mindfulness and resilience in enabling students to effectively navigate academic and personal challenges. Given that nursing students are at heightened risk for stress-related problems, equipping them with these resources could contribute to their academic success, emotional well-being, and future professional competence.

Mindfulness is particularly relevant to the nursing profession as it promotes key competencies such as enhanced self-awareness, effective communication, and professional autonomy [29]. By fostering these skills, mindfulness not only benefits the personal well-being of nursing students but also has the potential to enhance the quality of care they provide as future healthcare professionals.

Although the difference in scores between the experimental and control groups provides valuable preliminary evidence regarding the effectiveness of MBSR, this study has several limitations that should be acknowledged.

One key limitation is that the factors that may have positively or negatively influenced the subjective well-being of nursing students beyond the intervention itself were not examined. Additionally, the sample was geographically limited to two nursing schools within the same province, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other populations or educational contexts.

Another limitation is the reliance on self-report measures, which are subject to response biases such as social desirability or inaccurate self-assessment. Furthermore, the absence of long-term follow-up data prevents conclusions about the sustainability of the observed improvements in subjective well-being over time.

Despite these limitations, the study has several strengths. The use of a structured and replicable MBSR program, which is both feasible and adaptable to nursing education settings, enhances the practical relevance of the findings. Moreover, the inclusion of a control group and the demonstration of statistically significant effects on subjective well-being contribute to the methodological robustness of the study. These strengths support the potential for integrating mindfulness-based interventions into nursing curricula to promote psychological well-being among students.

The findings of this study indicate that nursing students in the experimental group exhibited a significant increase in subjective well-being following participation in an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program, while students in the control group showed a decline over the same period. Statistical analysis confirmed that the post-intervention subjective well-being scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p< 0.001). These results provide clear evidence that mindfulness-based interventions can effectively enhance the psychological well-being of nursing students.

These findings highlight the vulnerability of nursing students to stress and reduced well-being due to the academic, clinical, and emotional demands of their education. The observed decline in the control group underscores the need for timely and accessible interventions to prevent deterioration in subjective well-being.

Based on these results, integrating structured mindfulness-based programs such as MBSR into nursing curricula appears to be an effective strategy to support students’ mental health, enhance coping skills, and foster resilience. Educational institutions should consider offering practical mindfulness exercises, monitoring at-risk students, and prioritizing psychological well-being as an essential component of professional development.
