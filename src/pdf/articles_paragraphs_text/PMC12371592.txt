the introduction of innovative materials such as hydrogels, deep eutectic
solvents (DES), and ionic liquids (ILs). These materials offer unique
advantages in enhancing biodevice performance, particularly in enzyme
stabilization, biocompatibility, and electrochemical sensitivity.
Hydrogels, known for their high water content and flexibility, provide
an ideal matrix for enzyme immobilization in biological applications
but are limited by low ionic conductivity. DES, with their green chemistry
credentials and ability to stabilize enzymes under harsh conditions,
show great promise, although scalability and performance in complex
biological systems remain challenges. ILs, with their superior electron
transfer capabilities, enable high sensitivity in electrochemical
biosensors, though issues of viscosity and potential toxicity need
to be addressed for broader biomedical use. This review provides a
comparative analysis of the roles of these materials in enzyme-based
biosensors and bioelectronics, including microbatteries and bioelectrosynthesis,
highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and future opportunities.
The integration of these materials holds great potential for advancing
bioelectronics technologies, with applications spanning medical diagnostics,
environmental monitoring, and industrial processes. By addressing
current challenges and optimizing these materials for large-scale
use, the future of enzyme-based devices could see significant improvements
in efficiency, sensitivity, and sustainability.

The rapid advancement of biosensors and
bioelectronics has been
driven by the growing need for more sensitive, accurate, and sustainable
devices in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and bioengineering.,These devices rely on advanced materials that can seamlessly interface
with biological systems while offering high performance and durability. Additionally, innovative platforms such as flexible
carbon fiber electrodes have demonstrated exceptional performance,
as seen in their application for ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection
in human saliva, highlighting the importance
of material advancements in modern biosensors. This exemplifies how
technological innovation in biosensing has been driven not only by
material improvements but also by broader global demands. Recent discussions
highlight how the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, acted as a catalyst
for accelerating the integration of research, business, and innovation,
reinforcing trends that were already shaping the future of biosensor
and bioelectronics development and market competitiveness.

Beyond biosensors, a wide range of bioelectronic
devices has emerged,
including biofuel cells, implantable biodevices, neural interfaces, wearable sensors, lab-on-a-chip platforms, and bioelectronic medicine. Biofuel cells leverage enzymatic or microbial catalysis
to generate electricity from biological substrates, paving the way
for self-powered biosensors and medical implants. Neural interfaces,
such as brain-computer interfaces, rely on biocompatible materials
and signal processing advancements to enable communication between
electronic systems and neural networks, offering groundbreaking applications
in prosthetics, neuromodulation, and cognitive enhancement. Wearable
sensors, utilizing flexible and stretchable materials, are revolutionizing
real-time health monitoring, providing continuous physiological data
with minimal user discomfort. Lab-on-a-chip platforms integrate microfluidics,
biosensing, and electronics to enable rapid, high-throughput diagnostics,
which are crucial for disease detection and personalized medicine.
Bioelectronic medicine, a rapidly growing field, explores electronic
modulation of biological pathways to treat conditions such as inflammation,
pain, and neurological disorders.

The development of enzyme-based
bioelectronic devices, including
biosensors and biomimetic systems, has significantly advanced with
the introduction of innovative materials such as hydrogels, deep eutectic
solvents (DES), and ionic liquids (ILs). These materials offer unique advantages in enhancing biosensor performance,
particularly in enzyme stabilization, biocompatibility, and electrochemical
sensitivity. Hydrogels, known for their high water content and flexibility,
provide an ideal matrix for enzyme immobilization in biological applications. DES, with their green chemistry credentials
and ability to stabilize enzymes under harsh conditions, show great
promise, although scalability and performance in complex biological
systems remain challenges. ILs, with their superior electron transfer
capabilities, enable high sensitivity in electrochemical biosensors,
though issues of viscosity and potential toxicity need to be addressed
for broader biomedical use.

In addition to biomedical and diagnostic
applications, bioelectronic
devices are playing a critical role in sustainable energy generation
and environmental remediation. Enzymatic and microbial biofuel cells
offer a promising avenue for clean energy production, efficiently
converting organic substrates into electricity. Bioelectrosynthesis,
a process leveraging electrogenic microorganisms, enables the sustainable
production of valuable chemicals, including biohydrogen and biofuels,
with minimal carbon emissions. Water
splitting technologies, inspired by natural photosynthesis, are being
explored using biohybrid catalysts to facilitate hydrogen production
as a renewable energy source. Furthermore,
bioelectronic systems are being integrated into carbon capture and
utilization strategies, employing engineered microbial systems to
convert CO2into biobased products. These advancements
in bioelectrochemical systems contribute to global efforts toward
decarbonization, fostering the development of sustainable energy solutions
and circular bioeconomy models.

DES, ILs, and hydrogels have
emerged as key materials that can
address many of the challenges in current bioelectronic technologies(Figure).−Deep eutectic solvents and ionic liquids are known for their physicochemical
properties, such as high ionic conductivity, tunability, and environmental
friendliness.,These features make them ideal
for enhancing the electrochemical stability and selectivity of biosensors.
Hydrogels, on the other hand, offer excellent flexibility, high water
retention, and biocompatibility, making them suitable for creating
interfaces between biological tissues and electronic components.

Comparison of the main properties of hydrogels, deep eutectic
solvents
(DES), and ionic liquids (ILs) used in enzymatic biodispositives.

Ionic liquids (ILs)
are defined as salts that remain in a liquid
state at temperatures below 100 °C. As a result, the ions are
more disordered in these cases compared to those in inorganic salts,
for instance. This definition emphasizes their ionic nature, which
gives ILs interesting properties such as high ionic conductivity,
low volatility, and excellent thermal stability.−These characteristics
make ILs particularly useful in electrochemical bioelectronics, where
efficient electron transfer is essential for generating accurate signals.
The ionic structure of ILs allows for the movement of charged species,
facilitating interactions between enzymes and electrodes. This enhances
the sensitivity and responsiveness of the biosensor, enabling it to
detect even small concentrations of analytes. Additionally, ILs are
known for their ability to stabilize enzymes in harsh environments,
such as high temperatures or extreme pH conditions, which extends
the operational lifespan of a biosensor. Alternative approaches to enhance enzyme immobilization and electron
transfer include the use of nanostructured materials, such as mesoporous
frameworks formed by magnetically induced assembly of nanoparticles.
These structures have demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical
response, particularly for small redox proteins. The tunability of ILs, through the selection of different
cations and anions, allows for the customization of their physical
and chemical properties, making them adaptable for various applications.,However, this versatility also presents challenges, as certain IL
formulations can be highly viscous or toxic, limiting their use in
some biological or medical applications. Despite these challenges,
ILs offer significant advantages in biosensors that require long-term
stability and high sensitivity, particularly in industrial and environmental
contexts.

This review provides a comparative analysis of the
roles of these
materials in enzyme-based biosensors and bioelectronics, including
microbatteries and bioelectrosynthesis, highlighting their respective
strengths, limitations, and future opportunities. The integration
of these materials holds great potential for advancing bioelectronics
technologies, with applications spanning medical diagnostics, environmental
monitoring, and industrial processes. By addressing current challenges
and optimizing these materials for large-scale use, the future of
enzyme-based devices could see significant improvements in efficiency,
sensitivity, and sustainability.

Tablepresents
a comparative overview of the key characteristics of hydrogels, DES,
and ILs, highlighting their chemical composition, structural properties,
and applicability in enzyme-based bioelectronics devices. Hydrogels
are composed of polymer networks with a high-water content, which
makes them highly biocompatible and suitable for mimicking biological
environments.−These networks can be made from natural polymers
such as alginate, chitosan, or collagen, or from synthetic polymers
like polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyacrylamide.−For instance, a recent study demonstrated that carboxymethyl
hemicellulose hydrogels integrated with nitrogen-doped carbon dots
(CM-Hemi@Ca–N–CDs) exhibited significant antibacterial
and antifungal activity. These hydrogels
effectively inhibited the growth ofEscherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus, andCandida albicans, with enhanced antimicrobial performance attributed to strong binding
interactions and improved structural rigidity facilitated by amide
bond formation. In contrast, DES are mixtures of hydrogen bond donors
(HBDs) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs), typically formulated from
simple and nontoxic components like choline chloride and urea. DES are characterized by their ability to create
a liquid phase with melting points lower than those of the individual
components. On the other hand, ILs are
composed of organic salts formed from cations and anions, such as
imidazolium, pyridinium, or phosphonium-based molecules.−This structure gives ILs their excellent ionic conductivity and
thermal stability, making them highly suitable for electrochemical
applications.

In terms of common types, hydrogels are classified
into natural,
synthetic, and hybrid forms. Natural hydrogels, such as alginate or
collagen-based gels, are often preferred for biocompatibility, while
synthetic versions like PEG offer greater control over mechanical
properties. DES are typically classified into five types: Type I involves
a quaternary ammonium salt combined with a metal chloride (e.g., choline
chloride + zinc chloride), Type II composed
of a quaternary ammonium salt and a metal chloride hydrate (e.g.,
choline chloride + chromium­(iii) chloride hexa-hydrate), Type III formed by a quaternary ammonium salt
and a HBD (e.g., choline chloride + ethylene glycol), type IV that involves the interaction of a metal chloride
and a HBD (e.g., zinc chloride + urea), and type V composed only of molecular substances (e.g, thymol +
menthol). ILs are categorized based on
their cation type, including imidazolium-based ILs (e.g., 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium),
pyridinium-based ILs, and phosphonium-based ILs, each providing different
electrochemical characteristics suited for specific bioelectronics
applications.

The cross-linking
methods used in hydrogels include both (such
as ionic or hydrogen bonds and entanglements) and chemical cross-linking through covalent bonds initiated by external
agents. In contrast, DES rely on covalent
or noncovalent interactions between HBDs and HBAs to form stable mixtures,
without requiring polymerization; However,
it is worth noting that DES are polymerizable and, in such cases,
useful for the production of, for example, eutectogels and hydrogels
can be used for drug delivery, as deformation sensors, and in various
components of flexible electronics.−ILs, on the other hand,
maintain their structure through van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding,
and electrostatic interactions, providing excellent chemical stability
even in harsh conditions.

Hydrogels have garnered significant
attention in the field of enzyme-based
biosensors, bioelectronics and biomimetic devices due to their unique
properties and the ability to serve as effective platforms for enzyme
immobilization and as interfaces for electrochemical process in bioelectronics
systems. These materials are defined by their high-water content,
biocompatibility, and mechanical flexibility, making them ideal for
interfacing with biological systems in various biomedical and biosensing
applications.−Hydrogels are composed of three-dimensional polymer networks that
can retain large amounts of water, which contributes to their biocompatibility
and mimics the aqueous environment found in biological tissues. This feature, coupled with their capacity to
encapsulate enzymes while preserving their bioactivity, makes hydrogels
an ideal medium for biosensors.

One of the most important properties
of hydrogels is their high-water
content. This characteristic allows them to provide a moist environment
like that of biological tissues, which is essential for maintaining
the activity and stability of enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts that typically require aqueous
conditions to perform optimally, and hydrogels offer the necessary
hydration and mobility for substrates and enzymes to interact effectively. Moreover, the high-water content contributes
to the hydrogel’s porosity, which facilitates the diffusion
of analytes and enhances reaction kinetics.

Hydrogels play a pivotal role in enzyme encapsulation,
which is
one of the primary reasons for their use in enzyme-based biosensors.
This encapsulation involves embedding enzymes within the hydrogel
matrix, forming a protective microenvironment that shields them from
environmental stressors such as temperature fluctuations, pH changes,
or exposure to organic solvents, all of which could lead to denaturation
or loss of activity. Moreover, the highly hydrophilic nature of hydrogels
not only preserves enzyme bioactivity but also enhances stability
by maintaining an aqueous environment conducive to enzymatic reactions.,,For instance,Figurea outlines the formation of
dZIF-8 BH biohybrid hydrogel in its forms of beads, sheets and fibers.
These hydrogels combine the structural support of defective ZIF-8
frameworks with the stretchability and water retention properties
of alginate-based hydrogels. This synergy not only extends the stability
of encapsulated glucose oxidase (Figureb), but also enhances catalytic performance
by facilitating substrate accessibility and efficient product accumulation.

retained sensing activity of biosensors stored at room temperature

(1 mM glucose, 15 min incubation). Reprinted from ref  with permission from the

In addition to enzyme encapsulation, hydrogels
facilitate the transport
of analytes, which is critical for the operation of biosensors. Due
to their porous structure, hydrogels allow the diffusion of analytes
into the matrix, where they can interact with the immobilized enzymes.,This diffusion is essential for biosensors to detect specific molecules,
such as glucose or lactate, in real time. The transport of analytes
through the hydrogel matrix enhances reaction kinetics by enabling
rapid interaction between the analyte and the enzyme, which is vital
for generating a detectable signal in a timely manner. This property makes hydrogels particularly suitable
for biosensors that require fast response times, such as glucose monitoring
in diabetic patients or lactate sensing during exercise.

The
incorporation of enzymes into gels provide a highly structured
and stable microenvironment for bioelectrocatalysis.Figureillustrates the one-pot synthesis
of the BOD-based biogel, where Nafion and glutaraldehyde facilitate
enzyme entrapment while preserving its catalytic function (Figurea). The resulting
biogel is then integrated into a gas diffusion electrode (GDE), forming
a composite structure that enhances enzyme retention and electron
transfer (Figureb).
To assess the structural properties of the biogel, optical microscopy
images of the enzyme film reveal a homogeneous yet porous morphol
ogy, ensuring efficient substrate diffusion (Figurec). Additionally, FTIR analysis confirms
the successful incorporation of BOD and Nafion through characteristics
vibrational bands (Figured), further supported by chemical imaging that maps the enzyme
and polymer distribution across the electrode surface (Figuree). Electrochemical characterization
by cyclic voltammetry (CV) highlights the catalytic performance of
the BOD-based biogel. In the absence of the O2, the biogel
electrode exhibits minimal faradaic response, similar to the enzyme-free
control (Figuref).
However, under oxygen-saturated conditions, a significant increase
in catalytic current is observed (Figureg), confirming the efficient bioelectrocatalytic
activity of the immobilized enzyme. These results underscore he biogel’s
effectiveness in stablilizing the enzyme while enabling direct electron
transfer, a key feature for next-generation biosensors and bioelectrodes.

Despite their many advantages, hydrogels have certain limitations
when used in enzyme-based biosensors. One of the primary drawbacks
is their limited ionic conductivity. Since hydrogels are composed
mainly of water and polymer, their ability to conduct ions is relatively
low compared to other materials, such as ionic liquids or deep eutectic
solvents. This can limit the efficiency of electron transfer processes
in certain electrochemical biosensors, reducing the overall sensitivity
and signal output of the device. These issues have been previously
discussed in the literature, highlighting that enzymatic biosensors
often suffer from rapid activity loss and nonspecific adsorption,
limiting their commercial viability. To address this issue, researchers often modify hydrogels by incorporating
conductive materials, such as inorganic salts,to enhance their ionic conductivity.

Building on these efforts
to overcome the inherent limitations
of hydrogels, recent studies have explored innovative systems with
enhanced electrochemical properties and mechanical stability. A notable
example is the BEAQ-gel.Figurea shows that BEAQ-gel exhibit
quasi-reversible behavior, highlighting its potential as a redox-active
material for bioelectronics applications. Additionally, its mechanical
stability (Figureb) at elevated temperatures ensures it suitability for wearable devices,
maintaining structural integrity even under physiological conditions.
Furthermore, the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis (Figurec) reveals a hierarchical
internal structure that promotes ion diffusion and could enhance enzyme
encapsulation. Complementary to this,Figured presents the electron density profile obtained
via SAXS, providing further insight into the organized supramolecular
nature of BEAQ-gel. This well-structured network facilitates ion transport,
which is crucial for maintaining electrochemical performance in bioelectronics
applications. Beyond its electrochemical properties, the versatility
of BEAQ-gel extends to its integration into functional devices.Figuree illustrates the
structural design of a wearable microbattery using BEAQ-gel, demonstrating
its adaptability for flexible and stretchable applications. Moreover,Figuref compares the battery
with a commercial CR2032 cell, highlighting its compact size and flexibility.
These features make BEAQ-gel a promising material for energy storage
applications in wearable technologies.

Hydrogels are also sensitive to environmental changes,
such as
variations in pH and temperature. Since
the structure and function of enzymes are highly dependent on environmental
conditions, changes in the surrounding environment can lead to alterations
in the hydrogel’s structure or enzyme activity. For instance,
extreme pH shifts may cause the hydrogel to swell or shrink, which could disrupt
the encapsulated enzyme’s activity or even lead to leaching
of the enzyme from the matrix. Similarly, temperature fluctuations
could affect both the hydrogel’s mechanical properties and
the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency, leading to decreased performance
in biosensing applications.

One of the key properties that make DES suitable
for enzyme-based
bioelectronics systems is their low toxic and biodegradable nature.
Unlike some traditional solvents and ionic liquids, which may pose
environmental or health risks, DES are often composed of naturally
occurring or easily accessible components, such as choline chloride
and urea. This composition ensures that
DES are safe for biological applications, making them ideal for biosensors
used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. Overall, although DES offer several advantages
over conventional solvents, such as reduced toxicity, it is essential
to exercise caution in their use and to pursue ongoing research into
any potential risks.

Although
some DES exhibit adequate ionic conductivity for electrochemical
applications, this conductivity strongly
depends on molecular reorientation dynamics and glassy behavior near
the glass transition temperature (Tg).Tableprovides
the ionic conductivity values of several DESs across various temperatures.
As the temperature increases, the viscosity decreases, allowing for
greater ionic mobility and consequently raising the conductivity.

The ionic conductivity of DES is generally low (less
than 2 mS
cm–1at room temperature) due to the high viscosity
of these solvents. The viscosity, which hinders the free movement
of ions, results from the extensive hydrogen bonding network and with
other interactions like van der Waals and electrostatic forces among
the components of the DES.Tableorganizes the viscosity of a series of DES. As observed,
increasing the temperature decreases the viscosity, and increases
the ionic conductivity of DESs. This can be explained by the hole
theory, which states that an ion can move in an ionic liquid only
when it is near a hole of equal or larger size. DES have high viscosity and low conductivity because the
average size of an ion is around 0.4 nm, which is twice the average
radius of a hole. As a result, only a
small fraction of ions is in motion at any given time due to the lack
of appropriately sized gaps. On the other hand, both viscosity and
ionic conductivity of DES are tunable, meaning that their properties
can be adjusted by modifying the ratio of HBD to HBA or by adding
other components, like acids, salts, and amine derivatives. This tunability allows for the customization
of DES to suit specific applications, where viscosity can impact biomolecule
mobility, reaction rates, and overall dispositive performance.

containing ChCl:Urea (1:2) + LiCl (0.419 mol/kg).

DES have demonstrated the capacity to enhance enzyme
stability
under a variety of challenging conditions. The hydrogen-bonding networks
characteristic of DES reduce water activity and create a stabilizing
microenvironment that mitigates enzyme denaturation and prolongs enzymatic
activity. For instance, that natural
deep eutectic solvents (NADES), such as betaine-sorbitol-water (1:1:3),
significantly improve the thermal stability and catalytic activity
of lipoxygenase (LOX) from Pleurotus sapidus, with activity increases
of up to 43% compared to aqueous buffers. These features expand the usability of enzymes in industrial and
biosensing applications under harsh conditions. Beyond their role
in enzyme stabilization, DES also improve the performance and longevity
of coenzymes such as NAD/NADH, which play pivotal roles in redox enzymatic
reactions. Research has shown that choline chloride:urea DES significantly
prolong the stability of these coenzymes, maintaining their functionality
for up to 50 days. This effect is attributed
to the structured hydrogen-bond network within DES, which reduces
degradation pathways typically encountered in aqueous environments.
Such stabilization is crucial for the accurate operation of biosensors
in diagnostic and analytical applications, where the integrity of coenzymes directly impacts the precision
of measurements.

Furthermore, DES are versatile solvents that
can facilitate the
synthesis of novel materials for biosensor construction. By leveraging
their tunable properties, researchers can optimize their role in the
formation of composites for electrode modification. For example, DES
has been used to synthesize polyaniline nanocomposites,,which have demonstrated enhanced electrochemical properties, making
them ideal for biosensors,−both for the immobilization of biomolecules and as electron mediators
during the enzymatic reaction process.

The exploration
of electron transport pathways in redox enzymes
provides a deeper understanding of their integration into bioelectronics
devices. Recent studies highlight the role of protein structures in
facilitating electron transfer through localized conductance channels,
as the conductance properties of bilirubin oxidase using advanced
scanning tunneling microscopy techniques. Meanwhile, in situ and operando electrochemical techniques have
enabled a deeper understanding of biomolecular electron transfer mechanisms,
particularly in the context of redox proteins and bioelectrode development.
Although these studies focus on fundamental aspects of charge transfer,
their findings provide valuable insights that can be leveraged to
enhance the design and performance of biosensors. In that regard, ILs have attracted significant interest
in enzyme-based biosensors and bioelectronics thanks to its ability
to modulate electron transfer reactions. Furthermore, this class of materials presents interesting properties
for sensibility, such as low volatility, outstanding thermal resilience,
and superior electrical conductivity, which allow them to function
effectively as electrolytes or enzyme-stabilizing agents. Their key attributesadjustable ionic
conductivity, low volatility, and thermal stabilitymake them
highly suitable for use in bioelectronics platforms that require reliable
and long-term performance, especially in harsh environmental conditions.
The tunability of ILs allows for specific tailoring to meet the needs
of bioelectronics, whether for improving enzyme stability, enhancing
electron transfer, or increasing sensor sensitivity.

Electron transfer is a fundamental process underpinning
various
phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology. Its role in sustainable
energy solutions and the synthesis of value-added compounds aligns
with the development of enzyme-based biosensors, where electron transfer
mechanisms are critical for improving device performance and stability. That way, one of the most notable properties
of ILs is their adjustable ionic conductivity, which is essential
for facilitating efficient electron transfer.,The ionic nature of these liquids allows for the conduction of electricity
through the movement of ions, which is crucial in bioelectronics where
the success of application relies also on electrochemical reactions.
The conductivity of ILs can be fine-tuned by altering the cation–anion
pair, enabling researchers to optimize their designs for specific
applications.,A recent study investigated
the impact of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM]­[Ac]) as
a cosolvent for the bioelectrochemical reduction of CO2to formate byShewanella oneidensisMR-1. In the absence of ILs, exhibited a faradaic efficiency of 34.5 ± 26.1% at room temperature,
which increased to 69.7 ± 22.2% at 37 °C (Figurec). The addition of 5% (v/v)
[EMIM]­[Ac] at room temperature further enhanced system performance,
elevating the faradaic efficiency to 94.5 ± 4.3% (Figured. Moreover, the cathodic current
density surged from 1.57 ± 0.68 μA cm–2, in the absence of IL, to 10.50 ± 1.90 μA cm–2, (Figuree,
f), highlighting the role of [EMIM]­[Ac] in facilitating CO2solubility and enhancing electron transfer within the microbial
system.

ILs are also known for their low volatility, which makes them excellent for applications
under high
vacuum conditions because, unlike volatile substances (such as water
or organic solvents), they do not evaporate. This makes them ideal
for devices or sensors that need to operate stably at extremely low
pressures, ensuring safety and efficiency.,Unlike volatile organic solvents, ILs remain stable at elevated
temperatures without significant loss of mass or degradation, which
is particularly important in applications that require extended operational
times or exposure to harsh environmental conditions.

The thermal
stability of ILs has been highlighted as a critical
factor in enhancing the performance of electrochemical biosensors.
In a recent study, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) entrapped in in ILs
retained 73% of its initial activity after thermal treatment at 55
°C for 20 min, whereas unprotected AChE lost 60% of its activity
at temperatures between 42–48 °C. This thermal protection is attributed to the ability of
ILs to create a biocompatible microenvironment, reducing the impact
of thermal fluctuations on the enzyme’s active site. Such a
property enables the biosensor to operate efficiently under elevated
temperatures, facilitating the analysis of pesticides in real samples,
such as fruits and vegetables, without the need for prior cooling,
thereby improving process efficiency.

Additionally, in electrochemical
biodispositives, ILs can act as
the electrolyte due to their remarkable ionic conductivity, which
typically ranges between 10–3and 10–2S cm–1at room temperature, ensuring efficient
ion transport and minimizing resistance. Their wide electrochemical stability window, often exceeding 4.0
V, supports a broad spectrum without degradation of the electrolyte. This makes ILs particularly advantageous for
maintaining stability and performance during long-term operation,
even in complex biological environments, where traditional electrolytes
might degrade or lose efficacy. For example, imidazolium-based ILs
have demonstrated biomimetic electron transfer capabilities by emulating
the function of histidine residues in biological systems. This facilitates
a concerted two-electron transfer, similar to natural enzymatic processes.
Studies have shown that such ILs can enhance the electron transfer
efficiency of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) when compared to conventional
inorganic electrolytes. The increased peak currents observed in cyclic
voltammetry reflect improved conductivity and redox behavior, attributed
to the organized ionic structure of ILs. This organized ionic structure supports more efficient ion transport,
crucial for enhancing the stability and performance of enzyme-based
bioelectronics platforms.

Moreover, beyond their use as electrolytes,
ILs have emerged as
promising materials for enzyme immobilization and stabilization in
biosensors due to their properties and versatility. The composition
of ILs, based on different cations and anions, enables the modulation
of interactions between enzymes and immobilization materials, enhancing
catalytic efficiency, thermal stability, and operational resistance
of immobilized enzymes.,ILs have shown to
significantly enhance enzyme stability by minimizing denaturation
effects, particularly under nonconventional reaction conditions. This
has been demonstrated in the development of a highly sensitive amperometric
biosensor, where the immobilization of tyrosinase on a modified electrode
with ILs contributed to improved enzyme performance and stability,
allowing for accurate analysis of phenolic compounds such as catechol. These advances underscore the role of ILs as
a strategic tool in the development of innovative and sustainable
enzymatic technologies, including glucose, hydrogen peroxide, and alcohol detection devices.

Despite their many
advantages, ILs also have certain limitations
that must be considered when designing enzyme-based biosensors. One
of the primary challenges is the high viscosity of some ILs, which
can impede the diffusion of analytes and reduce the overall speed
of the biosensor’s response. While the viscosity of ILs can
be tuned to some extent, finding the right balance between viscosity
and conductivity can be challenging, particularly for biosensors that
require rapid analyte detection.

Another limitation is the potential
toxicity of certain IL components.
While many ILs are biocompatible, such as those synthesized from amino
acids, some cation–anion combinations
can be toxic to living organisms, which may limit their use in devices
intended for medical or environmental applications. For example, ILs
with imidazolium or pyridinium cations and highly fluorinated anions,
such as [(CF3SO2)2N] and [PF6], exhibit increased toxicity. This is often attributed to their structural features that enhance
hydrophobicity and membrane disruption potential. Researchers must
carefully select ILs that are safe and nontoxic, particularly for
biosensors designed for in vivo use or in applications where human
exposure is a concern. Lastly, the cost of ILs can be relatively high
compared to conventional solvents. The synthesis of ILs often requires
specialized equipment and processes, which can increase the overall
cost. While ILs offer significant performance benefits, the cost may
be prohibitive for some applications, particularly in cases where
the technology is intended for disposable or large-scale use.

A comparative analysis of these materials reveals distinct
strengths
and limitations in terms of how they stabilize enzymes, interact with
biological systems, and perform in bioelectronics technologies.Tablesummarize key properties,
advantages, limitations, and applications of these class of materials
for bioelectronics devices. Effective enzyme stabilization is fundamental
to the success of enzyme-based biosensors, as it ensures that enzymes
retain their catalytic activity over time, even under changing environmental
conditions. Hydrogels excel in maintaining enzyme bioactivity in aqueous
environments. The hydrated network within hydrogels mimics the natural
biological setting where enzymes typically function, preserving their
structure and catalytic capabilities for extended periods. However,
hydrogels are sensitive to environmental factors, such as changes
in temperature or pH, which can alter their structure, leading to
potential swelling or shrinking. This sensitivity can affect the stability
of the encapsulated enzymes, potentially reducing the biosensor’s
performance in conditions that are less controlled or more dynamic.

DES offer a distinct advantage in enzyme stabilization,
particularly
under harsh conditions. Their chemical composition, often involving
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, creates an environment that can
protect enzymes from or the denaturation caused by high temperatures
or the presence of organic solvents. This makes DES ideal fo industrial
applications where systems may be exposed to more extreme environments.
Despite this advantage, the use of DES in complex biological samples
remains less explored. Their interactions with biological matrices,
such as blood or tissue fluids, need further investigation to ensure
that they do not negatively impact enzyme activity or biosensor reliability.

ILs are particularly noted for their ability to enhance electron
transfer, which is crucial for bioelectronics that rely on electrochemical
signals. Their ionic nature supports efficient electron exchange,
allowing for the rapid detection of analytes. However, ILs can present
challenges in terms of enzyme stabilization due to their high viscosity
in some formulations. This can hinder the diffusion of substrates
and analytes to the enzyme, potentially slowing down the response
time. Furthermore, certain ILs have raised concerns about toxicity,
particularly when used in biological systems, limiting their application
in some biosensor designs.

Biocompatibility is another critical
factor for enzyme-based bioelectronics,
especially those intended for in vivo applications or prolonged interaction
with biological tissues and fluids. Hydrogels are highly biocompatible,
making them suitable for implantable biosensors or sensors designed
for direct contact with human tissue. Natural hydrogels, such as those
derived from alginate or chitosan, are particularly valued for their
minimal toxicity and ability to integrate seamlessly with biological
systems. This allows for extended use in medical diagnostics or therapeutic
monitoring without the risk of adverse reactions. However, synthetic
hydrogels may require additional modifications to match the biocompatibility
levels of their natural counterparts, particularly when used in sensitive
biological environments.

DES are generally considered safe and
biodegradable, making them
appealing for applications that prioritize environmental sustainability.
Their low toxicity and biodegradability, especially when derived from
naturally occurring components like choline chloride, make DES ideal
for applications in environmental monitoring or food safety. As interest
in their use in biomedical applications grows, further research is
needed to confirm their full biocompatibility across a wider range
of biological systems. This includes understanding how DES interact
with living cells and tissues over long periods, particularly for
biosensors that may need to function in more complex or reactive environments.

ILs, while tunable in terms of their biocompatibility, present
a more complex picture. The cation–anion combinations used
in IL formulations can significantly influence their safety and toxicity
profiles. Some ILs, particularly those based on imidazolium, have
been found to exhibit cytotoxicity, which can restrict their use in
medical or environmental biosensors. Moreover, ILs with long alkyl
chains in the cation further amplify toxic effects by interacting
strongly with biological membranes.,However,
other IL formulations, such as those based on phosphonium or pyridinium,
have been developed with improved biocompatibility, allowing them
to be used in biosensors designed for less invasive applications.
Despite this, the variability in IL formulations necessitates careful
selection to ensure that the material is safe for the intended use,
especially in cases where human or environmental exposure is likely.

In terms of performance in bioelectronics, each of these materials
offers unique advantages and limitations. Hydrogels are highly effective
for enzyme immobilization, creating a stable environment that preserves
enzyme activity while allowing analytes to diffuse through the matrix.
Their porous structure supports efficient enzyme–substrate
interactions, making hydrogels ideal for biosensors that operate in
aqueous environments. However, their
limited ionic conductivity poses a challenge in electrochemical biosensors,
where efficient electron transfer is necessary for signal generation.
This limitation can be mitigated by incorporating conductive materials,
such as nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes, into the hydrogel matrix,
though this increases complexity and cost.

DES are particularly
valuable for improving enzyme stability and
enhancing the overall. Their ionic nature contributes to improved
electrochemical properties, facilitating electron transfer and boosting
sensor performance. Additionally, DES offer significant eco-friendly
benefits, being biodegradable and derived from relatively inexpensive
and safe materials. These properties make DES a strong candidate for
biosensors used in environmental monitoring, where sustainability
and minimal environmental impact are key concerns. However, DES-based
biosensors, for example, in complex biological environments still
require further development to optimize their performance and stability
when exposed to more unpredictable variables, such as bodily fluids
or varying pH levels.

ILs excel in applications where enhanced
electron transfer is critical
for sensor performance. Their ionic nature allows for efficient movement
of electrons, making them ideal for electrochemical systems that require
high sensitivity and quick response times. ILs also offer long-term
stability, ensuring that dispositive remain functional over extended
periods without significant degradation of either the components or
the enzymes involved. However, their
high viscosity can impede the diffusion of analytes, limiting their
effectiveness in sensors that require rapid detection or in applications
where analytes are present at low concentrations. Additionally, concerns
about the toxicity of certain IL formulations persist, particularly
for biosensors designed for biomedical or environmental use, where
leakage or degradation could pose risks.

In comparing these
three materials, it becomes clear that hydrogels,
DES, and ILs each offer distinct benefits depending on the application.
Hydrogels are ideal for bioelectronics that require biocompatibility
and enzyme immobilization in aqueous environments, though they face
limitations in terms of ionic conductivity and sensitivity to environmental
changes. DES provide excellent enzyme stabilization and enhanced electrochemical
properties, making them a strong choice for eco-friendly dispositive,
though their use in complex biological systems remains underexplored.
ILs, with their outstanding electron transfer properties and a wide
electrochemical stability window, are highly effective in electrochemical
biosensors, though they are constrained by issues of viscosity and
potential toxicity in certain formulations.

The future of enzyme-based
bioelectronics may lie in the integration
of these materials to capitalize on their respective strengths while
mitigating their weaknesses. For instance,
hybrid systems that combine the biocompatibility and stability of
hydrogels with the enhanced electrochemical properties of DES or ILs
could provide a balanced solution for a wider range of applications.
Similarly, modifications to the chemical structure of DES or ILs could
improve their performance in biological environments, expanding their
utility in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial
processes.

The overall performance
of enzyme-based biosensors is not solely determinate by the intrinsic
properties of hydrogel, DES, and ILs, but also by their spatial arrangement
within the device. In this topic, we explore how the localization
of these materials – specifically, applying hydrogels directly
on the electrode versus incorporating DES and ILs within the electrolyte
– affects sensor efficiency and enzyme stability. Hydrogels
are typically deposited onto the electrode surface, where their high
water content and three-dimensional polymer network create a favorable
microenvironment for biomolecule immobilization. This direct contact
enhances enzyme stability by maintaining a biocompatible, hydrated
interface that mimics natural biological conditions. However, despite
their excellent ability to preserve enzyme activity, the low ionic
conductivity inherent to hydrogels can impede efficient charge transfer,
which is critical for generating a strong electrochemical signal.
In contrast, DES and ILs are often integrated into the electrolyte
rather than being fixed onto the electrode. Their tunable ionic conductivity
facilitates improved electron and ion transport throughout the sensor,
leading to faster response times and heightened sensitivity. Nonetheless,
when enzymes are dispersed within the electrode, the challenge shifts
to maintaining their structural integrity and long-term activity,
as the absence of a supportive immobilization matrix may render them
more vulnerable to denaturation.

A promising approach to overcome
these limitations is the development of hybrid systems that combine
the benefits of both configurations.−For instance, polymeric DES-based hydrogels (PODES) have demonstrated
enhanced enzyme stabilization and analyte diffusion, as seen in the
lab-on-a-bead biosensing platform, where alginate-based polymeric
DES were successfully used in colorimetric detection. Similarly, therapeutic DES-assisted hydrogels
have been developed for drug delivery, as demonstrated in the encapsulation
of curcumin in alginate-chitosan matrices, which improve biomolecule
stability and controlled release.

In addition to DES-based hybrid materials, IL-functionalized hydrogels
have also been explored for bioelectronics applications. IL-assisted
cellulose coating on chitosan hydrogel beads have shown promise as
drug carries, offering controlled release and stability. Moreover, Ureido-Ionic Liquid Mediated Conductive
Hydrogels (ULAS) have demonstrated superior mechanical adaptability,
enhance electron transfer, and microbial resistance.Figurea illustrates the ULAS hydrogel synthesis and its key electrochemical
properties. One of the key features of this hydrogel is its multifunctionality,
including self-healing, self-adhesion, and water retention properties
(Figureb) Notably,
its ionic conductivity was increased by a factor of 14.4, compared
to conventional hydrogel (Figurec), making it highly suitable for bioelectronic devices.
Furthermore, this material demonstrates a highly responsive and reversible
electrical signal under mechanical deformation, as shown in its strain-resistance
curve. Even after 3,000 stretching cycles, the hydrogel maintained
its performance (Figured), highlighting its stability for long-term applications in flexible
systems.

In conclusion, the choice between hydrogels, DES,
and ILs in enzyme-based
bioelectronics depends largely on the specific requirements of the
application. Each material offers unique advantages in terms of enzyme
stabilization, biocompatibility, and performance, though each also
presents certain challenges that must be addressed. As research in
this field continues, innovations in material science and biosensor
design will likely lead to new approaches that combine the best qualities
of these materials, resulting in more efficient, reliable, and versatile
biosensors for a broad array of applications.

Figureillustrates
the complementary roles of hydrogels, DES, and ILs in enzyme stabilization,
highlighting their individual advantages, challenges, and the intersections
where their properties converge to enhance biosensor performance.
Hydrogels, while highly valued for their biocompatibility and effective
enzyme immobilization, face a significant challenge in optimizing
ionic conductivity. The hydrophilic and porous nature of hydrogels
makes them ideal for maintaining enzyme activity in aqueous environments,
but this same property limits their ability to conduct ions effectively,
which is a critical factor in electrochemical bioelectronics. Since
many biosensors rely on the efficient transfer of electrons and ions
to generate detectable signals, the limited conductivity of hydrogels
can hinder their performance, particularly in electrochemical sensing
applications. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored
incorporating conductive materials, such as carbon nanotubes,,graphene,,or metal nanoparticles,,into hydrogel matrices. These materials can enhance the ionic and
electronic conductivity without compromising the structural integrity
or biocompatibility of the hydrogel. However, finding the right balance
between conductivity and biocompatibility remains a challenge. While
incorporating conductive additives can improve sensor performance,
it may also introduce complexity and potential toxicity, which could
reduce the overall safety of hydrogels for in vivo applications. Thus,
the opportunity for hydrogels lies in developing hybrid materials
that maintain their biocompatibility while significantly enhancing
their conductivity, allowing them to be used more broadly in biosensing
applications that require high sensitivity and electrochemical precision.

hydrogels, deep eutectic solvents (DES), and ionic liquids (ILs) in
enzyme-based biosensors.

DES have shown great promise due to their eco-friendly
properties,
excellent enzyme stabilization capabilities, and adaptability in harsh
conditions. However, one of the primary challenges facing DES is scalability.
While DES are typically composed of inexpensive and readily available
components, such as choline chloride and urea, producing them at a
scale suitable for industrial or widespread commercial applications
requires optimization of their formulation and manufacturing processes.
Inconsistent ratios of HBDs and HBAs or impurities can lead to variations
in the physical and chemical properties of DES, which could affect
the reproducibility and reliability of bioelectronics. Moreover, the
lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term stability of DES in
complex biological environments presents another challenge. While
DES have proven effective in stabilizing enzymes under controlled
laboratory conditions, their performance in real-world biological
systems, such as blood or tissue fluids, remains underexplored. The opportunity for DES lies in expanding their
use in more complex biological systems. By further researching the
interactions between DES and biological matrices, and by optimizing
their scalability, DES could be applied to a wider range of bioelectronics,
particularly in medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring.
Their biodegradability and low toxicity make them an attractive alternative
to conventional solvents and overcoming these scalability issues could
position DES as a leading material in sustainable biosensor technologies.

ILs are renowned for their outstanding electron transfer properties,
making them highly effective in electrochemical biosensors. However,
their high viscosity poses a significant challenge, particularly in
applications that require rapid analyte diffusion. The slow movement
of molecules within highly viscous ILs can reduce the response time
of device, making them less suitable for real-time or dynamic sensing
applications. Another major challenge for ILs is toxicity, as certain
cation–anion combinations can be harmful to living organisms
or the environment. ILs with long hydrophobic alkyl chains tend to
exhibit higher toxicity, primarily due to their enhanced interactions
with biological membranes and increased disruption of cellular structures. Despite these challenges, the tunability of
ILs presents a significant opportunity. By altering the cation–anion
pair, researchers can modify the physical and chemical properties
of ILs, potentially reducing viscosity and minimizing toxicity. The
development of biocompatible and low-viscosity ILs would open new
avenues for their application in bioelectronics particularly in fields
like medical diagnostics and wearable biosensing devices. Furthermore,
continued innovation in IL synthesis could lead to new formulations
that maintain their high electrochemical performance while being safer
for use in biological and environmental systems. Reducing viscosity
and addressing toxicity concerns are key to improving the widespread
application of ILs in enzyme-based bioelectronics, particularly in
large-scale commercial and industrial applications.

Hydrogels are highly effective
for enzyme immobilization due to
their high-water content and biocompatibility, creating a hydrated
environment that preserves enzyme activity while allowing analytes
to diffuse through the matrix. This makes them particularly suitable
for biomimetic devices in medical and biological applications where
direct interaction with tissues or fluids is necessary. However, their
limited ionic conductivity and sensitivity to environmental changes,
such as pH and temperature fluctuations, restrict their use in electrochemical
biosensors that rely on efficient electron transfer. Despite this,
hydrogels remain an excellent choice for applications where biocompatibility
and long-term stability are priorities, especially in wearable or
implantable bioelectronics.

DES stand out for their ability
to stabilize enzymes in harsh environments,
such as high temperatures or in the presence of organic solvents,
making them valuable in industrial applications where robust bioelectronics
performance is required. The ionic nature of DES enhances electrochemical
properties, enabling better electron transfer and improved sensor
sensitivity. Additionally, their biodegradable and eco-friendly composition
aligns well with the growing demand for sustainable technologies.
However, DES are still underutilized in complex biological systems,
and scalability challenges remain a barrier to their broader application.
With further research, DES hold the potential to be widely adopted
in environmental, food safety, and medical diagnostics.

ILs
offer superior electron transfer capabilities and long-term
stability, making them a natural fit for electrochemical bioeletronics
that require fast response times and high sensitivity. The tunability
of ILs allows for the adjustment of their viscosity, conductivity,
and hydrophobicity to suit specific applications. However, high viscosity
in some ILs can slow down analyte diffusion, and the potential toxicity
of certain formulations limits their use in biomedical or environmentally
sensitive applications. Innovations in IL synthesis could lead to
safer, more versatile ILs that maintain their excellent electrochemical
properties while minimizing these drawbacks.

Looking ahead,
hydrogels, DES, and ILs will continue to shape the
future of bioelectronic technology as research addresses their current
limitations and explores new avenues for their application. For hydrogels,
the focus will be on enhancing ionic conductivity without sacrificing
their biocompatibility. This could involve the development of hybrid
materials that incorporate conductive nanoparticles, carbon-based
materials or even the integration between hydrogel, DES and ILs. For
DES, overcoming scalability issues and expanding their use in biological
systems will be crucial for their wider adoption. With their strong
performance in enzyme stabilization and their eco-friendly nature,
DES are poised to become a key material in sustainable biosensing
technologies. Research into how DES interact with complex biological
matrices, such as blood or tissue, will help unlock their full potential
in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial biosensing
applications. ILs are expected to see advances in reducing viscosity
and improving biocompatibility, which will allow for their broader
use in enzyme-based bioelectronics, particularly in medical and wearable
applications. The continued development of new IL formulations that
maintain high electron transfer rates while being safer and more adaptable
for biological use will open new opportunities in real-time monitoring,
point-of-care diagnostics, and industrial sensor systems. By addressing
concerns about toxicity and optimizing their performance in large-scale
applications, ILs could lead to more efficient and precise biosensing
technologies across a wide range of fields.

In summary, hydrogels,
DES, and ILs each offer unique advantages
that can enhance the performance of enzyme-based biodevices, and continued
research will enable their broader use in future technologies. As
these materials evolve, they will provide new opportunities for creating
more reliable, sensitive, and sustainable devices, expanding the possibilities
for real-time diagnostics, environmental monitoring, electrosynthesis,
and advanced industrial applications.
