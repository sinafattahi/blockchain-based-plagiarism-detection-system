To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of intraoperative ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBM)-guided direct cyclopexy for treating traumatic cyclodialysis clefts.

Intraoperative UBM-guided direct cyclopexy was performed on a total of four eyes. Prior to the conjunctival incision, UBM evaluation was facilitated with a self-designed eye cup. Scleral flaps were generated according to their respective locations. Before the scleral flaps and conjunctiva were closed, UBM was used to promptly assess the repositioning status.

1.UBM-guided direct cyclopexies were performed on four male patients (mean age: 39.7 years). In all instances, the cyclodialysis cleft resulted from blunt ocular trauma, with an average time interval between injury and surgical treatment of 29.5 days. 2. A simple cyclodialysis cleft was observed in two patients. One patient had retinal detachment and subluxation of the lens, and one presented with a shallow anterior chamber, iridodialysis, cataract, vitreous hemorrhage, papilledema, and hypotony maculopathy. 3. Prior to surgery, the mean IOP in all four patients was 7 mmHg (range: 6–9 mmHg), which increased to an average of 16.5 mmHg on postsurgical day three (range: 11–22 mmHg). 4. UBM examination confirmed successful closure of the cleft in all patients.

During the procedure, UBM-guided direct cyclopexies can accurately assess cyclodialysis cleft repair without being affected by the optical clarity of the refractive media. Preliminary findings demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

A cyclodialysis cleft forms when the meridional ciliary muscle fibers at the scleral spur are disrupted, creating an abnormal secondary pathway for aqueous humor drainage into the suprachoroidal space. This condition results in persistent ocular hypotony and associated complications [1]. Blunt trauma is the most common cause, whereas iatrogenic origins are often identified in cases of unexplained hypotony following intraocular surgeries such as glaucoma surgery [2], phacoemulsification [3], and scleral IOL fixation [4]. Patients may experience varying degrees of vision loss due to a range of ocular conditions stemming from persistent or extremely low intraocular pressure (< 5 mmHg), including corneal edema, cataracts, optic disc edema, retinal edema, hypotony maculopathy, choroidal edema, and refractive changes such as hyperopia or myopia. Delayed treatment can lead to irreversible visual damage or loss [5].

The primary management objectives are to reposition the detached ciliary body on the sclera and prevent the development of serious complications, thereby restoring intraocular pressure (IOP). A cyclodialysis cleft is managed through a combination of conservative measures and surgical intervention. Initially, conservative treatment is preferred if patients are asymptomatic or if complications are self-limiting owing to a narrow cleft. However, for larger clefts or more severe hypotony, surgical intervention may be necessary. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly assess the extent and location of the cleft in cases of a cyclodialysis cleft.

The goal of reduction surgery for traumatic dialysis of cyliary body is to minimize complications and accomplish precision suturing. During the procedure, supplementary tools might be utilized to get closer to this objective.Accurately measuring the depth of dissociation is challenging due to the gonioscope’s two-dimensional imaging and lack of tomographic information, despite its simpler operation.Anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) employs high-resolution tomography to increase suture accuracy, but because of its shallow penetration depth, it might not be able to show the end of the detachment in cases of deep scleral or combined ciliary body detachment.Additionally, the imaging quality deteriorates in cases of severe refractive interstitial opacity. ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBM) is not influenced by refractive media and remains crucial for deep anatomical localization. It demonstrates efficacy in managing complex, trauma-induced large-scale cyclodialysis clefts. Furthermore, similar surgical approaches have been reported [6].In light of the aforementioned benefits of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), this study presents four cases of ocular trauma-induced cyclodialysis clefts and evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing intraoperative UBM in cyclodialysis clefts management. This offers case studies to support the method’s use.

This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Board of the Third Medical Center of PLA General Hospital(Reference Number: KY2024-032).Written informed consent for the surgery and to publish this case series were obtained from every patient described in this article.

All patients underwent a comprehensive examination, which included assessments of best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp microscopy, fundoscopy, and UBM.

All surgical procedures were executed by a single experienced surgeon, with the assistance of a seasoned ophthalmic technician.

Prior to the surgical procedure, a second UBM examination was conducted to determine the extent of the intervention. Under the guidance of UBM imaging, as shown in Fig.1, a peritomy was performed, and a thick lamellar limbus-based scleral flap was prepared in the region of the cleft, extending 3 mm posteriorly. An incision was then made in the remaining sclera overlying and exceeding the cleft by approximately 2 mm, positioned 1.5 mm posterior to the scleral spur. At this point, there was leakage of aqueous humor from the wound and clear visibility of the cyclodialysis cleft. Using interrupted nylon sutures (10 − 0), reattachment of the ciliary muscle to the scleral spur was achieved under direct visual control, with suture spacing of approximately 0.5 mm. This involved passing a needle through the anterior sclera posterior to the trabecular meshwork, then through the posterior scleral lip once more while avoiding the iris root, and finally through the ciliary muscle. To ensure the correct positioning of the ciliary body, another UBM examination was carried out prior to the closure of both the scleral flap and the conjunctiva. The intraoperative UBM images are presented in Fig.2.

As illustrated in Fig.3, we designed a custom eye cup to prevent immediate submersion of the eyeball in water during the procedure, thereby mitigating the risk of infection. The probe length of the UBM device was 2.3 cm. To ensure unobstructed operation during the procedures, the height of the eye cup was set to approximately 3 cm. Further details and parameters are provided in the accompanying illustration.

The patients received treatment with Atropine Sulfate Eye Gel, Tobradex eyedrops, and eye ointment. Visual acuity, slit-lamp microscopy, and IOP were assessed daily for three days postsurgery. A UBM examination was conducted one week after the surgery.

UBM-guided direct cyclopexies were performed on four male patients (mean age: 39.75 years; age range: 22–48 years) between October 2023 and June 2024.

Cyclodialysis was exclusively attributed to blunt ocular trauma, and the corresponding for patients 1–4 are presented in Table1. The average interval between the traumatic event and the cyclopexy procedure was 74.75 days, with a range of 10 to 191 days.

In the UBM examination, the mean extent of the clefts was measured at 3.25 clock hours. Two patients had cyclodialysis clefts as shown in Table1, the extents of which were 4 and 3.5 clock hours in Patients 1 and 2, respectively. Patient 3 presented with concomitant retinal detachment and subluxation of the lens, accompanied by a cleft measuring 1 clock hour. Furthermore, Patient 4 presented with a complex condition characterized by a cleft spanning 4.5 clock hours, accompanied by signs of a shallow anterior chamber, iridodialysis, cortical lens opacification, vitreous hemorrhage, papilledema, and hypotony maculopathy.

The preoperative best corrected visual acuity was less than 0.05 in Patients 3 and 4 but was 0.5 and 0.6 in the other patients who all had isolated cyclodialysis clefts. The preoperative mean IOP was 7 mmHg (range: 6–9 mmHg).

Every patient successfully underwent surgery without significant complications, such as postoperative infections. On the first day postsurgery, all four patients had ocular hypertension, as Table2shows, with an average measurement of 38.5 mmHg (ranging from 21 to 57 mmHg). Except for Patient 1, whose IOP peaked on the day after surgery, the IOPs of the remaining patients gradually decreased starting on the second postoperative day. UBM analysis revealed excellent closure of the ciliary crevices in all patients one week after surgery.

Patient 1 and Patient 2 presented with isolated ciliary body dissociation. Patient 1 initially underwent pharmacological management for six months. However, as conservative management failed to improve the patient’s IOP and visual acuity, surgical intervention was performed. Patient 2 received direct surgical treatment 18 days post-injury. Postoperatively, both the visual acuity and IOP of the two patients improved.

Patient 3 presented with retinal detachment and partial lens dislocation. During the surgical procedure, both retinal reattachment and phacoemulsification were performed, followed by silicone oil filling. On the first day after surgery, the IOP was 41 mmHg and was managed with mannitol and brinzolamide-timolol eye drops. Fortunately, the IOP returned to normal on the second day following surgery. After six months, the silicone oil was successfully removed, and an intraocular lens was implanted. As a result of these interventions, there was significant improvement in the best-corrected visual acuity, from 0.01 to 0.12.

For Patient 4, who presented with hypotony maculopathy preoperatively, we conducted direct cyclopexy and iridodialysis repair. On the first postoperative day, the patient experienced a significant elevation in IOP to 57 mmHg. Immediate management included anterior chamber paracentesis, mannitol administration, and topical dorzolamide eye drops. By the second postoperative day, the IOP had normalized. However, one week after surgery, despite an IOP of 7 mmHg, there was no substantial improvement in disc edema or hypotonic macular changes. The best-corrected visual acuity remained unchanged from the preoperative level.

The occurrence of a cyclodialysis cleft in clinical settings is infrequent; however, most cases are complex because of the separation between the ciliary body and the scleral spur. This separation leads to increased uveoscleral outflow through the suprachoroidal space and a reduction in aqueous production due to a compromised blood supply to the ciliary body [7]. Persistent ocular hypotony can result in impaired vision, and the treatment objective is to restore ciliary body activity. Direct cyclopexy, initially proposed by Vannas and Bjorkenheim in 1952 [8], is a classic and effective surgical approach for managing refractory or large cyclodialysis clefts, with favorable intraocular pressure control and visual outcomes. However, visual acuity may be reduced in eyes subjected to traumatic cyclodialysis due to various posttraumatic changes, such as cataract formation, choroidal rupture, or maculopathy, which can also impact postoperative vision. Depending on the presence of additional eye damage apart from the cyclodialysis cleft, other surgical procedures, such as cataract extraction, intraocular lens implantation, keratoplasty, or scleral buckling, may be performed concurrently. In our study cohort of four eyes, two suffered from further ocular injury. Although one eye exhibited minor vitreous hemorrhagic opacities that did not significantly interfere with the preoperative fundus examination, vitreous surgery was deferred, with subsequent observation of bleeding absorption during follow-up.

The primary factor contributing to the wide variation in the success rate of cyclodialysis surgery, regardless of the surgical technique used, is the procedure itself. For example, errors such as incorrect identification of anatomical structures, mistaking blood clots for the ciliary body, excessive spacing between stitches, misjudgment of the separation range, and improper positioning of the scleral flap are common issues [1,9]. Precise patient positioning is critical during direct cyclopexy, as any errors may result in the failure to reattach the ciliary body to the sclera, the inability to restore normal intraocular pressure (IOP), and potential complications in the anterior chamber. Considering these concerns, we devised a strategy to improve reattachment success rates by using auxiliary examinations to accurately identify the separation location and verify suture outcomes. Currently, gonioscopy, ultrasonic biomicroscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), and magnetic resonance imaging are used to investigate the cyclodialysis cleft [10–12]. Gonioscopically guided repair is widely employed to address the cyclodialysis cleft [13–15]. However, owing to the softness and frequent shallowness of the anterior chamber or unclear refracting media, such as corneal edema and hyphema, performing this type of repair is nearly impossible [16].

UBM, a type of high-frequency sonography, is capable of generating clear images of the anterior segment, is unaffected by factors such as refractive media or IOP, and is a widely used diagnostic tool for cyclodialysis clefts [17]. This technique overcomes the limitations of gonioscopy and AS-OCT examination. In Previous studies have supported UBM as the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring individuals with cyclodialysis clefts [18,19]. Moreover, there have been studies in which UBM was reported to be useful for preoperative evaluations and even real-time surgical guidance [20,21].

UBM provides highly detailed anatomical information, aiding in the precise localization and determination of cleft dimensions, and allows for the creation of a scleral flap on the basis of its location. Additionally, before the scleral flap and conjunctiva are closed, any decrease in attachment can be immediately detected using UBM. This approach effectively addresses the issue of poor reattachment caused by “blind” manipulation of delicate iris and chamber angle structures while also reducing the likelihood that larger clefts may require multiple surgical interventions. Sharon Braudo et al. successfully employed UBM during the surgical procedure to manage a case of extensive ciliary body detachment [6,22,23]. Following the surgical procedure, UBM evaluation revealed complete restoration of the ciliary body and a reduction in IOP in all four eyes. One week postsurgery, reexamination revealed low IOP in Patient 4, with no evidence of cleft dehiscence during UBM examination. This outcome was attributed to persistent impairment of the secretory function of the ciliary body. The IOP of the remaining patients was within the normal range.

The risk of infection associated with the use of UBM during surgery must be considered. The eye cup(Patent No.CN203799108U), a unique contribution of our study, enables the intraoperative use of UBM without compromising imaging quality by minimizing the pressure placed on the eyeball by water weight.The utilization of the eye cup offers support for the intraoperative application of UBM. However, fabricating the eye cup during each procedure requires a certain amount of time, thereby extending the duration of the operation to some extent. If the eye cup were pre-manufactured as a complete ready-to-use product, it would enhance the convenience of intraoperative procedures.One of the things we’ll be working on next is this as well.

In this study, the diagnosis, surgical intervention, and postoperative management of traumatic cyclodialysis clefts are systematically elucidated. On the basis of the postoperative follow-up data, the integration of UBM imaging with individually tailored surgical techniques plays a pivotal role in effectively closing fissures and optimizing visual acuity outcomes. Moving forward, we plan to conduct more in-depth research and disseminate additional findings to obtain innovative insights into treatment strategies for this condition.
