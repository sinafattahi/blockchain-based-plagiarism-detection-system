This article examines how vulnerability emerged, evolved and was contested during Austria's COVID‐19 response, by attending to the entangled realities of people with dis/abilities. Using a posthumanist, agential realist lens and a diffractive methodology, the research explores how vulnerability is not a fixed state but a dynamic process shaped by material and discursive practices. It introduces the concept of ‘vulnerability effects’ to articulate that vulnerabilities are simultaneously a product of and a catalyst for material and discursive practices within systems of dis/ability and crisis response. Drawing on Carol Thomas’s distinction between disablism and impairment effects, the analysis moves beyond binary framings to capture how vulnerabilities are simultaneously produced by systemic inequalities and contested through creative acts of resistance. Through the narratives of participants navigating institutional restrictions, inaccessible environments and intersecting crises, the article illustrates how debilitating conditions and activist affordances intra‐act, shaping the possibilities for agency and resilience. The findings reveal the fluid, context‐dependent and performative nature of vulnerability, challenging static paradigms in crisis response. By reframing vulnerability as relational and emergent, the article calls for inclusive and response‐able approaches to policy and social structures that address systemic neglect and promote equitable opportunities.

The COVID‐19 pandemic altered daily life for individuals worldwide (OHCHR2020). As public health measures were dismantled, their visible traces—such as empty disinfection dispensers—became reminders of a crisis consigned to history. This retreat into collective amnesia, evident in social, political and media discourses, undermines the opportunity to critically engage with the structural inequalities and systemic neglect that the pandemic exposed.

Our research documents and analyses the impact of COVID‐19 on people with dis/abilities1and complex mental health conditions.Cov_enable—a collaborative project realised byThe Bertha von Suttner Private University and the University of Viennafrom May 2021 to April 2025—employs a participatory, qualitative and longitudinal approach to observe how conceptions of vulnerability are reshaped and travel between the macrolevel forces of neoliberal capitalist structures that shape societal understandings of dis/ability, the mesolevel institutional practices that mediate access to self‐determined supports and the microlevel lifeworlds in which individuals adapt, resist or innovate.

In this article, we aim to critically examine the evolving nature of vulnerability during the pandemic through a posthumanist lens, inspired by Barad's (2007) agential realism. We will do so by introducing the emergent narrative ofvulnerability effects, a conceptual framework that captures how vulnerabilities are simultaneously a product of and a catalyst for material and discursive practices within systems of dis/ability and crisis response. By adopting vulnerability as an analytical lens, we tracenot what vulnerability is but what vulnerability does and how it comes into being.

By engaging with three narratives2of research participants, we highlight the relational and fluid nature of vulnerability. Through this lens, we aim to challenge dominant crisis paradigms, calling for response‐able approaches that are both just and transformative (Tronto2023) while deepening theoretical engagements within critical posthumanist disability studies (Goodley et al.2021) and offering insights to reimagine inclusive crisis responses.

This article opens by contextualising Austria's fluctuating crisis responses. Although the COVID‐19 pandemic is often framed as a moment of exceptionality, such a view risks obscuring the structural conditions and historical patterns that have long influenced constructions and responses to vulnerability. Hence, we consider vulnerability as a travelling concept, reflecting its evolving meanings during the pandemic within broader sociohistorical contexts.

We then introduce a posthumanist, agential realist perspective, focusing on how the concepts of entanglements and intra‐activity enrich our understanding of vulnerability. Next, we detail the diffractive research methodology applied in this study.

At the heart of the article, we reread three participant narratives, each offering a perspective on the variety of institutional contexts, material conditions and personal activism shaping the lives of adults with dis/abilities. Finally, we outline the emergent narrative ofvulnerability effectsfor understanding vulnerability as a dynamic interplay between material and discursive practices. Our analysis disentangles the ways in which these dimensions co‐constitute, sustain and transform the experience of vulnerability in crisis contexts.

In Austria, the government’s initial response to COVID‐19 identified ‘vulnerable groups’—including individuals with pre‐existing health conditions, impairments, mental illnesses and older adults (BMSGPK2020)—as a primary focus of protective measures. However, this categorisation resulted in significant disparities in the implementation of restrictions. Although the general population experienced mobility constraints for only a few weeks, individuals in institutional care endured prolonged confinement, including months‐long visitation bans and curfews (Volksanwaltschaft2020; Koenig and Barberi2023).

Simultaneously, essential COVID‐19 protective measures—such as tests, masks and personal protective equipment—were frequently inaccessible to persons with dis/abilities living independently. Only through the concerted efforts of members of the independent living movement were the particular needs of persons supported by personal assistance schemes recognised and subsequently considered in the implementation of emergency measures and supply strategies (Monitoringausschuss2021).

The initial phase of the pandemic in Austria was dominated by a discourse of fear, exemplified by former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's assertion: ‘We will soon face the situation in Austria where everyone knows someone who has died from Corona’ (Czejkowska and Froebus2021, 96). This narrative served to justify restrictive measures by invoking collective solidarity and responsibility. However, as the pandemic progressed, the political emphasis shifted from the protection of ‘vulnerable groups’ to the broader goal of preserving population‐wide healthcare systems.

Austria became the first European country to implement a national COVID‐19 vaccine mandate. Announced in November 2021, the mandate required vaccination for everyone over the age of 18, with penalties for noncompliance (Druml and Czech2022). This policy marked a historic shift and provoked significant social opposition as debates over the mandate became increasingly polarised.

By summer 2022, Austria had significantly relaxed its protective measures, abolishing the vaccine mandate and gradually lifting all mask‐wearing requirements (Parliament, 7 July2022). Those identified as ‘worthy of protection’ were increasingly left without any safeguards and accommodations.

Austria’s pandemic response exemplifies a fluctuating focus on dis/abled individuals, oscillating between moments of recognition and extended periods of neglect (Naue and Flieger2022). Political and institutional attention disproportionately centred on individuals in institutional care settings, overlooking independent living arrangements. Stereotypical portrayals of people with dis/abilities as dependent and pitiable in both political and media discourses during COVID‐19 (de Ruiter, Dekking et al.2023) contributed to the reinforcement of paternalistic practices and the legitimisation of restrictive institutional measures.

In the midst of these dynamics, vulnerability emerges as a relational and ongoing process shaped by inequalities, material reality and discourse. The next chapter explores these intersections, situating the pandemic within a continuum of historical and social processes.

Vulnerability, as a concept, has travelled through different terrains of understanding and application, shaped by historically contingent and socially embedded conditions. In its earliest usages, vulnerability was tied to individual susceptibility to harm, particularly in medical or military contexts where the focus lay on securing the body against threats (ten Have2016). During the 1980s and 1990s, vulnerability began to be framed within broader structural and social dimensions. Responses to HIV/AIDS and environmental crises revealed how societal inequalities, stigma and exclusion intersected with individual experiences of harm (Higgins et al.2010; Brown2011). These shifts reflected an increasing recognition that vulnerability is not merely an inherent condition of certain individuals but a socially and politically mediated phenomenon.

The COVID‐19 crisis yielded a research field where vulnerability concepts have been applied in various manners. This often entailed an essentialising focus on individual medical vulnerability, with less emphasis on the exploration of structural dimensions (Bambra et al.2021; Phillips2021; The Lancet2020).

The binary framing of vulnerability as individual fragility or a product of precarious systemic inequalities often rests on the dichotomy of ‘capacity‐endowed’ and ‘debility‐laden bodies’ (Puar2009, 169). Puar's (2020) work disrupts this binary by introducing debility, thus shifting the focus from the capacities of dis/abled bodies to the historically contingent and politically charged systems that produce and sustain able‐bodiedness. Debilitation is not a static condition but a process embedded in the relational assemblages of legal frameworks, infrastructural adaptations and sociopolitical norms. So too, capacitation emerges as a regulated and extractive relation. This perspective exposes how it is often systemic neglect, rather than overt violence, that operates as a mechanism of governance, actively producing vulnerability.

During the pandemic, these dynamics were especially evident in institutional care settings where confinement and isolation were implemented under the guise of protection (de Ruiter, Niemeijer, et al.2023). The Disability Covid Chronicles project (Mills et al.2025), a 3‐year research project and collated online archive, provides insights into these intersections, documenting experiences of amplified risks and systemic neglect among dis/abled individuals. Among this assemblage, Michele Sommerstein's blog (Sommerstein,n.d.) provides reflections on the inaccessibility of healthcare resources and structural discrimination that contributed to disproportionate outcomes. Yet, these accounts showcase not only the harms faced by dis/abled individuals but also highlight their creative responses, mutual aid and activism networks. Initiatives such as the ‘Mask Up’ campaign, where activists distributed protective gear at public transit hubs, embody the collective efforts to address the systemic neglect dis/abled communities faced.

Dokumacı (2023) offers a lens to understand these acts of resistance through the concept of activist affordances—the microperformances by which dis/abled individuals navigate and transform hostile environments. These ‘tiny everyday artful battles’ (6) reconfigure spaces of exclusion into opportunities for more liveable worlds. Through such engagements, dis/abled individuals craft unique worlds of expressivity and legibility, not as a result of systemic support but as acts of accommodation arising despite systemic impediments.

As Tronto (2023) argues, responses to crises such as COVID‐19 are deeply entangled with ethical and political considerations. Vulnerability arises in the spaces where structural inequalities, epistemic injustices and material conditions intersect (Mladenov and Dimitrova2023), shaping both the possibilities for agency and the constraints imposed by societal systems.

The COVID‐19 pandemic, far from an isolated crisis, serves as a lens through which to examine vulnerability as a relational and performative concept. Posthumanism and agential realism offer a framework for further exploring these material‐discursive entanglements, emphasising intra‐action as central to understanding the systemic workings of dis/ability and crisis response.

Posthumanism offers a transformative perspective for rethinking the concept of vulnerability by challenging anthropocentric assumptions that have historically shaped academic and policy discourses. Emerging in the early 1990s, posthumanism has evolved into an intellectual framework for understanding the relational nature of material and social realities (Herbrechter et al.2022). It departs from traditional humanist paradigms by rejecting the notion of humans as distinct and superior entities, advocating instead for a relational ontology that recognises the interdependence of human and more‐than‐human agencies (Braidotti2019).

Within critical disability studies, posthumanism has become an important lens for interrogating the interplay of technological, ecological and social forces that impact human bodies. Goodley et al. (2021) argue that posthumanism allows for a nuanced examination of the interplay between human beings, who are increasingly empowered through technological advancements yet simultaneously more vulnerable due to ecological impacts. They suggest that posthumanism in disability studies not only questions traditional dichotomies—such as those between humans and machines—but also promotes a more constructive and imaginative engagement with these entities (Goodley et al.2021, 31).

Karen Barad’s agential realism, influenced by Niels Bohr’s philosophy of quantum mechanics, deepens this perspective by offering the premise that the epistemological, the ontological and the ethical are intertwined, making it impossible to separate them. Central to agential realism are the concepts of intra‐action and entanglement. With her concept of intra‐action, Barad (2007) reassesses the role of matter as dynamic and variable, rather than static and unchanging. Agency is not an inherent property of subjects or objects but is understood as the ‘mutual constitution of entangled agencies’ (33). This redefinition contrasts with the concept of interaction, where entities are seen as pre‐existing independently. Instead, in an intra‐active framework, entities emerge and continually materialise through their entanglements with humans, nonhumans or the environment (Barad2007). This shift encourages a view of the world as inherently composed of interdependent phenomena.

Barad's notion of entanglement further redefines the material‐discursive relationship, rejecting the binary separation of the material (nonhuman, reality) and the discursive (human, social). Instead, entanglements reflect irreducible relations of responsibility and obligation, where the boundaries of ‘self’ and ‘other’ are continually reconfigured through intra‐action (Barad2014).

Vulnerability is not an inherent or static condition but results from dynamic intra‐actions shaped by systems of power and knowledge. Barad (2007) emphasises boundary‐making practices ‘formative of matter and meaning, productive of and part of the phenomena produced’ (148). Theseapparatusesdelineate inclusion and exclusion, defining what matters within particular intra‐actions. The COVID‐19 pandemic has highlighted how vulnerability is materialised through these processes, revealing ‘able‐bodiedness’ not as a natural state but as a specific embodiment ‘co‐constituted through the boundary‐making practices that distinguish “able‐bodied” from “disabled”’ (Barad2007, 158).

Posthumanism and agential realism shift the focus from individual characteristics to systemic forces, positioning vulnerability as a dynamic phenomenon shaped by entangled intra‐actions and boundary‐making practices. They highlight the sociopolitical and socioeconomic conditions that produce vulnerability and urge a critical rethinking of inclusion and exclusion as co‐constituted and relational.

Our research and methodology did not follow a linear progression. Instead, it unfolded within the entangled realities of conducting research under the conditions of COVID‐19, demanding that we adapt both our conceptual frameworks and practical research approaches to the evolving material and social realities (Nind et al.2023). The pandemic shaped not just the subject of our research—vulnerability—but also the processes of knowledge production. For example, the first series of interviews had to be planned as remote conversations, mediated by unstable digital infrastructures and shaped by participants' varying levels of access and comfort with technology. Producing diary entries—a research strategy we adopted—was similarly shaped by material conditions, such as the availability of quiet spaces during lockdowns, the emotional weight of isolation and the affordances of the devices provided. In our project, we adopted a two‐stream research approach to capture both structural dynamics and individual experiences of vulnerability.

The first stream aimed to uncover emerging discourses surrounding vulnerability and the material practices evolving within institutional responses. We monitored policies linked to COVID‐19 and analysed media representations through datasets from national television (public broadcasting) and newspapers. In parallel, we conducted interviews and group discussions with stakeholders, including leaders of crisis management boards and representatives of organisations.

Our project adhered to rigorous ethical standards; however, due to its nonclinical nature, no formal ethical approval was required through its funding agency. Nonetheless, the project implemented a multistage informed consent process to accommodate the diverse needs of participants, including accessible communication formats and options for partial or complete withdrawal of consent at any stage of the research. In framing our ethical approach, we distinguished between ethical requirements and ethical responsibilities (Anderson and Muñoz Proto2016). Ethical requirements included adherence to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), encompassing measures to ensure data confidentiality and security. Ethical responsibilities reflected the project’s epistemological and normative commitments to participatory research. Recognising the potential for exclusion and marginalisation in research processes, the project prioritised principles of voice, empowerment and self‐representation to ensure that participants could meaningfully shape their engagement.

Data generation began with semistructured interviews (Gibson et al.2013) in mid‐2021. Participants who opted in engaged in personal diary entries (Bates2020) for a period spanning from 6 months to a year. These participants received personal tablets for submitting their entries, giving them a choice on whether to produce their diaries as videos, audios or written texts. Follow‐up interviews were scheduled based on preliminary analyses, which were then discussed and refined in collaboration with the participants. In total, we conducted 60 interviews involving 34 individuals. Among them, 12 participants submitted about 100 diary entries.

Engaged in diligent attempts to code, categorise and draw out lines of connection between the data, we frequently encountered what felt asdead ends. The ‘apparatus of knowing’ (Barad2007) we had established seemed to restrict our understanding and ability to capture the dynamism unfolding in our engagements with research participants. A sense of frustration permeated our team as it felt that the practices of knowing we were employing only mirrored back to us our pre‐existing understandings of vulnerability (Mazzei2014).

It was rather by chance that we stumbled upon a text about posthumanist diffractive methodologies for dis/ability studies (Naraian and Gabel2023). In this text, Naraian and Gabel (2023) engage with an experience‐driven engagement of postqualitative research methodologies and discuss these methodologies for their ability to engage with the complexities of disabled experiences and explore the underlying power dynamics and material conditions.

Central to the reshaping of our methodical approach became the concept ofdiffraction. Originating from an optical phenomenon, this term has been adopted by Haraway (1997) and Barad (2014) to signify a methodological shift in knowledge practices. Diffraction, in its physical sense, refers to the meeting and deflection of waves by an obstacle, leading to interference and the creation of new patterns. In contrast to reflection, which reproduces mirroring or sameness, a diffractive approach to analysis implies not viewing difference as either an inherent essence or something inconsequential but as relational and dynamic. As Haraway (Haraway1999, 320) notes, “a diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear but rather maps where theeffectsof differences appear.” Barad (2007, 72) builds on this, refining diffraction as an analytical tool for understanding and responding to theeffects of difference.

Moving on from our initial coding and categorisation, we began to incorporate Clarke’s (2005) situational analysis, particularly the posthumanist elements elaborated in later versions (Clarke et al.2018,2022). By incorporating Barad’s concepts of entanglement and intra‐action (Barad2007), we embraced the possibilities of diffractive analysis to explore vulnerability not as interactions of separate entities but as entanglements of diverse intra‐actional agentic forces (Schwertel2023). Just as vulnerability must be understood as aconcept in motion, the notion of travelling concepts, experiences and sense‐making highlights the fluidity and situatedness of knowledge—an essential principle in situational analysis (Clarke et al.2018, 42) and diffractive methodology (Fox and Alldred2023).

Mapping, both as a physical and cognitive tool, played a critical role in our analysis. Early working versions foregrounded participants’ embeddedness in institutions, discourses and practices. As the research team deepened its engagement with diffractive analysis, the maps became more fluid, illustrating the cascading effects of policy changes on participants' daily lives and showing how intra‐acting elements materialised differently across diverse sociomaterial contexts (Figure1).

Diffractive mapping Elisabeth, working version 27.04.2024.

Flip charts and other tools were used to work with these maps during analysis sessions. More than representational tools, these evolving maps functioned as analytic devices, making visible shifting entanglements, tensions and the recursive effects of systemic responses.

Although the pandemic created changes in the lived material realities of people globally, within the lives of people with dis/abilities whom we accompanied during the research, we began to notice the workings of a distinct layer ofdifference within the differenceof the pandemic, which we have coined asvulnerability effects.

Doing diffractive analysis meant reading and rereading our data and rearranging our maps through and with (multiple) theoretical concepts, especially material‐discursive entanglements and intra‐action (Barad2007), activist affordances (Dokumacı2023) and debilitation (Puar2020). This allowed us to trace how the effects of policies (e.g., lockdown measures) were unevenly materialised in participants’ lives.

The following diffractive readings are an attempt to generate meaning by capturing the complex realities and experiences of our research participants. The selection of the three reread narratives presented here reflects the purposive sampling strategy established at the outset of the project, each of which highlights the relational interplay of structural, material and discursive forces that continually shape the living and support conditions of adults with dis/abilities.

John, a man in his thirties, identifies as a person living with a psychiatric impairment. Across four interviews and seven audio diaries between June 2021 and July 2022, he shared how his life evolved amid the pandemic’s disruptions. John lives in a semi‐supported living arrangement, supplemented by family support, and spends his days at a sheltered workshop. After the workshop, he heads back home to his apartment where he interacts with his family, walks his dog and engages in recreational engagements, such as video gaming.

John's story was selected for this analysis because it reveals the complex relational entanglements of various forces, including social context, psychiatric symptoms and the social and material infrastructure shaping his evolving mental health within community‐based psychiatric support systems.

The hallucinations inflict pain on me. […] They are always present, even at this moment, they arealwayspresent. At the moment they’re very quiet (.) they just sit there and watch us, it’s intense, yes.

So, a typical day. I get up at six thirty, take my stomach acid tablet, because after all I have nine medications in total, then I have breakfast, take my medication, the standard medication […] And then I take my evening medication, go to sleep, get everything ready for the next day, so that I only have to get up, get dressed, take my medication, eat and leave.

Now, thank God, I can already carry my laundry down to the cellar, then into the washing machine, the detergent, the fabric softener and then switch it on. My mother was so kind […] to mark exactly what I need for my laundry with a smiley and now I know, ok, turn the smiley, press start and then my laundry will be washed.

These practical adaptations reflect a broader sociomaterial engagement where John’s personal agency, the materiality of his environment and the emotional and practical support of his family collectively contribute to his evolving sense of self‐sufficiency.

Living alone and being mentally ill, I mean, I mean, there are challenges that everyone has when they live alone, but mental illness makes it even more so that you have to be careful, yes? What was difficult for me was being alone with myself. That wasn’t the case before. It’s a challenge, but it’s part of it. Because how can you become independent if you can’t even be alone with yourself? With thoughts that keep going round and round and these future scenarios that you just kind of run through.

I have to admit that I sit at home more often now and really have to prevent my thoughts from slipping into extremes […] It’s corona‐related, yes. I mean, I used to get caught up in things and completely overthink them, in these “what ifs”, “what could have been”? All these factors that you can’t really influence as an individual anyway. And that’s becoming more and more, and the fear that I’m now getting, or already have of corona, is becoming an increasingly intense experience.

John’s anxiety, amplified by a cascade of ‘what if’ scenarios and the effects of a constant intensification of stress as a result of witnessing growing public disregard for safety measures and conspiracy theories affecting his peers, as well as global events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, culminated in a mental health crisis early in 2022, which necessitated a period of hospitalisation disrupting his plans for greater independence. In response, the collective advice from his support network—including his family, doctor and support worker—was to postpone his transition towards living more independently.

My brain would be completely overwhelmed with sensory impressions because of the sounds of other people, all the images that I perceive and such. And then I usually listen to loud music or read in a book. […] That was before COVID that I needed music but because of COVID I've now moved on to very loud music, like hardcore techno music, very, very loud heavy metal.

Spending time outdoors introduces another paradox: it offers a sense of spatial liberation and social validation yet simultaneously amplifies his anxieties. Regulating the volume of the music he listens to becomes a crafting device to shield him from the sensory overload of public spaces and to prevent the escalation of his symptoms. The pandemic intensified John’s hallucinations, necessitating his coping mechanisms or ‘tics’, to become more potent. His strategy of ‘freezing like a stone’ in crowded settings (audio diary, 13 January 2022) emerges as a last‐resort mechanism.

John's anxieties and responses are not static but continually intra‐act with the dynamic interplay of restrictions and freedoms. The persistent nature of his symptoms, exacerbated by the pandemic’s shifting conditions, begins to debilitate the agency he strives to maintain. A speculated longer period of hospitalisation in a psychiatric facility in the summer of 2022 indicates a peak in this layered emotional journey.

Sophia, an entrepreneur in her 50s, has spent over 2 decades managing an animal farm where she hosts guests and organises events. Sophia is blind and uses personal assistance, which is essential for both her professional activities and personal mobility. She lives with and cares for her frail mother. Her narrative consists of an interview conducted in July 2021 and a series of 20 diary entries covering the period until June 2022.

My typical days vary depending on what day it is. During the week, I usually go to my farm with my assistant (…) And, uh, then there are always seasonal tasks that come along. We now have the sheep shearing ahead of us and we have the hay work. These are the two major tasks that we have done in the last few days (…) then there is usually a short talk with, uh, my employee, my assistant and we decide what to do next.

Sophia’s daily life is entangled with material and nonmaterial agentic forces, including the seasonal rhythms of agricultural tasks. Her assistant plays a key role in this dynamic, and their synchronised intra‐actions are reflected in Sophia’s use of ‘we’.

The pandemic disrupted Sophia’s routines and ways of working. The cancellation of guest visits had a significant impact on her financial stability. She particularly mourned the loss of her work at a retirement home, where she had visited with her animals and built meaningful relationships. The role of her personal assistant evolved from one of support to a crucial element in helping Sophia adapt to these changes. Meanwhile, the operational rhythms of her farm were further restricted by pandemic‐related regulations, including the wearing of masks and physical distancing.

I don’t know if you can imagine. But you have to listen through the homepages and there are a hundred thousand links and information. These are things where I personally think that people with disabilities are excluded because the accesses are not barrier‐free, absolutely not. And then they say just take a sighted help.

The pandemic‐induced digital transformation demanded significant ingenuity and adaptability from Sophia. Confronted with an inaccessible and systemically ableist framework that failed to address her specific needs, she developed strategies to advocate for her rights and secure entrepreneurial grants.

I tried to clarify many things over the phone, but most people were in home office. I always had to find out the private numbers of the employees to talk to them and say what I needed, otherwise I always just heard, please visit our homepage at www. then enjoy.

For me personally, a sense of achievement was the first time I managed to establish a connection and participate for an hour and a half on the Internet.

Sophia’s agency became increasingly entangled with her mother’s deteriorating health. Concerns about her mother’s vulnerability to infection led to increased self‐isolation, which in turn reshaped her interactions with her personal assistant. Feeling compelled to limit personal contact, she chose to meet her assistant only when absolutely necessary. This recalibration culminated in a significant event when she decided to commute alone to her farm, a route that involved several train changes of varying accessibility. Although exempt from the regulations requiring face masks in public places, Sophia decided to wear one to protect her mother’s health. However, this decision inadvertently disrupted her sensory navigation, which relies heavily on acoustic and tactile feedback to compensate for her visual impairment. This challenge was magnified by the almost total absence of passers‐by who might otherwise have offered assistance or guidance. While attempting to board an express train, Sophia misjudged the gap and fell, fracturing her ankle and triggering a series of cascading effects. The absence of immediate rehabilitation services extended the duration of her movement restrictions, affected her ability to manage the farm and forced her to rely on donations to cover necessary medical treatment for her animals.

Her diary entries from September 2021 to June 2022 reveal her continued resilience and advocacy in the midst of an ongoing struggle to secure equal rights and opportunities. These entries also reflect the debilitating toll of the constant effort required to navigate inaccessible systems, including ongoing health challenges and the financial burden exacerbated by steep increases in electricity costs.

Although Sophia has had access to limited forms of support, such as pandemic‐related financial assistance, her economic stability remains precarious. Her daily life, which includes managing her farm, her health and her emotional well‐being, is intertwined with the wider socioeconomic and sociomaterial challenges of intersecting crises. The animals on her farm, essential to her livelihood, function as coagents within the material‐discursive entanglements that shape her life. Beyond emotional support, these interactions form a relational kinship, fostering a shared agency that underpins Sophia’s ability to endure and adapt in the face of financial, health and systemic adversity.

Elisabeth, a woman in her 50s, has lived and worked in an institutional care setting for more than 2 decades. Her narrative spans three interviews and four video diary entries from summer 2021 to August 2022. Elisabeth's life prior to COVID‐19 bridged multiple domains. She navigated her roles as a resident and service user labelled with intellectual dis/ability within the institutional world while simultaneously serving as a self‐advocate for disability rights and as a knowledge producer and lecturer engaged in teaching and inclusive research at a university. These roles enabled her to act as spokesperson for other residents, especially women with dis/abilities confined to institutions. This combination provides unique insights into the ways knowledge, power and agency materialise in and outside institutional settings, shaping the conditions of existence and modes of relating.

Elisabeth's narrative was chosen because it highlights life in institutional care during the pandemic, marked by disproportionate restrictions, limited freedoms and paternalistic policies. As a self‐advocate actively engaged beyond the institution, she uniquely challenged these constraints. Her dual role—as both regulated by institutional structures and an active knowledge producer—offers a lens to examine the epistemic boundaries of how intellectual dis/ability is shaped, negotiated and resisted within material‐discursive realities.

They didn’t like it when I had appointments outside. They always asked exactly what I was doing. But I didn’t care, and eventually, they accepted it. Still, it was annoying.

Through her capacity as a self‐advocate, Elisabeth persistently defended her external engagements while also championing the needs of fellow residents, demonstrating how her role as a mediator between these worlds challenged institutional norms.

The question came up how long does it last ehm where can we go, can I visit someone, can I go on vacation? We didn't know what we were allowed to do and what not. Can we go shopping now or not, what is it and how contagious is it?.

The ability of institutional managers to respond was itself caught up in delayed and ambiguous directives from the federal government. However, they did not make use of the discretion opened up by the policy recommendations, nor did they make a sincere effort to communicate this information in a way that would alleviate the residents’ information gap.

What are we allowed to do? We only got information when we got upset.

When I was left alone as an advocate we wrote to the authorities that we want to have the information on time.

And I could have been exempted from the mask, but I didn’t want to, because I thought that would be unfair to the others.

Yes, I missed the contact, or like saying, okay, now I’m going to a concert or like I go swimming or something, or I go to a café and even if I just sit there and drink my raspberry soda and watch people a bit.

It has come to the point that I want to move out of the institution.

I’ve thought to myself: “how well off is someone who has their own apartment, even if they can’t go outside”. It’s not mentally good, because they can’t talk to anyone.

Elisabeth’s experiences during the pandemic illustrate how institutional practices and protective discourses, framed around notions of security and vulnerability, became mechanisms of control and exclusion. The intertwining of institutional power‐knowledge regimes and ableist discourses reinforced epistemic violence by portraying people with intellectual dis/abilities as unknowledgeable and incapable.

Living at the onto‐epistemic boundaries of intellectual dis/ability, Elisabeth navigated a complex interplay of institutional paternalism, systemic exclusion and her own relational agency. By mobilising her experiential knowledge and advocacy skills, she sought to challenge the institutional ethos and reconfigure the restricted spaces afforded to her and her peers. However, her inability to achieve her goal of independent living reveals the profound limitations imposed by structural inequalities and the pervasive culture of dependency that defines institutional care settings, offering a lens to understand the co‐construction of intellectual dis/ability within institutional environments.

To understand the dynamics of vulnerability, we have leveraged the analytical affordances of agential realism. The reread narratives of John, Sophia and Elisabeth disentangle the mechanisms that create and sustain categories of vulnerability. The boundaries imposed by societal, institutional and political forces do not merely delineate who is vulnerable; theyactively shapethe sociomaterial conditions of existence for those navigating these labels.

However, these effects are not pre‐existing states or passive outcomes butrelational processes of becoming, simultaneously produced by systemic, material and discursive conditions and generating further impacts that recursively shape these conditions. They are bothproductsof specific sociomaterial arrangements andcatalystsfor subsequent effects or transformations—whether through perpetuating inequalities or fostering resistances and reconfigurations of agency. It is this dynamic interplay that we termvulnerability effects. Although the analysis presented here draws on only three distinct narratives, the mechanisms and dynamics of vulnerability effects resonate across broader contexts, reflecting patterns observed throughout the project. Although these findings are situated within Austria's specific policy landscape, they highlight systemic processes of vulnerability production that extend to other Global North contexts, albeit shaped by local institutional and sociopolitical conditions.

Building on Carol Thomas’s (2007,2012) distinction between disablism and impairment effects,vulnerability effectsparallels but also departs from her framework. Thomas describes disablism as the socially imposed restrictions and psychoemotional harms that people categorised as impaired experience, whereas impairment effects refer to the unavoidable biosocial impacts of impairments on embodied functioning, which are always culturally mediated rather than purely biological (Thomas2012, 211). Although we align with Thomas's critique of essentialist views of disability,vulnerability effectsrejects a rigid bifurcation between disablism and impairment effects. Instead, it situates vulnerability as an emergent phenomenon that is co‐constituted through the intra‐action of material, systemic and corporeal realities (Barad2007).

Vulnerability effectsintegrates a dynamic view of agency, expanding beyond the psychoemotional dimensions of disablism. Although Thomas powerfully critiques the internalised oppression and relational harms of disablism,vulnerability effectsacknowledges both the ways individuals are affected by and how they navigate and resist these conditions through creative and embodied practices. This dual framing captures the iterative and recursive nature ofvulnerability effectsas both products and catalysts, linking their emergence to broader systems of dis/ability while also recognising their transformative potential.

Vulnerability effectshinge between two interrelated onto‐epistemological threads that illuminate the interplay of seemingly opposing forces—activist affordances and debilitation.

Activist affordances, as conceptualised by Dokumacı (2023), refer to the micropractices of resistance and adaptation through which individuals create possibilities for existence and recognition within systems that marginalise them. These affordances foreground the embodied and relational strategies that enable individuals to navigate oppressive sociomaterial conditions.

Yet, these acts of resistance unfold within contexts where agency is continually worn down by systemic forces. Drawing on Puar's (2020) concept of debilitation, we understand this as an active process through which sociopolitical and socioeconomic systems generate vulnerability by constraining agency and reinforcing material inequalities. Debilitation not only opposes activist affordances but also interacts recursively with them, as the exertion required for resistance is met with enduring systemic barriers.

Elisabeth's experiences reveal this dynamic interplay. Her institutional confinement, shaped by systemic neglect and paternalistic norms, severely restricted her autonomy but simultaneously catalysed her advocacy efforts. Through these acts of resistance, she worked to reconfigure epistemic and spatial boundaries, challenging the very structures that excluded her from societal discourse. However, the systemic neglect she sought to contest also undermined her efforts, eroding her aspirations for independent living and diminishing her capacity for sustained resistance over time.

Sophia's narrative highlights a different dimension of this dynamic. The inaccessibility of physical and digital environments, ostensibly designed to support activity, instead reproduced exclusion and constrained her autonomy. These barriers, rooted in structural inequalities, demanded constant acts of ingenuity and advocacy, which became critical for sustaining her resilience. Her relational kinship with her animals offered a significant source of stability and agency, but the persistent need to navigate exclusionary systems exacted a cumulative toll, depleting her physical and emotional reserves.

John's experiences further illustrate the recursive interaction of debilitation and activist affordances. The compounded pressures of shifting support systems, evolving family dynamics and overlapping global crises created cycles of anxiety and destabilisation that required ever‐intensifying coping mechanisms. Although he initially developed adaptive routines to manage these challenges, the cumulative strain led to his hospitalisation, demonstrating how systemic forces can push even adaptive strategies to their breaking point. His story illuminates how shifting social dynamics—eroding solidarity and increasing hostility—destabilised his sense of belonging and magnified his vulnerability.

Framingvulnerability effectsas recursive moves beyond static or linear understandings of vulnerability. The reciprocal relationship between debilitation and activist affordances is key to understanding how vulnerabilities are not passively endured but are actively contested and reshaped. Yet, such navigation can be taxing, as the agency exercised is often fragile (Naraian2019). Sociopolitical fluctuations and the dwindling energy reserves people can muster impact their resilience, as do the structures and processes of institutions that often compound vulnerability. Our findings challenge the urge to merely encourage individuals to assert further agency under neoliberal paradigms. Our study points to the need for focusing on material‐discursive practices that craftvulnerability effects, advocating for transformative strategies to actively reform the conditions fostering them. By understanding vulnerability as both a product and a catalyst, we can interrogate the structural underpinnings of inequality while fostering pathways for transformation. This framing urges a shift in crisis response strategies from addressing immediate impacts to dismantling the systemic mechanisms of debilitation and creating conditions that sustain enduring agency.

As the immediacy of the pandemic fades, there is a critical risk of structural amnesia where lessons from the crisis are overshadowed by a return to entrenched practices. Revisiting the pandemic throughvulnerability effectsas a conceptual lens provides a pathway to better understand the material‐discursive practices that shape vulnerability and to imagine possibilities for transformative change grounded in equity, inclusion and shared response‐ability. Although our findings are situated within Austria's policy landscape and reflect systemic patterns in the Global North, further research is needed to explore how these dynamics manifest in diverse sociopolitical settings.

Within our project, an initial prototype for inclusive crisis monitoring was implemented through the participatoryC_all Voicesproject. This initiative brought together various stakeholders and supported the cocreation of arts‐based performances developed by individuals with dis/abilities, reflecting their pandemic experiences. These events not only facilitated a shared exploration of the pandemic's effects but also informed actionable recommendations for inclusive crisis management strategies. A forthcoming paper will further explore the epistemic injustices of knowledge production and participation during the COVID‐19 pandemic, offering insights into the systemic transformations required for future crises.
