Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women, with metastasis accounting for the majority of these deaths. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is crucial for staging and treatment planning. This study aims to develop a non-invasive preoperative model for predicting SLN metastasis using clinical data and preoperative MRI.

A retrospective study included 4,276 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery were enrolled. After exclusions, 999 patients were analyzed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression identified significant predictors of SLN metastasis, which were used to construct nomograms. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) validated the model’s accuracy. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to create a risk stratification system.

Significant predictors of SLN metastasis included tumor size on MRI, multifocality, MRI-BIRADS classification, ADC value, short axis, and cortical thickness (P< 0.05). The nomogram showed excellent discriminatory power with an AUC of 0.847. The RPA stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with respective SLN metastasis probabilities of 15.8%, 28.6%, and 69.8%.

This non-invasive SLN metastasis prediction model and risk stratification system provide a valuable tool for personalized clinical decision-making, potentially reducing the need for SLN biopsy in low-risk patients. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.

The incidence of female breast cancer has increased by approximately 0.5% annually since the mid-2000s [1]. Currently, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignant disease among women, accounting for 31% of all newly diagnosed cancers [2]. The status of axillary lymph nodes (ALN) is a critical factor in determining prognosis and developing individualized treatment plans. However, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been associated with numerous postoperative complications, such as reduced range of motion, arm and shoulder pain, and lymphedema [3,4]. Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is less invasive with fewer complications than ALND, it can still lead to shoulder dysfunction, paralysis, and lymphedema, diminishing patients’ quality of life. Moreover, the false-negative rate of SLNB is 5.5% [5]. Additionally, prolonged intraoperative pathology waiting times result in extended anesthesia duration, increased costs, and heightened risk of postoperative venous thrombosis. As such, non-invasive examination of SLN metastasis has become a critical focus in clinical practice.

Further clarification of imaging criteria is needed for assessing lymph node metastasis. While lymph nodes with a diameter exceeding 1 cm are classified as metastatic, many nodes smaller than 1 cm are malignant, and larger nodes are often benign due to inflammatory conditions [6]. Liu et al. [7] proposed using a long-to-short axis diameter ratio of less than 1.52 to predict lymph node metastasis. Similarly, Kim et al. [8] utilized lymph node characteristics such as long and short axes and cortical thickness to forecast ALN metastasis.

Numerous attempts have been undertaken to develop predictive models for SLN metastasis in breast cancer. However, some models rely on postoperative pathological data unavailable preoperatively or on advanced technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, which are difficult to implement widely. To address these limitations, this study combined clinical data with preoperative MRI images to develop a non-invasive model for predicting SLN metastasis. Additionally, it established a risk stratification system using recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), marking a novel contribution to this field.

This retrospective study was approved by the Zhengzhou University Institutional Review Board (No. 2023-KY-0586). A total of 4,276 histologically confirmed breast cancer patients undergoing surgery at the Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, between January 2020 and September 2022, were included (Fig.1). Exclusion criteria encompassed male breast cancer (n= 3), ductal carcinoma in situ (n= 115), ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (n= 122), specific invasive breast cancer (n= 41), and cases without MRI scans (n= 2,430). Additional exclusions involved cases without SLNB (n= 153), surgeries conducted at other hospitals (n= 202), patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n= 191), and palliative surgeries (n= 15). Five patients lacking postoperative pathological reports were also excluded. This resulted in 999 patients, including 992 unilateral and 7 bilateral invasive breast cancer cases, for a total of 1,006 cases.

MRI acquisition was conducted using a 3.0T scanner (GE Discovery 750 W) equipped with an 8-channel breast-dedicated coil. Patients were positioned prone with their breasts securely placed within the coil. MRI sequences included axial T1WI, axial T2WI, DCE-MRI, DWI, and sagittal contrast-enhanced imaging. Second-phase (61–122 s) DCE images, which provided optimal tumor-to-background contrast, were selected for analysis. Recorded MRI parameters comprised tumor size, ADC values, long axis, short axis, and cortical thickness of the most suspicious levelⅠaxillary lymph node depending on morphological features according to previous reports (Fig.2) [26]. When more than one suspicious lymph node was identified, the largest-appearing node was selected as the most suspicious levelⅠaxillary lymph node. Measurements were initially assessed by a radiologist with 9 years of expertise and subsequently reviewed by a senior radiologist possessing over 12 years of expertise. To assess reproducibility, a subset of 32 patients was independently evaluated by two radiologists, and Inter-observer agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, two-way random-effects model, absolute agreement). The ICC for tumor size measurements was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83–0.94), indicating good to excellent agreement between the two radiologists. Both radiologists were blinded to the tumor’s pathological type and SLN status.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 27) and R (version 4.1). Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-squared test and expressed as percentages (%). Continuous variables were represented as means ± standard deviations and analyzed with the independent sample t-test. To determine optimal cutoff values for SLN metastasis prediction, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of long axis, short axis, and cortical thickness measurements were generated. The Youden index was applied to establish threshold values. Univariable logistic regression identified clinically significant variables (P< 0.05), which were subsequently incorporated into multivariable logistic regression. A prediction nomogram was then constructed (Fig.4).

The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table1. The mean values for the long axis, short axis, and cortical thickness of the most suspicious levelⅠaxillary lymph node on MRI were 10.06 ± 3.469 mm, 6.87 ± 2.131 mm, and 2.78 ± 1.278 mm, respectively. Based on the ROC curves (Fig.3), the long axis, short axis, and cortical thickness could be potential diagnostic markers for SLN metastasis. The respective cutoff values for these parameters were 9.7 mm, 7.0 mm, and 2.7 mm (Tables1and2). Table2summarizes additional data regarding the ROC curves.

Univariable logistic analysis identified significant associations between SLN positivity and various factors, including tumor size on MRI, tumor location on MRI, multifocality, MRI-BIRADS classification, ADC value, long axis, short axis, and cortical thickness (P< 0.05) (TableS1). Multivariable logistic regression further revealed that tumor size on MRI, multifocality, MRI-BIRADS classification, ADC value, short axis, and cortical thickness were independently associated with SLN positivity (P< 0.05) (TableS2). These findings were subsequently utilized to construct prediction nomograms (Fig.4).

The SLN nomogram demonstrated strong discriminatory power, with a concordance index of 0.847 (0.822–0.872) (Fig.5). Calibration curves validated the agreement between observed SLN metastasis probabilities and nomogram-predicted probabilities (FigureS1). Decision curve analysis (DCA) further highlighted the model’s clinical utility, with the greatest net benefit observed when the SLN metastasis probability threshold was set between 0.04 and 0.081 (FigureS2).

Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was employed to stratify patients by SLN metastasis risk. A two-node decision tree was constructed using cortical thickness and ADC values to classify patients into three distinct risk groups: (i) low risk (cortical thickness of the targeted lymph node ≤ 2.7 mm), (ii) intermediate risk (cortical thickness of the targeted lymph node > 2.7 mm and ADC ≥ 1.164 × 10⁻³ mm²/s), and (iii) high risk (cortical thickness of the targeted lymph node > 2.7 mm and ADC < 1.164 × 10⁻³ mm²/s). The respective risks of SLN metastasis for these groups were 15.8%, 28.6%, and 69.8% (Fig.6).

Axillary lymph node metastasis is a critical predictor of tumor recurrence and survival in patients with breast cancer. Accurate preoperative assessment of SLN status is vital for evaluating the N stage of breast cancer to guide clinical decision-making. While pathological examination following SLNB remains the gold standard for diagnosing SLN metastasis, non-invasive prediction methods have emerged as promising alternatives. Consequently, it is essential to investigate the risk factors associated with SLN metastasis and to develop effective risk stratification systems and preoperative prediction models.

Numerous predictive models for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer have been developed. However, these models vary widely in research factors, methodologies, and outcomes, yet lack a unified standard [9–18]. Some models rely on advanced technologies, such as radiomics, machine learning, and deep learning, which are often inaccessible in many healthcare settings, particularly at the community level. Others incorporate conventional pathological and immunohistochemical markers, which are unavailable preoperatively. This study aims to address these limitations by developing a straightforward, pragmatic, and accessible preoperative prediction model.

In this study, tumor size on MRI, multifocality, MRI-BIRADS classification, ADC value, short axis, and cortical thickness were significantly correlated with SLN positivity (P< 0.05). The probability of SLN metastasis was found to be twice as high in cases where the tumor size > 5 cm on MRI (51.5%, 17/33) compared to cases ≤ 2 cm (26.3%, 134/509). Indicatively, the potential for metastasis to SLNs escalates in correlation with the extent of the tumor. Consistent with previous reports [19–21]. In this study, the probability of SLN metastasis in single or multiple tumors was 33.4% (308/921) and 60.0% (51/85), respectively. In cases where the tumors were multifocal, the probability of SLN metastasis was approximately twice that observed in cases where the tumors were unifocal. Multifocality was found to be an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis, a result that aligns with those of Song et al. [22] and Xue et al. [19]. In this study, the probability of SLN metastasis was 10.3% (3/29), 31.6% (220/606), and 48.4% (136/281) in MRI-BIRADS classifications 3, 4, and 5, respectively. An elevated MRI-BIRADS classification was found to be associated with an increased risk of SLN metastasis which is in accordance with previous reports [20,23]. In comparison to the non-metastasis, yet the most suspicious levelⅠaxillary lymph node on MRI (0.98 ± 0.174 × 10− 3mm2/s), the median ADC values for metastasis ones were considerably lower (0.92 ± 0.143 × 10− 3mm2/s). The probability of metastasis to SLN is inversely proportional to the tumor’s ADC value which is consistent with previous studies [19,24,25]. Consistent with previous research [26–28], the long axis, short axis, and cortical thickness of the metastasis lymph node were found to be substantially longer than those of the non-metastasis lymph node, as determined by univariable logistic regression.

The nomogram serves as a foundation for individualized prediction of SLN metastasis risk and demonstrates an AUC of 0.847, indicating excellent discriminatory ability. Calibration curves validated the agreement between predicted and observed probabilities, while decision curve analysis confirmed the model’s clinical utility. Furthermore, a recursive partitioning analysis was used to classify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on cortical thickness and ADC values.

The findings suggest that patients in the low-risk group, characterized by a cortical thickness ≤ 2.7 mm, may potentially be exempted from SLNB due to their minimal clinical risk. However, further multicenter clinical studies with larger cohorts are necessary to validate these results and ascertain the feasibility of omitting SLNB in selected patient populations.

Although axillary ultrasound is commonly used to assess lymph node morphology preoperatively, its diagnostic performance is operator-dependent and may be limited in cases of deep-seated or multiple nodal metastases. MRI offers a more comprehensive evaluation, particularly in patients with dense breast tissue or multifocal disease. Thus, our MRI-based model may provide additional value in complex cases and institutions with access to advanced imaging modalities.

One limitation of this study is the exclusion of certain preoperative biological markers such as HER2, ER, PR, and Ki-67, which may contribute valuable prognostic information. These markers were not consistently available preoperatively in our retrospective cohort. Future prospective studies integrating imaging features with molecular and pathological data are warranted to further enhance model performance.

Furthermore, while the majority of SLNs are located at level I, where the largest lymph node was measured, there is no assurance that target lymph nodes are indeed SLNs. Due to the retrospective design, preoperative localization of lymph nodes was not performed, and therefore a direct one-to-one correlation between the lymph nodes measured on MRI and those evaluated in histopathology could not be confirmed. To minimize uncertainty, we endeavor to mitigate selection bias and rigorously adhere to exclusion criteria. Future prospective studies incorporating preoperative marking and intraoperative node tracking are needed to address this limitation.

This research examines the potential application of a decision-making model for predicting SLN involvement in breast cancer patients. The proposed preoperative model provides a framework for stratifying risks of SLN metastasis in primary breast cancer, supporting clinicians in selecting more effective personalized treatments. Importantly, the model may help identify clinically negative patients at low risk of SLN metastasis, potentially obviating the need for SLNB and reducing unnecessary surgical interventions.
