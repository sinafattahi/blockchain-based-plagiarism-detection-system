Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, accounting for 15% of all cancer deaths. The decision between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy (MX) plays a fundamental role in the management of early-stage breast cancer. Improved survival rates are an essential outcome influencing these decisions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to compare the effectiveness of BCS versus MX in terms of survival and recurrence outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases on 03/19/2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Studies published from 1994 to 2024 comparing BCS with MX in breast cancer patients were included. The meta-analysis included 22 studies with a total sample size of 389,465 participants. For local recurrence, the random-effects model indicated an odds ratio (OR) of 1.65 (95% CI: 0.79-3.47, p = 0.19, I² = 70.6%). Regional recurrence showed an OR of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.26-5.03, p = 0.87, I² = 83.8%). For disease-free survival at five years, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.57-1.09, p = 0.14, I² = 98.2%), and at 10 years, the HR was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.79-1.58, p = 0.53, I² = 96.4%). Overall survival (OS) at five years showed a significant benefit for BCS (HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.71, p = 0.0001, I² = 98.8%), as did OS at 10 years (HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42-0.91, p = 0.0149, I² = 98.8%). High heterogeneity was present in the survival outcomes (I² > 90%), limiting the robustness of the findings and suggesting variability across studies. BCS may offer comparable or superior survival outcomes compared to MX, but further research is needed to address the substantial heterogeneity and to develop personalized treatment guidelines. Notably, all 22 cohort studies were rated “good quality” on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), supporting the overall reliability of the evidence.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, accounting for 15% of all cancer deaths [1]. In 2020, it was estimated that 685,000 women died from breast cancer globally [2]. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer is one in eight for women [3].

For women diagnosed with primary breast cancer, the initial treatment typically involves curative breast surgery. Historically, breast cancer surgery was dominated by Halsted's mastectomy (MX), introduced in 1894, which remained standard for decades ​[4]​. In the late 20th century, two randomized trials demonstrated that breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiation achieved equivalent survival to MX in early-stage breast cancer ​[4]. Advances in imaging and screening have since enabled earlier detection of nonpalpable tumors, prompting more localized and tailored surgical approaches ​[4]. Modern surgical strategies increasingly emphasize personalization, considering tumor biology, breast size, and patient preference, and minimally invasive techniques aimed at preserving quality of life without compromising oncologic outcomes.

MX remains an option for many women with screen-detected, early-stage breast cancer. While chemotherapy decisions are primarily based on tumor biology and are generally independent of surgical choice, some patients may opt for MX to avoid radiation therapy and its associated side effects, provided that they meet criteria that do not require post-MX radiation ​[4]​. Additionally, it may be necessary for women who have received radiation on the affected side or for those with relatively small breasts in the case of a large primary breast cancer, extensive calcifications, or multicentric disease. Several studies have shown no detectable difference in overall survival (OS) (the length of time a patient lives after diagnosis or the start of treatment) or disease-free survival (DFS) (the period after primary treatment during which no signs of cancer recurrence or progression are observed) between women with early-stage breast cancer who undergo BCS plus radiation and those who undergo MX ​[4,5]. However, advances in systemic therapies, including targeted agents and immunotherapy, may differentially influence long-term outcomes based on tumor biology and surgical approach, underscoring the need to individualize treatment plans. A 20-year follow-up of a randomized study comparing BCS with MX for early breast cancer showed that the rates of death from all causes for BCS were 41.7% and 41.2% for MX [6]. The respective rates of death from breast cancer were 26.1% and 24.3%, showing no differences in long-term survival rates between the two treatments [6]. A 10-year, follow-up, single-center, real-world study conducted in China showed similar results, with no statistical difference in the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival rate (91.7% vs. 70.3%), as well as the 10-year DFS rate (87.6% vs. 83.8%) [7].

The choice between BCS and MX is influenced by factors such as complication rates, length of hospital stay, rehabilitation time, patient-reported symptoms, body image, and quality of life. MX is often recommended to avoid postoperative radiotherapy (RT) ​[5]​. BCS followed by RT is the standard local treatment for early-stage invasive breast cancer; however, it is not recommended for patients with a high risk of local recurrence, such as those with aggressive tumor biology, multifocal tumors, positive margins, or certain genetic mutations, where MX may be preferred ​[8].

While the equivalence of BCS and MX for survival outcomes has been well-established through randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies are essential to understanding real-world outcomes, including patient quality of life, complications, and long-term satisfaction. Observational studies provide insights into how these treatments perform outside the controlled settings of clinical trials and help identify factors that influence treatment choices and outcomes in diverse populations. While RCTs have established comparable survival rates, there is limited synthesis of real-world outcomes in diverse populations from observational data.

In this review, we seek to perform an analysis that addresses variables such as local recurrence, regional recurrence, mortality, OS, and DFS. In conducting this systematic review and meta-analysis, we adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards and evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. It is important to acknowledge that the data from these studies remain observational, which may introduce certain biases. However, observational data are crucial for informing clinical practice and patient decision-making by complementing the findings of RCTs with evidence from real-world settings.

This systematic review and meta-analysis employed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to conduct a comprehensive systematic review [9]. The protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD 42024530103).

Types of study: We systematically reviewed relevant studies published from 1994 to 2024 to ensure the most recent and rigorous information available in English. We meticulously screened and analyzed cohort studies and case controls. We excluded case series, cross-sectional, dissertations, book chapters, protocol articles, reviews, news articles, conference abstracts, comments, letters to the editor, and editorials. Furthermore, we excluded studies that did not clearly describe their operationalizations, were duplicated, were unable to describe their operationalizations clearly, and could not obtain the necessary data or receive a response from the original author via email.

Type of participants: This study has set specific participant selection criteria, including individuals aged 18 years and older diagnosed with breast cancer without metastasis, despite sub-classification. We plan to analyze subgroups according to the classification of breast cancer. Furthermore, we included all types of molecular subtypes and histological grades. Studies were included irrespective of the study sample size, inpatient/outpatient setting, and geography if they provided data needed for the systematic review. Exclusion criteria are individuals under 18 years of age.

Types of intervention: The study has established specific participant selection criteria, including studies that use BCS as an intervention compared with MX. Studies comparing the intervention were included. Exclusion criteria consist of studies published solely as abstracts, studies that do not directly compare these two interventions, and studies without complete information.

The primary outcomes to be measured in this project include local recurrence, regional recurrence, mortality, OS, and disease-free survival.

We searched PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and EMBASE using the following terms: ‘’Mastectomy‘’, ‘’Breast conserving surgery’’, and ‘’Breast cancer'' on 03/19/2024 (Tables1-4). This rigorous approach resulted in a homogeneous dataset, allowing for more accurate and reliable results.

Following an initial screening based on the title and abstract, two reviewers (CIMD and PS) independently selected trials for inclusion in this review using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This search used Rayyan [10] to extract relevant data, and duplicates were filtered. Keywords were employed to highlight inclusion and exclusion criteria-related words on Rayyan (Rayyan Systems Inc., Cambridge, MA). Any disagreement about the inclusion of the studies was resolved through consensus and consultation with a third reviewer (SSD). Subsequently, a full-text analysis was conducted with two reviewers (KLT and HO) who independently selected trials for inclusion in the review using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreement about the inclusion of studies was resolved by consensus and consultation with a third review author (EC).

The data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers, and disagreements were solved by consensus. When multiple overlapping reports from the same study were identified, the information from the one containing the most relevant information, or the first published report, was included.

We evaluated the data using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook [11]. To assess the quality of observational studies included in the systematic review, we applied the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) to determine the risk of bias (Table5) [12]. The NOS evaluates studies across three domains: the selection of study groups, comprising four items; the comparability of cohorts, consisting of one item; and the outcome of interest, encompassing three items. Within the selection and outcome domain, one star was allocated per item. The comparability domain permits a maximum allocation of two stars. Consequently, the highest achievable score on the NOS is 9 points. The final scores were interpreted as follows: good quality studies were identified as those achieving three or four stars in the selection domain, with one or two stars in the comparability domain and two or three stars in the outcome domain. Fair quality studies were granted two stars in the selection domain, one or two stars in comparability, and two or three stars in outcome. Poor quality studies were identified as those with 0 or one star in the selection domain, lacking stars in comparability, or receiving 0 or one star in the outcome domain. Two independent reviewers (TC and OYGG) evaluated the risk of bias in each study, considering the specific criteria and guidelines provided by the respective tools. Any reviewer discrepancies have been resolved through discussion with a third, blinded reviewer (EC).

The NOS evaluates studies across three domains: the selection of study groups, comprising four items; the comparability of cohorts, consisting of one item; and the outcome of interest, encompassing three items. Within the selection and outcome domain, one star was allocated per item. The comparability domain permits a maximum allocation of two stars. Consequently, the highest achievable score on the NOS is 9 points.

A meta-analysis was performed using R (version 3.4.3; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) [33]. The pooled effect of the outcomes was examined using a random-effects meta-analysis [34]. Whenever the number of studies reporting an outcome of interest was insufficient, only a qualitative analysis of the results was performed. Effect sizes were expressed as relative risk (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval. The I² statistic assessed heterogeneity, and the following cut-off values were used for interpretation: <25, 25-50, and > 50% were considered small, medium, and large heterogeneity, respectively [35]. For all outcomes, sensitivity analyses according to the leave-one-out method were performed to determine the influence of individual studies on the overall effect, using diagnostic plots proposed by Viechtbauer et al. [36]. Egger's regression test examined publication bias when 10 or more reports with the same outcome were available [37]. Subgroup analysis will be performed by year, country, risk of bias, stage of breast cancer, and type of histological classification, if possible. To calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS), we will extract the total sample size and the percentage of survivors from each study. Using these data, we estimated the number of events (non-survivors) and censored observations. We then applied the Parmar and Tierney methods to compute HRs from reconstructed Kaplan-Meier curves and summary survival statistics.

Our initial search across four databases for observational studies yielded 22,390 potential articles. After eliminating 5,107 duplicates, we conducted screening based on title and abstract, leading to the exclusion of 17,229 articles. Six of the 54 articles sought for retrieval were not retrieved, leaving 48 articles for eligibility assessment. Twelve were excluded due to incorrect publication type, eight due to incorrect study design, four due to wrong outcomes, and two due to the wrong population. Ultimately, 22 studies were included in this review. This is summarized in our PRISMA flow chart (Figure1).

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram delineates the systematic process of identifying and screening studies across multiple databases, culminating in selecting 22 pertinent studies.

The 22 articles had a total sample size of 389,465 participants. The primary focus of the selected research papers is to compare BCS with MX in women with breast cancer, with emphasis on evaluating the safety and efficacy of each therapy through measures such as OS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). The studies varied across a broad geographic range, which included these countries: China (28%), the USA (28%), Korea (14%), Norway (10%), Switzerland (4%), Sweden (4%), Denmark (4)%, Iran (4%), and Egypt (4%). While the selected studies presented varied results, most indicated improved survival outcomes with BCS with or without RT compared to MX. Approximately 71% of the studies reported enhanced survival using BCS, while the remaining 29% reported no survival benefit or significant difference. Despite reporting superior OS, BCSS, and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to MX alone, the reporting of these values was not consistent among studies. Therefore, while the trend towards better outcomes with BCS remained robust across various analyses, caution is warranted when comparing specific numerical results across studies due to these methodological differences. This information is summarized in Table6.

The risk of bias assessment utilized the NOS for all 22 cohort studies [12]. Our results in Table5show that all 22 studies were deemed good quality. A good quality study strongly correlates with a low risk of bias, as the rigorous methodological criteria evaluated by the scale minimize systematic errors and enhance the reliability of study findings, thereby indicating a reduced likelihood of bias.

This meta-analysis assessed the effect of various interventions on regional recurrence in breast cancer. Four studies with a total of 4,511 participants (1,327 in the experimental group and 3,184 in the control group) were included. The random-effects model indicated an odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.26-5.03, p = 0.87, I² = 83.8%). The prediction interval ranged from 0.0012 to 1088.41, highlighting the wide potential variation in new studies.

The funnel plot for regional recurrence outcomes was asymmetric, indicating the possibility of publication bias. Due to the limited number of studies, Egger's test for small-study effects was not possible and could not be conclusively interpreted.

Subgroup analysis by country revealed significant differences (p = 0.047), with studies from Korea reporting an OR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.22-0.70, I² = 0.0%) and studies from China showing an OR of 4.07 (95% CI: 0.43-38.16, I² = 77.0%). Analysis by intervention also revealed significant differences (p = 0.047), with BCS with RT (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.22-0.70, I² = 0.0%) vs. BCS alone (OR = 4.07, 95% CI: 0.43-38.16, I² = 77.0%). Analysis by type of breast cancer showed significant differences for unspecified types (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.95, p = 0.0003). Analysis by stage of breast cancer also showed significant differences for stages I, IIA (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.95, p = 0.0003). Other subgroup analyses by year and study design did not show significant differences. The sensitivity analysis identified Noh et al. [16], Sang et al. [21], and Kim et al. [24] as potential outliers. Omitting these studies significantly impacted heterogeneity and the overall effect. However, excluding these outliers was not feasible as it would leave only one study in the meta-analysis (Tables7-8).

BCS, especially with RT, was consistently associated with improved survival. The most clinically meaningful effect was seen in five-year overall survival (HR = 0.49; after outlier removal, HR = 0.42). DFS at five years also favored BCS after sensitivity analysis (HR = 0.60). These findings suggest a potential real-world advantage of BCS over MX, especially in early-stage and triple-negative breast cancer. However, wide prediction intervals and methodological differences across studies suggest that results should be interpreted cautiously.

Breast cancer is a pervasive health concern affecting approximately one in every eight females [38]. Given its significant impact, understanding the efficacy of treatment modalities is crucial. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aim to contribute to this understanding by evaluating the outcomes of two common procedures used in treating breast cancer: MX and BCS. Our meta-analysis included six studies with 12,504 participants for local recurrence, five with 12,076 participants for regional recurrence (RR), and five with a total of 116,222 participants for mortality. Including fewer studies and a smaller sample size compared to our systematic review, which included 22 articles with a total sample size of 389,465 participants, could influence the discrepancy in results.

This meta-analysis examining local recurrence and RR rates highlights critical insights into the effectiveness of BCS compared to MX. Initially, no significant difference in local recurrence rates was found between BCS and MX (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 0.79-3.47, p = 0.19). However, subgroup analysis by study year, as well as by breast cancer type, revealed significant variations (p = 0.01), particularly in studies published in 2019 (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.27-2.22). This discrepancy can be attributed to evolving surgical techniques, advancements in adjuvant therapies, improved diagnostic methods, and updated surveillance guidelines, all of which have likely improved the precision and outcomes of BCS, reducing local recurrence rates. Subgroup analysis by breast cancer type showed significant differences, especially in invasive breast cancer, reflecting the disease's aggressiveness and varied treatment responses. Tumor biology, specifically hormone receptor status, may modify the effectiveness of surgical outcomes. Hormone receptor-positive tumors exhibit a more favorable prognosis and may respond well to adjuvant endocrine therapy, enhancing the efficacy of BCS. While triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes tend to be more aggressive in nature and may diminish the relative benefits of BCS over MX [39]. These findings emphasize the need for tailored treatment strategies to improve clinical outcomes. In addition, shared decision-making should weigh tumor biology and treatment goals alongside quality-of-life factors. BCS often preserves body image and emotional well-being, making it a preferred option when clinically appropriate.

Our findings align with previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which similarly found no significant differences in local recurrence rates between BCS and MX in breast cancer patients (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.61-1.99, p = 0.74) [40]. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of RR reveal significant geographic and intervention-specific variations. Korean studies showed a favorable OR of 0.39 for BCS versus MX in reducing RR, contrasting with Chinese studies reporting an OR of 4.07. Furthermore, BCS combined with RT significantly lowered OR (0.39, 95% CI: 0.22-0.70, I² = 0.0%) compared to BCS alone (OR = 4.07, 95% CI: 0.43-38.16, I² = 77.0%). High heterogeneity (I² = 83.8%) underscores variability in study methodologies and patient demographics, necessitating personalized treatment approaches. These findings substantiate existing literature advocating for BCS with RT as a preferred treatment strategy in early-stage breast cancer, supported by studies like those of Noh et al. [16] and Sang et al. [21], which underscore its efficacy in reducing local recurrence risks. Incorporating BCS with RT into treatment protocols could optimize outcomes by minimizing recurrence risks, though further research is needed to refine guidelines and enhance patient stratification.

The meta-analysis demonstrates significant benefits of BCS on overall survival at both five and 10 years. At five years, the HR is 0.49, indicating a substantial improvement in overall survival. However, high heterogeneity is observed across studies (I² = 98.8%), suggesting considerable variability in the results. Notably, differences among countries are significant, with China showing a lower HR (0.42, 95% CI: 0.17-1.06, I² = 90.5%) compared to the USA (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.36-1.31, I² = 99.0%). These differences may reflect variations in healthcare systems, treatment protocols, patient demographics, genetic profiles, or lifestyle factors.

Subgroup analyses by study year revealed significant variations. For instance, studies from 2022 (HR = 0.57) might benefit from improved methodologies or larger sample sizes, reducing variability compared to earlier years. Similarly, analyses by breast cancer types showed significant differences, which could be attributed to underlying biological differences between subtypes. For example, triple-negative breast cancer (HR = 0.65) may respond differently to interventions compared to invasive breast cancer (HR = 0.56) due to distinct molecular characteristics and treatment sensitivities. Additionally, substantial variations were observed across different stages of cancer, with HRs ranging from 0.33 to 1.69, indicating varying impacts of interventions based on disease progression, prognosis, treatment intensity, and response rates.

At 10 years, the analysis focused on comparing the effectiveness of BCS with RT versus MX. Most observational studies consistently found that patients who underwent BCS with RT reported better quality of life, reduced psychological stress, and higher satisfaction rates than those who underwent MX alone. Quantitatively, the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in the hazard of death at 10 years for patients who underwent BCS compared with MX (HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42-0.91, p = 0.01). This finding aligns with the survival and quality of life benefits of BCS with RT observed in qualitative analyses.

The qualitative analysis of the DFS at five years suggests that an improvement exists when utilizing the BCT procedure compared to MX. Despite this qualitative trend, the meta-analysis results were not significant with an HR of 0.78 under the random effects model, with a 95% CI: 0.57-1.09 and I2= 98%, which indicates that there are no significant differences between therapeutic modalities. The heterogeneity levels need to be acknowledged when interpreting these results, and the possibility of publication bias given by the asymmetric result of the funnel plot results. The sources of this level of heterogeneity are possibly differences in patient demographics, tumor subtypes, cancer stages, use of RT, and follow-up durations. Previous studies have shown that these factors can significantly influence DFS outcomes. The practical utility of these results regarding the DFS at five years is that they suggest BCS with RT may offer comparable long-term control to MX, supporting its use in appropriately selected patients.

The analysis of DFS at 10 years revealed an HR of 1.12, indicating a 12% higher risk of disease recurrence or death in the BCS group compared to the MX group. However, this result is not statistically significant, and the analysis demonstrates substantial heterogeneity (I² = 96.4%), indicating potential variation in future study results. Subgroup analysis by country revealed significant differences (p < 0.0001), particularly for studies from Korea. These differences may be influenced by genetic factors, socioeconomic conditions, and the healthcare system. Subgroup analysis by breast cancer stage also showed significant differences (p < 0.0001) for stages I and IIA, suggesting that the stage of breast cancer might influence the comparative effectiveness of BCS and MX. These results could be explained by the sample size of the subgroup affecting the overall result. Omitting studies by Hartmann-Johnsen et al. [22] and Ye et al. [29], identified as potential outliers, resulted in an adjusted HR and reduced heterogeneity (I² = 42.3%), although the overall effect remained non-significant. The heterogeneity produced by Harmann-Johnsen et al. [22] could be due to limited demographic factors such as location (Norway), while Ye et al. contributed to the heterogeneity by specifically including females under 40, an age group where treatment outcomes can be significantly influenced. Similar to our results, a 10-year study conducted by the National Cancer Institute demonstrated no significant differences in DFS at 10 years between MX and BCS, but showed significant differences when analyzing by tumor stage [42]. A longer study conducted from 1995 to 2018 reported no significant differences as well, and no differences with subgroup analysis, providing strong support to the findings in this analysis [43].

Recent meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated that BCS offers superior survival outcomes compared to MX for early-stage breast cancer. A study using data from the National Cancer Database employed a propensity score-matched analysis to control for confounders and found improved overall and BCSS rates compared to MX [44]. Additionally, a meta-analysis with a total of 1,802,128 patients reported that patients who underwent BCS had better OS compared with MX [41]. These findings align with our results, reinforcing the notion that BCS followed by RT should be considered a viable and potentially superior option for early-stage breast cancer.

Our meta-analysis adds several novel insights to the existing literature. Unlike prior studies, our study offers a broader range of observational studies, representing a diverse population, enhancing the generalizability of the study. Our subgroup analyses provide an understanding of which group of patients would benefit from BCS versus MX. The incorporation of long-term data provides insight into the sustained effects of BCS and MX over an extended period, crucial for understanding the durability of treatments. By including recent data, our analysis focuses on treatments and protocols relevant to clinical practice. Comparing our analysis with previous findings reinforces our results and provides a comprehensive and updated understanding of the comparative effectiveness of BCS and MX.

Our meta-analysis has several limitations. Initially, it relies exclusively on observational studies, which are more susceptible to bias and may lack the generalizability and validity of RCTs. The possibility of publication bias, indicated by initial asymmetry in the funnel plot, may distort the evidence pool and jeopardize the accuracy of conclusions. Additionally, wide confidence intervals and significant heterogeneity in the results indicate substantial variability in study outcomes, which should be considered when interpreting our findings. The subjective nature of assessing publication quality can lead to inconsistencies among reviewers, casting doubt on the reliability and objectivity of the study's findings. These limitations underscore the necessity for further research. Future studies should consider clinical variables, regional, and contextual factors that may impact treatment efficacy. Prioritizing research in breast cancer survival involves optimizing treatment modalities and developing tailored survivorship care models to meet the diverse long-term needs of survivors. Addressing health disparities to ensure equitable access to effective treatment is crucial for enhancing the quality of life and long-term outcomes for all breast cancer patients. Efforts to minimize study heterogeneity are essential for improving the reliability and generalizability of meta-analytic findings in this field. While our meta-analysis offers valuable insights into the impact of interventions on local recurrence, regional recurrence, and mortality in breast cancer patients, it also highlights the complexities and challenges of synthesizing data from diverse studies. Continued research and methodological advancements are necessary to address these unresolved questions and enhance our understanding of optimal treatment strategies for breast cancer.

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the complexity of surgical decision-making in early-stage breast cancer. Across diverse populations and study designs, BCS combined with RT was consistently associated with improved overall survival and, in some subgroups, such as early-stage and triple-negative patients, better disease-free survival. These findings support the consideration of BCS plus RT as a preferred treatment strategy when anatomically and clinically feasible. Using the GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation) framework, the certainty of evidence was rated as moderate for overall survival and low for recurrence outcomes, largely due to heterogeneity and the observational nature of included studies. Rather than diminishing the relevance of our findings, this underscores the need for high-quality, prospective research to better define which patients benefit most. Future studies should focus on standardizing outcomes, stratifying by molecular subtype and stage, and reducing variability in real-world practice.
