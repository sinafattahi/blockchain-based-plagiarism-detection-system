Amid rising awareness of both overt and covert racism and the persistence of epistemic injustice within healthcare systems, there is an urgent need to revisit foundational ethical concepts in nursing. This article offers a critical and respectful engagement with Megan‐Jane Johnstone's (2011) conceptualisation of justice as a basic human need grounded in a distributive framework. While her work significantly advanced justice as a moral imperative in nursing, it reflects an individualistic and deontological orientation that can insufficiently address the relational, embodied, and structural dimensions of injustice experienced by racialised patients and practitioners. Drawing on contemporary phenomenological philosophy, relational ethics, and post‐pandemic scholarship, I advance an alternative view of justice as a dynamic, intersubjective, and contextually situated practice. Engaging with thinkers such as Merleau‐Ponty, Carel, Fricker, and proponents of Ubuntu ethics, this article argues for a shift from distributive to relational justice, one that centres mutual recognition, epistemic humility, and ethical responsiveness. Such a reconceptualisation offers a more inclusive and situated ethical framework, capable of responding to the moral complexities and inequities shaping contemporary nursing practice.

In her seminal article Nursing and Justice as a Basic Human Need, Johnstone (2011) foregrounds the importance of justice as not merely a social ideal, but a moral necessity embedded in human dignity. This framing opens a critical space for nursing to explore justice as both a structural commitment and a lived ethical imperative. While healthcare systems increasingly focus on equity, access, and the social determinants of health (Killen et al.2021), the lived dimension of justice in practice i.e., the relational, moment‐to‐moment enactments of justice by nurses, remains relatively under‐theorised.

The International Council of Nurses (ICN2021) explicitly acknowledged the enduring impact of racism and systemic discrimination in healthcare settings. The ICN called on nurses to actively dismantle discriminatory practices and to advocate for racial and social justice as core to nursing ethics. This urgent moral call is echoed in recent scholarly literature (Bailey et al.2017; Braveman et al.2011), which situates racism not merely as a social issue but as a structural determinant of health inequities. The COVID‐19 pandemic has further illuminated the disproportionate impact of these inequities on marginalised populations (Yearby et al.2020), placing increased ethical demands on nurses as both caregivers and advocates.

To deepen our understanding of justice as a lived phenomenon, this paper draws on the existential and intersubjective philosophy of Martin Heidegger (1962) and the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Heidegger's notion of “being‐with” (Mitsein) underscores the inherently relational nature of human existence, which speaks directly to the relational justice inherent in nursing practice. Heidegger positions Dasein not as an isolated subject but as one whose being is always already with others, thereby demanding ethical responsiveness grounded in shared existence.

Complementing this, Ubuntu philosophy advances a vision of interconnected humanity captured in the maxim: “I am because we are.” Ubuntu highlights relationality, empathy, and social cohesion as foundational to justice (Mbiti1969; Metz2011). It brings forth the idea that justice is not only procedural but affective and communal, an orientation to seeing oneself in the face of the other Tembo2023; Ramose2002). These philosophical perspectives are crucial for reimagining relational justice in nursing as something that is not supplemental to social justice but integral to its full expression (Noyoo2017).

Together, these frameworks enable a reconceptualisation of justice that integrates structural and interpersonal dimensions. By situating justice as both a political and ontological concern, nursing practice can move beyond static ethical codes and toward a dynamic praxis that is attuned to suffering, vulnerability, and the demand for moral presence (Sellman2011; Tembo2023; Van Manen2014).

Traditional frameworks in bioethics and nursing often anchor justice in distributive justice i.e., the equitable allocation of resources, rights, and burdens (Beauchamp and Childress2013). This utilitarian and liberal paradigm, though foundational to healthcare policy and ethics, remains insufficient for capturing the affective and existential complexity of nursing practice. Nurses encounter justice not only in policies or clinical guidelines but in the fragile moral spaces where recognition, presence, and ethical responsiveness unfold. Recognition is not an adjunct to justice, it is its pulse, animating the moral life of care (Fraser2003; Slemon et al.2024).

Moving beyond distributive models invites a philosophical reorientation toward recognition‐based justice, where justice is grounded not in what individuals have but in how they are seen, received, and responded to. Drawing on Heidegger's ontology of being‐with (Mitsein), we understand justice as arising from our fundamental relationality. For Heidegger (1962), human existence is not solitary but inherently co‐constituted i.e., we are always already with others. In the clinical space, this means that moral responsibility to the patient is not something assumed externally; it is given in the structure of being. Justice, in this view, is not a principle applied but a way of dwelling ethically with others in their vulnerability (Dreyfus1991; Todres et al.2007). This perspective aligns with contemporary nursing education, which emphasises the integration of social justice principles into practice (Slemon et al.2024).

Ubuntu philosophy, with its emphasis on communal identity and ethical interdependence, enriches this notion. Ubuntu proclaims,“I am because we are”, locating justice in the shared fabric of human life (Metz2011; Ramose2002). Recognition, from this perspective, is an act of solidarity, a way of seeing oneself in the other. It refuses the abstraction of persons into categories or clinical objects. Justice is relational, affective, and situational, it happens when one acknowledges the other's humanity not as a duty, but as the affirmation of mutual belonging (Bayuo2025; Mulaudzi et al.2025). In this way, Ubuntu challenges the individualism often implicit in Western liberal ethics and offers a more holistic, embodied conception of justice grounded in interconnectedness, empathy, and care (Tembo2023).

Further deepening this account, Merleau‐Ponty's phenomenology reminds us that recognition unfolds through the body, not abstract cognition. As embodied beings, we perceive, gesture, and respond to one another in a shared world of meaning (Merleau‐Ponty1962). Justice, then, becomes a corporeal ethic, a responsiveness felt in the nurse's gaze, in silence shared at the bedside, or in a touch that dignifies rather than objectifies. Recent studies highlight how Merleau‐Ponty's concepts of corporeality and relationality provide a useful foundation for understanding the lived experiences of patients and nurses during critical illness (Cypress2024; Tembo2017). The other is not simplythereto be served but appears through an affective encounter that reveals their vulnerability and personhood.

This phenomenological orientation reclaims justice as a lived experience, a moral responsiveness that takes place in and through relationship. It challenges the adequacy of justice conceived solely in procedural or distributive terms and calls for a more radical attentiveness to the moral textures of practice. In this sense, nursing becomes not merely a technical discipline governed by ethical codes but a moral vocation animated by the call to recognise, to dwell with, and to respond. Justice as recognition is not about outcomes alone, it is about presence.

Relational justice emerges not as a set of principles, but as an ethical event, ahappeningwithin the lived encounter between nurse and patient. It is grounded in the immediacy of presence, the moral resonance of vulnerability, and the capacity to remain ethically attuned to another's suffering. This concept draws heavily from Tronto (1993) ethics of care, which defines care as a practice shaped by attentiveness, responsibility, competence, and responsiveness. In this framework, justice is not an abstract rule to be applied, but an ongoing ethical responsiveness to the concrete, situated needs of others.

Similarly, Bergum and Dossetor's (2005) notion of relational ethics advances the idea that the ethical moment is forged in relationship through trust, mutuality, and authentic engagement. In the clinical encounter, the nurse is not merely delivering care but entering an intersubjective space where each person's vulnerability calls forth a shared ethical obligation. The self is not separate from the other; rather, the nurse is constituted in relation. Here, justice becomes an act of staying, of refusing to retreat into detachment or efficiency, and instead choosing to be ethically present. I am called into care not through obligation alone, but because I recognise the other's vulnerability as akin to my own, a mirror that reflects our shared humanity.

This responsiveness is embodied, not merely cognitive. Drawing on Merleau‐Ponty (1962) phenomenology, we understand that the nurse does not meet the patient as an abstract moral agent but as a sensing, moving, feeling body. The ethical response arises not just in speech or protocol, but in posture, in touch, in silence. Justice becomes visible in the subtle ways the nursemakes roomfor the other's suffering: adjusting a pillow, sitting without speaking, making eye contact that affirms dignity (Tembo2017). The body becomes the site where moral recognition is both expressed and received. I do notthinkmy way into justice, I live it.

This embodied presence is also deeply ontological. Heidegger (1962) concept ofMitsein, being‐with insists that our existence is always relational. I am never simply an isolated “I” providing care to a distant “you.” Rather, we are thrown together in the shared world of illness, vulnerability, and human finitude. The nurse, in responding to the patient, is also responding to their own being‐toward‐death, their own thrownness, their own existential precarity (Tembo et al.2023). Justice, then, is not an external task to be fulfilled, but a way of being‐with‐others in the truth of our shared condition. The ethical demand does not wait, it arises immediately, in the quiet drama of human interdependence.

Ubuntu philosophy offers a profound articulation of relational justice, especially within contexts marked by structural violence and historical marginalization. Central to Ubuntu is the maxim:“a person is a person through other persons”, emphasizing the intrinsic interconnectedness of humanity (Ewuoso and Hall2019). This worldview compels an ethics rooted in social cohesion and mutual recognition, where justice is actualized through acts of care, respect, and solidarity (Mugumbate et al.2023). Recognizing oneself in the other underscores the belief that another's dignity is inherently linked to one's own, and their suffering diminishes the collective well‐being. Ubuntu challenges notions of justice that are solely procedural or bureaucratically neutral, instead anchoring justice in communal relationships, where connection is not merely a context for care but its very foundation (Matahela and Ngwenya2025).

This relational perspective unsettles dominant ethical frameworks in nursing, which often prioritize individual autonomy, impartiality, and rational decision‐making. Ubuntu reminds us that care is not a unidirectional act but a shared experience. The nurse and patient cocreate a moral space where justice becomes possible, a space that is delicate and requires continual reaffirmation in practice (Mulaudzi et al.2025). Choosing to engage rather than withdraw, to listen rather than turn away, embodies the essence of relational justice.

Ultimately, relational justice affirms that the significance in care lies not only in actions taken but in the manner of their execution and the transformation of those involved. It is a justice that listens, lingers, and honours presence, recognising the other not as an object of care but as a co‐subject in an evolving, ethically charged world. In this way, relational justice does not oppose social justice but enriches and humanizes it, reminding us that the pursuit of equity must encompass the quiet revolution of presence (Nolte and Downing2019).

A key philosophical tension lies in the disjunction between systemic imperatives for social justice and the intimate relational ethics that unfold in everyday nursing practice. On one hand, nurses are increasingly positioned as agents of structural change i.e., tasked with identifying and redressing the broader determinants of health, including systemic racism, poverty, and marginalisation (American Nurses Association2023; International Council of Nurses2023). These imperatives are essential and ethically urgent. Yet, they are frequently articulated through the abstract logic of policy, data, and distributive principles, frameworks that, while necessary, can remain distant from the lived experience of care (Tembo et al.2023).

On the other hand, nurses operate in the immediacy of the clinical moment, responding to patients not as demographic categories or members of a marginalised group, but as singular, suffering persons. These moments are often ethically ambiguous, emotionally complex, and saturated with vulnerability. They resist abstraction. The nurse must respond not only as a representative of a just system but as a moral presence within a fragile intersubjective encounter (Gullick et al.2020). This dual demand creates a tension between macro‐level justice work and micro‐level ethical responsiveness.

Philosophically, this tension is not merely practical, it is ontological. As Heidegger (1962) argues, our being is always already being‐with (Mitsein); we are not isolated subjects applying principles from a distance, but relational beings thrown into a shared world. The nurse does not stand outside the suffering of the other to objectively administer justice but is implicated in that suffering called into it by the very structure of human relationality. To reduce care to a systemic mandate is to overlook the moral demand that arises from shared existence.

Merleau‐Ponty (1962) deepens this insight by situating ethical action within the body. I do not encounter the patient as an abstraction, but as a presence that touches and moves me in the immediacy of perception. The body becomes the site where justice is not merely thought but felt and enacted. In this view, the system may fail to recognise the patient in front of me, but I must not. My ethical responsibility is not only institutional, but also incarnate.

Ubuntu offers yet another axis for understanding this tension. Its emphasis on interdependence “I am because we are” positions justice not as a matter of external redistribution alone but as a lived ethic of mutual recognition and social cohesion (Letseka2013). Ubuntu refuses the split between individual and community, between policy and presence. From this perspective, systemic and relational imperatives are not necessarily opposed but must be held in dynamic tension (Ewuoso and Hall2021). When I care for the other, I am participating in a wider justice, one that begins in the face of the other but extends into the structures that shape our possibilities for flourishing (Tembo et al.2023).

Yet the integration of these dimensions remains fraught. Nurses are often left to navigate this space without adequate philosophical support (Tembo2023). They may be trained to identify health inequities but not necessarily to dwell with the moral dissonance of treating an undocumented patient in a system that denies them access, or to recognise the existential weight of bearing witness to preventable suffering (Andrews et al.2023). The structural is always present in the room encoded in charts, funding decisions, and triage policies but so is the cry of the particular (Kenny et al.2021; McInerney et al.2024). This tension between systemic injustice and individual moral presence requires nurses to hold space for both, often without institutional support or philosophical grounding (Peter and Liaschenko2013; Tembo et al.2023). To do justice in such spaces requires more than compliance with ethical codes, it requires moral imagination, presence, and the courage to act when systems remain indifferent (Tembo2017).

Thus, the tension between systemic and relational justice is not a problem to be solved but a space to be ethically inhabited (Peter and Liaschenko2013; Kenny et al.2021). It demands of nurses not only clinical expertise and policy literacy but also philosophical depth, a capacity to hold the brokenness of systems and the sanctity of the moment together without collapsing one into the other (Tembo2023; McInerney et al.2024). Nursing, in this sense, becomes a practice of ethical straddling: bearing systemic awareness while responding with situated care. This is lived justice (Andrews et al.2023; Van Manen2016).

Tembo (2023) reminds us that the inclusion of philosophy in nursing is not a luxury, but a necessity. Philosophy offers not only reflective distance, but a language for the unspoken tensions, the moral ambiguities, and the ethical ruptures that shape nursing's everyday encounters. Without this depth, nursing risks becoming a technocratic practice, detached from the affective, ontological, and moral textures that constitute care.

Justice, from a phenomenological standpoint, is not only an abstract virtue or institutional goal, but also a mode of ethical disclosure (Tembo2017). It unfolds in the contours of the lifeworld, in the proximity between nurse and patient, in the pause, in the gaze, in the silence that holds suffering (Tembo et al.2023). It is experienced rather than imposed. It calls forth the nurse not through command, but through the face of the other, what Levinas might describe as an interruption of the self, a demand that cannot be ignored (van der Merwe and Murove2021).

Heidegger's concept ofMitsein(being‐with) deepens this orientation. To be is always to be‐with‐others; our very existence is structured by relationality (Heidegger1962). In nursing, this means the patient is not simply an object of care but a co‐inhabitor of the moral space of the encounter (Gullick et al.2020). The call of justice is not mediated through policy or protocol but through the shared world (Mitwelt) in which both nurse and patient dwell. Justice, then, is enacted when I dwell well with the other i.e., when I attune myself to their suffering, their fragility, their humanity.

Ubuntu offers a vital decolonial expansion of this phenomenological insight. Where Heidegger reveals the relational structure of being, Ubuntu makes it ethically explicit: “I am because we are.” This aphorism reframes justice as inherently communal, affective, and interdependent (Ramose2002; Tembo et al.2023). To live justly is to recognise oneself in the face of another; to refuse indifference; to embody solidarity. In Ubuntu, justice is not adjudicated, it is cultivated through care, empathy, and social cohesion. It speaks to a justice of recognition, not only of rights but of personhood, dignity, and presence (Ewuoso and Hall2021).

Justice in this framework is not distant or abstract; it is immediate, fleshy, and real. It is sensed through intercorporeality, through Merleau‐Ponty (1962) notion of the body‐subject. As nurses, we do not relate from a distance i.e., we lean in, we touch, we listen, we hold. Our bodies are not neutral instruments but sites of moral encounter (Tembo2023). Justice, then, is not merely thought, it is lived. It is what happens when a nurse recognises that the suffering before them is not alien, but proximate; not theirs to fix, but theirs to respond to.

In this way, a phenomenology of justice insists that ethical nursing practice cannot be confined to institutional mandates or distributive principles. Rather, it must encompass the vulnerable, embodied, and affective dimensions of care (Tembo et al.2023). Nurses are not merely agents of a system; they are moral subjects dwelling in the shared lifeworld of illness, pain, and hope. Justice must be lived, not merely legislated.

This philosophical critique repositions justice not only as a structural mandate but as a lived, relational, and moral phenomenon within nursing. By integrating the social justice commitments of contemporary nursing ethics with phenomenological insights into relational being, I argue that justice must be reclaimed as a praxis of presence, resistance, and moral imagination. Justice is not an abstract standard to be applied, but a way of being‐with the other that responds to suffering, affirms dignity, and resists the erasure of personhood.

Justice becomes praxis when it is enacted in the ordinary, quiet moments of carei.e.,when I stay with the patient's discomfort, when I notice what is left unsaid, when I honour stories that resist medicalisation. In these moments, I resist the reduction of the other to a diagnosis, a protocol, or a demographic. Instead, I respond as a moral agent situated within a web of embodied relations and systemic constraints. This ethical stance requires courage and imagination, an openness to the ambiguity of care and the creativity to act justly even when the system does not.

Tembo (2023) asserts that philosophy provides the language and reflective depth necessary for nursing to articulate and navigate its ethical tensions. Through a phenomenological lens, we come to see that justice in nursing is not simply a matter of equity in policy, but of equity in presence. Nurses, as moral agents, must develop the capacity to bear witness, to feel disruption, and to act responsively within structures that often silence such responses.

Reclaiming justice as lived praxis challenges us to reconfigure nursing ethics beyond compliance and toward a mode of being that is attuned, vulnerable, and radically responsible. Justice, in this frame, is not only something I demand from the world, but something I must embody in my gestures, my silences, my listening, and my refusal to look away.
