Stropharia rugosoannulata, commonly known as the wine-cap mushroom or giantStropharia, is an edible fungus naturally distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by a wine-red cap, a wrinkled-ring-bearing stipe, and a large, thick, and fleshy fruiting body with a crisp and tender texture. This species is rich in nutrients such as proteins, amino acids, and minerals and contains various bioactive compounds including polysaccharides, polyphenols, and flavonoids, thereby providing it with both nutritional and health-promoting properties.S. rugosoannulatacan grow on a wide range of agricultural and forestry waste substrates and is highly amenable to artificial cultivation. It has been recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations for cultivation in developing countries. Originally cultivated in Germany, this mushroom later spread to other European countries and the USA and was introduced to China in the 1980s. Due to its cultivation characteristics being highly compatible with China’s agricultural conditions, the species has rapidly expanded in the country. Since the implementation of China’s Rural Revitalization and Targeted Poverty Alleviation strategies in 2013, large-scale cultivation projects ofS. rugosoannulatahave been actively promoted, establishing China as the world’s leading producers and greatly stimulating industrial development. This review summarizes the current state of theS. rugosoannulataindustry in China and explores potential directions for the extension of its industrial chain, aiming to provide a reference for its sustainable development and international promotion.

• S. rugosoannulata exhibits high nutritional, medicinal, and ecological value.

• China has become the world’s leading producers of S. rugosoannulata.

• The development of S. rugosoannulata industry in China provides a model for the world.

Stropharia rugosoannulataFarl. ex Murrill (1922), commonly known as the wine-cap mushroom or giantStropharia, is a large basidiomycete fungus belonging to the genusStropharia, familyStrophariaceae, and orderAgaricales(Huang1995). In Chinese pronunciation, it is referred to as “Daqiugaigu,” where “Da” means giant and “qiugaigu” means the genusStropharia. Wild populations ofS. rugosoannulataare mainly distributed in temperate regions of Europe, North America, and Asia. Fruiting bodies typically appear in spring and autumn and are commonly found in grassy areas, forest edges, woodchip piles, or compost heaps containing cow or horse manure (Huang et al.2023b). The fruiting bodies occur singly or in clusters. When immature, the fruit bodies are white; as they mature, the caps become wine-red to reddish-brown. Initially hemispherical, the caps flatten with age and can reach up to 25 cm in diameter, often covered with fibrous white scales. The flesh is thick and white. The stipe is white, up to 15 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter, thickened at the base and featuring a prominent annulus near the apex. The annulus is wrinkled and easily detached (Huang1995). The gills are initially white, turning purplish-gray upon maturity, and the spore print is dark purplish-brown. The mycelium is white in color (Szudyga1978; Stamets and Chilton1983). During development, the stipe morphology changes: in the young stage, the stipe is short and thick with a bulbous base tapering toward the top, while in the mature stage, the stipe elongates and maintains a more uniform diameter throughout (Huang et al.2023c).

S. rugosoannulatais a litter-decomposing fungus that primarily relies on carbon and nitrogen sources for nutrition (Pozdnyakova et al.2018). Its mycelium efficiently decomposes substrates rich in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, converting them into carbon sources for growth (Guo et al.2023). Although it exhibits minimal selectivity for nitrogen source types, it is highly sensitive to nitrogen concentration, as low levels of nitrogen promote mycelial branching and proliferation (Zhang et al.2023a,b,c).

Temperature and moisture are critical environmental factors influencing spore germination, mycelial growth, primordium formation, and fruiting body morphology (Table1). As a moderate-temperature species,S. rugosoannulataspores require cold stratification (5 °C for 30 days) prior to germination, which occurs optimally at temperatures above 24 °C, with the ideal germination temperature being 28 °C (Bao et al.2016). Mycelial growth occurs within a wide temperature range (5–35 °C), with an optimum at 26 °C. Growth slows significantly below 10 °C and ceases below 5 °C, though the mycelium remains viable. Temperatures exceeding 35 °C inhibit or kill the mycelium (Chen et al.2021). Primordium formation is triggered by a drop in temperature to 10–20 °C (Stamets and Chilton1983). At lower temperatures (around 16 °C), the fruiting bodies are stout and compact, grow slowly, and are less likely to open. In contrast, at higher temperatures (around 24 °C), the fruiting bodies grow rapidly, are slender and loose, and are prone to early cap opening (Huang et al.2023b).

Optimal mycelial growth requires a substrate moisture content of 65%–80%, with 75% being ideal (Yan et al.2001). For fruiting body growth, the preferred ambient relative humidity is 85%–95%, which ensures a moist mushroom surface and prevents cap cracking (Yan et al.2001). When relative humidity drops below 60%, stipe cracking becomes more likely (Huang et al.2023c).

Unlike other members of the genusStropharia,S. rugosoannulatadoes not produce the hallucinogenic neurotoxin psilocybin and is therefore considered a completely safe edible mushroom (Yang et al.2022). Its fruiting bodies are rich in proteins, amino acids, mineral elements, carbohydrates (including dietary fiber), B vitamins, and unsaturated fatty acids, with an amino acid composition that meets the standards of high-quality protein (Huang et al.2023a). Compared to commonly cultivated edible mushrooms such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), and black fungus (Auricularia auricula),S. rugosoannulatacontains higher levels of proteins, amino acids, and minerals. Notably, it has the highest potassium content among edible mushrooms, reaching 3.58 g·100 g−1, making it a typical example of a high-protein, low-fat, and mineral-rich mushroom (Liu et al.2024a,b). In addition to its nutritional value,S. rugosoannulatais rich in taste-enhancing compounds, including umami peptides, free amino acids, soluble sugars, organic acids, and taste-active nucleotides (Hu et al.2020a; Li et al.2022a; Lu et al.2022). It also possesses a variety of characteristic aroma compounds, predominantly alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones (Jiang et al.2023). With its large size, thick flesh, and crisp texture,S. rugosoannulatacan be consumed raw as sashimi or cooked in various ways such as in soups, hot pots, pan-fried, or stir-fried dishes. It is thus recognized as a high-quality edible mushroom that combines health benefits, nutritional richness, and palatable flavor.

S. rugosoannulatais rich in a variety of bioactive compounds with significant pharmacological potential, including polysaccharides, polyphenols, sterols, peptides, lectins, flavonoids, and ergothioneine (Huang et al.2023a). Studies have shown that these functional components exhibit a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as immunomodulatory, antitumor, antioxidant, antiviral, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and anti-obesity activities. In particular, the polysaccharides derived fromS. rugosoannulataare abundant and have been demonstrated to exert preventive or adjuvant therapeutic effects against several chronic metabolic disorders and cancers, including hyperglycemia, coronary heart disease, hepatic steatosis, obesity, and various malignancies (He et al.2012; Liu et al.2019a,b; Wang et al.2021; Li et al.2022b). Thus,S. rugosoannulatais regarded as a promising natural medicinal resource with substantial potential for development.

The mycelia ofS. rugosoannulatahave demonstrated considerable potential in soil and water bioremediation. Studies have shown that it can effectively degrade wood preservatives such as polychlorophenols, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from sawmill soils and timber (Valentín et al.2013). During the degradation of tree litter, the mycelium employs laccase-mediated oxidation to break down organic pollutants including nonylphenol, bisphenol A, and anthracene (Pozdnyakova et al.2018). Moreover, the fungus is capable of degrading 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in soil (Weiß et al.2004) and accumulating toxic heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) from soil or substrate matrices (Gabriel et al.2016; Dong et al.2022). In aquatic systems, it has been reported to efficiently decolorize industrial effluents containing azo and anthraquinonic dyes (Jarosz-Wilkołazka et al.2002), degrade pharmaceutical contaminants like carbamazepine in domestic wastewater (removal rate exceeding 70%), and partially remove cyclophosphamide (Castellet-Rovira et al.2017). It also exhibits antibacterial activity against common waterborne pathogens such asEscherichia coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Sen et al.2023).

The cultivation ofS. rugosoannulatacan utilize nearly all types of commonly available agricultural biomass waste (e.g., crop straw, tree litter, livestock and poultry manure) as growth substrates (Liu et al.2021). This practice reduces air pollution and CO₂ emissions caused by the open burning of agroforestry residues (Hu et al.2025). It avoids deforestation and pesticide use, helping to conserve forests and reduce soil contamination. The cultivation process is simple and labor-intensive but physically undemanding, making it particularly suitable for the participation of physically challenged individuals in rural areas (Huang et al.2023b). Moreover, the spent substrate can be directly applied to the field, where it significantly improves soil structure, enhances soil fertility, and increases microbial diversity, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers (Liu et al.2021). Therefore,S. rugosoannulatacultivation represents an ecologically sound agricultural practice and a model of circular economy well-suited for broad adoption in developing countries (Liu et al.2021; Hu et al.2025). It also contributes to achieving two major goals of the United Nations: poverty reduction and climate change mitigation (FAO2022).

Before human cultivation began, wildS. rugosoannulatafruiting bodies were frequently foraged due to their large size, attractive wine-red cap, mild flavor, and edibility. In 1922, American mycologist William A. Murrill first scientifically described this mushroom species (Murrill1922). The earliest record of artificial cultivation appeared in 1969, when German farmers successfully domesticated the mushroom using straw. Subsequently, countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Netherland, and the former Soviet Union introduced and cultivated the species (Sharma et al.2007). By 1989, production ofS. rugosoannulatain Europe had reached approximately 1300 tons (Domondon et al.2000), though no further production data were reported thereafter. In 1983, mycologist Paul Stamets described the cultivation characteristics of the mushroom in his book The Mushroom Cultivator and introduced European strains of cultivatedS. rugosoannulatainto the USA, marking the transition of the species from wild to cultivated status there (Stamets and Chilton1983). In the 1980 s, a strain was introduced from Poland to Shanghai, China, with successful trial cultivation but no subsequent promotion. In 1992, Fujian province reintroduced the species and, after successful trials, began to promote its cultivation (Huang1995) (Fig.1).

With the increasing recognition ofS. rugosoannulata’s value in environmental protection and bioremediation, the cultivation purpose in some countries has gradually shifted from the production of edible fruiting bodies to the utilization of its mycelium for the efficient absorption and degradation of pollutants. Globally, growers in North America or New Zealand primarily cultivateS. rugosoannulataas a landscape mushroom in the city garden or in the backyard, using hardwood chips or straw beds as substrates (Stamets and Chilton1983). In Europe, commercial cultivation has ceased, and the species is now primarily used for the remediation of contaminated soil and water bodies (Valentín et al.2013). In these regions, the scale of cultivation is relatively small, and there is a lack of statistical data. At present, China is the only country to have achieved large-scale commercial cultivation ofS. rugosoannulata, and since 2013, its production data have been included in the national annual statistical reports on edible fungi (China Edible Fungi Association2025). China has become the world’s leading producer ofS. rugosoannulata.

The cultivation characteristics ofS. rugosoannulataalign well with China’s abundant natural resources, an aging rural labor force with low incomes, and predominantly temperate to subtropical geographic zones. Since 2013, driven by the Chinese government’s targeted poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies, the cultivation ofS. rugosoannulatahas been rapidly promoted as a flagship project. Its cultivation areas have expanded across all provinces in the country, and its production volume has increased sharply. According to statistics,S. rugosoannulatais now cultivated in all 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China (Huang et al.2023b), and the total fresh mushroom yield reached 494,745 tons in 2023 (China Edible Fungi Association2025), more than 17 times the yield in 2017 (Fig.2A). The total cultivation area exceeded 6000 hectares, with Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi being the major producing provinces (Fig.3). However, China is the world’s largest producer of edible fungi, with an annual output exceeding 40 million tons (Li and Xu2022). Compared with major species such asL. edodes,A. auricula,P. ostreatus, andA. bisporus, each with an annual production of over 1.5 million tons,S. rugosoannulatais still considered a minor edible fungus species in China (Fig.2B).

With continuous efforts from Chinese edible mushroom partitioners, advancements in food processing technologies, and growing public awareness of nutrition and health, significant progress has been made in the processing and product development ofS. rugosoannulata. A growing variety ofS. rugosoannulataproducts is now available in the market. A relatively complete industry chain has taken shape, covering all stages from strain selection, cultivation to post-harvest processing and product sales.

Germplasm resources serve as the foundation and origin of theS. rugosoannulataindustry. With the increasing scope and depth of wild fungal resource surveys in China, wildS. rugosoannulatawas first discovered in Tibet in 1993. Since then, new wild strains have been continuously identified in regions such as Yunnan, Jilin, Taiwan, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hunan, Ningxia, and Shandong (Huang1995; Huang et al.2024; Fu et al.2025) (Fig.3). Concurrently, as the cultivation scale ofS. rugosoannulatahas expanded, color-mutant strains with stable genetic traits have been successively identified in various regions (Fu et al.2025).

At present, Chinese researchers in the field of edible fungi have developed numerous newS. rugosoannulatacultivars (strains) through various approaches, including domestication of wild strains, systematic selection, mutagenesis breeding, and hybridization. These new strains exhibit advantageous traits such as high yield, strong resistance, wide adaptability, and diverse coloration, and they largely meet the cultivation requirements across different regions of China, which vary greatly in climatic conditions (Table2). In 2024, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences reported that, based on genetic diversity analysis of 50S. rugosoannulatastrains collected from across China, these strains could be divided into two groups: cultivated and wild. The cultivated strains exhibited high genetic similarity, whereas the wild strains showed significant genetic diversity (Gu et al.2024).

The letters R, Y, and W denote red, yellow, and white cap color varieties, respectively.

S. rugosoannulatais considered one of the easiest edible mushrooms to cultivate globally. Unlike wood-rotting fungi such asL. edodesandA. auricula,S. rugosoannulatacan utilize almost all types of agricultural and forestry residues as substrates. Its cultivation does not require bagging, sterilization, or aseptic inoculation equipment. Instead, raw or fermented materials can be directly spread as substrate beds, manually inoculated with spawn, and covered with a simple casing layer (e.g., soil or leaf litter) (Stamets and Chilton1983). Due to its minimal technical requirements and high edible value, it has been recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for cultivation in developing countries (Huang et al.2023b).

Currently,S. rugosoannulatais cultivated in China using three main models: field cultivation, forest cultivation, and facility cultivation (Guo et al.2025). Field cultivation involves rotation with crops such as wheat, rice, or vegetables, utilizing farmland during the off-season after harvest (Hu et al.2025). Forest cultivation entails intercropping with trees to make full use of space beneath forest canopies or in orchards (Zhang et al.2017; Gong et al.2018). These two models dominateS. rugosoannulatacultivation in China and typically rely on natural climate conditions for seasonal fruiting. They are characterized by low production costs, ease of management, and favorable economic returns. Facility cultivation is primarily adopted in northern China and high-altitude regions, enabling off-season production during summer and winter (Wei et al.2021).

Based on reported data from various regions, all three cultivation models predominantly involve sowing in autumn. The average yields are ranked as follows: Facility cultivation (7.89 kg·m−2) > forest cultivation (7.24 kg·m−2) > field cultivation (6.47 kg·m−2). Similarly, the average net profits are ranked: facility cultivation (25,293.5 CNY·667 m−2) > forest cultivation (15,316.51 CNY·667 m−2) > field cultivation (9,003.4 CNY·667 m−2). The amount of substrate used is a key factor affecting yield, with all three cultivation models showing a linear increase in yield with increased substrate input (Guo et al.2025).

At present, the consumer-end products ofS. rugosoannulatain China include fresh mushrooms as well as various levels of processed products (Fig.4), forming a multi-level product structure.

FreshS. rugosoannulatamushrooms are characterized by vibrant coloration, thick and meaty texture, pleasant aroma, and crisp mouthfeel, making them suitable for various cooking methods such as soups, hotpots, stir-frying, and deep-frying. They can also be consumed raw as sashimi. Fresh mushrooms constitute the primary consumer product form ofS. rugosoannulatain China and hold a notable position in the fresh edible mushroom market.

Although three color varieties ofS. rugosoannulatahave been bred in China, only the red and yellow types are currently available in the mushroom market (Wang et al.2025a,b) (Fig.5A,B). The red type, representing the wild phenotype, is widely cultivated and marketed across the country. The yellow variety, derived from a spontaneous color mutation during the cultivation of the red type, was first reported in 2021 and has since entered the market on a small scale in provinces such as Yunnan and Sichuan (Huang et al.2024). The white variety, obtained through radiation-induced mutagenesis of the red strain, was first reported in 2025 and has completed demonstration cultivation but has not yet been commercially promoted (Song et al.2025) (Fig.5C).

Researchers have exploited the bioaccumulation capacity ofS. rugosoannulatafor zinc, selenium, flavonoid, and 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ, an alkaloid isolated from mulberry trees with hypoglycemic activity and clinical applications in the treatment of type II diabetes) to cultivate nutritionally enhanced mushrooms enriched with these substances. This has been achieved by applying specific supplements such as ZnSO₄ and Na₂SeO₃ or by selecting targeted cultivation substrates, includingPueraria lobataresidue (rich in flavonoid) and mulberry sawdust (Song et al.2009; Wang2018; Zeng et al.2018; Liu et al.2019a,b; Li et al.2021).

PostharvestS. rugosoannulatafruiting bodies are typically graded based on morphological characteristics, weight, cap development (whether the cap has opened), and the presence of physical damage. Undeveloped caps with intact, undamaged, and well-formed fruiting bodies are classified into commercial grades, whereas opened caps or mushrooms with deformities or mechanical damage are considered off-grade (non-commercial) products. Liu and Su (2024) proposed a grading system based primarily on stipe morphology and weight, categorizing commercial mushrooms into three grades: first-grade mushrooms have greater weight and short, thick stipes; second-grade mushrooms are similarly heavy but with elongated stipes; and third-grade mushrooms are lighter in weight. They also developed a lightweight, efficient real-time image recognition and classification model forS. rugosoannulata, which can be applied in automated sorting systems to overcome the limitations of manual grading, such as high labor intensity, low efficiency, and reduced accuracy. Higher-grade mushrooms are typically marketed as fresh products, while lower-grade and off-grade mushrooms are usually processed into value-added products.

Compared with other edible mushrooms,S. rugosoannulatafruiting bodies have a higher moisture content and strong postharvest respiration, making them highly susceptible to quality deterioration such as weight loss, cap opening, browning, softening, and mold growth (Zhang et al.2025). Therefore, primary processing is essential to extend shelf life.

In the fresh produce market, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is commonly used to preserve postharvestS. rugosoannulata. This includes methods such as short-term anaerobic treatment combined with micro-perforated packaging (SAT-MP) or the use of novel nanocomposite packaging materials (Ye et al.2023; Liu et al.2024a,b). Additionally, coating with a solution of 0.5% chitosan and CaCl₂ is employed as a preservation technique (Zhang et al.2025), typically in combination with cold storage to delay quality degradation and extend shelf life.

Dried products are the predominant form of primary processed mushrooms due to their long shelf life.S. rugosoannulatadried products are typically produced through hot air drying, vacuum freeze-drying (lyophilization), or microwave drying (Hu et al.2020a; Liu et al.2022; Chen et al.2023; Jia et al.2024). Among these, freeze-dried mushrooms excel at retaining proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and other key nutrients, while preserving the original shape, bioactive compounds, flavor profile, color, and aroma of the fresh mushroom. They are lightweight, crisp, and considered the highest-quality dried product, albeit at a higher processing cost (Liu et al.2018; Jiang et al.2023). Hot air drying, while economical and simple to operate, causes some loss of color, shape, and nutrients but yields a product with enhanced flavor and higher vitamin D₂ content (Liu et al.2022; Jiang et al.2023), making it the most commonly available dried form on the market. Microwave-dried mushrooms exhibit low rehydration rates, significant shrinkage, color change, and lower overall flavor compound content and umami value, resulting in comparatively lower product quality (Yu et al.2021; Wu et al.2024).

Brining and quick freezing are also widely used primary processing methods for edible fungi. BrinedS. rugosoannulatais a traditional product prepared by blanching followed by heavy salting or immersion in highly concentrated brine, allowing for preservation exceeding 2 months (Wu and Chen2007). Quick freezing is a low-temperature technique that best retains color, texture, and form. When processed at − 40 °C, vacuum packaged, and stored at ≤ 1 °C,S. rugosoannulatacan be preserved for more than 3 months (Wang et al.2020).

Deep-processed products ofS. rugosoannulatarefer to various foods developed using this mushroom as a raw material. In China, a wide array of such products currently exists, including mushroom powder, biscuits, soup bases, crisps, beverages, seasonings, and ready-to-eat items. With ongoing advances in food processing technologies, the diversity of these products continues to expand.

The quality ofS. rugosoannulatapowder has been shown to be significantly influenced by drying methods, processing techniques, and particle size. In terms of color, freeze-dried powder is bright white and closely resembles the color of fresh fruiting bodies; hot-air-dried powder appears darker, with a color intensity negatively correlated with drying temperature; and microwave-dried powder exhibits the darkest hue (Hu et al.2020b). When polysaccharides are extracted from the powder using hot water, smaller particle sizes yield higher polysaccharide content and extraction efficiency (Lu et al.2021). Compared with conventional micronized powder, nanoscale powder demonstrates markedly improved solubility in water and enhanced umami, saltiness, and aroma, making it suitable for development into salt substitutes and flavor enhancers (Ban et al.2024a). Twin-screw extrusion processing significantly increases soluble dietary fiber content and digestibility of the powder while improving water and oil holding capacities and its adsorption capacity for cholesterol and nitrite, thus making it suitable for producing high-soluble dietary fiber powders (Ban et al.2024b).

As an intermediate product,S. rugosoannulatapowder can be further processed for functional component extraction or used as an ingredient in the development of novel foods. For example, moderately milled powders (average particle size ~ 36.63 µm) can be blended with water and processed under ultra-high pressure to produce soups with enriched flavor compound concentrations (Lu et al.2022). Incorporation of mushroom powder into low-gluten flour enables the production of functional mushroom biscuits with richS. rugosoannulataflavor, crisp texture, and elevated levels of protein, dietary fiber, and total phenolics, along with notable antioxidant properties (Zhong et al.2024). When mixed with wheat flour, corn starch, and other ingredients, the powder can also be used to prepare convenient soup bases with the characteristic flavor ofS. rugosoannulata(Hu2019).

S. rugosoannulatabeverages are typically prepared from its homogenate, aqueous extract, or enzymatic hydrolysate, supplemented with various auxiliary ingredients and sometimes fermented. Common products include vinegar (Yang2016), alcoholic drinks (Li et al.2018), protein beverages (Li2016), and compound functional beverages (Zhang et al.2020). These products are generally characterized by balanced nutrition, unique flavor, and pleasant taste and have shown functional properties such as antioxidant, anti-fatigue, and cosmetic effects.

Seasonings developed fromS. rugosoannulatainclude flavored soy sauce produced by adding its hot-water extract and sucrose to brewed soy sauce followed by heating, filtration, and preservation treatment (Wang2019), as well as umami-enhancing mushroom essence and condiments obtained by concentrating its aqueous extract via membrane separation and flavor blending (Xue et al.2022).

Ready-to-eat products made fromS. rugosoannulatarefer to seasoned and cooked items that are packaged for immediate consumption. Common forms include brined mushroom cans (Tang and Gao2005), flexible-packaged products (Sun2014), and a variety of flavored items (e.g., spicy, sweet) (Zhao et al.2024), as well as beef sauce containing dicedS. rugosoannulata(Fu et al.2024). These items offer long shelf life, convenience, and diversified flavor profiles, making them well-suited to the fast-paced demands of modern consumers.

Refined products ofS. rugosoannulatarefer to high-purity extracts of bioactive compounds or nutrients isolated from its fruiting bodies or mycelia. These extracts serve as key raw materials for high value-added products such as functional foods, pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics. Such products typically possess high technological content and economic value. However, most of these products remain at the stage of laboratory research or preliminary development, with no mature examples having reached industrial-scale application.S. rugosoannulataextracts can be broadly categorized into total extracts and single extracts.

Total extracts refer to mixtures of various bioactive components obtained through physical or chemical methods, generally in relatively high yields. These include water-soluble polysaccharides, proteins, peptides, polyphenols, flavonoids, and dietary fiber (Table3). Among them, water-soluble polysaccharides are the most extensively studied and deeply characterized bioactive compounds. They exhibit a range of biological activities, including antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, hepatoprotective (e.g., against fatty liver), and pancreatic lipase inhibitory effects (Liu et al.2019a,b; Wang et al.2021; Li et al.2022a,b,c; Hao et al.2023; Huang et al.2023a; Ma et al.2025). When ultrasound-assisted extraction is employed, the polysaccharide yield from fruiting bodies can reach up to 13.25% (Wei et al.2023b). Therefore, these polysaccharides have potential applications as immunoenhancing agents or adjunct therapies for metabolic disorders such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia and can also be utilized as functional additives in health foods.

In addition,S. rugosoannulataproteins are not only nutritionally valuable—capable of meeting essential amino acid requirements—but also demonstrate certain functional bioactivities. Protein content inS. rugosoannulatacan exceed 30% and has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-obesity properties (Cui et al.2018; Liu et al.2025a,b), making it a promising component for the development of functional foods aimed at weight management. A combination of wet pulverization and temperature cycling method has been found to offer a low-cost, high-yield approach for extractingS. rugosoannulataproteins, making this method suitable for industrial-scale protein production (Liu et al.2025a,b).

Compared with total extracts, the extraction, separation, and purification processes of single compounds fromS. rugosoannulataare more complex. However, these single extracts exhibit higher technological value and greater economic potential. To date, various single constituents have been isolated fromS. rugosoannulata, including homogeneous polysaccharides, lectin, laccase, taste-active peptides, and sterols (Table4).

Among which, the homogeneous polysaccharides derived fromS. rugosoannulataexhibit diverse structures and a wide range of bioactivities, indicating substantial potential for pharmaceutical development (Gao et al.2022; Liu et al.2025a,b; Wang et al.2025a,b). Taste-active peptides mainly present umami or salty characteristics, which can be utilized as natural flavor enhancers in the development of nutritional seasonings (Chen et al.2022; Li et al.2024). Its sterol compounds are structurally diverse and exhibit significant pharmacological activities. Some of these sterols have been reported to possess cholesterol-lowering, anti-Alzheimer’s, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (Wu et al.2011,2012).

At present, China has established a nationwide sales network and a well-developed cold chain logistics system (Li and Xu2022), ensuring the efficient distribution ofS. rugosoannulataproducts from production areas to consumer markets. Consumers can conveniently purchase fresh and processedS. rugosoannulataproducts through multiple retail channels, including rural farmers’ markets, urban wet markets, large supermarkets, and e-commerce platforms. Among them, wholesale markets and supermarkets primarily sell fresh mushrooms, while online platforms including professional mushroom trading platform such as Huinong (https://www.cnhnb.com/) and Emushroom (https://www.emushroom.net/) and integrated E-commerce marketplace such as Taobao (https://www.taobao.com/) and Alibaba (https://www.1688.com/) mainly offer processed products.

A wide variety ofS. rugosoannulataproducts are available on the market, including fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms, salted mushrooms, frozen mushrooms, canned mushrooms, mushroom crisps, mushroom-based sauces, and different flavored mushrooms.

Currently, the primary market forS. rugosoannulataproducts is domestic, although small quantities are exported to international markets such as Europe. The market scale and global influence of these products are gradually expanding.

Currently, theS. rugosoannulataindustry in China remains dominated by the sale of fresh mushrooms and primary processing products. Deep-processed products account for less than 20% of the market, and high-purity refined extracts are nearly absent, resulting in low overall product value and an industry chain still situated at the lower-to-middle end. In contrast to other edible fungi such asL. edodesandA. auricula, which have established comprehensive industrial chains and developed diverse and advanced processed products (Jiang et al.2025), theS. rugosoannulataindustry still falls behind significantly in product diversification and market sophistication. There is an urgent need to promote the development of high-value-added products such as multifunctional extracts and health foods, thereby extending the industrial chain and enhancing the overall value of the industry.

Although a considerable number of scientific publications and invention patents related toS. rugosoannulatahave been produced in China, the variety of products on the market remains limited, primarily encompassing fresh, dried, salted, frozen, canned mushrooms, crispy snacks, and sauces (largely at the level of primary processing). In particular,S. rugosoannulatapolysaccharides (despite their relatively simple extraction process, wide-ranging pharmacological activities, and extensive research) have yet to be commercialized. This indicates that most research outcomes remain at the laboratory or pilot scale stage, without successful translation into industrial-scale production.

Compared with traditional edible fungi such asL. edodesandA. auricula,S. rugosoannulatahas a shorter cultivation history in China and is still considered a novel species in many regions. Public awareness remains limited, and influential brands or flagship products have not yet emerged. Current market positioning mainly focuses on primary agricultural products, lacking brand development and functional marketing strategies that highlight health benefits. Sales channels rely heavily on farmers’ markets and supermarkets, with limited penetration into high-end culinary, functional food, and nutritional health markets, thereby constraining the full potential of market expansion.

At present,S. rugosoannulatais primarily cultivated outdoors, and its production cycle and yield are highly susceptible to climatic conditions, particularly temperature and humidity. Industrialized cultivation represents the future direction of the edible fungi industry, enabling year-round production, overcoming environmental constraints, and improving land-use efficiency and economic returns (Guan et al.2024). Although no reports have yet documented successful year-round factory-scale production ofS. rugosoannulata, related studies in China have made progress. In some regions, shelf-based cultivation within greenhouses has been achieved (Lv et al.2023), and initial successes have been reported in intelligent growth chambers that simulate factory conditions through precise control of temperature, humidity, lighting, and ventilation. These efforts have also identified key technical parameters for controlled cultivation (Yan et al.2024). While large-scale, stable, and high-yield industrial production has not yet been fully realized, the maturation of relevant technologies and the expansion of market demand suggest that industrialized cultivation may become a critical pathway for upgrading theS. rugosoannulataindustry in the future.

In recent years, China has made significant advances in the identification of agronomically important genes and marker-assisted selection in edible fungi. Transgenic breeding has been applied in major species such asL. edodesandA. bisporus, while gene editing techniques have been successfully implemented in reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lingzhi) andP. ostreatus(Bao2021). In comparison, molecular breeding ofS. rugosoannulatais still in its early stages, with current efforts mainly focused on molecular marker research for germplasm identification (Gu et al.2024), and no new cultivars have yet been developed through molecular techniques. In 2023, Wuhan Academy of Agricultural Sciences published a high-quality genome assembly ofS. rugosoannulataalong with comprehensive gene annotation data (Guo et al.2023). This foundational resource provides theoretical support for the discovery of functional genes, elucidation of trait inheritance mechanisms, and implementation of molecular design breeding, thereby laying the groundwork for the industrial application of molecular breeding in this species.

Drawing on the industrial chain development experiences of other edible fungi such asL. edodesandA. auricula, theS. rugosoannulataindustry should adopt a differentiated and clustered development strategy that leverages its unique resource endowments and functional properties. This approach would support the transition from low-end agricultural commodities to high-end nutritional and health-oriented products. For example, the fruiting body’s rich nutrient profile and suitability for fermentation make it a promising candidate for developingS. rugosoannulata-based enzymatic products (Mei et al.2020). Its mycelium, known for strong metabolic activity and fermentation compatibility, can be used in solid-state fermentation of grains (e.g., wheat, corn, soybean) to produce innovative staple food products such as “mycelium-enriched cereals” (Zhang et al.2023a,b,c). Moreover, due to its high polysaccharide content and diverse pharmacological activities,S. rugosoannulatahas potential in the development of functional foods, health beverages, adjunctive therapeutics, and cosmeceuticals. Additionally, given its ecological adaptability to forest cultivation, opportunities exist to establish integrated forest economy models (combining cultivation, education, health, and agritourism through partnerships with schools, research institutions, and eco-tourism enterprises) for enhanced rural development.

From a multidimensional perspective—encompassing climate suitability, agricultural structure, nutritional demand, and labor availability—temperate and humid subtropical regions, high-altitude zones, and developing or agriculturally oriented countries such as India, Nepal, Ethiopia, Kenya, Colombia, Peru, and Ukraine exhibit strong potential for industrial adoption. For instance, India, as the world’s most populous country, has a large consumer base for plant-based foods and edible fungi, yet its annual mushroom production remains low at only 180,000 tons (Patel et al.2025). Notably, wildS. rugosoannulatahas been documented in Himachal Pradesh in northern India, where artificial cultivation trials have already been conducted (Sharma et al.2007), indicating a favorable environment for its development. Given the increasing global awareness of its nutritional and functional value, and the continued international dissemination of cultivation techniques,S. rugosoannulatais expected to join the ranks ofL. edodes,A. bisporus, andP. ostreatus, becoming one of the world’s major edible mushroom species (Fig.6).
