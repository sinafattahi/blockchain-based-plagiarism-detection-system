A 70-year-old woman with a refractory duodenal ulcer developed a 1.5-cm perforation at the duodenal bulb following two failed attempts at endoscopic hemostasis (Fig. 1). Placement of an over-the-scope clip for closure was unsuccessful, and resulted in sepsis.

A nitinol duodenal covered stent (22 mm in diameter, 10 cm in length) was deployed endoscopically (Fig. 2,Video 1). This stent integrates three key innovations: (i) a tripartite anchoring system – an umbrella-shaped gastric component for antral apposition, a cylindrical pyloric segment for radial fixation, and a bulbous duodenal anchor for coaptation; (ii) a papilla-aligned fenestration within the membranous mid-section to preserve physiological pancreatobiliary drainage; and (iii) optimized radial force distribution across segmented zones to minimize migration. Follow-up at 15 days confirmed closure of the complete perforation, and the stent was safely retrieved.

An anatomically designed duodenal stent that can both obliterate the fistula and provide physiological drainage is used to close a perforation of a refractory duodenal ulcer in an elderly frail woman.

Duodenal perforations are challenging owing to anatomical fragility and the enzyme-rich secretions12. Conventional stents risk migration and obstructing drainage, thereby exacerbating leaks3. An anatomically designed duodenal stent uniquely addresses these limitations: its anchoring system ensures stable positioning without tissue injury, while the fenestration aligns precisely with the papilla, allowing continuous biliary/pancreatic flow into the bowel lumen. This design prevents reflux-related complications and promotes fistula healing by isolating the defect from digestive enzymes. The case underscores the stent’s dual role as a mechanical sealant and physiological conduit, which may be particularly critical in elderly patients with impaired healing.
