One of the main goals in pediatric dentistry is to perform effective treatments with minimal intervention and in the shortest possible time. New restorative materials for primary teeth, such as Cention-N, may overcome the mechanical limitations of Glass-Ionomer Cement (GIC). This study systematically reviews the shear bond strength (SBS) and micro-leakage of GIC and Cention-N in primary teeth. This research was conducted as a systematic review and meta-analysis. Comprehensive searches were carried out in reputable databases including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane up to December 2024. Relevant in vitro studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected and assessed using the QUIN checklist. Data were analyzed with CMA software. The I2test evaluated heterogeneity, and the Begg test detected publication bias. Out of 179 articles identified, 12 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Ten of these were eligible for meta-analysis. The results showed that the SBS of Cention-N was significantly higher than that of GIC when bonding agents were used (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD]: 5.61; 95% CI: -6.99 to -4.23; P < 0.001). Additionally, micro-leakage of Cention-N was significantly lower compared to GIC under the same conditions (SMD: 1.7; 95% CI: 0.85 to 2.54; P < 0.001). Cention-N, with its superior mechanical properties and reduced micro-leakage when bonding agents were used, appears to be a promising option for primary tooth restorations, especially in stress-bearing areas.

Effective pediatric dental treatment prioritizes minimal intervention and speed, often influenced by children’s cooperation levels. Dentists select from various dental filling materials like composite, compomer, glass ionomer cement (GIC), amalgam and stainless steel crrown (Gok Baba et al.2021). Amalgam use has waned due to its possible toxicity and environmental concerns, alongside aesthetic drawbacks, shifting focus to tooth-preserving materials like composites and GIC. While composites offer aesthetics, they are technique-sensitive and moisture-intolerant, making GIC a more practical choice in challenging situations. GIC, an adhesive, fluoride-releasing material, is beneficial in pediatric dentistry but possesses weak mechanical properties and high solubility (Moghimi et al.2022).

Therefore, to overcome these limitations, dentists have been looking for a material that has amalgam strength, composite esthetic, and the low technical sensitivity of GIC (Bhat et al.2023).

Recently, a new restorative material called Cention-N has been introduced, which is resin-based and is in the group of Alkazite restorative materials. Alkazites are materials that include an alkaline filler that is able to release acid-neutralizing ions such as fluoride, calcium, and hydroxide. Clinically, it is easy to handle, moisture-compatible and can be used for the restoration of primary and permanent teeth (Jayaraj et al.2018, Bhat et al.2023).

The bond strength of restorative materials is crucial. Permanent teeth generally exhibit higher bond strengths to dental adhesives compared to primary teeth due to differences in dentin composition, structure, and reactivity to bonding agents. Primary teeth have less mineralized dentin, smaller tooth size, and fewer dentinal tubules with lower permeability. Primary dentin may react differently to etchants used in bonding procedures, potentially affecting the quality of the hybrid layer. The hybrid layer (the interface between the tooth and the adhesive) is often thicker in primary teeth, potentially leading to less effective bonding. The lower bond strengths and altered hybrid layer formation in primary teeth can contribute to a higher risk of restoration failure, such as debonding or leakage (Pires et al.2018). This highlights the need for materials with superior bond strength and reduced leakage in primary teeth, especially in uncooperative children without ideal isolation.

A study comparing the bond strength of Cention-N and GIC in primary molars found Cention-N to have significantly higher bond strength than GIC in Class II and IX restorations. The superior shear, tensile, and compressive bond strength of Cention-N has been attributed to the size of its mineral filler nanoparticles (Pathak and Mallikarjuna2021). Minimizing micro-leakage in dental restorations is vital to reduce sensitivity, marginal discoloration, and secondary caries. Polymerization shrinkage in resin composites can create marginal gaps, leading to micro-leakage, often resulting in post-operative sensitivity, marginal discoloration, and secondary caries. Conversely, Cention-N is reported to be isofiller, potentially reducing shrinkage due to its lower elastic modulus, thereby minimizing polymerization shrinkage and micro-leakage (Mann et al.2018). Some studies report less micro-leakage with Cention-N, though findings are not entirely consistent (Punathil et al.2019). A study by Hegde et al. (2023) found that while composite materials showed higher shear bond strength (SBS) than GIC and Cention-N in primary molars, Cention-N’s SBS was still superior to that of GIC cement (Hegde et al.2023).

Consequently, this systematic review was conducted to investigate the mechanical properties and micro-leakage of Cention-N compared to GIC in the restoration of primary teeth.

The methodology of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic reviews (PROSPERO) with the approval code CRD42024628099. Furthermore, this study was conducted in dental faculty of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and was approved by Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, with the ID number of IR.MUI.DHMT.REC.1403.011.

This review consider only in-vitro studies and aimed to compare the results of bond strength and micro-leakage of Cention-N with GIC or Resin-modified Glass-Ionomer cement (RMGIC). Hence in-vitro studies which assess the SBS and micro-leakage (outcome) of Cention-N (intervention) compared to GIC or RMGIC (comparison) in primary teeth restoration (population), were entered in this systematic review (PICO framework). Cross-sectional, cohort, case, clinical trial, and review studies were not included in this study.

A comprehensive and systematic literature search was executed, extending up to December 2024, to identify all relevant in vitro studies published in English pertaining to this research topic. To gather information from electronic sources, a targeted search was conducted across reputable databases: Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase, and PubMed. The search focused on articles related to the SBS and micro-leakage of CENTION-N material in comparison with GIC or RMGIC for the restoration of primary teeth.

Standard English keywords, aligned with the MeSH database, were employed in all electronic searches, utilizing a combination of AND and OR operators (Table1).

Two independent researchers meticulously screened five English databases according to the defined search strategy, examining the titles and abstracts of the identified articles. They selected studies based on the predefined inclusion criteria. The inter-rater reliability for the abstract and full-text review stages was assessed using a correlation coefficient. Any discrepancies between the initial two researchers were resolved through consultation with a third researcher. Studies identified across multiple databases were included only once to avoid duplication. Subsequently, the full texts of the selected articles underwent a thorough review to ensure their appropriateness for this study. Additionally, a manual literature search was performed by reviewing the reference lists of the selected articles and consulting with experts in this field. To capture grey literature, searches were conducted using Proquest and the first 100 results from Google Scholar (Table2).

The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the QUIN checklist, accessible athttps://jpdm-ips-mnm.com/quin-toolthe-risk-of-bias-tool-for-assessment-of-in-vitrostudies.

The information were extracted from studies and collected in the form of an evidence table in the Excel program and entered into the CMA software and analyzed using it. Since the results of different studies do not have the same value, inverse variance was used to weight the studies. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the Cochran’s Q test. The degree of heterogeneity was quantified using the I2statistic. Initially, a fixed-effects model was used, and if significant heterogeneity was observed, a random-effects model was used.

The Begg’s test was used to detect publication bias. Since no publication bias was observed, Trim and Fill tests were not used.

In comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed (7 articles), Web of Science (1 article), Scopus (114 articles), ProQuest (5 articles), Embase (2 articles), and Google Scholar (50 articles), a total of 179 articles were identified. Following the removal of 27 duplicate entries, 152 unique articles proceeded to the next stage of evaluation. Of these, 122 were excluded based on their titles and abstracts, as they did not meet the predefined inclusion criteria.

The full texts of the remaining 30 articles underwent a thorough review. A further 18 articles were excluded during this phase because their focus was on permanent teeth or other mechanical properties. Consequently, 12 articles ultimately met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. All 12 of these selected articles were in vitro studies, consistent with the research parameters (Fig.1).

The quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUIN checklist. Seven articles achieved a score above 75%, indicating good quality, while five articles scored between 50 and 75%, representing moderate quality.

Publication bias was evaluated using Begg’s test. For the comparison of teeth restoration with Cention-N versus RMGIC regarding micro-leakage, the test revealed no significant publication bias (P = 0.60), suggesting a low probability of such bias. Additionally, publication bias was considered non-existent for other evaluations in this systematic review due to the limited comparison of only two studies in those instances. The significance level for all statistical tests was established at P = 0.05.

Two studies with similar methodology (Balagopal et al.2021, Pathak and Mallikarjuna2021) were entered to meta-analysis to assess SBS between Cention-N and GIC and heterogeneity was observed between the studies. (I2= 97.56%, p < 0.001). Therefore, the random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean SBS using Cention-N and GIC to restore primary teeth (Standardized mean difference [SMD]: 24.9, 95% CI: −76.51 to 26.7, P = 0.34) (Fig.2).

Two studies with similar methodology (Agarwal et al.2019, Hedge et al.2023) were entered to meta-analysis to assess SBS between Cention-N (with bond) and GIC and heterogeneity was not observed between the studies. (I2= 00.00%, p-value = 0.96). Therefore, the fixed effect model was used. The results showed that the mean SBS of Cention-N, when bonding is used, is statistically higher than GIC in restoration of primary teeth (SMD: 5.61, 95% CI: −6.99 to −4.23, P < 0.001) (Fig.3).

Two studies with similar methodology (Jabin et al.2021, Pai et al.2024) were entered to meta-analysis to assess SBS between Cention-N and RMGIC and heterogeneity was observed between the studies. (I2= 98.42%, p < 0.001). Therefore, the random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean SBS using Cention-N and RMGIC to restore primary teeth (SMD: 0.20, 95% CI: −1.07, 0.66, P = 0.63) (Fig.4).

Two studies with similar methodology (Patil and Winnier2021, Keskus and Oznurhan2022) were entered to meta-analysis to assess micro-leakage between Cention-N and GIC and heterogeneity was observed between the studies. (I2= 92.06%, p < 0.001). Therefore, the random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean micro-leakage of Cention-N and GIC ((SMD: 0.11, 95% CI: −2.83, 3.06, P = 0.94) (Fig.5).

Two studies with similar methodology (Agarwal et al.2019, Keskus and Oznurhan2022) were entered to meta-analysis to assess micro-leakage between Cention-N (with bond) and GIC and heterogeneity was not observed between the studies. (I2= 43.90%, p = 0.18) Therefore, the fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The results showed that the mean of micro-leakage of Cention-N, when bonding is used, is statistically lower than GIC for restoration of primary teeth (SMD: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.85, 2.54, P < 0.001) (Fig.6).

Three studies with similar methodology (Punathil et al.2019, Jabin et al.2021, Duraisamy et al.2024) were entered to meta-analysis to assess micro-leakage between Cention-N and RMGIC and heterogeneity was observed between the studies. (I2= 97.54%, p < 0.001). Therefore, the random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean micro-leakage of Cention-N and RMGIC (SMD: 0.28, 95% CI: −3.47, 4.03, P = 0.88) (Fig.7).

Cention-N is a dual-curing filling material that offers bulk placement, ion release, and durability, addressing the needs of both dentists and patients (Mazumdar et al.2018). As an “Alkazite” material, it contains an alkaline glass filler that releases hydroxide, calcium, and fluoride ions (Mann et al.2018). Key components of Cention-N include barium aluminum silicate for strength, ytterbium trifluoride for radiopacity, isofiller (Tetric N-Ceram technology) to reduce shrinkage stress, and fluoro-calcium silicate, which releases ions to regulate pH and support remineralization (Kaur et al.2019). It is suitable for Class I, II, and V restorations in both permanent and primary teeth. Cention-N’s high flexural strength, low shrinkage, and fluoride release make it a good alternative to traditional fillings (Mann et al. (Mann,2018)).

Glass ionomer cement (GIC) chemically bonds to teeth (Kaur et al.2019) and releases fluoride over time. This fluoride release offers an antibacterial effect and aids in remineralization adjacent enamel, making GIC highly beneficial in pediatric dentistry and for high-caries-risk patients (Sidhu2011). While GIC exhibits excellent biocompatibility, its lower mechanical properties (compressive and tensile strength) compared to composite resins limit its use in high-force restorations (Culbertson2001).

Resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) blends the characteristics of traditional GIC and resin composite. These materials cure via both acid–base reactions and light polymerization, providing improved handling and aesthetics. RMGICs possess mechanical strength intermediate to composites and traditional GIC, with their properties varying based on resin content. (Wilson1990, McCabe1998).

This review consider only in-vitro studies and aimed to compare the results of bond strength and micro-leakage of Cention-N with GIC or RMGIC. These two properties play an important role in the resistance to chewing forces and indicate the success and durability of the restoration. SBS refers to the maximum force required to break the bond area between the bonded restoration and the tooth surface (Kaur et al.2019). Micro-leakage refers to the penetration of fluids, bacteria, ions, or small molecules through microscopic gaps at the junction of the restoration and the tooth surface, which can lead to secondary caries, sensitivity, or restoration failure (Rathi et al.2020).

Also, in this systematic review study, the two materials GIC and Cention-N were compared in two conditions: without bonding and with bonding in terms of micro-leakage and shear bond strength. These materials adhere to the tooth structure and have anti-caries properties due to fluoride release. Their low thermal expansion is similar to the tooth structure and they are biocompatible and have low cytotoxicity (Somani et al.2016).

This systematic review included 12 studies, but only 10 were eligible for meta-analysis. The study by Dhull et al. (2022) was excluded because it reported SBS as the number of cycles before material separation. Additionally, the Patel study (Patel et al.2023) was omitted due to incomplete data and the inability to contact the author for clarification. The remaining 10 studies were all in vitro. Among these, 6 studies compared the SBS of Cention-N with GIC or RMGIC in extracted primary teeth, while 7 studies focused on micro-leakage using the same comparisons. Three studies examined both SBS and micro-leakage.

The result of meta-analysis revealed that SBS of Cention-N without using bonding agent in restoration of primary teeth were not different with CIC and RMGIC. However in the presence of bonding agents, Cention-N performed better than GIC in terms of reducing micro-leakage and increasing shear bond strength.

Meta-analysis in studies by Patil and Winnier (2021), Keskus and Oznurhan (2022) showed that without the use of bonding agents, there was no significant difference in micro-leakage of GIC and Cention-N. Also, in studies by Punathil et al. (2019), Jabin et al. (2021), Duraisamy et al. (2024), which compared Cention-N with RMGIC, no significant difference in micro-leakage was observed between the two groups. This indicates that both materials perform similarly in sealing the tooth-restoration junction. In the studies by Balagopal et al. (2021, Punathil et al. (2019), without the use of bonding agents, no significant difference was found between SBS of GIC and Cention-N. Also, in the studies by  Pai et al. (2024),  Jabin et al. (2021), which compared SBS of Cention-N with RMGIC, no significant difference was observed.

The comparable microleakage and SBS results observed without bonding agents between GIC and Cention-N may attributed to the inherent adhesion mechanisms of these materials. GIC establishes a chemical bond through ionic interactions between calcium or aluminum ions and the tooth’s mineral structure, naturally adhering to the tooth (Nicholson1998). Cention-N, conversely, forms a stable polymer network via its self-curing alkasite matrix, yielding adequate bond strength even without bonding agents (Justen et al.2024). Moreover, both materials exhibit favorable adaptability to tooth surfaces, facilitating a smooth, continuous interface that minimizes fluid penetration and microscopic gap formation. The utilization of materials with high thermal compatibility, such as GIC and Cention-N, further restricts thermal expansion and mitigates internal stress at the junction. Consequently, these attributes contribute to the similar performance of both materials in the absence of bonding agents (Khoroushi and Keshani2013, Kaul et al.2022).

Agarwal et al. (2019, Keskus and Oznurhan (2022) demonstrated that the use of bonding agents significantly reduced micro-leakage in Cention-N compared to GIC. This finding aligns with the superior mechanical and polymerization properties of Cention-N, which enhance its ability to adhere to tooth surfaces. Bonding agents help minimize marginal gaps and limit fluid penetration, which is crucial in preventing secondary caries and ensuring the longevity of restorations.

The studies by Hegde et al. (2023), Agarwal et al. (2019) further highlighted the significant improvement in SBS with the use of bonding agents, showing that Cention-N outperformed GIC. This superior performance is attributed to the denser polymer network in Cention-N, which provides stronger adhesion under chewing forces.

The observed differences when bonding agents are used can be explained by the chemical composition, resin base, and the greater similarity of Cention-N to composites, which enhances its compatibility with bonding agents. Cention-N, due to its high-density polymer network and dual-curing capabilities, particularly benefits from the use of bonding agents, leading to a more durable bond (Mann et al.2018).These findings underscore the importance of combining bonding agents with modern materials such as Cention-N to significantly improve the efficiency and durability of dental restorations (Francois et al.2020).

In vivo studies comparing Cention-N and GIC in dental restorations have revealed differences in their performance and clinical outcomes. Cention-N has demonstrated superior adaptation, higher fluoride release, and reduced micro-leakage compared to GIC, making it more effective in preventing secondary caries (Arora et al.2022; Bhat et al.2023). Additionally, Cention-N provides better color stability and aesthetics due to its translucency and chameleon effect, whereas GIC tends to be more opaque and exhibits poorer long-term color matching. However, both materials perform similarly in terms of marginal integrity and surface texture (Arora et al.2022).

A key limitation of this systematic review lies in the in vitro nature of the included studies. Laboratory conditions cannot fully replicate the complex and dynamic environment of the oral cavity. Factors such as temperature fluctuations, masticatory forces, saliva composition, the oral microbiome, and patient-specific variables (e.g., enamel quality and oral hygiene practices) can significantly influence the clinical performance of restorative materials. Moreover, methodological heterogeneity among the primary studies (including variations in cavity preparation techniques, thermocycling protocols, and bonding agent application) impedes direct comparisons and contributes to data variability. Some studies also had small sample sizes, which may limit the statistical power needed for definitive conclusions. These limitations highlight the need for further clinical trials with robust controls and standardized protocols to more accurately assess the performance of restorative materials.

Cention-N, due to its superior SBS and lower micro-leakage, appears to be a suitable option for restoring primary teeth, especially in stress-bearing areas. When bonding agents were not used, no significant differences in micro-leakage or SBS were observed between GIC and Cention-N. However, in the presence of bonding agents, Cention-N outperformed GIC in both reducing micro-leakage and enhancing shear bond strength.
