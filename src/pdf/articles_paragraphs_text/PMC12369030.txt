Gallbladder perforation is a serious complication of acute cholecystitis. Among its rarest manifestations, cholecystobronchial fistula represents an exceptionally uncommon form of type III perforation and is frequently misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific presentation.

A 67-year-old Chinese (East Asian) male presented with a chief complaint of cough and hemoptysis. His medical history was significant for nephrotic syndrome, for which he had been receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy. Imaging demonstrated cholelithiasis, a cholecystobronchial fistula, and a right-sided lung abscess. A staged treatment approach was implemented. Stage I involved ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage for infection control. Following clinical stabilization, stage II consisted of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperative findings confirmed spontaneous closure of the fistula. The patient achieved an uneventful recovery and remained recurrence-free during follow-up.

Cholecystobronchial fistula typically results from chronic gallbladder inflammation. Prolonged corticosteroid use may obscure clinical manifestations, potentially delaying diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is essential for fistula identification, supplemented by bronchoscopic bilirubin or microbiological analysis. A staged minimally invasive approach enhances both safety and therapeutic efficacy. This report underscores the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, precise imaging, and individualized surgical planning in the management of rare biliary fistulas.

Gallbladder perforation is a serious complication of acute cholecystitis, occurring in approximately 2–11% of patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy [1]. The widely accepted Niemeier classification (1934) categorizes gallbladder perforation into three types: type I (acute-free perforation into the peritoneal cavity), type II (subacute perforation with localized pericholecystic abscess), and type III (chronic perforation with fistula formation) [2]. Cholecystodiaphragmatic fistula (CDF) is an uncommon variant of type III perforation characterized by a pathological connection between the gallbladder and thoracic cavity through the diaphragm.

This rare condition is typically associated with prolonged, uncontrolled cholecystitis or gallstones and results from the formation of an infection-induced subphrenic abscess, which may erode through the diaphragm, eventually progressing to pleurobiliary and bronchobiliary fistulas [3,4]. Owing to its rarity and nonspecific clinical presentation, CDF or cholecystobronchial fistulas (CBF) are often overlooked or misdiagnosed. Imaging examinations and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential to improve diagnostic accuracy.

This report presents a rare case of CBF secondary to gallbladder perforation, successfully managed with a staged approach involving percutaneous drainage followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). This case demonstrates that timely diagnosis, individualized treatment strategies, and minimally invasive interventions are essential in optimizing outcomes for complex biliary fistulas.

A 67-year-old Chinese (East Asian) male presented with a 1 month history of intermittent cough and 1 day of hemoptysis. His medical history was notable for nephrotic syndrome managed with daily prednisone (10 mg) for 1 year. He denied hypertension, diabetes, or prior surgery procedures. On admission, vital signs were: temperature 36.6 °C, heart rate 109 beats/minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute, blood pressure 138/92 mmHg, and body weight 65 kg. Chest examination revealed normal percussion and no rales or rhonchi. Abdominal examination showed a flat, soft abdomen without tenderness, rebound, or guarding; Murphy’s sign was negative, and bowel sounds were 4/minute.

Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cell count 10.77 × 10/L (neutrophils 77.8%), hemoglobin 133 g/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 100.92 mg/L, total protein 62 g/L, albumin 31.7 g/L, and random blood glucose 5.54 mmol/L. Tumor markers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9, and CA125 were within normal limits.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a mass-like lesion in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe. Contrast-enhanced chest and abdominal CT (Fig.1A,D) revealed a 4-cm gallstone impacted in the gallbladder neck, an enlarged gallbladder with heterogeneous density, and a cholecysto-diaphragmatic-bronchial fistula.

The patient was initiated on antibiotic therapy along with fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional support. Bronchoscopy identified a small amount of gray-brown secretion in the right middle lobe bronchus, and culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid grewEscherichia coli. Following multidisciplinary consultation, and given the patient’s immunocompromised status and infection burden, ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) was performed. A 10F catheter drained approximately 200 mL of purulent, bile-stained fluid (Fig.2A,B), and culture of purulent grewEscherichia coli. The patient’s symptoms improved significantly and he was discharged after 12 days.

Postoperative histopathology confirmed chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 7, and remained symptom-free during follow-up. Axial non-contrast chest and abdominal CT images obtained 1 month after surgery demonstrated complete resolution of both pulmonary and subphrenic abscesses (Fig.1C,F).

Cholelithiasis is a common condition frequently encountered in general surgical practice. Epidemiological data from China indicate a prevalence of approximately 5.1%, with a higher incidence in females (6.5%) compared with males (3.3%) [5]. CDF is a rare complication of gallbladder disease, typically resulting from prolonged, untreated, or inadequately managed chronic cholecystitis. Sustained inflammation induces pericholecystic adhesions, compromising gallbladder wall vascularity and culminating in ischemia, necrosis, and fistulization. With the widespread adoption of standardized gallstone management, the incidence of biliary-enteric and biliary-thoracic fistulas has declined significantly and is estimated at 1–3% in patients with gallstones [6].

Gallbladder fistulas are classified according to their anatomical connections. Cholecystoduodenal fistula is the most prevalent (70–75%), followed by cholecystocolic fistula (10–20%), with less common types including cholecystogastric, cholecystojejunal, and cholecystoileal fistulas [7,8]. CDF, which forms a pathological communication between the biliary system and thoracic cavity, is a rare but serious entity. It can be further divided into biliary pleural fistula and cholecystopleural fistula [9]. First described by Peacock in 1850 [10], most cases remain isolated to case reports owing to their rarity.

CDF pathogenesis encompasses congenital anomalies, infections (example, hepatic hydatidosis, abscesses), biliary obstruction, trauma, and iatrogenic injury [10], yet chronic infection persists as the principal etiology [11,12]. Clinical presentation is often nonspecific, manifesting as abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, and vomiting, while systemic signs such as fever may be absent [13]. In this case, prolonged glucocorticoid therapy for nephrotic syndrome attenuated characteristic symptoms (example, fever, localized abdominal pain), delaying diagnosis of gallbladder perforation and subphrenic abscess formation. The pathogenesis of CBF in this patient involved persistent, inadequately treated cholecystitis, which led to the formation of adhesions between the gallbladder and diaphragm. The expanding subphrenic abscess eroded through the diaphragm and, aided by preexisting pleural adhesions, breached the pulmonary parenchyma to form a bronchial fistula.

CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans play a pivotal role in diagnosis, allowing for precise visualization of the fistulous tract, diaphragmatic disruption, and assessment of biliary and pulmonary involvement [14,15]. A recent case series emphasizes that contrast-enhanced CT is the primary imaging modality to identify and evaluate transdiaphragmatic fistulas including CBF, particularly when patients present with nonspecific or atypical respiratory or thoracoabdominal symptoms [16].

In this case, the chest and abdomen contrast-enhanced CT imaging revealed thickening of the gallbladder, diaphragmatic breach, and indistinct boundaries with the right middle lobe lesion, confirming CBF. Notably, microfistulas may lack classic signs (example, biloptysis) while contributing to chronic pulmonary inflammation. Bronchoscopy with bilirubin quantification in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid provides diagnostic confirmation; however, in this case, gallstone obstruction prevented bile reflux, yielding negative bilirubin testing. Diagnosis relied on characteristic CT findings and microbiological concordance, whereEscherichia coliwas isolated synchronously from both biliary and bronchial specimens—with surgical exploration providing definitive verification.

Owing to its rarity, there is no standardized treatment protocol for CBF. Management strategies also differ, ranging from conservative drainage and endoscopic interventions to open or laparoscopic surgery. However, several management principles include: decompressing the biliary system, ensuring adequate drainage of abscesses, closing the fistula, and addressing the underlying pathology [17–20]. A staged management approach for CBF has not been previously described in the literature. In this case, PTGBD provided effective decompression and infection control. Adequate drainage of the subphrenic abscess was crucial in eliminating the pathological tract. Supportive measures including intravenous antibiotics and nutritional supplementation were also essential [17,21,22].

Given the patient’s malnutrition, anemia, and chronic inflammatory changes with extensive adhesions, a staged damage-control approach was adopted: percutaneous drainage followed by delayed definitive surgery. Once the infection was controlled and nutritional status optimized, LC was performed. Surgical goals included complete removal of the gallbladder and stones, evaluation and closure of any residual diaphragmatic defect, and management of dense adhesions. Laparoscopy, when performed by experienced hepatobiliary surgeons, offers advantages over open surgery, including reduced morbidity and faster recovery [19,23].

In this patient, a combined antegrade and retrograde dissection technique was used to safely navigate extensive adhesions. The diaphragmatic defect had spontaneously healed, obviating the need for surgical repair. The patient recovered without complications and remained symptom-free during follow-up.

The atypical presentation of this case due to steroid use, complicating diagnosis, makes contrast-enhanced CT critical for early detection. Prognosis significantly improves with a staged management approach: initial PTGBD for infection control and gallbladder decompression, followed by LC after clinical stabilization. This comprehensive strategy enhances patient safety and improves long-term outcomes.
