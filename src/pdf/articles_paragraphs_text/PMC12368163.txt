The original version of this Article contained an error in the keywords, in which “Times series modelling” was omitted. The keywords now read: “Multimodal AI, Deep Learning, Interstitial glucose prediction, Time series modelling”.

Additionally, in the original Figure 3 and Figure 4, the information given did not align with the set variables mentioned in Table 5. The original Figure3and4and accompanying legends appear below.

Comparing violin plot of absolute point error for multimodal and unimodal architectures developed for Menarini sensor across different variable sets at three prediction horizon. The violin plot shows the distribution of absolute point error 25%, 50% and 75% quartile via dashed line.
