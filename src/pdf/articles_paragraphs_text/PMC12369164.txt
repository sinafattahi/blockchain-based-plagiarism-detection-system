Menstruating girls encounter persistent social, cultural, and religious restrictions, alongside inadequate facilities at home and school, hindering effective menstrual hygiene management (MHM). In rural Rwanda, limited awareness and preparedness worsen these challenges. This study investigates MHM practices and associated factors among primary schoolgirls in the Gakenke District to inform targeted interventions.

An institution-based cross-sectional study of 384 primary school girls was conducted. A systematic sampling technique was used for recruiting participants. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire and were entered in Excel, which was subsequently sent to SPSS V. 25 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to test associations. Two-tailedP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The mean age of the study participants was 14 years (1.3 years). About one in ten (9.11%) school-aged girls in Gakenke District, Rwanda, had poor knowledge of MHM, 11.2% had negative attitudes toward MHM, and 14.3% had poor practices. The odds of good MHM practices were significantly greater among school girls who knew that their menstrual blood came from the uterus (AOR: 4.57; 95% CI: 1.62 to 12.89), who knew that menstruation is a monthly cycle (AOR: 2.86; 95% CI: 2.08 to 15.75), who received formal puberty or menstrual education (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.19 to 9.13), who knew that disposable and reusable pads are available on the market (AOR: 7.06; 95% CI: 5.37 to 18.58), who had good knowledge of MHM (AOR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.87 to 21.05) and who had a positive attitude toward MHH (AOR: 11.44; 95% CI: 9.60 to 16.02).

Addressing poor MHM among young adolescents requires collaborative interventions, including stakeholder-led sensitization for formal puberty education, improved access to disposable and reusable pads, and initiatives that boost knowledge and foster positive attitudes toward menstruation.

Adolescence is a critical period in the life cycle marked by significant major biological and behavioral changes start to occur. This period is characterized by the onset of menarche or menstruation, a biological process that occurs when blood leaves the womb for a few days every month [1,2]. As menstruation begins, adolescent girls may encounter reduced upward mobility, thereby restricting their access to education and economic opportunities [3]. According to a systematic review, menstruation often acts as a physiological barrier for adolescent girls, limiting their freedom to leave home [4]. Effective menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is crucial to safeguard health and prevent discomfort or embarrassment [5,6]. MHM includes using clean menstrual products, accessing proper disposal facilities, and receiving adequate menstrual health education. It also entails having access to water and soap for bathing, reusable pads where applicable, and suitable infrastructure for discarding used materials, along with reliable information on menstrual sanitation, and maintaining personal hygiene [1,7]. However, managing MHM is a major challenge for adolescent girls who lack these basic facilities at home or in school.

The prevalence of poor MHM practices varies across countries and regions. WHO and UNICEF reported that 2.3 billion people lack basic sanitation, and just 27% have handwashing facilities with soap and water [8]. Studies from low-income countries entailed the relationship between MHM, school attendance, and academic performance [9–11]. Moreover, studies have reported that many school aged girls miss school during menstruation due to feelings of shame, concerns about visible stains on clothing, and lack of private space for MHM [2,6].

Challenges in MHM are widespread, with many girls lacking access to basic sanitation facilities and hygiene products. A study from low income country stated that over-half of the schools lack adequate latrines for girls, and existing facilities are often unhygienic [12]. Similarly, researches conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa revealed that poor MHM among school girls is driven by poor accommodations (hygiene infrastructure), limited access to clean water and menstrual hygiene products, and unaffordable MH materials [13,14]. A study conducted in Kenya found that 61.7% of schoolgirls missed at least one day of school each month, primarily due to the lack of private facilities for changing or laundering at school [15]. Similarly, research from Uganda’s Rukungiri district indicated that 61.7% of the surveyed girls were absent from school for comparable reasons, including inadequate support and limited information on their MHM practices effectively [15,16]. Despite, menstruation necessitates the availability of personal hygiene facilities and waste disposal with adequate privacy, most primary school toilet facilities in Rwanda were lacking washing facilities and do not have doors with inside locks. Girls in Gicumbi, Rwanda, reported staying home while menstruating instead of using inadequate facilities found at their schools [17]. A study by Ketema among high school girls revealed that 91.9% of girls with access to clean water had good MHM practices [13].

Cultural restrictions and taboos surrounding menstruation also pose significant barriers, particularly in African and South Asian countries In many African countries, menstruation is clouded by many restrictions, taboos and beliefs [18,19], which is similar to evidence from other countries: India, Iran, and Afghanistan [10–12]. Similarly, a study in Kibogora, Rwanda, reported that 82.1% of girls had negative feelings about their menarche, and 24.4% had not acquired any information about their period before experiencing their first menstruation [20].

Although awareness of MHM is increasing, notable differences remain among schoolgirls in their understanding of menstruation, age-related factors, openness in discussing menses, and sources of information, all of which affect their MHM practices [21,22].

Recently, MHM has gained attention as a possible barrier to educational access and performance among school girls and has been introduced in the curriculum where all Rwandan girls and boys start to learn about menstruation in order to have a meaningful understanding of menses and menstrual hygiene. However, culture still persists to victimize women for a truly biological fact, and wash facilities and access to sanitary towels are not yet adequate in all schools and these challenges still remain in creating barriers to adolescent girls’ school performance and academic achievements especially in rural areas like the Gakenke District. This highlights a need for comprehensive evidence based targeted interventions on MHM practices. Additionally, this district, apart from being a rural district, also has a greater number of females than the national average (Gakenke has 115 females per 100 males, which is greater than the national average of 111 females per 100 males) [23]. Therefore, this study aimed to assess MHM practices and associated factors among primary school girls in Gakenke District, Northern Province, Rwanda.

A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted in 18 schools in Gakenke District, Rwanda. Both government-aided and public schools were included in this study.

The Gakenke District is one of the five districts of the Northern Province of Rwanda. Female population in Gakenke district comprises 53.6% of the population, with an average of 115 females for every 100 males, which is greater than the national average of 111 females for every 100 males. More than forty-percent (41.3%) of households in Gakenke district are at a walking distance of 15 min to improved water access. One-fourth (25%) of families are headed by females [23,24].

Eighteen of the 132 mixed (girls and boys) primary schools from nine sectors: Muhondo, Rushashi, Coko, Ruli, Nemba, Karambo, Gakenke, Minazi and Kivuruga were included in the present study. The schools were selected purposively to include different communities from suburban and rural areas. Eligible participants comprised girls who had commenced menarche. For schoolgirls under the age of 18, parental consent was obtained from parents or guardians. Girls who were absent on the day of data collection were excluded.

The target population consisted of 1184 schoolgirls (primary five and primary six) who had reached menarche. Sample size was calculated using a single proportion formula () and the following assumptions; proportion (p) of school girls with good MHM was estimated to be 50% as there was no previous research regarding MHS in the study setting, confidence interval 95% (z = 1.96), and degree of precision (e) 5%. Therefore, an aggregate of 384 menstruating girls were recruited to participate in this study. A purposeful sampling technique was used to select classes/grades from which participants were attending (P5 and P6), and the calculated sample size was allocated proportional to the designated schools. List of all participants was obtained from all schools in advance, a systematic sampling method was implemented in each of the designated participating schools using a K sampling interval. The interval (K) was calculated by dividing the total number of eligible girls by the predetermined sample size for each school. The initial participant was selected at random from numbers 1 to K through a lottery system, and subsequent participants were chosen at intervals of K until the required sample size was reached.

The data were collected using a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview approach from April to July 2023. The tool was originally in English, and it was translated to Kinyarwanda for better understanding. The tool was also used in another study and demonstrated a strong internal consistency [25]. Four data collectors were trained for two days by the principal investigator. Training included interviewing and recording using observational checklist like school and toilet facilities. On a second day a pilot study was conducted in schools other than the main study settings.

Knowledge of MHM among the participants was assessed using 14 variables related to knowledge. The knowledge score was calculated by summing (1 = to those who knew the correct answer, and 0 = to those who did not know the correct answer). The total sum score of the tool ranges from 0 to14. Furthermore, a percent knowledge index (PKI) was calculated for each student and a percentage of the correct answers ≥ 50% was grouped as good knowledge and those who scored less than half were classified as having poor knowledge of MHM according to the Bloom Taxonomy [26]. The participants’ attitudes were calculated using a 5-point Likert scale [27] by asking respondents about their opinions in regards to MHM and were grouped into two groups: positive and negative. Moreover, practice toward MHM was dichotomized as good practice or poor practice on MHM.

Data entry was performed in Excel, and the data were imported to SPSS software version 25 for statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis was performed using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for quantitative data. The chi-square test was used to assess the factors associated with the practices of participants toward MHM. Furthermore, Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the magnitude of association (Odds ratio) of factors with good practice of MHM both before and after adjustment. A collinearity diagnosis test was performed to assess correlated variables before considering for multivariate logistic regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for all variables that were found to be significantly associated with MHM using the backward stepwise approach from the full model. All tests were performed with 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios. A two-sidedPvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The mean age of the study participants was 14.5 years (1.3 Std. deviation), with a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 19 years.

A majority (67.2%) of respondents were in primary grade 6, and 88% reached menarche when they were 10 to 14 years old. Farming is the main occupation of parents (Fathers 64.8% and Mothers 82.8%) (Table1). More than half of fathers (56.7%) and mothers (52.2%) attended primary school education level. All schools (100%) have separate toilet facilities for males and females. However, only 33.3% have functioning internal locks on the toilets, and 66.1% of the toilets were clean most of the time. A small percent (33.3%) of the schools have hand washing closer to the toilets. Overall, 75% of the studied schools were equipped with menstrual waste disposal. However, no school has incinerator. In this study, more than two-thirds (68%) of the study schools had a separate female room (Table1).

Table2revealed that, more than half of the participants (57%) knew how to wear a pad before menarche. It also revealed that 91.4% of the respondents knew that menstruation is not an illness, and 64.1% had information that women stop menstruating when they are older. 83% (83.1%) of girls knew about abdominal pain during menstruation, and 66.9% knew that menstrual blood comes from the uterus. More than half (55.7%) of the participants thought that menstruation is dirty and should be avoided.

This study revealed that 56.5% of participants knew that unclean menstrual hygiene materials may lead to infections. A greater proportion (95.8%) of the participating girls knew that menstruation is a monthly cycle, and 85.7% knew that the duration of menstruation may be a week or less.

In regard to the environmental effects of disposed menstrual pads, 75.6% knew that poor disposal can destroy the environment. 83% (83.3%) of girls knew about programmes promoting menstrual hygiene, while 79.2% received formal puberty or menstrual education.

Overall, 90.9% of the school girls attending primary school in Gakenke District had good knowledge of MHM.

Regarding attitude toward menstruation, 304 of the 384 (79.2%) school girls do not believe in stigma related to menstruation (Table3). More than three-fourth (78.1%) were comfortable discussing matters related to MHM with other people. Similarly, 76.3% of the school girls mentioned that menstruation does not affect their daily activities. In this study, 85.9% of school girls agreed that a menstruating girl should not be forbidden from some activities, with a mean of 3.88 (SD 0.72). Moreover, 85.9% of school girls believed that culture or religious beliefs do not influence MHM practices (Table3). Overall, 88.8% of respondents had a positive attitude toward MHM.

Approximately three-fourths (74.0%) of the girls used disposable sanitary pads, while the remaining 26% uses reusable pads (Table4). 76% of the school girls changes sanitary pads at least twice a day during heavy menstrual blood flow with 73% of them do it in a safe and clean place. More than half (57.3%) of the school girls dispose used sanitary pads in toilets and 28.1% in dustbins, and 11.5% burn used sanitary pads. In this study, 87.2% of school girls use water and soap to clean their garments during menstruation. 77% of the school girls dry their used sanitary pads on the sun and 89.3% take more showers during menstruation, of whom 86.5% make sure that their genital area is clean during menstruation. Only 59.6% of the girls wash their hands before and after changing their menstrual pads. Approximately three-fourths (72.9%) of the school girls in this study reported that they stored their sanitary pads in a clean and safe place between use, and 73.4% stated that they properly wore menstrual pads during menses. Overall, 76.3% of the school-aged girls changed and used clean stained garments during menstruation. This study revealed 85.7% of the school girls have good MHM practices.

In this study, none of the school-aged girls’ sociodemographic variables were associated with MHM (Table5). Awareness about programs promoting menstrual hygiene, received a formal puberty education or menstrual education, accessibility to reusable pads in their market, good knowledge about MHM, and positive attitude towards MHM were found significantly associated (P< 0.001) with MHM practice as shown in Table5.

Logistic regression analysis revealed that school-aged girls who knew that menstruation fades with age were 2.46 times more likely to practice good MHM than their counterparts (AOR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.38 to 4.83) (Table6). Similarly, those who knew that a menstruating girl could feel abdominal pain were more than double as likely to practice good MHM as those who did not, but this difference was not significant after adjustment (AOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 0.35 to 5.99). The odds of good MHM practice were 4.11 times (AOR: 4.11; 95% CI: 2.27 to 7.45) and 4.57 times (AOR: 4.57; 95% CI: 1.62 to 12.89) greater among school girls who knew that menstrual blood comes from the uterus. Similarly, those who knew that menstruation is a monthly cycle were 2.86 times (AOR: 2.86; 95% CI: 2.08 to 15.75) more likely to practice good MHM practices than those who believed menstruation is not a monthly cycle, and this difference was significant (P= 0.007). School girls who received a formal puberty or menstrual education were 2.18 times (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.19 to 9.13) more likely to practice good MHM compared to their counterparts and the difference was significant (P= 0.05).

Regarding the facility for MHM, school girls who knew that disposable and reusable pads are available on their market were 7.06 times (AOR: 7.06; 95% CI: 5.37 to 18.58) more likely to practice good MHM than those who did not, and this difference was significant (P< 0.001).

In this study, school-aged girls with good knowledge of MHM were 3.32 times (AOR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.87 to 21.05) more likely to practice good MHM than those with poor knowledge of MHM, and the difference was significant (P< 0.001). Moreover, schoolgirls who had a positive attitude toward MHH were 11.44 times (AOR: 11.44; 95% CI: 9.60 to 16.02) more likely to practice good MHM than their counterparts and the difference was significant (P< 0.001) (Table6).

Healthy MHM ensures equity in health, education, and social domains of a society. The present study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of MHM among primary-five and six school girls in Gakenke District, Rwanda. In the present study, about one in ten (9.11%) school-aged girls in Gakenke District, Rwanda, had poor knowledge regarding MHM. This finding is in line with other similar studies from Ethiopia and India [28,29]. Although 87.2% of the participating school girls had heard about menstruation before their first period, only 38.8% of them had heard about menstruation from their mothers which is similar to another study [26]. More than half (57%) of the participating school girls in Gakenke District, Rwanda, did not know how to wear a sanitary pad on their first menses (Table2). This is in line with the existing evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly when attending school [30]. Consequently, enhancing schoolgirls’ knowledge of MHM through targeted interventions remains essential.

Although menstruation is a normal physiological process in females of reproductive age, it is surrounded by taboos and supernatural perceptions [31]. In this study. only 6.3% of schoolgirls reported feeling free from menstruation-related stigma. As a result, many adolescent school girls cannot obtain adequate information regarding menstruation and hygienic practices, and they often experience menarche without preparing themselves, particularly in rural areas. This might result in adverse health outcomes and poor academic performance in adolescent schoolgirls, which is consistent with findings from other studies of comparable sociodemographic characteristics[20, 29 ].

Furthermore, poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in schools, inadequate puberty education, and a lack of hygienic MHM items (absorbents) cause girls to experience menstruation as shameful and uncomfortable [32]. Although all schools in Gakenke District, Rwanda, have a separate toilet facility for males and females, only 33.3% have an inside lock and a functioning hand-washing. This is similar to a study from Ethiopia and Nigeria [29,32]. This study revealed that schoolgirls have many shortcomings, including inadequate access to water, toilets, soap, pad changing rooms, sanitary pads for emergencies, and waste disposal infrastructure, and further intervention in service provision is required in the primary schools of Gakenke District. Corresponding to other studies, only 25% of the studied schools were equipped for menstrual waste disposal, and 68% of the schools had a separate female room. This is comparable to other studies from Ethiopia [29,33].

Knowledge and understanding about MHM are important for proper MHM practices among schoolgirls. In this study, 90.9% of the school girls in Gakenke District had good knowledge of MHM. Although, this proportion is higher than in other comparable studies: Ethiopia, Nepal, and Nigeria [29,32,33], further work should be strengthened to make it 100%, and no one girl should be left behind at home, work or in school.

Numerous MHM studies from low- and middle-income countries have been independently conducted to examine the prevalence of social, educational and health problems faced by girls with poor MHM [26,29,34]. Recognizing the relevance of MHM to the health, wellbeing and educational achievements of girls, many governments in low-income countries have initiated an array of policies and programmes implemented at different levels known by WASH. In the present study, 85.7% of school girls in Gakenke District, Rwanda had good MHM practices, based on the scores of their responses to MHM practice indicators. Therefore, further work is recommended to improve WASH in schools focused on the need for dignity and privacy, raising awareness to break the silence and stigma, making safe and effective MHM absorbents accessible, and improving the school WASH environment. Evidence indicates that separate toilets for girls, water and cleansing materials, and safe disposal of soiled materials encourage proper MHM practices among school girls [26]. There is growing evidence that improvements in hygiene services in schools have a positive impact on student health and well-being and enable equal learning opportunities and positive education outcomes. Therefore, local leaders in Gakenke District, Rwanda, should work in collaboration with stakeholders to create good MHM practices, such as the use of sanitary napkins and the washing of genital areas with water and soap, to boost confidence in day-to-day activities and prevent urinary and reproductive tract infections in schoolgirls.

MHM is directly linked to SDG 6 and contributes to the achievement of other SDGs, such as good health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5) [35]. The present study revealed that 87.2% of school girls in Gakenke District use water and soap to clean their garments during menstruation, and 89.3% take more showers during menstruation. This implies that the need for an adequate WASH facility remains paramount in this study setting. Therefore, improvements in school MHM are important for health, education, and equality. As a cross-cutting development agenda, programme integration among schools and collaboration among multiple actors are needed.

Education on puberty and menstruation is an important milestone for preparing schoolgirls both psychologically and mentally. The present study highlighted that the odds of good MHM practice was higher among school-aged girls who received a formal puberty or menstrual education as compared to their counterparts. This finding is consistent with other studies [19,35]. On the other hand, school girls who knew that disposable and reusable pads are available on the market were more likely to practice good MHM than those who did not (P< 0.001). This implies that the availability of sanitary pads encourages proper MHM practices for schoolgirls, which is in line to the existing evidences [13,14].

School girls with good knowledge of MHM were 3.32 times more likely to practice good MHM than their counterparts, and similarly, girls who had a positive attitude toward MHH were 11.44 times more likely to practice good MHM. All these differences were significantly associated (P< 0.001). Thus, achieving optimal success in MHM demands a multifaceted approach—encompassing enhanced knowledge, transformative shifts in attitudes and behaviors, and improved access to reusable pads, especially among school-aged girls.

The current study found that approximately 10% of schoolgirls exhibited limited knowledge and a negative attitude toward MHM, while 14% demonstrated poor MHM practices. Although the majority relied on commercially manufactured disposable sanitary pads, many attended schools that lacked functioning, lockable toilets, adequate handwashing facilities near restroom areas, and appropriate menstrual waste disposal systems which are crucial for safe MHM. Furthermore, only a small number of girls had received MHM education or access to emergency sanitary products. Notably, health promotion initiatives, market availability of reusable menstrual pads, sufficient knowledge, and a positive attitude were all significantly linked to effective MHM practices. Addressing these gaps requires improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure, complemented by tailored educational interventions. These recommendations support the broader objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6).

This study possesses notable strengths, particularly its inclusion of schoolgirls from both semi-urban and rural settings—groups that frequently comprise socioeconomically disadvantaged populations targeted by government welfare initiatives. Nonetheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. The cross-sectional design restricts the ability to establish causal relationships. Additionally, the study could not account for variations in MHM practices or fluctuations in the availability and quality of sanitary pads supplied through school-based menstrual hygiene services. Finally, the generalizability of the findings to other districts within Rwanda may be limited.
