In this paper, the influence of surface energy (SE) on the linear and nonlinear frequencies of anodic aluminum micro beams with [100] and [111] crystalline orientations resting on an elastic substrate are analyzed based on the Timoshenko beam (TB) and Euler–Bernoulli (EB) models, spanning Nano- to micro-scale dimensions. Given the high ratio of surface-to-volume the studied micro beams, the proposed model incorporates SE effects. To extract the micro beam frequencies, the governing the Galerkin method with trigonometric and polynomial shape functions corresponding to clamped–clamped, clamped-simply supported, and simply supported boundary conditions are used. By assuming a harmonic temporal response, the natural frequencies are derived. The study examines the influence of crystalline orientation ([100] and [111]), beam length, elastic substrate coefficient, moment of inertia, and shear deformation (via the TB) under various boundary conditions on the nonlinear and linear frequencies of the micro Timoshenko beam models and Euler–Bernoulli. A comparative analysis reveals that the EB yields higher estimates for both linear and nonlinear frequencies compared to the TB, which accounts for rotational inertia and shear deformation effects. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that crystalline orientation significantly impacts the linear and nonlinear frequencies. Specifically, the anodic aluminum microbe am with [111] crystalline orientation exhibits higher linear and nonlinear frequencies due to its greater stiffness compared to the [100] orientation.

In recent years, micro- and nanostructures have garnered significant attention in scientific and engineering communities due to their exceptional properties, including high sensitivity, superior reliability, miniaturized dimensions, and enhanced mechanical durability. These advanced structures have enabled groundbreaking applications across multiple disciplines, such as: High-precision instrumentation (atomic force microscopy probes1,2), Bio sensing and chemical detection (lab-on-a-chip diagnostic systems3–6), MEMS/NEMS devices (resonators, energy harvesters, and micro actuators4,7–9) and Biomedical engineering (e.g., targeted drug delivery systems and implantable sensors). A critical characteristic of these miniaturized structures is their exceptionally high ratio of surface-to-volume, which becomes increasingly dominant at reduced scales. As extensively demonstrated in prior research10,11, surface-related phenomena—including surface elasticity, residual stresses, and atomic-scale adhesion effects—play a non-negligible role in determining the mechanical, electrical, and thermal responses of micro/nanoscale devices. This surface dominance leads to size-dependent behaviors that frequently deviate from classical continuum mechanics predictions. Current Research Challenges are modeling complexities, fabrication-induced stresses and anisotropy considerations. Recent studies have employed modified beam theories (e.g., nonlocal elasticity or strain gradient approaches) to better capture these size-dependent phenomena, particularly for dynamic applications where resonant frequency control is crucial. The development of comprehensive models that incorporate surface energy effects, geometric nonlinearities, and substrate interactions remains an active area of research in Micro-Nano electro-mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). These effects result in fundamentally distinct physical and mechanical properties at material surfaces compared to their bulk counterparts12–14. Consequently, classical elasticity theory fails to accurately predict surface-dominated behaviors at small scales due to its inherent inability to incorporate size-dependent parameters15. This limitation has motivated extensive research efforts to develop more sophisticated models capturing surface stress and strain effects on physical behavior. Lagowski et al.16pioneered the analysis of resonant frequencies in GaAs micro beams using classical beam theory, where residual surface stress was modeled as a compressive axial force. This approach oversimplified surface stress distribution by neglecting its tonsorial nature. Gurtin and coworkers17enhanced Lagowski’s model by introducing a distributed tensile force across the beam surface to more accurately represent residual surface stress. Their work revealed that while surface elasticity significantly influences natural frequencies (contrary to16), residual surface stress plays a negligible role in dynamic response highlighting the need for model specificity. Surface elasticity (stiffness) and residual stress (pre-strain) exhibit competing influences on vibrational characteristics, requiring separate treatment in constitutive models. At nanoscale, surface energy contributions may exceed bulk energy, necessitating non-classical continuum approaches. Recent AFM-based measurements confirm that surface elasticity dominates frequency shifts in Si micro beams, supporting Gurtin-type models over compressive-stress assumptions. The Laplace-Young equation was specifically developed to model surface stresses in fluids. Gurtin et al.18utilized this equation to develop a continuum model of surface elasticity in solids. Through the Laplace-Young equation, Wang and Feng19investigated the natural frequency of an EBMB. He and Lilley20studied the effects of surface elasticity and residual surface stress on the vibrations of nanowires with various boundary conditions, and their results were validated by experimental studies21. Chen et al.22also proposed a generalized Laplace-Young equation for curved surfaces in nanostructures. The TB has been widely used to study the dynamic behavior of micro- and Nano-sized beams23,24. Abbasionejad et al.25examined the linear free vibrations of a TBMB in the presence of surface elasticity and residual surface stress. In recent years, the nonlinear vibrations of micro beams under size-dependent effects have attracted significant attention. Mohammadi and Abbasi26investigated the nonlinear vibrations of an atomic force microscope micro beam using perturbation theory. They derived expressions for the nonlinear frequency parameter and nonlinear factor of damping, observing their dependence on size-dependent parameters in the results. Toğan27examined the nonlinear vibrations of EB on an elastic foundation, incorporating third-order nonlinearities. He analyzed the of nonlocal influence, the stiffness of elastic medium, and boundary conditions on the frequency response. Shafiei et al.28studied the size-dependent nonlinear vibrational behavior of FG porous micro beams. A comprehensive investigation into the nonlinear free vibrations of piezoelectric Nano actuators was conducted by Kaghazian et al.29employing nonlocal elasticity theory. Their study systematically examined the influence of key parameters including applied direct voltage, scale factor, and geometric dimensions on the natural frequency characteristics of piezoelectric micro beams. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic behavior of microscale piezoelectric systems under varying operational and structural conditions30–35. Farsad et al.30introduces a coupled XFEM-level set approach to model nanoscale surface and interface effects, validating it through analytical, atomistic, and multiscale comparisons for nanoplates and nanobeams. He and Lilley31investigate how surface stress affects the resonance frequencies of bending nanowires by integrating the generalized Young–Laplace equation into beam theory, deriving analytical solutions for different boundary conditions and proposing an empirical relationship between the overall Young’s modulus and a surface effect factor. He et al.32systematically investigate frame-dependent constitutive equations for surfaces, defining surface elastic properties and proposing a hyperelastic incompressible surface model, with robust finite element implementations validated against theoretical results. In the present study, based on the model proposed in Ref.25, the characteristics of free vibrations of a TBMB and EBMB resting on an elastic foundation are investigated. Furthermore, the effects of surface elasticity and residual surface stress as size-dependent functions on the resonant frequencies of micro beams are discussed. The linear and nonlinear frequencies of Micro beam based on the both beam theories including TBMB and EBMB are computed and compared.

The micro beam is resting on an elastic foundation, which provides distributed support and influences its mechanical response. This model is fundamental for analyzing the dynamic and static response of microscale structures, particularly in applications involving: Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), Nano mechanical sensors and Thin-film interactions. The elastic foundation is typically modeled using Winkler-based or Pasternak-type formulations, depending on the required level of accuracy in representing shear deformation and foundation stiffness. Figure1illustrates a micro beam elastic modulus (E), shear modulus (G), density (ρ).

Additionally, the load distribution imposed by the elastic foundation upon the Nano-micro beam may be formulated via Eq. (5).

whereis the constant coefficient of the elastic foundation andrepresents the transverse displacement of the beam at a distance xx from the coordinate reference. By applying Hamilton’s principle, the governing differential equations of motion for the beam are derived using both the EB and TB, as expressed by Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively.

whereis the beam’s cross-sectional area,represents the moment of inertia, anddenotes the shear correction factor. By eliminating the right-hand side terms in Eqs. (6) and (7), the linear differential equations governing beam motion are obtained for both EB and TB. The Galerkin method can be employed to solve Eqs. (6) and (7). For this purpose, an assumed mode shape given by Eq. (8) is first considered.

By substituting Eq. (8) into Eqs. (6) and (7), multiplying both sides of these equations by the shape functionand finally integrating along the beam length, the time-dependent Eqs. (9) and (10) are derived for the EB and TB, respectively.

To solve Eqs. (9) and (10) using the Galerkin method for beams with simple-simple (SS), clamped–clamped (CC), and clamped-simple (CS) boundary conditions at both ends, the corresponding trigonometric shape functions can be assumed as given in Eqs. (18) to (20), respectively.

Alternatively, polynomial shape functions can be assumed in the form of Eqs. (21) to (23) to solve the governing equations.

The trigonometric and polynomial shape functions satisfy the geometric boundary conditions at clamped supports (zero displacement and zero slope) and simple supports (zero displacement and zero moment). When a harmonic system response is assumed in the form of Eq. (24).

Sinceis a constant coefficient, the natural frequency of the system can be derived for both EB and TB by neglecting the nonlinear term and solving the eigenvalue equation for the linear case under various boundary conditions. For the analysis of a simply supported beam using a trigonometric shape function, an explicit solution can be obtained. By applying the proposed function in Eq. (18) to Eqs. (9) and (10), relations (25) and (26) are derived for the EB and TB, respectively.

If a harmonic response for the system is assumed in the form of Eq. (24), the natural frequency of the EB can be derived in the linear case as expressed in Eq. (27).

Similarly, for the TB by neglecting the nonlinear term, the linear natural frequency can be derived in the form of Eq. (28).

When the nonlinear term is considered, the system’s frequency is derived as a function of amplitude. To compute the nonlinear frequency, various methods can be employed, such as the harmonic balance method, the partial harmonic balance method, the multiple scales method, the averaging method, the Lindstedt Poincaré method, and others. In this paper, the harmonic balance method is utilized. To demonstrate the application of the harmonic balance method for extracting the nonlinear frequency of the beam, this approach is applied to the nonlinear Eqs. (25) and (26) for the EB and TB, respectively. The presented procedure has also been implemented for other boundary conditions. For this purpose, the dimensionless parameters (32) and (33) are first introduced.

By introducing the dimensionless parameters (32) and (33), the nonlinear differential Eqs. (25) and (26) for the EB and TB are expressed in the forms of Eqs. (34) and (35), respectively.

To solve Eqs. (34) and (35) using the harmonic balance method, the system response is assumed to be in the harmonic form given by Eq. (36).

Indeed, any other harmonic combination can also be considered for the harmonic solution of the system. By substituting Eq. (36) into Eqs. (25) and (26) and separating the coefficients ofand, the set of Eqs. (37) and (38) is derived for the EB. Withassumed to be known, the two unknownsand ω are calculated in terms of. The Newton–Raphson numerical method has been employed to solve the system of equations.

Similarly, by applying the same procedure to the governing equations of the TB and separating the coefficients ofand, the system of Eqs. (39) and (40) is derived.

[111] with surface elasticityand residual stress25,32.

A strong correlation is observed between the present results and the reference data in the normalized frequency variation curves25. Furthermore, it can be inferred that as beam length increases, the surface elasticity effect diminishes significantly. For sufficiently long beams, this effect becomes negligible in the beam modeling.

Figure4demonstrates the effect of employing different shape functions on the natural frequency of an EB with [111] crystalline orientation and elastic coefficient. The frequency curves presented in Fig.4were derived using both trigonometric and polynomial shape functions for beams with simply-supported (SS), clamped-simply supported (CS)and clamped–clamped (CC) boundary conditions, according to Eqs. (18) and (23). As shown one can be concluded that the polynomial shape functions yield lower estimates of the linear frequency compared to trigonometric shape functions for all boundary conditions examined. This frequency reduction effect is consistent across the SS, CC, and CS boundary configurations. The observed behavior suggests that the choice of shape function significantly influences the predicted dynamic characteristics of Nano-micro-beams.

Figure5presents the variation of the beam’s linear frequency with respect to length changes using four different beam theories including TBMB with surface elasticity, EBMB with surface elasticity, Conventional TB and EB. The analysis considers simply-supported boundary conditions with [111] crystalline orientation and elastic coefficient. The results indicate that the EB predicts higher frequencies than the TB at shorter lengths and both theories converge for sufficiently long beams as rotational inertia and shear deformation effects diminish. In addition, the [111] crystalline orientation increases system stiffness, yielding higher natural frequencies compared to models neglecting surface elasticity. Figure6examines surface elasticity effects by comparing [111] crystalline orientation, [100] orientation and without surface elasticity effect. The results indicate that the crystalline orientation significantly impacts short-beam frequencies. In addition, the [111] orientation produces the highest frequency predictions and the [100] orientation’s negative surface elasticity reduces system stiffness. Figure7evaluates boundary condition effects. Clamped supports (CC) yield the highest frequencies due to constraint stiffness and frequency magnitudes follow: CC > CS > SS for all beam models.

A comprehensive analysis of the numerical results presented in Figs.5,6,7reveals several key findings regarding the dynamic behavior of nanobeams with surface elasticity effects. The most significant observation indicates that incorporation of surface elasticity in the theoretical model produces a marked enhancement in the frequency response characteristics of nanobeams across all considered boundary conditions. This enhancement manifests as a systematic upward shift in the natural frequency spectrum, with the magnitude of this shift being strongly dependent on the beam’s characteristic dimensions. The comparative study between models with and without surface elasticity effects demonstrates particularly pronounced differences for nanobeams with shorter lengths (L < 25 nm in the current study), where surface-to-volume ratios are substantially higher. In these cases, the frequency response may increase by as much as 10–20%, depending on the specific boundary conditions and mode number under consideration. However, this effect exhibits clear length-scale dependence, gradually diminishing for longer beam specimens (L > 25 nm) until becoming practically negligible at macroscopic scales. Furthermore, the investigation of boundary condition effects yields consistent trends across all length scales. The frequency spectrum follows a hierarchical pattern corresponding to the degree of constraint, with fully clamped (CC) configurations producing the highest natural frequencies, followed by clamped-simply supported (CS), and finally simply supported (SS) arrangements displaying the lowest frequency values. This behavior aligns with classical beam theory predictions, though the absolute frequency values are notably modified by surface effects, particularly in the nanoscale regime. The observed phenomena can be physically interpreted through two complementary mechanisms: (1) the surface elasticity introduces additional stiffness contributions that become increasingly significant at smaller scales, and (2) the boundary conditions govern the relative dominance of bending versus stretching deformation modes, with constrained configurations naturally exhibiting higher stiffness characteristics. These findings have important implications for the design of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) where both dimensional scaling and support conditions can be engineered to achieve desired dynamic performance.

To analyze the effectiveness of two different beam models in calculating the fundamental frequencies for modes 1 to 4, Fig.8has been generated. Considering identical mechanical and geometric properties for both models under investigation, it can be observed that as the mode number increases in shorter lengths, the discrepancy in predicting natural frequencies becomes more pronounced. Consequently, for higher modes, the TB should be employed to obtain accurate results. Additionally, as the beam length increases, this discrepancy diminishes, such that the results converge for relatively long beams. Therefore, for short beams, the TB must be used to derive precise solutions.

Figure9illustrates the curve of variations in the non-dimensional nonlinear frequency of the beam as a function of its dimensionless amplitude, using the TBMB, EBMB, TB, and EB models for the [111] crystal orientation with an elastic coefficient of k = 0.05 GN/m2. For better representation, the nonlinear frequency is presented in non-dimensional format by dividing it by. Given the dependence of the nonlinear frequency on the amplitude of motion, Fig.5demonstrates that, for all presented models, the nonlinear frequency increases with rising amplitude. Additionally, similar to the linear case, accounting for surface elasticity results in a higher estimation of the nonlinear frequency compared to when it is neglected. Figure10displays the effect of surface elasticity on the dimensionless nonlinear frequency of the TB for the [111] and [100] crystal orientations, as well as the case without surface elasticity. From Fig.10, it can be inferred that the nonlinear frequency for all amplitude values is predicted to be higher for the [111] crystal orientation compared to both the case without surface elasticity and the [100] crystal orientation.

The standard boundary conditions influence on the dimensionless nonlinear frequency for the [111] crystal orientation with an elastic foundation coefficient of k = 0.05 GN/m2is illustrated in Fig.11. Based on the curves presented in Fig.11, it can be concluded that the beam with CC boundary conditions exhibits the highest stiffness compared to CS and SS boundary conditions. Consequently, similar to its linear behavior, the nonlinear behavior also results in a higher natural frequency for the clamped beam.
