The most common cystic
fibrosis mutation is the F508del mutation
in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR),
which causes misfolding of the first of two nucleotide binding domains
(NBD1/2), preventing Mg/ATP-dependent NBD dimerization for normal
function. Although folding correctors elexacaftor/VX-445 and lumacaftor/VX-809
have been combined to correct the NBD1 misfolding, the exact correction
pathway is still unknown. In this study, the constrained tertiary
noncovalent interaction networks or the thermoring structures of dimerized
NBD1 in hCFTR/E1371Q with or without F508del were analyzed to identify
the weakest noncovalent bridge as the final post-translational tertiary
folding of dimerized NBD1 in response to folding correctors. These
computational analyses suggested that hCFTR primarily used cooperative
folding between α- and β-subdomains in dimerized NBD1
as the last step upon binding of the potentiator ivacaftor/VX-770.
However, the binding of folding correctors allosterically protected
the α-subdomain from misfolding until subsequent core formation.
This thermodynamic protective mechanism, unlike the chaperone-based
one in cotranslational NBD1 folding, may restore posttranslational
NBD1 folding for tight Mg/ATP-mediated NBD dimerization in the F508del
mutation and also potentially apply to treating other cystic fibrosis
patients with rare mutations.

The
protecting group strategy is typically used in multistep organic
syntheses to control the length and efficiency of the desired reactivity. Similarly, proteins also employ several protective
strategies such as chaperones, quality control mechanisms, and other
factors during the folding process to ensure correct 3D structure
and to prevent misfolding or aggregation.,A
good example is the cotranslational folding of the first of two cytosolic
nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1/2) from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) among ATP-binding cassette transporters.

NBD1 consists of an N-terminal (residues 389–491),
α-helical
(residues 500–564), and parallel-four-stranded β-sheet
core (residues 568–603) subdomains. These subdomains undergo sequential synthesis, starting with ATP-stimulated
N-terminal compaction and ending with
C-terminal compaction. The timing of these
folding events is tightly controlled to ensure that α-helical
subdomain collapse is delayed until the β-sheet core is synthesized.
To prevent misfolding, it is necessary to protect the α-subdomain,
possibly with chaperones in the ribosome during synthesis to achieve
efficient cotranslational folding without any off-pathway products.

On the other hand, considering that the
most common cystic fibrosis
mutation F508del damages CFTR folding by destabilizing NBD1 or its
interactions with ICL4, leading to a failure of Mg-/ATP-dependent
NBD dimerization for normal channel gating,−the systematic fluidic grid-like noncovalent interaction mesh networks
of NBD1, with or without the interactions with ICL4, have been constrained
as thermoring structures with the minimum energy required to stabilize
the interactions.,Although the biggest thermoring
Grid18of the isolated (F508del)­hNBD1 monomer is located
in the N-terminal subdomain, and has a calculated melting temperature
threshold (Tm,th) of 32 °C to unfold
the weakest N396–N445 H-bond, the
biggest thermoring Grid14of the partially dimerized NBD1
of full-length (F508del)­hCFTR with elexacaftor/VX445 bound is positioned
in the α-subdomain and has a calculatedTm,thof 39 °C to unfold the weakest D529–R555 salt
bridge. Furthermore, in the tightly dimerized NBD1 of full-length
(F508del)­hCFTR with Trikafta (ivacaftor/VX-770, tezacaftor/VX-661
and elexacaftor/VX445) bound, the biggest Grid10is also
present in the α-subdomain and has a calculatedTm,thof 49 °C to unfold the weakest Y517–D537
H-bond.

Since the weakest noncovalent
interaction for the final posttranslational
folding in NBD1 is located in the region that accumulates numerous
suppressor mutations, which improve NBD1 stability, CFTR folding efficiency,
and (F508del)­hCFTR processing with folding correctors such as VX-445
or VX-809 synergistically,−
,−it is of special interest to explore the hypothesis that the binding
of folding correctors initiates a protective posttranslational pathway
to prevent NBD1 misfolding in (F508del)­hCFTR in the absence of chaperones.

To test this hypothesis, the thermoring structures of dimerized
NBD1 of human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(hCFTR) with or without F508del were further analyzed in the presence
of single or combined modulators. The results demonstrated that the
weakest Y517–D537 or D529–R555 H-bond appeared in the
α-subdomain of dimerized NBD1 from hCFTR with or without F508del
upon the binding of single or combined folding correctors such as
VX445, VX-661 or VX-809. In contrast, the least-stable Q525–E585
H-bond linked both α- and β-subdomains in hCFTR with the
potentiator ivacaftor/VX-770 bound. Therefore, dimerized NBD1 in full-length
hCFTR employed a cooperative pathway in the final posttranslational
folding. However, the binding of the folding corrector to hCFTR stimulated
a protective pathway in dimerized NBD1, which was used to correct
for the structural defect of (F508del)­hCFTR.

Four cryo-EM structures of phosphorylated
and Mg/ATP-bound hCFTR/E1371Q constructs in an activated state at
4 °C were selected for thermoring analysis. Three structures
with F508 included 6O2P with VX-770 bound (model resolution = 3.3
Å), 7SV7 with VX-661 bound (model
resolution = 3.8 Å), and 7SVD with
VX-809 bound (model resolution = 2.7 Å). One structure without F508 was 8EIO with VX445/VX-809 bound (model
resolution = 2.8 Å).

The standard
methods for filtering tertiary noncovalent interactions,
along with exact calculations, were the same as those previously used,
ensuring accurate and repeatable results.,,−UCSF Chimera was used to review potential stereoselective or regioselective
intradomain lateral tertiary noncovalent interactions along the single
polypeptide chain of hNBD1 with or without F508. These interactions
included salt bridges, H-bonds, and lone pair/CH/cation–π
interactions between paired amino acid side chains. When a backbone
NH or CO at a residue position was within a cutoff distance for an
H-bond with a side chain of a nearby residue, that H-bond was also
considered. Detailed cutoff distances and interaction angles can be
obtained in the online Supporting Information (Tables S1–S4). Notably, momentary fluctuation-induced
perturbations in tertiary noncovalent interactions during protein
dynamics were not taken into account. In this study, approximately
36–43 different tertiary noncovalent interactions were identified
along the single polypeptide chain from L383/E384 to L636/Q637 of
NBD1 on each protomer.

The same grid thermodynamic
model that was previously validated was used to map the energy landscape
of tertiary folding of NBD1 in full-length hCFTR with or without F508.,,−Briefly, a black line represented the specific polypeptide chain
from the N-terminal to the C-terminal of NBD1 while colorful lines
represented specific noncovalent interactions linked by side chains
of paired protein residues (colorful arrows). When these lines formed
a systematic fluidic grid-like mesh network, each noncovalent interaction
had at least two paths between paired residues. A direct path was
the interaction itself, while a reverse path consisted of the nearby
peptide segment and other noncovalent interactions. Since the reverse
path could be shortened by Floyd-Warshall’s Algorithm as the
minimal free or silent residues that did not involve any noncovalent
interactions, the shortest direct and
reverse pathways created a thermosensitive ring or thermoring, denoted
as Grids, where “s” represented the size of a thermoring
or the total number of free or silent residues to control the weakest
noncovalent interaction within it. For example, when E391 formed an
H-bond with K447 inFigurea, if a direct path started from E391 and ended at K447, then
the peptide segment from K447 to E391 paved a reverse path. Since
another adjacent reverse path from K447 to F446, M394, and E391 had
a length of 2 (the total number of free amino acids in peptide segments
K447 to F446 and 394 to 391), and no other possible adjacent reverse
paths were shorter than 2, the shortest round path from E391 to M394,
F446, and K447 and back to E391 lined a thermoring Grid2with a two-residue size to control the least-stable E391–K447
H-bond.

Once each tertiary noncovalent interaction was assigned
a unique size, the largest thermoring could be identified to trace
the weakest noncovalent interaction along the single peptide chain.
Meanwhile, the total noncovalent interactions and grid sizes along
the same polypeptide chain could be summed up and displayed by black
and cyan circles next to the mesh network map.

The specific binding of VX-809 and VX-445 to TMD1 and the TMD2/lasso
interface is sufficient to restore normal Mg/ATP-mediated NBD1–NBD2
dimerization of (F508del)­hCFTR/E1371Q without the potentiator VX-770. Therefore, it is intriguing to explore the impacts
of folding correctors on the location and stability of the biggest
thermoring in (F508del)­hNBD1.

The dimerized (F508del)­hNBD1 (PDB,
8EIO) is a single polypeptide spanning from L383 to L636 with a disordered
regulatory insertion (RI) (residues E403 to L436). Along this peptide chain, forty-four intradomain noncovalent
interactions via amino acid side chains were located in the N-terminal,
α- and β-core subdomains (Figurea). Along with tight Mg2+binding
to T465, Q493, and D572 and tight ATP binding to W401, K464, T465,
S466 and Q493, the Q552–D529–R555 bridges formed a smaller
Grid2in the α-subdomain while F575, F587, and H609
produced the smallest Grid0in the β-subdomain (Figurea). Collectively,
a ratio of a total of 69 grid sizes to a total of 44 noncovalent interactions
was calculated as a systematic thermal stability (Ti) of 1.57 (Table). Therefore, dimerized hNBD1 was tightly folded. Meanwhile,
hNBD1 also interacted with ICL4 via E474–R1066 and E543–T1057
H-bonds and several π interactions, such as Y380–R1066,
E474–W1063, and W496–F1074 (Figureb).

required to control the least-stable noncovalent interactions in the
grids are labeled with black numbers. The least-stable Y517–D537
H-bond in the biggest Grid10is highlighted. The total
grid sizes and the total grid size-controlled noncovalent interactions
along the single peptide chain of NBD1 from L383 to L636 are shown
in cyan and black circles, respectively. (b) Noncovalent interactions

interaction are shown in and near a red circle. (d) The sequence of
the biggest Grid10to control the least-stable Y517–D537

On the other hand, despite
the tight coupling between the N- and
C-termini via K442–S623, Y627–K447 and L453–D614
backbone H-bonds, the biggest Grid10was found in the α-subdomain
along with weakened interfacial interactions between NBD1 and ICL4.
With a 10-residue size controlling the least-stable Y517–D537
H-bond, which was equivalent to 1.3 basic H-bonds, the calculated
melting threshold (Tm,th) for the thermoring
from Y517, R516, Y563, R555, D529, E528, S531, E535, N538, D537, and
back to Y517 was about 47 °C (Table), higher than theTm,thof 39 °C for (F508del)­hNBD1 with VX-445 bound. This result was consistent with the notion that
the corrector VX-445 fails to confer enough NBD1 stability to poorly
responsive variants.

If the location
of the biggest Grid10in the α-subdomain
is a result of weakened ICL4–NBD1 interactions in (F508del)­hCFTR
rather than the binding of VX445 and VX-809 to TMD1/2, then the binding
of folding correctors to hCFTR/E1371Q should reposition the biggest
thermoring in NBD1. To investigate this, the thermoring structures
of NBD1 in hCFTR/E1371Q were analyzed in response to different modulators.

After the potentiator VX-770 bound to the TMD1/TMD2 interface of
hCFTR/E1371Q, forty-six intradomain noncovalent interactions via amino
acid side chains were identified in dimerized NBD1 (Figurea). NBD1 is a single polypeptide
from L383 to Q637 and includes the disordered RI from E410 to L436. When compared with (F508del)­hCFTR/E1371Q with
VX-445 and VX809 bound (PDB, 8EIO), although the ICL4–NBD1
interactions were enhanced by the additional M469–W1063 and
F1068/Y1073–F508–F1074–L1065 π interactions
(Figureb), ATP still tightly bound to W401, G463, K464, T465,
S466, and Q493, along with the additional E391–K447 and T398–L441
H-bonds and the supplemental M394–F446 and F400–F409
π interactions (Figurea). As a result, several changes were observed in the α-
and β-subdomains (Figurea). For example, when the D529–Q552 H-bond was replaced
with the R516–Y563–Y517 π interactions in the
α-subdomain, the Y569–M595 π interaction as well
as the Y565–K598, K584–E588, E608–K611 and S631–N635
H-bonds were disrupted in the β-subdomain. In this case, when
the K503–Y512–Y517–D537–K503 noncovalent
bridges formed the new smallest Grid0in the α-subdomain,
Q525 H-bonded with E585 via their side chains, coupling both α-
and β-subdomains. Meanwhile, the T465–D572, A462–G622,
and K447–Y627 H-bonds still linked the N- and C-termini together
(Figurea). However,
the total noncovalent interactions and grid sizes changed from 44
to 46 and from 69 to 63, respectively. Therefore, the systematic thermal
instability (Ti) decreased from 1.57 to
1.37.

Notably, along with the additional
H-bond between the side chain
of Y569 and the backbone CO of K564, the Q525–E585 H-bond in
the second biggest Grid8still linked both α- and
β-subdomains via a thermoring from Y517 to I521, Q525, E585,
F587, F575, P574, Y569, K564, Y563, and back to Y517 (Figurec,d). When this H-bond were
energetically equivalent to 1.2 basic H-bonds (1.2 kcal/mol), the
calculatedTm,thwas about 50 °C
(Table), which was
the same as theTm,thof 50 °C in
NBD1 of hCFTR/E1371Q (PDB, 6MSM). Therefore,
although ivacaftor/VX-770 destabilizes full-length F508del–CFTR
and accelerates channel deactivation at 37 °C, it had no effect on cooperative folding between the α-
and β-subdomains of hCFTR/E1371Q.

When VX-770 was replaced with
VX-661, the different binding site in TMD1 disrupted the F508–Y1073
and L1065–F1074 π interactions at the NBD1–ICL4
interface, inducing a global change in NBD1 despite intact ATP binding
(Figurea,b).,In the N-terminal subdomain, the M394–F446 and F400–F409
π interactions and the T398–L441 H-bond were substituted
with the N396–D443 H-bond. In the α subdomain, the K503–D537
salt bridge as well as the R516/Y517–Y563 π interactions
were disrupted. Meanwhile, the K522–E527 salt bridge, the T501–E504
H-bond, and the Y515–S519 π interaction were created.
Following the disruption of the Q525–E585 H-bond between α
and β subdomains, the E583–K606 and T629–S631
H-bonds, together with the F626–L633 π interaction, were
replaced with a new D567–T599 H-bond and the E588–K612
salt bridge. Taken as a whole, the total number of tertiary noncovalent
interactions and grid sizes changed from 46 to 44 and from 63 to 66,
respectively. Therefore, the systematic thermal instability (Ti) also increased from 1.37 to 1.50 (Table). When the T465–D572, A462–G622,
K447–Y627, and D443–S624 H-bonds still coupled the N-terminal
with the β-core subdomain, the biggest Grid9was
identified in the α subdomain to control the D529–R555
H-bond via a thermoring from D529, E528, S531, F533, I539, D537, Y517,
Y512, F508, R560, and R555, and back to D529. When the controlled
H-bond was energetically equivalent to 2.0 basic H-bonds, the calculatedTm,thwas about 56 °C (Table), which was higher than theTm,thof 50 °C of NBD1 in hCFTR/E1371Q (PDB,
6MSM). Therefore, binding of VX-661 to
TMD1 relocated the final folding in the α-subdomain and enhanced
the stability of NBD1, regardless of the change in the ICL4–NBD1
interactions.

sequence of the biggest Grid9to control the least-stable

VX809 and VX661 share the same
binding site, leading to similar effects
on the tertiary structure of NBD1 and the NBD1–ICL4 interface
(Figurea,b). Restoring
the L1065–F1074 π interaction at the interface disrupted
the weakest Q525–E585 H-bond between the α- and β-subdomains.
As a result, in the α-subdomain, the K522–E527 salt bridge,
the Y517–D537 H-bond, and the Y515–S519 and F533–I539
π interactions were replaced by the S549–Q552 H-bond
and the Y517–Y563 π interaction. Meanwhile, in the β-core
subdomain, an H-bond shifted from D567–T599 to E583–H609
along with replacing the E588–K612 salt bridge with the E608–K611
H-bond. Lastly, while the H-bonds shifted from A462–G622 and
D443–S624 to L453–D614 and K442–S623, respectively,
at the interface between the N- and C-termini, the E391–K447
salt bridge and the N396–D443 H-bond in the N-terminal disappeared,
but the F626–L633 π interaction appeared in the C-terminal.
Overall, the total grid sizes changed from 66 to 73 along with a decrease
in the total noncovalent interactions from 44 to 38 (Figurea), resulting in an increase
in systematic thermal instability (Ti)
from 1.50 to 1.92 (Table).

sequence of the biggest Grid12to control the least-stable

On the other hand, the weakest D529–R555
H-bond was influenced
by the biggest Grid12through a thermoring from D529, E528,
S531, E527, I521, Y517, Y563, R555 and back to D529 in the α-subdomain.
Hence, the calculatedTm,thwas about
50 °C, which was the same as theTm,thof 50 °C for NBD1 in hCFTR/E1371Q (PDB, 6MSM). In this context, the binding of VX-809 to TMD1 caused a
relocation of the final folding in the α-subdomain regardless
of the change in the NBD1–ICL4 interactions.

The folding kinetics of NBD1 in hCFTR is
complex and can be influenced
by various environmental factors. The NBD1-NBD2 dimerization through
bound Mg/ATP is essential for normal CFTR activity, but this process,
when disrupted by the misfolding of (F508del)­hNBD1, can be restored
by the binding of folding correctors such as VX-445 and VX-809 to
TMD1/2, highlighting the importance of understanding the final step
of NBD1 folding for the development of an allosteric correction pathway.
In this study, the effects of different modulators on the thermoring
structures of dimerized NBD1 with Mg/ATP bound in full-length hCFTR/E1371Q
with or without F508 deletion were examined. The comparative subdomain
interactions,Tm,thvalues, and drug behaviors
suggest that the final step of posttranslational NBD1 folding under
physiological condition may involve either a cooperative or protective
mechanism, which is lacking in F508-deleted hCFTR. While the cooperative
interaction between α and β-subdomains in dimerized NBD1
was still present with the binding of VX-770 to the TMD1/TMD2 interface,
the protective step was initiated by the binding of correctors, regardless
of the presence of the F508del mutation. Therefore, this protective
folding pathway in dimerized NBD1, activated by correctors to rectify
the misfolding caused by the F508del mutation, could serve as a potential
strategy for developing drugs to treat patients with rare CF mutations
in the future.

Several lines of
evidence have demonstrated that the coupling between ICL4 and NBD1
facilitates NBD1 and full-length CFTR folding.,,A recent study further showed that the Q525–E585/S589
H-bond between α- and β-subdomains is present in the isolated
hNBD1 monomer but absent upon F508 deletion. When the RI (residues
400–439) and the regulatory extension (RE) (residue 645–675)
are removed for Mg/ATP-mediated NBD dimerization, it disappears in
hNBD1 but appears in (F508del)­hNBD1. It was also found in the (F508del)­hNBD1
monomer with 3S mutations. In contrast,
this H-bond appears again in dimerized NBD1 of full-length hCFTR/E1371Q
with or without VX-770 bound but disappears in dimerized NBD1 of full-length
hCFTR/E1371Q or (F508del)­hCFTR/E1371Q with VX-661 or VX-809 or VX-445
bound (Figuresa, a, a, a). Therefore, although the removal
of RI and RE or the introduction of the 3S mutations restores the
cooperative folding pathway used in isolated (F508del)­NBD1 from full-length
hCFTR, it was compromised in NBD1 of (F508del)­hCFTR with folding correctors
bound. In this case, an alternative protective folding pathway was
needed (Figure).

hCFTR/E1371Q with Mg/ATP/VX770 bound (PDB:6O2P) and open phosphorylated hCFTR/ΔF508/E1371Q
with Mg/ATP/VX809/VX445 bound (PDB:8EIO) are used for the models. VX770, VX-445,
and VX-809 are colored green. The N-terminal, α- and β-subdomains
in NBD1 are colored orange, cyan, and blue, respectively. The biggest
thermorings in NBD1 are shown in red. The residues responsible for
the least-stable noncovalent interactions in NBD1 are shown in space
fills.

A previous study revealed that delaying
α-subdomain compaction favors cotranslational folding of isolated
hNBD1.,This study further demonstrated that finalizing
α-subdomain compaction also facilitates post-translational folding
of dimerized NBD1 in full-length hCFTR with or without F508 in response
to folding correctors. Following the binding of a single folding corrector
VX-809 or VX-445, the weakest D529–R555 salt bridge was always
present in the α-subdomain of dimerized or partially dimerized
NBD1 (Figuresa and a). Similarly, when
two folding correctors VX-445 and VX-809 or VX-661 bind to (F508del)­hCFTR,
the weakest Y517-D537 H-bond also appeared in the α-subdomain
of dimerized NBD1 (Figurea). These results suggested that
the formation of the weakest D529–R555 or Y517–D537
bridge was the last event in the post-translational folding pathway
of dimerized NBD1 in the presence of folding correctors.

Notably,
type I correctors have been reported to enhance the stability of (F508del)­hCFTR
at the plasma membrane at 37 °C.−However, VX-445 does
not provide enough NBD1 stability for poorly responsive variants, consistent with the lowerTm,thof 39 °C of partially dimerized NBD1 in (F508del)­hCFTR/E1371Q
with VX-445 bound. This study further
indicated that the combination of VX-445 with VX809 is needed for
the higherTm,thof 47 °C to unfold
dimerized NBD1 in (F508del)­hCFTR/E1371Q (Figurec,d,Table). Similarly, when Trikafta
modulators bind to (F508del)­hCFTR, theTm,thneeded to unfold dimerized NBD1 also increases to 49 °C. Thus, the additional binding of the potentiator
VX770 may account for why Trikafta significantly boosts the activity
of (F508del)­hCFTR more than VX-445 and VX-809 at 37 °C.

On the other hand, folding correctors
lumacaftor/VX-809 and presumably
tezacaftor/VX-661 have been shown to optimize CFTR folding during
synthesis in cells. This suggests that
the folding corrector may act as a chaperone, allosterically regulating
the critical D529–R555 or Y517–D537 bridge to ensure
proper cotranslational folding of NBD1. Therefore, the type-I folding
correctors VX-809 and VX-661 not only stabilize TMD1 early in biogenesis but also initiate a protective pathway to enhance
the efficiency of NBD1 folding from cotranslation to posttranslation.
This ultimately corrects structural defects for proper (F508del)­hCFTR
synthesis and function.

A recent study identified three conserved thermoring
anchors in isolated
NBD1 monomer or dimer with or without F508 or 3S mutations. The first is the smallest Grid0formed
by the T465–Mg–Q493 and K464/T465/S466–ATP bridges
in the N-terminal subdomain upon Mg/ATP binding. The second is the
smaller Grid2shaped by Q552–D529–R555 H-bonds
in the α-subdomain. The third is the smaller Grid3lined by the E583–K606 and F587–H609 bridges in the
β-subdomain. Although these three smaller thermorings are also
conserved in dimerized NBD1 of full-length hCFTR/E1371Q, the binding of modulators to TMD1 or TMD2 or
their interface disrupted the D529–Q552 or E583–K606
H-bond in dimerized NBD1 of hCFTR/E1371Q (Figuresa, a, a, a). More importantly, the binding of single folding corrector VX-661,
VX-809, or VX-445 rendered the D529–R555 salt bridge the weakest
in NBD1 no matter whether F508del is introduced or not (Figuresa and a). Therefore, despite complex CFTR
NBD1 folding kinetics, the highly conserved D529–R555 salt
bridge is always required for normal NBD1 folding upon Mg/ATP binding.
In support of this proposal, the D529F or R555 K mutation significantly
improves NBD1 and full-length CFTR folding, possibly by restoring or enhancing kinetic coupling between α-helical
subdomain and β-sheet core (Figurea), or finalizing the folding of α-helical
subdomain (Figuresa and a).,,,On the contrary, as
the nearby L558S mutation disrupts the coordinated compaction of α-helical
and β-sheet core subdomains, which cannot be restored by the
introduction of S492P and I539T (PT), this critical D529-R555 salt bridge may be kinetically and thermodynamically
impaired. Therefore, no matter whether a cooperative or protective
folding pathway is used during CFTR biosynthesis, the highly conserved
D529–R555 salt bridge, together with the highly conserved Mg/ATP
binding site, is always needed for correct NBD1 folding in response
to complex environment perturbations. Further mutations and molecular
dynamics simulations in this region are required to illuminate the
protective role of the salt bridge in NBD1 folding and CFTR trafficking
with or without the involvement of folding modulators.

Tertiary noncovalent interactions such
as H-bonds, π interactions,
and salt bridges play a crucial role in protein folding and stability.
However, the energy landscape of these interactions is not fully understood.
Based on high-resolution 3D structures of NBD1 from hCFTR, tertiary
noncovalent interaction networks were constrained as “thermorings”
of various sizes from the smallest to the biggest to control the melting
temperature of each noncovalent interaction. This allows for minimal
energy requirements to regulate the timing of protein biosynthesis
in different scenarios. Although chaperones are typically used to
protect a subdomain from cotranslational misfolding in the ribosome,
the weakest noncovalent link can also protect a subdomain from posttranslational
misfolding. This is essential for proper protein function in response
to chemical perturbations. These findings underscore the significance
of an intrinsic thermodynamic protection strategy in the post-translational
folding of proteins and the management of relevant inherited diseases.
