Radiogenomics integrates imaging and genomic data to further refine precision oncology and is of particular interest in oncogene-driven lung cancer. By linking radiologic features with molecular alterations, radiogenomics aims to enable non-invasive tumor characterization, improve diagnostics, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. In oncogene-driven lung cancer, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has uncovered actionable oncogenes such asEGFR,KRAS,ALK,BRAF,MET,HER2, and fusions inROS1, andNTRK, which have revolutionized the management and outcomes of patients with these alterations. Radiogenomics has the potential to overcome several challenges in the clinic, such as repeat tissue biopsies, which are invasive and may be inadequate due to inherent tumor heterogeneity, by leveraging imaging biomarkers from CT, PET, and MRI to infer genomic profiles. In this review, we discuss the many recent advances in the burgeoning field of radiogenomics. We discuss how specific radiological features in oncogene-driven NSCLC, are starting to aid in mutation prediction and personalized treatment selection, and explore how radiogenomics may enhance treatment response prediction and refine prognostic models beyond traditional staging. Finally, we explore some of the challenges in its clinical implementation, including standardization of imaging protocols, data harmonization, and some of the ethical considerations regarding patient privacy and finally, we evaluate current evidence beyond lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and despite advances in early detection and treatment, the prognosis for patients with advanced lung cancer remains poor [1,2]. Historically, lung cancer has been classified into two broad categories: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with NSCLC further divided into several subtypes including adenocarcinomas, large cell carcinomas and other rarer histological types [3]. This classification of course fails to capture the full complexity of these diseases, and the various subtypes of NSCLC exhibit many distinct morphological, genomic and transcriptional profiles, each contributing to different clinical behaviours and treatment responses [4].

Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized treatments in the modern oncology era by allowing for the identification of several targetable oncogenic drivers, and driven a veritable paradigm shift in the management of NSCLC [5]. Our current armamentarium of targeted treatments has only increased in size in recent years (Fig.1), such that in oncogene-driven NSCLC, there are now nine separate validated targets which have FDA and EMA-approved therapies [6–14]. However, despite this momentous progress, several challenges remain; from tumor heterogeneity to uncertainties in the sequencing of therapies, and the burgeoning field of radiogenomics is poised to play a pivotal role in the crossroads of precision oncology.

Radiogenomics is a field that combines medical imaging with genomics to understand how these genetic alterations can influence imaging characteristics in various diseases, thereby exploring the relationship between the genetic and molecular profiles of cancers and their corresponding imaging signatures [15]. With the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, prognostic capabilities and therapeutic strategies for cancer patients, radiogenomics may address major challenges such as tumoral heterogeneity, and provide a more accurate and personalized assessment of tumors, with the potential to guide clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatments for their patients [16,17]. Moreover, this new field could play a crucial role in monitoring disease progression and detecting early signs of resistance allowing for timely adjustment of treatment strategies [16,18,19]. In advanced NSCLC, access to tissue for genomic testing may also be limited, especially in the context of re-biopsy. Thus, radiogenomics may offer a promising, non-invasive alternative by correlating imaging phenotypes with underlying genotypes.

In this review, we discuss the many recent advances in the field of radiogenomics and discuss the potential impact it may have in the field of oncogene-driven NSCLC. We discuss evidence to date, including how specific radiologic features are beginning to aid in mutation prediction and personalized treatment selection, and explore how radiogenomics may enhance treatment response prediction and refine prognostic models beyond traditional staging. Finally, we explore some of the challenges in its clinical implementation, including standardization of imaging protocols, data harmonization, and review some of the ethical considerations in addition to evaluating progress beyond lung cancer.

Radiogenomics employs a structured analytic pipeline that begins with the acquisition of high-quality imaging (typically utilizing CT or PET-CT), followed by the segmentation of the region of interest (ROI), the extraction of quantitative imaging features (radiomics), and the application of machine learning algorithms to associate these features with molecular or clinical endpoints (Fig.2) [18]. Key steps require robust feature selection, model training, and external validation to ensure reproducibility and clinical relevance [20]. In addition, standardization across each stage of this workflow is critical to advance radiogenomics to the next stage and to allow for clinical translation. In the context of oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiogenomic approaches offer the potential to non-invasively predict actionable mutations, such as EGFR, KRAS, and ALK alterations, particularly in scenarios where tissue biopsy is limited or infeasible. Integrating imaging-derived phenotypes with genomic data may help refine diagnostic strategies, guide targeted therapies, and monitor resistance in real time.

The seamless integration of radiological images and genomic profiles lies at the core of radiogenomics [15]. Medical imaging obtained via CT, positron emission tomography (PET), or MRI provide a visual representation of a tumor, with macroscopic characteristics such tumor location, size, shape, metabolic activity and density. In contrast, genomic data offers insights at the molecular level, revealing genomic information regarding altered molecular pathways and changes that are driving tumor growth. Radiogenomics then, provides an intersection, with the aim of merging the visual insights from medical imaging together with the molecular understanding provided by genomic data [27].

In the context of oncogene-addicted lung cancer, the integration of radiological and genomic data has yielded some promising developments to date. For example [21], specific imaging features such as tumor texture, spiculation and metabolic heterogeneity have been proven to predict the histological subtypes of lung cancer [22], and further studies have demonstrated that these features can correlate with actionable genomic alterations, such asEGFR,KRASorALK[23,24]. Here, we delve into recent progress in the more well-defined targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The original poster child of targeted therapy success in NSCLC, the targeting of EGFR using small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors ushered in the era of precision oncology [25–27]. EGFR is the most well-described oncogene in NSCLC, and EGFR mutations are the most frequently studied oncogenic drivers in NSCLC, particularly in Asian and non-smoking populations. Recently, strides have been made in characterizing EGFR-driven NSCLC utilizing radiogenomics. For example, certain CT imaging features have been identified and demonstrated to correlate with the presence of an activating EGFR mutation; these include the presence of irregular borders and ground-glass opacities in the lesion, pleural retraction, nodule margins.(Table1) [21,28,29]. Liu et al. used the capability of CT-based radiomic features to predict EGFR mutation status in surgically-resected peripheral lung adenocarcinomas in an Asian cohort of patients [30]. The group noted statistically significant differences in 11 radiomic features between EGFR mutant and wild type groups on univariate analysis, and that EGFR mutant status could be predicted by a set of five radiomic features that fall in three broad groups: CT attenuation energy, tumor main direction and texture defined by wavelets and Laws [30]. The group captured useful information regarding tumor phenotype, and suggested that the model that they built could be useful to predict the presence of EGFR mutations in peripheral lung cancers when mutational profiling is not feasible [30].

Zhou et al. examined the gene expression profiles of patients with NSCLC and created a radiogenomic map, that integrates CT imaging features and gene expression profiles in patients with NSCLC [21]. The group utilized gene functional enrichment and CT characteristics, to identify a cluster of co-expressed genes involved in the EGFR pathway that had a significant relationship with the degree of ground-glass opacity and irregular nodules or nodules with poorly defined margins, thereby providing proof of concept for the non-invasive identification of molecular properties of NSCLC [21].

Another international multicentre study with a large cohort of cases developed a deep learning (DL) model based on the entire lung, which achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.812 in predicting EGFR status in lung cancer; the group successfully stratified progression-free survival in patients treated with EGFR-TKI and correlations were found between radiomic phenotypes and multiple genotypes, in addition to multiple gene pathways associated with drug resistance and cancer progression mechanisms, suggesting the use of radiogenomics in predicting EGFR mutation [31]. Building on this, Wang et al., constructed a model which may assist in predicting the acquisition of known EGFR-resistance mutation T790M following targeted therapy, suggesting another potential application of radiogenomic models is optimizing and directing EGFR-targeted therapy decisions [32]. A pilot study of patients with NSCLC pre- and post-treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib collected high-resolution CT imaging to investigate whether radiogenomics could identify an EGFR-TKI response-phenotype [33]. Changes in features between scans were interrogated, in addition to delta volume and delta maximum diameter, which were strongly predictive of EGFR mutation status and of an associated gefitinib response [33]. Altogether, these data suggest that radiogenomics may be useful in both detecting EGFR mutations and have a role in predicting responses to EGFR TKIs. While classical activating mutations have been associated with specific imaging features, including ground-glass opacities, smaller lesion size, and smooth margins on CT imaging (Table1), and several studies have developed radiomic models that predict EGFR mutation status with moderate performance (sensitivity: 70–85%, specificity: 65–80%), these models have generally focused on treatment-naïve patients and classical EGFR mutations (i.e. EGFR exon 19 deletion and EGFR exon 21 L858R point mutation). Radiogenomic characterization of resistance mutations (e.g., T790M, C797S) therefore remains limited due to smaller datasets and lack of confirmatory tissue genotyping. This is a critical unmet need, especially as therapy selection increasingly hinges on distinguishing baseline or upfront EGFR alterations from acquired EGFR variants.

In advanced-stage NSCLC, where re-biopsy or comprehensive tissue profiling is often not feasible, radiogenomic models offer the potential of a non-invasive alternative. Deep learning approaches that integrate CT imaging with transcriptomic data have demonstrated the feasibility of predicting EGFR mutations in biopsy-limited or metastatic cohorts [34]. These advances support the clinical relevance of radiogenomics in advanced disease, though prospective validation is, of course, essential.

KRAS is another target for which radiogenomic studies have demonstrated that CT imaging features can predict KRAS-driven disease. Models based on low-dose CT scan and PET-CT have shown good predictive performance for identifyingKRAS-disease [35,36], however, given that KRAS has only recently become a druggable target KRAS [37,38], further validation is needed. To date, KRAS mutations have been associated with imaging features such as solid, spiculated lesions and the absence of ground-glass opacity (Table1). Most radiogenomic models to date have considered KRAS mutations as a single entity, without stratifying by molecular subtype. Given the therapeutic relevance of KRAS G12C, efforts are now underway to distinguish this subtype radiographically, though published data are limited [28]. Future radiogenomic models will need to address this gap to guide precision therapy selection.

Fusions of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)gene and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4(EML4) gene were first identified as a likely molecular driver in patients with NSCLC over twenty years ago [39]. Accounting for approximately 5% of NSCLC cases, these patients now have several TKIs targeting therapy options, though resistance is an inevitable challenge [40,41]. In keeping with EGFR-driven tumors, there are data to suggest that radiogenomics is useful in detecting ‘ALK signatures’. One retrospective study for example, identified features such as central tumor location, absence of a pleural tail and the presence of large pleural effusions as core features, demonstrating approximately 80% sensitivity and specificity [42], as well as identifying radiographic features associated with reduced survival (e.g. disorganised tumor vasculature significantly correlated with a reduced progression free survival (PFS), with a median PFS of 11.4 months compared to 20.2 months in tumors without this trait [42]. A large meta-analsysis from Alice Shaw’s group confirmed these findings, interrogating twelve studies with 2,210 NSCLC patients in an effort to define ALK-driven radiomic patterns [43]. The group concluded that compared with ALK wild types NSCLC, ALK-rearranged NSCLC was more likely to have lymphangitic carcinomatosis (OR, 3.88;P= .03), pleural metastasis (OR, 1.89;P= .02), and pleural effusions (OR, 2.94;P= .003); in addition, ALK driven disease was more likely to be solid (OR, 2.37;P< .001) and less likely to have cavitation (OR, 0.45;P= .002), more likely to have lymphadenopathy (OR, 3.47;P< .001) or pericardial metastasis (OR, 2.18;P= .04). Radiomic models incorporating texture heterogeneity and metabolic activity have also shown promise in predicting treatment response to ALK inhibitors, though these data need to be further validated [44].

While ALK-rearranged NSCLCs are often characterized radiographically by peripheral location, pleural retraction, and large pleural effusions (Table1), most published radiogenomic models focus on ALK-positive disease broadly, with limited ability to distinguish among fusion variants such as EML4-ALK versus other ALK partners. To our knowledge, no validated radiomic models currently exist to predict ALK fusion subtypes. This represents another gap in radiogenomics research, particularly given emerging data on the biological and therapeutic differences between fusion variants [42].

Recently identified as a pan-cancer tissue agnostic target [45], BRAF is a druggable tyrosine kinase within the RAS signalling pathway; BRAF V600E mutations occur in NSCLC patients at a rate of 2–5% and lead to constitutive activation and uncontrolled downstream signaling; [46,47] there are targeted therapy options for this cohort [48], however atypical BRAF variants are less well defined [49]. Currently, the data to support radiogenomic models as a predictive marker for BRAF-driven NSCLC is lacking: in a small retrospective study, Halpenny et al. compared BRAF-mutated versus wild-type, and noted that while BRAF lesions were most frequently solid, (84%), spiculated (50%), and peripheral (84%), there were no radiogenomic differences of significance distinguishing BRAF lesions from non-BRAF lesions [50].

Overall, for rare molecular alterations of lung cancer, radiogenomic studies are simply restricted by size. There are studies which have explored predicting multiple molecular subtypes through a deep learning system based on CT and/or PET/CT; [51] while encouraging – the system achieved 0.862 (95% CI, 0.758–0.969) for discrimination of a panel of 8 mutated genes, includingEGFR,ALK,ERBB2,BRAF,MET,ROS1,RETandKRAS, 0.856 (95% CI, 0.663–0.948) - these data will likely require further validation [51].ROS1gene fusions are an established oncogenic driver in NSCLC, comprising 1%-2% of NSCLC cases (Fig.1); some imaging features predictive of ROS1-driven disease have been identified, including that these tumors are more likely to be peripherally located compared to EGFR NSCLC, with lobulated margins [52]. Another group has suggested that another rare target in NSCLC, RET fusion, together with ROS1-driven disease demonstrate distinctive vascular patterns, growth characteristics and imaging features that enable one to determine fusion-positive disease from fusion-negative NSCLC [53].

Outside of NSCLC, primary brain tumors, i.e. GBM and breast cancer are major tumor types with the most promising recent progress in the field of radiogenomics. GBM remains a lethal disease with a dismal prognosis, frequently complicated by clinical dilemmas such as the identification of radiation necrosis, tumor progression, and pseudoprogression on MRI imaging [54]. Logically, given the importance of brain imaging, radiogenomics offers the potential to impact this disease greatly, to potentially offer more precise diagnosis, predict prognosis, and assess tumor response. Radiogenomics has been utilized to predict for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status in gliomas, a valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarker for the management of patients with gliomas [55,56]. Choi et al. examined 1166 patients with gliomas and developed a fully automated MRI-based deep-learning method to classify IDH mutation status, demonstrating the potential of non-invasive imaging techniques in identifying genomic alterations [57,58] In addition, more recently Ahanger et al. demonstrated a positive association between most signaling pathways active in GBM (i.e. receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)-Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3- Kinases (PI3K) signaling) and the radiomic features derived from patients MRI imaging [59]. Here the group demonstrated that DL models achieved high AUC scores, namely 0.7 for RTK-RAS, 0.8 for PI3K, 0.75 for TP53, and 0.4 for NOTCH, and demonstrating the potential of machine learning models in accurately predicting oncogenic signaling pathways from radiomic features [59].

Despite its potential, several challenges may hinder the integration of radiogenomics into routine clinical practice. A major hurdle is the need to manage and integrate vast quantities of imaging and genomic data [60]. Currently, these datasets are stored in disparate systems that lack interoperability, requiring significant investment in sophisticated software platforms capable of seamless data integration. Such systems must support standardized protocols to ensure reproducibility and consistency across institutions. Variability in imaging quality—arising from differences in equipment, scanning protocols, and timing—also poses a challenge, necessitating algorithms that can normalize and harmonize this data [18]. Similarly, heterogeneity in genomic profiling methods, which vary between laboratories and specimens, must be addressed to achieve reliable and reproducible results.

The interpretation of radiogenomic data remains a complex task [61]. While promising correlations between imaging features and genetic profiles have been reported, many findings are preliminary and need validation in larger, more diverse populations. The development of user-friendly software capable of providing real-time radiogenomic insights will be critical. These tools must be designed for multidisciplinary teams, incorporating input from radiologists, geneticists, oncologists, and bioinformaticians to facilitate accurate and clinically relevant interpretations. Education and training programs for clinicians will also be vital to ensure competency in analysing and applying these data.

Ethical and legal concerns may further complicate the integration of radiogenomics. The collection, storage, and sharing of genomic data raise significant issues around patient confidentiality and data security [62]. Establishing robust frameworks for informed consent will be crucial. In addition, radiomics is a data-hungry methodology, and regulatory directives such as GDPR or HIPPA can impair easy unobstructed flow of data between institutions.

The advent of radiogenomics represents a paradigm shift in the understanding and management of lung cancer and other solid tumors. While radiogenomics may be poised to transform the landscape of lung cancer, it is an evolving field and the use of radiogenomics for personalized medicine remains investigational. By integrating non-invasive radiological signals with genomic data, radiogenomics offers the potential of an unparalleled window into tumor biology, facilitating precise non-invasive tumor profiling and adding to our current knowledge base in NSCLC. Several aspects of lung cancer care may reap the many benefits, from diagnosis and prognosis to impacts on therapeutic decision-making and surveillance.

While developments are promising, there is still a long way until radiogenomics will be integrated into clinics and delivered to our patients as standard of care. Although unlikely to replace tissue sampling in the near future, the continued improvement in models and diverse imaging datasets may deliver on the promise of a “virtual biopsy.” Perhaps when genomic analysis is not feasible via tissue sampling, in the near future, these methods may offer prognostic considerations or additional therapeutic options for patients.

As technology continues to evolve, current limitations - such as challenges in data integration, standardization, and interpretation - need to be overcome. Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and multi-omics integration will further refine radiogenomic applications, making them more accessible and clinically impactful. These developments may enable radiogenomics to become a cornerstone of precision oncology, influencing clinical trials and standard practice.

The future of radiogenomics in lung cancer is therefore promising, with the potential to improve outcomes for patients and to advance our collective understanding of cancer biology. By fostering a more nuanced, precise, and dynamic approach to cancer care, radiogenomics offers the potential to significantly reduce the trial-and-error nature of current treatment paradigms and pave the way for breakthroughs beyond lung cancer, extending its impact across tumors.
