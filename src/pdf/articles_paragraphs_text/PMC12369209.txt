More and more long non-coding RNA small nucleotide host RNA (SNHG) gene family has been confirmed to be unregulated in cervical cancer (CC) tissues, and it is significantly related to the prognosis of CC. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to explore the correlation between the expression level of SNHGs and the prognosis of CC.

Six relevant electronic databases were searched, relevant original documents were screened, and the research quality of each document was assessed based on the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) scale. Relevant data were extracted including SNHG expression levels, survival outcomes and follow-up time. Hazard ratio (HR) and Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were combined to assess the association between SNHG expression and overall survival (OS) TNM stage, tumor size, depth of invasion. The sensitivity analyzes and Begg’s test was conducted to explore potential publication bias.

The results of pooling HR with 95%CI indicating the marked positive association between increasing SNHG expression and poor OS (HR: 2.046, 95%CI: 1.402–2.691). In addition, high SNHG expressions contribute to advanced TNM stage (OR: 1.476, 95%CI: 1.178–1.849), easier to lymph node metastasis (OR: 1.614, 95%CI: 1.021–2.553), bigger tumor size (OR: 1.299, 95%CI: 1.031–1.638). Meanwhile, an insignificant relationship was also found between high SNHGs expression and histological grade (OR: 1.053, 95%CI: 0.814–1.361), DM (OR: 1.659, 95%CI: 0.969–2.838), depth of invasion (OR: 1.126, 95%CI: 0.466–2.726) and age (OR: 1.115, 95%CI: 0.899–1.382). Sensitivity analysis suggests the reliability and robustness of OS, the results of Begg’s test indicated that there is no significant publication bias in the original literature.

Most SNHGs are highly expressed in CC tissues, elevated SNHG expression predicts poor prognosis of CC, SNHG may serve as a potential target for tumor therapy and a promising prognostic marker.

Cervical cancer is one of the major cancers threatening women [1–3]. It has imposed tremendous psychological and physical stress on women and caused a huge economic burden worldwide every year. According to the global cancer statistics in 2021, the number of new cases and deaths of CC in 2020 was 604,127 and 341,831 respectively, ranking 9th among the global new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths [4–7]. The survival rate of CC is closely associated with clinical stage, pathological type, treatment method, and the overall health status of patients [8,9]. The prognosis of early-stage CC is relatively good, while that of advanced or recurrent CC is relatively poor [10,11]. With the gradual application of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of CC, the survival rate of CC patients has been significantly improved [12–15]. However, many patients inevitably develop drug resistance during chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy [16–19]. Therefore, the prognosis of most patients has reached a bottleneck, and it is difficult for them to obtain significant survival benefits [20]. In recent years, many researchers have attempted to identify new tumor treatment targets to provide new options for clinical treatment.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers [21–23]. As a class of small molecules longer than 200 nucleotide units and lacking protein-coding functions, lncRNAs have been shown to significantly influence the occurrence and development of many tumors [24–26]. Firstly, lncRNAs can affect the proliferation of tumor cells by regulating the expression of transcription factors [27]. They can also regulate the migration, invasion, and apoptosis of tumor cells by directly acting on downstream genes or signaling pathways [28]. In addition, lncRNAs can act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), indirectly regulating downstream genes or signal cascades by sponging microRNAs and intervening in a series of cell biological behaviors of tumor cells, such as proliferation, migration, and drug tolerance [29]. Most lncRNAs have been shown to be significantly associated with cancer prognosis. For example, Liu et al. discovered that lncRNA BRAF-activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) may contribute to the growth and migration of endometrial stromal cells by serving as a ceRNA, upregulating the expression of tripartite motif-containing 59 (TRIM59) through sponging and downregulating miR-15a-5p [30].

Small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs), as a family member of lncRNAs, have long attracted the attention of researchers. As an RNA family, SNHGs have numerous members, including SNHG1, SNHG3, SNHG4, GAS5 (SNHG2), SNHG15, DANCR (SNHG13). Many SNHGs have been shown to significantly affect the prognosis of CC by regulating the proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug tolerance of CC cells. For example, Zhang et al. found that lncRNA SNHG14 induces the proliferation and invasion of CC cells by increasing caspase-3 and decreasing Bax, JAK2, and STAT3 [31]. Zhu et al. suggested that lncRNA SNHG16 may enhance the proliferation and invasion ability of CC cells by upregulating zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox protein 1 (ZEB1) through sponging and decreasing miR-216-5p [32]. The high expression of many SNHG family members has been shown to be significantly associated with poor prognosis of CC, such as SNHG1, SNHG7, and SNHG14 [33–35]. Based on this, this study aims to conduct a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the correlation between the expression levels of SNHGs and the prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics of CC patients, providing potential targets and promising prognostic markers for the treatment of CC.

A systematic search was conducted across six electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and Wanfang Database) to identify relevant publications from their inception to January 1, 2025. The search terms were structured as follows: (“SNHG” OR “Small Nucleolar RNA Host Genes” OR “DANCR” OR “Differentiation Antagonizing Non-Protein Coding RNA” OR “LRRC75A-AS1” OR “Leucine-rich repeat containing 75A-antisense RNA1” OR “MEG8” OR “Maternally Expressed Gene 8”) AND (“Cervical Cancer” OR “Cancer of the Cervix” OR “Carcinoma of the Cervix” OR “Cervix”). Note: LRRC75A-AS1 (SNHG29) and MEG8 (SNHG23/SNHG24) were included as aliases. To ensure comprehensive coverage, manual searches of reference lists from identified articles were additionally performed.

Studies employing standardized methods (qRT-PCR) with defined cutoff values (mean or median) for quantifying SNHG expression levels.

Investigations explicitly evaluating associations between SNHG expression and CC prognosis.

Bioinformatics analyses without clinical validation.

Studies lacking primary endpoints (e.g., overall survival [OS]) or secondary outcomes (e.g., TNM stage, lymph node metastasis [LNM], distant metastasis [DM]).

The methodological quality of observational studies included was evaluated using the NOS, a validated tool for assessing non-randomized studies. The NOS framework comprises three domains: Selection (4-star maximum for cohort studies; 3-star for case–control), Comparability (2-star maximum), Exposure/Outcome (3-star maximum). A maximum score of 13 stars was attainable for cohort studies and 9 stars for case–control studies, with higher scores indicating superior methodological rigor. While the NOS lacks strict quality thresholds, studies achieving ≥ 7 stars were operationally classified as high-quality based on established conventions in oncology research [36].

Two researchers independently extracted the relevant information of each original document, including the first author's name, publication year, follow-up time, SNHG detection method, cut-off value, and SNHG expression level. To explore the correlation between the expression level of SNHG and the survival outcome, the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted. For the literature that only provided the survival curve but did not provide the HR value, the software of Engauge 4.0 version was adopted (http://markummitchell.github.io/engauge-digitizer) [37]. The version of the software indirectly obtains the HR value. Furthermore, to explore the correlation between the expression level of SNHG and the clinicopathological parameters of CC patients, odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were extracted. If the data extracted by the two researchers were inconsistent, it was resolved through discussion, or a third researcher was asked for help.

The software of Stata SE 12.0 (StataCorp) were adopted in this meta-analysis. Combining HR with 95%CI was conducted to evaluate the association between SNHG expression and the prognosis of CC patients. Pooling OR with 95%CI was performed to explore the relationship between SNHG expression Clinicopathological parameters of CC patients such as tumor size, histological grade, depth of invasion or TNM stage. As for the heterogeneity of each result, I-square (I2) andp-value were used. As forI2< 50%,p> 0.05, The results were not considered to be significantly heterogeneous, the fixed-effect model would be used. IfI2≥ 50%, p ≤ 0.05, we believe there is significant heterogeneity in the results, the random-effect model was performed, and the subgroup would be conducted. The sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness and reliability of the overall results. The Begg’s test was used to explore whether there is significant publication bias in each result.

Following a systematic review of relevant literature, a total of 257 original articles were initially retrieved. Through subsequent screening processes, 152 duplicate publications were eliminated from consideration. Among the remaining 105 articles, 39 literature reviews, 26 articles involving animal experiments, and 8 non-English publications were excluded. Further exclusions included 15 studies with inadequate data and 3 pre-existing meta-analyses. Ultimately, 15 eligible studies comprising 1037 CC patients were included in this meta-analysis [31,32,35,38–49] (Table1and Fig.1).

The included patient cohort (n= 1037) was exclusively composed of Chinese subjects, with follow-up durations ranging from 30 to 120 months across studies. Individual study sample sizes varied between 30 and 124 cases. All 15 investigations consistently demonstrated significant overexpression of SNHG family members in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The expression levels of SNHG were systematically investigated for their association with critical clinical outcomes, including OS, TNM staging, and lymph node metastasis (LNM). Quality assessment conducted using the NOS revealed that all 15 included studies achieved scores no lower than 6 points (maximum 9) (Table2), indicating satisfactory methodological quality for meta-analytic inclusion. This rigorous evaluation process confirms the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the selected studies for comprehensive data synthesis.

Ten publications with 683 CC patients were collected to assess the relation between SNHGs expression and OS. Combining HR with 95% confidence interval (CI) showed the markedly positive association between high SNHGs expression and poor OS (HR: 2.046, 95%CI: 1.402–2.691) (Fig.2). Although no significant heterogeneity was observed, subgroup analyses were conducted in this study due to the incomplete consistency in follow-up duration, cut-off values, and study quality among different original studies. These analyses were based on follow-up time (less than or not less than 60 months), cut-off values (mean or median), and study quality (9 points or below 9 points). The results of the subgroup analyses revealed that a significant positive correlation between high expression of SNHG and poor CC prognosis was observed in all subgroups. This correlation was noted in the subgroups with not less than 60 months follow-up months (HR: 2.014, 95%CI: 1.349–2.679), mean cut-off values (HR: 1.937, 95%CI: 1.108–2.767), median cut-off values (HR: 2.344, 95%CI: 1.002–3.686), less than 9 of NOS score (HR: 2.009, 95%CI: 1.360–2.659) (Table3).

Thirteen studies containing 970 patients were enrolled in this research to evaluate the relationship between SNHG expression and TNM stage of CC patients. A significant positive relation between increasing SNHG expression and advanced TNM stage was found (OR: 1.476, 95%CI: 1.178–1.849) (Fig.3). Given the inconsistencies in NOS scores, subgroup analyses based on NOS score (9 or less than 9 points) were conducted. The high expression of SNHGs was significantly positively correlated with advanced TNM stages in the subgroup of less than 9 of NOS score (HR: 1.746, 95%CI: 1.354–2.25) (Table4).

Thirteen research including 970 cases were obtained to explore the association between SNHGs expression and LNM, significantly positive relationship between elevating SNHGs expression and easier lymph node metastasis was revealed (OR: 1.614, 95%CI: 1.021–2.553) (Fig.4). A significant heterogeneity (I2= 65.2%,p= 0.001) was observed, and the subgroup analyses were implemented. An obvious correlation was also manifested between increasing SNHGs expression and the subgroup of less than 9 of NOS score (HR: 1.764, 95%CI: 1.331–2.337) (Table4).

Other clinical pathological characteristics were also assessed. The significant association between high SNHGs expression and bigger tumor size (OR: 1.299, 95%CI: 1.031–1.638) (Fig.5). In the meantime, insignificant association between high SNHGs expression and distant metastasis (OR: 1.659, 95%CI: 0.969–2.838) (Fig.6), histological grade (OR: 1.053, 95%CI: 0.814–1.361) (Fig.7), deeper invasion (OR: 1.126, 95%CI: 0.466–2.726) (Fig.8) and age (OR: 1.115, 95%CI: 0.899–1.382) were also observed (Table4).

The outcome of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the aggregate findings remained stable even after excluding the data from any individual study, which implies that the conclusions drawn regarding OS are consistent and sturdy (Fig.9). The Bgger's regression test outcomes pointed to the insignificance of various clinical and pathological factors in relation to OS: (p-value >|z|= 1.000), TNM stage (p-value >|z|= 0.045), LNM (p-value >|z|= 0.389), tumor dimensions (p-value >|z|= 0.513), distant metastasis (DM) (p-value >|z|= 1.000), and histological grade (p-value >|z|= 0.101), indicating that there is likely no substantial publication bias or other forms of bias in the underlying research (Fig.10).

Although without the capability to encode proteins, most of the SNHG family members have been revealed to play important roles in various cancers including lung cancer [50], breast cancer [51], colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and osteosarcoma. SNHGs could directly act on downstream signaling pathways or indirectly regulate them by acting as competitive endogenous RNAs, sequestering microRNAs, thereby affecting tumor cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and drug resistance. For example, Bai et al. reported that SNHG1 may promote the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by sponging and downregulating miR-497 and miR-195-5p [52]. Xu et al. revealed that SNHG6 may enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by downregulating miR-26a/b and regulating Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) expression [53]. To date, many studies have reported that aberrant expression of SNHGs may predict different survival outcomes in CC, and numerous studies have attempted to explore the correlation between SNHG expression levels and CC prognosis. Based on this, the present study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the correlation between the expression levels of SNHG family members and the prognosis of CC, providing reliable evidence for clinical decision-making.

This study included 15 original studies. Based on the NOS scale score, all original literature met the inclusion criteria. The combined HR results indicated that high expression of SNHGs predicted poor survival outcomes in CC. Although heterogeneity was not significant, inconsistencies in follow-up time, SNHG expression levels, sample size, and cutoff values among different studies were the main sources of bias. Therefore, we performed subgroup analyses based on follow-up time, SNHG expression levels, sample size, and cutoff values. The results showed that all SNHG family members enrolled in this meta-analysis were upregulated in CC. High SNHGs expressions predicted poor survival outcomes (HR: 2.046, 95%CI: 1.402–2.691,I2= 0, P= 0.995). Additionally, the correlation between SNHG expression levels and clinical pathological parameters in CC patients was also explored. The results indicated that high expression of SNHGs was significantly positively correlated with many clinical pathological parameters in CC patients, including advanced TNM stage (OR: 1.476, 95%CI: 1.178–1.849), Easier lymph node metastasis (OR: 1.614, 95%CI: 1.021–2.553), and bigger tumor size (OR: 1.299, 95%CI: 1.031–1.638). In the meantime, insignificant association between high SNHGs expression and distant metastasis (OR: 1.659, 95%CI: 0.969–2.838), histological grade (OR: 1.053, 95%CI: 0.814–1.361), deeper invasion (OR: 1.126, 95%CI: 0.466–2.726) and age (OR: 1.115, 95%CI: 0.899–1.382) were also observed. The main source of heterogeneity was the expression level of SNHG, and we conducted subgroup analyses based on it.

There was no significant heterogeneity overall (I2= 0%,P= 0.978). However, within the subgroup with a NOS score of 9, there was significant heterogeneity (I2= 93.3%,P< 0.0001), and similarly, within the subgroup with a NOS score below 9, there was also significant heterogeneity (I2= 56.7%,P= 0.006). This might be because the results of Cao et al. had a considerable impact on the overall findings. Cao et al. reported a significant positive correlation between high SNHG expression and favorable TNM staging, which is contrary to other studies. Therefore, For most SNHG family members, high expression of SNHG is positively correlated with advanced TNM staging. The pooled OR and 95% CI results indicated considerable heterogeneity in lymph node metastasis (LNM). Subgroup analyses based on different NOS scores revealed that the subgroup with a NOS score of 9 exhibited significant heterogeneity. This subgroup includes two studies, one of which (Cao et al.) presents results opposing those of all other studies, thus being the main source of heterogeneity. In other words, in most cases, high SNHG expression predicts distant lymph node metastasis, while in a very small proportion, high SNHG expression suggests less likelihood of lymph node metastasis”. The lack of correlation between high SNHG expression and distant metastasis (DM) or depth of invasion, there are several potential reasons as follows: firstly, the sample size of our study might be insufficient, leading to inadequate statistical power to detect significant associations. Secondly, the results of Cao et al. are contradictory to those of other studies, which could have influenced the overall results and rendered them statistically non-significant. Thus, we suggest that increasing the sample size could strengthen the conclusions of this research.

Sensitivity analysis results showed that removing any single study would not significantly affect the overall results. The publication bias results indicated that theP-values for each indicator were greater than 0.05, suggesting that there was no significant publication bias in the outcome indicators of this study.

A relevant study has been identified, which provided both survival curves (including patient numbers for low/high expression groups) and explicitly reported HR values with 95% confidence intervals [34]. Via analysis using Engauge software, an HR of 3.22 (95% CI: 1.26–8.25) was obtained, whereas the original publication reported an HR of 4.434 (95% CI: 1.629–12.069). Regarding the minor discrepancies between these results, the following clarifications are provided: The differences observed may be attributed to potential human error during the process of data extraction. Variations might also emerge due to inherent differences in algorithmic implementations across various software platforms. It should be noted that the degree of variation lies within an acceptable range for this secondary analysis. Importantly, both sets of results demonstrate reasonable consistency in terms of effect direction and statistical significance.

Most of researchers attempted to explore the molecular biological mechanisms by which SNHGs regulate CC (Table5) [32–35]. Firstly, SNHGs can directly interact with downstream genes, and regulate signaling pathways. For example, Zeng et al. found that SNHG7 facilitate the proliferation and invasion of HeLa and C-33A cells by regulating E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin. Zhu et al. observed that SNHG3 could induce the migration, invasion and proliferation of HeLa cells via up-regulating Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). Secondly, SNHGs can indirectly regulate downstream signaling cascades by serving as ceRNAs. For example, Zhu et al. revealed that SNHG16 contribute to the proliferation and invasion of SiHa cells through the up-regulation of Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1 (ZEB1) by absorbing and down-regulating miR-216-5p. Guo et al. demonstrated that SNHG20 may promote proliferation and invasion of HeLa and SW756 cells by increasing ADAM Metallopeptidase Domain 10 (ADAM10) expression by sponging miR-140-5p.

This study still has some limitations. First, the SNHG family has dozens of members, and only a little more than ten have been explored so far, with a large part of the members not yet evaluated for their correlation with CC prognosis. Therefore, the conclusions of this study only represent the correlation between the prognosis of CC and some members of the SNHG family (GAS5, SNHG7, SNHG9, SNHG12, DANCR, SNHG15, SNHG16). Second, in the included original studies, some studies only provided survival curves and case numbers, without providing HR values and 95% CI. This study indirectly extracted the HR values, and 95% CI of patients based on Engauge software, which inevitably led to statistical bias or other biases. In addition, the patients included in this study were mainly Chinese, so the results or conclusions of this study may only be applicable to the Chinese population or the East Asian population. Finally, inconsistencies in follow-up time, case numbers, cutoff values, and SNHG expression levels among different original literature all had a certain impact on the results. Despite these limitations, this study is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the correlation between SNHG expression levels and CC prognosis, comprehensively assessing the correlation between SNHG expression levels and overall survival, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor diameter, and histological grade. Moreover, this study also summarized the molecular biological mechanisms by which SNHGs regulate the progression of CC.

Most SNHGs are highly expressed in CC tissues. High expression of SNHG predicts poor prognosis of CC, and SNHG can be a potential therapeutic target and a promising prognostic marker for CC.
