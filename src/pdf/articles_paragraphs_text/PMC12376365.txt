PTH plays a crucial role in bone remodelling by regulating bone formation. Pre-collagen type 1 N-terminal peptide (P1NP) is a key biomarker indicative of new bone formation. However, the relationship between PTH levels and P1NP levels in patients with osteoporotic fractures (OPFs) has not been fully elucidated.

This study analyzed data from 588 OPFs patients hospitalized between January 2015 and March 2022. Serum P1NP concentration serve as the dependent variable, while PTH level serve as the exposure variable. Covariates included age, gender; Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), platelet, triglyceride, albumin, hemoglobin. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the independent association between PTH and P1NP levels, adjusting for covariates. Non-linear relationships were evaluated using generalized additive models.

This study found a positive association between PTH level and P1NP level in patients with OPFs (β = 0.59; 95% CI [confident interval] = 0.22 to 0.96;P= 0.0018). This association remained significant after multivariate adjustment. Moreover, the nonlinear model showed a threshold effect, with PTH level below 16.63 (pg/mL) being positively correlated with P1NP (β = 1.69; 95% CI = 0.90 to 2.47;P< 0.0001). However, this correlation did not hold true for PTH level above 16.63 (pg/mL) (β = 0.37; 95% CI = -0.34 to 1.07;P= 0.3091).

This study identified an inflection point and a nonlinear, threshold effect in the relationship between PTH and P1NP levels. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Osteoporosis (OP) is marked by a decrease in bone density and degradation of bone microstructure, leading to a heightened risk of fractures [1,2]. The diagnosis of osteoporosis relies on assessing bone mineral density (BMD) [3,4]. Osteoporotic fractures and related complications typically become more prevalent in females aged 55 years and beyond, and in males aged 65 years and beyond [5]. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) substantially heightens the risk of fractures, as well as non-skeletal injuries, leading to subsequent pain and detrimentally impacting quality of life.

The N-terminal propeptide of collagen type 1 (P1NP) is a precursor peptide discharged into the circulatory system during the formation of type I collagen, the predominant collagen type within the bone framework [6]. Assessing the level of P1NP in the bloodstream serves as a vital diagnostic method for evaluating bone metabolic activity, particularly the rate of bone formation. Elevated P1NP levels signify heightened bone generation, which may arise in growth phases during the recovery process post a fracture, or in reply to particular OP therapies. On the contrary, diminished P1NP levels may indicate insufficient bone formation, posing a concern within circumstances like OP or alternative metabolic bone disorders [7].

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is crucial in regulating bone metabolism. PTH is secreted by the parathyroid chief cells and affects calcium-phosphorus homeostasis, particularly serum calcium levels, by binding to specific receptors on key tissues, such as bone and kidney. PTH affects bone formation and resorption through mechanisms such as its action on PTH/PTHrP receptors [8,9]. Previous studies have shown that intermittent PTH therapy significantly increases P1NP levels and bone mineral density among OP patients [10,11].

Although the relationship between PTH and markers of bone metabolism has been established in specific conditions such as hyperparathyroidism, the relationship between PTH and P1NP in patients with osteoporosis, especially those with osteoporotic fractures, has not been fully elucidated. The available literature suggests that intermittent PTH treatment lead to significant increases in both the P1NP levels and BMD in patients with osteoporosis, suggesting the likelihood of an association between PTH and P1NP levels, as PTH known to stimulate bone resorption and activate osteoblasts indirectly, in turn affecting the release of P1NP [12]. Furthermore, PTH and antiresorptive therapy have been observed to increase and decrease P1NP levels, respectively, in patients with osteoporosis. However, there have been few specific investigations of the relationship between PTH and P1NP, especially in Chinese patients with osteoporotic fractures.

The primary objective of this study was to explore the possible threshold relationship between PTH and P1NP in patients with osteoporotic fractures and assess the clinical significance of the relationship. Elucidating of the relationship between the two will provide insight into the mechanisms involved in bone metabolism and offer new perspectives on the clinical management of osteoporosis. This could potentially guide optimization of the parameters of PTH-related therapies such as teriparatide, and may also improve the methods used for fracture risk assessments and the monitoring of treatment effects. This study addresses a critical knowledge gap by characterizing the relationship between PTH and P1NP in Chinese patients with osteoporotic fractures, providing population-specific insights into bone metabolism.

This retrospective investigation involved the analysis of prospective data obtained from willing participants treated at the Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University (Kunshan, Jiangsu, China) between January 2015 through March 2022. The hospital, serving as a specialized referral facility, has affiliations with the authors of this study. A total of 3558 consecutive patients with OPFs who underwent orthopedic surgery were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) must be at least 50 years of age; (2) must have a diagnosis of fracture determined by radiography or computed tomography, including fractures of the wrist, proximal humerus, lumbar spine, thoracic spine, femoral neck, and femoral rotor/subrotor region; (3) must be hospitalized and receiving surgical intervention; (4) must have clinical data in the hospital records; (5) must be contactable by telephone. Individuals meeting the subsequent criteria were not considered: (a) participants diagnosed with secondary OP (n= 610); (b) data for individuals with missing information (n= 2144); (c) abnormalities of calcium and phosphorus metabolism (n= 38); (d) patients aged less than 50 years (n= 125); (e) people with thyroid diseases (n= 6), (f) vitamin D, calcium, PTH medications users (n= 47). For an osteoporosis diagnosis, a fragility fracture must be present without additional metabolic bone conditions, despite having a normal bone mineral density (T-score). If no fracture occurs, a T-score of ≤ −2.5 is indicative of osteoporosis [13]. According to the exclusion criteria outlined above, a total of 588 patients were eligible for subsequent analysis. The patient selection process, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, has been illustrated in the schematic diagram presented in Fig.1. Baseline population characteristics were described using the entire screening population, while all statistical analyses were performed only on the 588 patients who met the inclusion criteria.

The present work was granted ethical approval from the Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University (approval No. 2021-06-015-K01) and also meticulously adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patient information was originally gathered to enhance the standard of care provided by the hospital. Moreover, all individuals had completed an informed consent record prior to any data collection commenced. Throughout the investigation, all data evaluators were kept unaware of the identities of the patients.

The levels of serum P1NP were measured utilizing the automated electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay on the Roche cobas8000/e602 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).

The independent variable examined in this research was the abstaining blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) level gathered during the early hours, measured using the chemiluminescence technique on the Beckman Coulter Unicel DXI 800 instrument (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA), employing the resistivity method. The intra-assay coefficient of variation for P1NP measurement was < 3.0%, while the inter-assay coefficient of variation was < 3.5%; for PTH measurement, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was < 4.0%, and the inter-assay coefficient of variation was < 5.0%. These values are consistent with international clinical laboratory standards, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our research results.

The factors considered as covariates included age, gender, BMI, alcohol consumption (present or absent), smoking behavior (present or absent), CCI [14], lymphocyte count, monocyte count, blood sugar level, LDL level, HDL level, GH level, APTT, PT, serum potassium concentration, magnesium concentration, triglyceride concentration, albumin level, calcium level, hemoglobin level and platelet count. Every clinical parameter was assessed while patients were in a fasting state within three days of their hospital admission.

Demographic details, clinical data, and laboratory features of all participants were presented as mean values with SD for continuous variables or frequency distributions (expressed as a percentage) for categorical variables. Every qualitative variable underwent univariate analysis employing either Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test [15,16]. In parallel, Continuous parameters manifesting normal distribution underwent statistical examination utilizing the independent samples t-test, whereas those displaying non-Gaussian distribution were analyzed statistically employing the Mann-Whitney U test [17]. Additionally, the link between PTH concentration and P1NP concentration was explored through univariate linear regression analysis.

The autonomous connection among PTH and P1NP concentration was investigated using generalized estimating equations (GEE), with covariates being adjusted for. Results from the unadjusted analysis (crude model), analysis with minimal adjustment (Model I), and analysis with comprehensive adjustment (Model II/III) were examined. Initially, a variance inflation factor (VIF) examination was performed to diagnose collinearity among the covariates. Subsequently, the subsequent conditions were utilized to determine if adjustments to the covariates were necessary: (1) The independent variable is either incorporated into the the unadjusted model or eliminated from the fully adapted model if the related odds ratio (OR) alters by 10% or greater; (2) The first criterion or any factor with a significance level ofP< 0.1 in the single-variable model. Therefore, Model II for the thoroughly corrected examination was formulated according to the initial standard.

Moreover, a generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to uncover non-linear relationships among the factors within interest [18]. Upon detecting any nonlinear correlation, the boundary effect (depicted as a smoothing curve) was determined by employing a two-segment linear regression model. If a clear proportion could be distinguished in the smoothing curve, the inflection point where the most appropriate model was to be implemented was automatically determined using the iterative method. Additionally, the resilience of and the possible diversity in the various subcategories was assessed by iterating through subgroup analyses while categorizing according to diverse factors. Following that, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was utilized to scrutinize the alterations and interconnections of the distinct subcategories [19].

Every statistical computation was executed using R software (Version 3.6.3) and Empower Stats (X&Y solutions, Inc., Boston, MA, USA).Pvalues beneath 0.05 were deemed indicative of statistical significance.

Table 1 provides details of the patient characteristics, including demographic and clinical information. A total of 588 patients with osteoporotic fractures (OPFs) were included in the final analysis. The study population had a mean age of 68.90 ± 11.10 years, with females constituting 69.51% of the cohort. The mean serum P1NP concentration was 57.90 ± 32.00 µg/L, and the mean PTH level was 13.25 ± 6.94 pg/mL.

Univariate analysis revealed a significant positive association between PTH and P1NP levels (β = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.97;P= 0.0017). This relationship remained robust after multivariate adjustment in both Model Ib(adjusted for demographic and clinical factors: β = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.23;P< 0.0001) and Model IIc(additionally adjusted for platelet count: β = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.24;P< 0.0001) (Tables2,3).

The generalized additive model analysis identified a non-linear relationship between PTH and P1NP levels with a significant threshold effect (P< 0.05 for LRT test). The inflection point was found to be a PTH level of 16.63 pg/mL. Below this threshold, there was a strong positive correlation between PTH and P1NP levels (β = 1.52; 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.32;P< 0.0001), while no significant association was observed above this threshold (β = 0.24; 95% CI: −0.48 to 0.95;P= 0.5165). The difference in slopes between the two segments was statistically significant (slope difference = −1.28; 95% CI: −2.55 to −0.02;P= 0.0473), confirming the non-linear relationship (Table4).

Subcategory examinations were undertaken in the completely adapted Model II to affirm the solidity of the outcomes. The subsequent potential confounding variables were taken into account: patient age, sex, CCI, BMI, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, LDL concentration, triglyceride level, albumin level, hemoglobin level calcium level, platelet count. All examinations were adjusted for the 14 factors listed earlier (excluding the subgroup factor). Table S1 validates the consistency of all layers.

This study identified a significant positive association between PTH and P1NP levels (β = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.42–1.24,P< 0.0001) in patients with OPFs. The association was non-linear with an inflection point at a PTH level of 16.63 pg/mL. Below this threshold, a strong positive correlation was observed (β = 1.52, 95% CI: 0.72–2.32,P< 0.0001), while no significant association was present above 16.63 pg/mL (β = 0.24, 95% CI: −0.48-0.95,P= 0.5165). This threshold effect suggests a concentration-dependent mechanism in PTH regulation of bone metabolism underlying osteoporotic patients.

The positive correlation between low PTH levels (< 16.63 pg/mL) and elevated P1NP values reflects an important regulatory mechanism in bone metabolism. At physiological concentrations, PTH promotes bone formation primarily through intermittent stimulation [20]. At low levels, PTH binds to PTH/PTHrP receptors, activating cAMP and protein kinase A signaling pathways in osteoblasts, thereby promoting osteoblast differentiation and increasing P1NP release. This mechanism explains why moderate PTH levels are more effective in stimulating bone formation [21].

However, the flattening effect observed when PTH levels exceed 16.63 pg/mL may be attributed to several factors: (1) PTH receptor saturation, where high PTH concentrations lead to the downregulation or desensitization of receptors; (2) The activation of osteoclast activity by sustained high PTH levels, resulting in increased bone resorption at the expense of bone formation; [22,23] (3) Potential inhibition of certain signaling pathways in osteoblasts by high levels of PTH through negative feedback mechanisms, limiting P1NP production [24–26]. This flattening effect suggests an optimal concentration range for PTH in regulating bone metabolism, beyond which no further increase in bone-forming activity occurs.

Previous cross-sectional studies have investigated the association between OP and PTH levels, with several finding a link between lower PTH concentrations and reduced bone mineral density [27,28]. Drugs such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone (teriparatide) have been used in the management of postmenopausal women and men suffering from severe OPFs or individuals with an elevated risk of subsequent fracture [29,30].

P1NP is a marker for bone generation that reflects the regeneration and mending of bone tissue [31]. As such, measurements of P1NP are frequently employed in clinical environments to assess a individual’s OP, the recovery of fractures, and skeletal growth, aiding in the formulation and modification of treatment strategies [32]. Significantly, the latest research underscores a direct relationship between PTH concentrations and P1NP levels among individuals with osteoporotic fractures following adjustments for significant variables like age and BMI.

Clinical studies have found that PTH has numerous positive effects on OPFs outcome. In addition to increasing patients’ bone density, Periodic PTH treatment boosts osteoblast count and function, resulting in enhanced bone density and better trabecular and cortical skeletal integrity [33,34]. Osteoblasts, endosteal cells, and bone marrow stromal cells contain PTH receptors, and cyclic PTH therapy stimulates these cells by adjusting cAMP concentrations and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A [35–37]. PTH receivers also activate the calpain C pathway, stimulating osteoblast cell proliferation. Preclinical evidence suggests a potential association between PTH and osteosarcoma [38,39]. Teriparatide, a derivative of human parathyroid hormone (1–34), is authorized for managing postmenopausal and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. As an exogenous PTH mimetic, teriparatide may affect the body’s own PTH level during treatment [40]. Since the body regulates the secretion of endogenous PTH through a negative feedback mechanism, the introduction of exogenous PTH mimics, such as teriparatide,, may lead to the inhibition of the body’s own PTH secretion. Therefore, PTH levels may be suppressed during treatment with teriparatide. However, the exact degree of suppression may vary between individuals. Once teriparatide is discontinued, PTH levels usually return to normal. Several mild and adverse effects of temporary nature have been documented with teriparatide. Nevertheless, while PTH increases bone formation, long-term usage of PTH also promotes bone resorption [41,42]. Consistent endogenous synthesis or external provision of PTH, such as in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, may lead to adverse outcomes on bone, particularly cortical bone [43].

Our findings align with previous study, who demonstrated that intermittent PTH treatment significantly increases bone mineral density and P1NP levels, but with dose-dependent effects [11]. Similarly, previous study observed that appropriate PTH doses can rebuild bone structure, while excessive doses may have adverse effects [33]. Unlike these studies, we are the first to identify a precise turning point (16.63 pg/mL) in the PTH-P1NP relationship in OPF patients, providing a quantitative reference for optimizing PTH-mediated bone metabolism.

The threshold effect identified in this study carries important clinical implications. First, it offers evidence-based guidance for monitoring PTH levels in patients with osteoporosis, suggesting that maintaining PTH concentrations below 16.63 pg/mL may optimize bone formation. Second, it may inform dosage adjustments of PTH analogs such as teriparatide, helping to avoid surpassing the optimal therapeutic range. However, the interpretation of P1NP as a biomarker of bone metabolism warrants caution in certain populations—particularly in pathological conditions such as chronic renal failure—where P1NP levels can be influenced by non-skeletal factors, complicating its use in individualized treatment. Thus, while the P1NP threshold may serve as a useful reference for assessing treatment response, its application should be integrated with other clinical indicators, especially in patients with comorbidities.

Identifying the optimal window range for PTH, particularly establishing the upper threshold of 16.63 pg/mL, may transform management strategies for osteoporosis in clinical practice. For patients with PTH levels approaching or exceeding this threshold, simply increasing PTH may not yield additional bone formation benefits, potentially necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies such as combination with antiresorptive medications or intensified calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

In summary, this research represents the inaugural epidemiological investigation conducted in China to examine the autonomous link amid PTH levels and P1NP levels among individuals with OPFs. This study possesses several strengths. Initially, numerous potential confounding factors (such as thyroid disease and OP patients below the age of 50) were eliminated prior to the assessments carried out within this investigation. Moreover, the current study adjusted for established confounding variables, including age, gender, BMI, CCI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, monocyte count, lymphocyte count, LDL levels, platelet count, triglyceride levels, albumin levels, calcium level, and haemoglobin levels. Various linear regression analyses were used. Additionally, this study utilized a generalized straight-line model to examine the straight-line association amid PTH concentrations and P1NP concentrations, while employing a GAM to evaluate any non-linear associations. By dealing with non-parametric smoothing and fitting regression spline to the dataset, GAM has a distinct benefit in addressing non-linear associations. Therefore, by utilizing GAM, we can enhance our ability to identify the genuine relationship between the exposure and outcome. Ultimately, this study furnishes valuable insights from an evidence-based perspective for developing useful treatment and diagnostic strategies.

This study has several limitations that should be considered in future research. First, the current investigation adopted a retrospective cross-sectional design. Therefore, the link identified between PTH concentrations and P1NP levels does not imply a causal connection, underscoring the need for well-structured intervention trials to substantiate the derived conclusions. Second, to study the natural physiological relationship between PTH and P1NP, we excluded patients using vitamin D, calcium supplements, and medications that could potentially influence bone turnover markers. While this helped observe the relationship between endogenous PTH and P1NP without pharmacological intervention, it limited our understanding of these relationships in therapeutic settings. Furthermore, as the primary aim of our study was to explore the specific relationship between PTH and P1NP, we did not analyze other bone turnover markers (such as CTX, P1CP, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase) and bone-related hormones (such as vitamin D and glucocorticoids). These markers could provide a more comprehensive picture of bone metabolism and should be considered in future studies. This study also did not investigate key factors like liver and kidney functionality, as well as nutritional status, which may influence bone metabolism and the PTH-P1NP relationship. Additionally, this research employed a monocentric setup with a relatively modest participant pool, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the results. Finally, the generalizability of this study to other biological and ethnic groups may be limited. Considering that bone metabolism may vary across different races and ethnicities, larger multicenter randomized controlled trials involving ethnically diverse populations should be conducted to enhance the reliability and generalizability of the conclusions put forth. Moreover, this study did not address the relationship between PTH and P1NP in specific populations, such as individuals with renal insufficiency. In patients with chronic kidney disease, bone metabolism is often dysregulated, and both PTH and P1NP levels may be significantly influenced by renal function. Impaired renal clearance can result in elevated PTH concentrations and altered P1NP metabolism, potentially modifying the association between these two markers. Therefore, the PTH–P1NP threshold effect observed in this study may not be directly applicable to patients with compromised renal function. Future research should focus on delineating the interplay between bone turnover markers in such populations to better understand the pathophysiological dynamics of PTH and P1NP under varying systemic conditions.

The findings indicated a positive correlation between serum P1NP concentrations and PTH levels in OPFs patients with an inflection point of 16.63 (pg/mL). When the range of PTH concentrations was below 16.63 (pg/mL), a positive correlation was observed between P1NP concentrations and PTH concentrations. However, when PTH levels exceeded 16.63 (pg/mL), this relationship did not exist. Therefore, in managing patients with OPFs, we encourage future studies to explore the mechanisms underlying the threshold effect and to determine the clinical significance of maintaining PTH levels within a specific range to optimize bone health outcomes.
