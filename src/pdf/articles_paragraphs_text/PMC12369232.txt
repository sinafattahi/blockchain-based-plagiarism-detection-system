Despite the major breakthroughs in immunotherapy, a substantial number of cancer patients continue to confront problems such as low response rates, which restrict the overall effectiveness of existing treatments. There is an urgent necessity to combine advanced biomedical advancements with conventional therapies to improve treatment results. The activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has become a viable technique to elicit innate immune responses against tumors, attracting significant interest as a novel target in cancer therapy. However, STING agonists face significant challenges in clinical application due to complications related to transport efficiency, degradation, and bioavailability. Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have facilitated the invention of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as adaptable platforms for cancer immunotherapy, utilizing their distinctive characteristics, including large surface area, adjustable porosity, and improved permeability. This review systematically investigates current advancements in the usage of MOFs for altering the cGAS-STING pathway, highlighting their promise as adaptable platforms for agonist administration or direct activation in tumor immunotherapy. Additionally, this review focuses on the use of MOFs as carriers or agonists, integrated with multimodal strategies to potentiate anticancer immune responses via the cGAS-STING pathway. The discussion concludes with an examination of the challenges and future directions for MOFs in boosting immunotherapy through the stimulation of the cGAS-STING pathway.

Cancer immunotherapy is currently regarded as a groundbreaking advancement in cancer treatment by awakening and strengthening the immune system to sustainably control previously incurable and extremely aggressive malignancies [1–3]. To date, various cancer immunotherapy approaches have been investigated [4], primarily including immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) and the adoptive transfer of engineered immune cells (ACT) [5]. Moreover, other strategies, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [6,7], small molecule drugs [8,9], cytokine therapy [10–14], oncolytic viruses [15–17], and cancer vaccines [18–21], have also shown promise. Currently, cancer immunotherapy, especially FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that strengthen adaptive antitumor immunity, has provided substantial advantages for numerous clinical patients [22]. However, the treatment is still limited by the risk of autoimmune side effects [23–25] and the prevalence of resistance in a considerable number of cancers [26–28]. These limitations are mainly attributed to tumor heterogeneity [29], immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TIME) [30,31], insufficient production and performance of tumor-specific CD8 + T lymphocytes, limited availability of appropriate neoantigens, compromised processing and presentation of neoantigens, and epigenetic alterations. Collectively, these considerations have led to many obstacles in the clinical translation of immunotherapy. Notably, the efficacy of adaptive antitumor immunity relies heavily on a robust innate immune response [32]. Recent advancements in biomedical research and technological innovation, which have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential, are providing novel avenues for the development of effective cancer therapies. Among these, mounting evidence indicates that targeting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway has broad prospects in antitumor immunity [33–37].

As an innate immune sensor of cytoplasmic DNA [38–41], cGAS can sense the leakage of DNA from cancer cells [42,43], activate the STING pathway via a cascade reaction, promote the expression of type I interferons (IFN-I) [44,45], and initiate innate anticancer immunity [46]. IFN-I notably functions as a conduit between innate and adaptive immunity [47]. Their activities include facilitating dendritic cell maturation and migration, as well as augmenting cytotoxicity delivered by cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer cells, protecting effector cells from apoptosis, and inhibiting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thereby imposing a suppressive influence on tumor angiogenesis [48]. Consequently, activation of the cGAS-STING pathway can transform immunologically inert “cold” tumors into active “hot” tumors through IFN-I secretion and lymphocyte infiltration [49–52]. This change boosts the antitumor immune response within the TME and improves the effectiveness of existing immunotherapy. Given these processes, targeting the cGAS-STING pathway is a viable route for cancer immunotherapy [53]. Specifically, due to the potent immunostimulatory capacity of the STING signaling pathway, agonists targeting this pathway are identified as promising therapeutic agents, either as standalone treatments or in combination with other therapeutic strategies.

Numerous STING agonists, encompassing cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and non-CDNs, have been created and extensively assessed in preclinical and clinical investigations [54,55]. Despite their promising therapeutic potential, these agonists are confronted with significant challenges, including instability and low internalization efficiency [56,57]. To address these constraints, considerable efforts have been dedicated to the advancement of nanotherapeutic techniques aimed at activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway [52,58]. Notably, nanomaterial-mediated activation of this pathway has been demonstrated to robustly enhance tumor-specific immune responses and elicit potent antitumor activity [59,60]. Among these nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention due to their distinctive structural features, including high surface areas, customizable pores, and efficient drug-loading capacity, in addition to their excellent biocompatibility [61–63]. However, the potential of MOFs in cGAS-STING pathway modulation remains underexplored, particularly concerning their dual role as agonist carriers or direct agonists [64,65]. To address this gap, this review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in MOFs-based strategies for enhancing immune stimulation and improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. Specifically, we highlight the application of MOFs as either delivery vehicles or direct agonists, synergistically integrated with multimodal therapies (e.g., radiotherapy (RT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and sonodynamic therapy (SDT)), to amplify antitumor immune responses via modulation of the cGAS-STING pathway (Fig.1). Finally, the challenges and prospects of MOFs-based approaches in tumor immunotherapy are discussed.

In cancer immunotherapy, increasing data suggest that IFN-I secreted after stimulation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway significantly inhibits tumor development [66–69]. To understand the underlying mechanisms, this section offers an overview of the structural and functional features of cGAS and STING proteins. It delineates the activation of this important signaling pathway, which leads in the generation of IFN-I and the beginning of antitumor immune responses (Fig.2).

cGAS, the principal cytosolic DNA sensor, identifies cytoplasmic DNA in a sequence-independent yet length-dependent fashion (> 40 base pairs) across various cell types [70–72]. Structurally, human cGAS (hcGAS) comprises 522 amino acids, with a non-conserved N-terminal domain and a conserved C-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain named Mab21 [73]. The N-terminal domain is crucial for sustaining high enzymatic activity and essential for DNA binding, as it contains specific conserved polar amino acid residues, such as serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr). In contrast, the Mab21 domain exhibits a bilobed architecture with two positively charged surfaces that engage with the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA [46,74]. Upon dsDNA binding, cGAS forms a 2:2 DNA/cGAS complex, wherein dimerization induces catalytic pocket rearrangement and allosteric activation [70,75]. This structural transformation enables cGAS to catalyze the substrates guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into 2’,3’-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which was a natural ligand of STING protein [76]. Key catalytic residues (E225, D227, D319) coordinate Mg2+ions to facilitate cGAMP synthesis, while a zinc finger motif (H390, C396, C397, C404) stabilizes B-type dsDNA recognition [77]. Notably, hcGAS exhibits heightened DNA length sensitivity compared to murine homologs, primarily mediated by Lys187 and Leu195 in the protein spine [78,79].

STING, a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), is a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions as a sensor for cyclic dinucleotides [80]. Structurally, human STING (hSTING) comprises 379 amino acids, with an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a globular C-terminal domain (CTD) [81]. The N-terminal domain contains four transmembrane regions (TM1-4) that anchor STING to the ER membrane. Notably, STING exists as a constitutive dimer, adopting a domain-swapped architecture where TM1 from one subunit pairs with TM2-4 from the other, forming two layers: a central layer (TM2 and TM4) surrounded by peripheral helices (TM1 and TM3) [82]. Among these helices, TM2, the longest and most tilted relative to the membrane plane, plays a critical role in stabilizing the dimeric structure [81]. CTD is exposed in the cytoplasm and contains the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the C-terminal tail (CTT). LBD includes four α helices (LBDα1 ~ α4) and 5 β pleated sheets (LBDβ1 ~ β5), while the linker between TM4 and LBDα1 forms a right-handed crossover, positioning the TM and LBD of each subunit on opposite sides of the dimer [83]. This inter-domain interaction, mediated by a surface groove formed by TM2-TM3, the connecting helix, and LBD, is a conserved structural feature essential for protein stability and function [81]. Finally, the CTT contains a TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-binding motif (TBM) and an interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-binding motif, which are critical for downstream signaling [46].

The interaction of cGAMP with STING triggers a conformational change that activates downstream signaling cascades involving TBK1 and IRF3, ultimately leading to IFN-I production [84]. The precise procedure is outlined as follows: Initially, the binding of cGAMP to LBD induces the cytoplasmic part of STING, including the linker, LBD and CTT, to rotate 180° relative to the TM so that the right-handed cross of the linker is untied, and the LBD of the same STING subunit returns to the same side of the TM to form a shoulder-to-shoulder STING dimer [82]. Secondly, cGAMP binding causes LBDα2 and LBDα3 to tilt downward, separating the LBDα2-α3 loops between dimers and eliminating steric clashes [81]. In addition, these conformational changes also trigger CTT release, exposing the STING polymerization interface and enabling parallel dimer assembly into polymers stabilized by disulfide bonds (e.g., Cys148) [82]. Within these polymers, STING dimers recruit TBK1 through high-affinity interactions at the dimer interface, promoting TBK1 trans-autophosphorylation. Notably, only a subset of CTTs within the STING polymer recruit TBK1, while Ser366 on adjacent CTTs is phosphorylated by TBK1, forming the 363LXIS366 motif essential for IRF3 binding [74]. Subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 facilitates its dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation of IFN-I genes, particularly IFN-β [85]. In parallel to the IRF3 pathway, STING activates NF-κB signaling through IκB kinase interaction, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, particularly IFN-α and IFN-β [86].

IFN-I is crucial for innate immunity and tumor immunosurveillance [87]. Mechanistically, IFN-I enhances tumor-associated antigen presentation by DCs, facilitating the stimulation and proliferation of tumor-specific T cells and bridging innate and adaptive immunity against malignancies [88]. The antitumor effects of IFN-I are mediated through multiple pathways. First, IFN-I directly inhibits tumor cell proliferation and metastasis by activating intracellular signaling cascades. For example, FAM210B suppresses lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell proliferation and migration by upregulating IFN-α/β expression and activating the STAT1/IRF9/IFIT3 pathway [89]. Second, IFN-I play a pivotal role in ICI therapy. As demonstrated by Zhu et al., endogenous IFN-I signaling in tumor cells is crucial for inhibiting CD47-SIRPα, as it reprograms tumor metabolism and enhances immune cell infiltration and activity [90]. Third, IFN-I modulate tumor cell behaviour by promoting ATP release, which enhances immune cell activation and antitumor responses [90]. Additionally, IFN-γ amplifies the IFN-I response network by upregulating IRF7, promoting Th17-to-Th1 cell conversion and improving antitumor function [91]. In summary, IFN-I exerts potent antitumor effects through diverse mechanisms, and harnessing IFN-I production via the cGAS-STING pathway constitutes a viable approach to augment the efficacy of immunotherapy.

With the deepening understanding of STING and its signaling mechanisms, the cGAS-STING pathway has become a crucial target in cancer immunotherapy, driving extensive studies to discover and develop STING agonists. Based on their chemical structures and mechanisms of action, STING agonists can be categorized into five classes: CDNs and their derivatives, small molecule agonists, metal ion agonists, endogenous DNA agonists, and MOFs-based agonists. In this section, we systematically summarize and discuss these five categories of agonists, as shown in Fig.3.

CDNs, recognized as the most extensively researched STING agonists, are natural ligands synthesized by cGAS in reaction to cytosolic DNA [92]. These molecules, defined by a cyclic structure of two nucleotide units, are essential in the initiation of innate immune responses [93]. The primary endogenous CDN, 2’3’-cGAMP, is synthesized by cGAS in reaction to the presence of double-stranded DNA from damaged or infected cells [94]. CDNs contain cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), bacterial 3′,3′-cGAMP, and mammalian 2′,3′-cGAMP [95]. Endogenous CDNs encounter notable limitations stemming from their hydrophilic and negatively charged characteristics, which impede cellular internalization [96,97]. Additionally, their vulnerability to degradation by exonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP1) leads to a diminished serum half-life and decreased efficacy [98]. Chemical modifications have been employed on CDNs to address these challenges, focusing on the phosphodiester linkage, 2′/3′-OH groups, ribose, and nucleotides [99]. The modifications have enhanced pharmacokinetic profiles, leading to the advancement of several analogs into clinical trials. ADU-S100, a synthetic phosphorothioate CDN, shows markedly greater activity compared to 2′,3′-cGAMP and exhibits strong antitumor and antimetastatic properties [98]. Furthermore, SB11285 has demonstrated efficacy through intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intratumoral administration. Cyclic adenosine-inosine monophosphate (cAIMP) represents an innovation that includes ribose substitution, internucleotide modification, and phosphate alteration [100]. Fluorine-substituted analogs exhibit enhanced stability and activity [101]. Despite these advancements, CDN-based agonists are predominantly delivered through intratumoral injection in clinical trials, which restricts their applicability to a wider variety of tumors.

Small molecule STING agonists represent a promising class of synthetic compounds designed to activate the STING pathway with superior pharmacological properties compared to natural CDNs. These low molecular weight compounds directly bind to STING, inducing conformational changes that trigger downstream signaling cascades. Early examples, such as flavone acetic acid (FAA) [102], 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) [103], and 10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) [104], demonstrated antitumor activity by activating the NF-κB pathway and inducing IFN-I production. However, these agonists selectively bound murine STING (mSTING) but not hSTING, leading to clinical trial failures. A significant breakthrough came with the discovery of ABZI analogs, the first non-nucleotide STING agonists capable of activating both mSTING and hSTING [105]. Among these, dimeric aminobenzimidazole (diABZI) exhibited 18-fold greater potency than cGAMP, robust antitumor activity, and complete tumor regression in murine colon cancer models [106]. Further advancements include orally available MSA-2 [55,107], which selectively targets tumor tissues and enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy, and SR-717 [108], an intraperitoneal agonist with broad species and allele specificity that activates CD8+T cells, NK cells, and DCs while upregulating PD-L1 expression. Additionally, novel agonists such as DSDP, BNBC, G10, and the photoactivatable caged-diBSP01 have shown potential in preclinical studies [109,110]. Despite these advances, the therapeutic efficacy of small molecule STING agonists remains limited by insufficient targeting and intracellular stability, resulting in suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles.

Transition metal ions, particularly manganese (Mn2+), have emerged as a novel class of STING agonists with significant immunomodulatory potential [111]. These ions enhance antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), promote the maturation of CD4+and CD8+T cells, and amplify adaptive immune responses. Mechanistically, Mn2+directly activates cGAS even without exogenous double-stranded DNA, resulting in the synthesis of 2′,3′-cGAMP and subsequent generation of IFN-I. Additionally, Mn2+catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to hydroxyl radicals (•OH), a highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further potentiates cGAS-STING signaling [112]. These dual mechanisms enable Mn2+to induce innate immune responses independently of infection. Furthermore, Mn2+facilitates the development of APCs, such as DCs, bridging innate and adaptive immunity. This immunostimulatory capability positions Mn2+as a promising therapeutic agent for infections and tumors.

Endogenous DNA agonists are natural activators of the cGAS-STING pathway, relying on intracellular DNA to initiate immune responses [113]. These agonists include DNA fragments from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that leak into the cytosol during cellular stress. In cancer therapy, interventions like radiation and chemotherapy induce DNA damage and cell death [114], releasing tumor-derived DNA that potently stimulates the cGAS-STING pathway, triggering IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Similarly, mtDNA, structurally akin to bacterial DNA, activates cGAS upon cytosolic release [115]. These mechanisms link tumor cell death to antitumor immunity, highlighting their critical role in cancer immunotherapy. Despite their potential, endogenous DNA agonists face challenges. Their advantages include natural pathway activation without exogenous agents and tumor-specificity when generated during tumor cell death, minimizing off-target effects. However, their reliance on therapeutic interventions limits standalone utility, and excessive cGAS-STING activation can lead to chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders. To optimize their therapeutic application, strategies like combining radiation therapy with STING agonists or immune checkpoint inhibitors are being explored to enhance antitumor immunity while mitigating adverse effects. Overall, endogenous DNA agonists represent a potent and natural means of activating the cGAS-STING pathway, with ongoing research focused on refining their use in cancer immunotherapy.

Nanoparticles serve as a versatile platform for STING-targeted cancer immunotherapy, functioning either by delivering STING agonists or by mimicking cytosolic DNA to act as agonists independently [65,116]. It has been reported that metal-based nanoparticles are one type of nanoparticles often used to activate the cGAS-STING pathway [117,118]. Among these, manganese-, calcium-, zinc-, platinum-, iron-, lanthanide-based nanoparticles have achieved remarkable advancements in STING pathway activation. However, most of these metal-based nanoparticles are inorganic materials with generally poor biocompatibility and degradability. After entering the systemic circulation, they are prone to cause a series of adverse reactions without trigger the expected immune response [119,120]. These drawbacks necessitate the development of alternative metal-based systems with improved biocompatibility. To overcome these limitations, researchers have designed a series of metal-based nanoparticles based on stable organic ligands to enhance therapeutic efficacy while mitigating toxicity [37,121]. MOFs, formed by coordination between metal ions/clusters and multidentate organic ligands, are particularly representative. Compared to metal-based nanomaterials, MOFs offer advantages including simplicity of fabrication, adjustable surface functionality, controllable release activated by tumor-specific stimuli, including acidic pH or enzymatic activity, and superior biocompatibility [122,123]. MOFs are not only able to be designed to precisely deliver CDNs like 2’3’-cGAMP or small molecule agonists to tumor locations due to the tunable porosity but also to be utilize metal components to act directly on the cGAS-STING pathway. MOFs loaded with both ions and agonists can also be designed to achieve cascade activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, improving activation efficiency [124]. Unlike conventional metal-based nanoparticles, MOFs mitigate issues such as low bioavailability and systemic toxicity due to their organic ligand-mediated degradability and controlled release properties. Challenges persist, including, the potential immunogenicity of specific organic ligands, and the necessity for a thorough assessment of long-term toxicity and biodegradability. Despite these limitations, MOFs show significant potential for enhancing STING-targeted cancer immunotherapy. Current research aims to enhance the design, specificity, and safety of MOFs for clinical applications, establishing them as a prominent platform for future advancements in this area.

MOFs are efficient carriers for delivering STING agonists to tumor sites, ensuring sustained immune activation. They can be modified through synthetic modification [129,133,134] or pore-filling strategies [144], mitigating drug degradation risk. When considering the type of STING agonist to be loaded, the agonists of CDNs and its derivatives are characterized by their relatively large size and susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. Although artificially modified, their application is mainly achieved by intratumoral administration. Therefore, the current design concept is that when MOF is used as a carrier for STING agonists, the main type of STING agonists delivered is small molecule agonists. Small molecule agonists are small in size and are mainly loaded into the pores of MOFs by pore-filling and artificial modification. For example, Liu et al.‘s team constructed a multifunctional immunological nanomedicine (MOF-CpG-DMXAA) by introducing cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligonucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5,6-dimethylxanthone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) into MOF-801 (Fig.4a) [127]. This nanomedicine enhances the antitumor immune effect in HCC by activating the STING pathway (Fig.4b), reprogramming TAMs, maturing DCs, and destroying tumor blood vessels. However, the ultra-small 4.8 Å pore size of MOF-801 limits its ability to deliver larger biomolecules. To address this limitation, researchers have developed mesoporous MOFs with optimized particle sizes and appropriate stability [160–162]. For example, Professor Ding’s team synthesized HM801 with mesoporous structure using a soft template method, enabling the delivery of the STING agonist MSA-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant RBD antigen. This approach enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses, improving vaccine efficacy (Fig.4c) [128]. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the use of MOFs as STING agonist carriers. The preparation of agonist-loaded MOFs often involves complex synthesis steps, including post-synthetic modification and loading processes. Additionally, maintaining the stability and activity of agonists during loading requires optimized conditions. Furthermore, drug release efficiency can be constrained by the pore structure of MOFs and the physiological environment. Certain MOFs may also exhibit gradual degradation under physiological conditions, raising concerns about long-term biological toxicity. Hence, designing MOFs structures that can function as agonists represents a potentially effective approach to overcoming the aforementioned limitations.

MOFs can not only load agonists benefitting due to their flexibility in structure and porosity but also directly operate as agonists. A key feature of these MOFs-based agonists is their predominant composition, Zn2+[148,163,164] and Mn2+[125,131,135,138,142]. Additionally, a subset of cobalt (Co)-based MOFs have also been shown to exhibit STING agonist activity [139]. Notably, MOFs incorporating copper (Cu) or iron (Fe) ions can stimulate mtDNA production for STING activation. Moreover, MOFs can be engineered with photosensitive ligands [165–169] or high-Z elements (such as hafnium) to enhance the ROS [170–173]. The persistent oxidatively generated damage to mtDNA induced by ROS results in mtDNA release, subsequently triggering the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway [174–177]. In this section, we summarize and discuss studies utilizing MOFs as direct or indirect agonists to activate the cGAS-STING pathway, highlighting their diverse mechanisms and therapeutic applications. For example, Prof. Jinzhi Du’s team developed an eco-friendly method to synthesize immunostimulatory Mn2+-MOFs (ISAMn-MOFs) for cancer metalloimmunotherapy (Fig.5a) [125]. The unique structure of these MOFs facilitates the rapid release of Mn2+ions, effectively increasing intracellular Mn2+concentrations. This enhancement activates the STING pathway, thereby improving antitumor immune responses. Mn-based MOFs face challenges in structural stability due to Mn valence changes and require extensive safety evaluations, particularly for long-term use. In contrast, Zn-based MOFs exhibit superior chemical and thermal stability. As an essential trace element with lower toxicity, Zn-based MOFs demonstrate excellent safety for biomedical applications, as supported by statistical data in Table1. Furthermore, comparative studies have shown that Zn2+exhibits unique dual functionality among various metal ions, simultaneously promoting cGAS protein phase separation and enhancing its enzymatic catalytic activity [178]. Furthermore, Zn2+induces intracellular ROS accumulation, causing mitochondrial damage and subsequent mtDNA release [164,179]. While individual metal ions have been demonstrated to activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, their therapeutic potential in immunotherapy remains constrained when administered as monotherapy [151]. To address these issues, Zheng et al. constructed multifunctional ZIF-8@MnO2nanoparticles to facilitate the degradation of MUTP53 and enhance the cGAS stimulation pathway through dual metal ions (Fig.5b) [63]. The ZIF-8@MnO2nanocomposite demonstrates dual functionality in cancer therapy, releasing Zn2+and Mn2+to induce oxidative stress and mtDNA leakage. Zn2+promotes proteasomal degradation of p53 mutants, alleviating their inhibition on cGAS-STING, while Mn2+enhances cGAS sensitivity to dsDNA. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirm its efficacy in activating the cGAS-STING pathway and combing with PD-L1 blockade, significantly inhibiting breast cancer progression and metastasis. Despite their promising therapeutic potential, MOFs face several critical limitations that hinder their clinical translation, including suboptimal biocompatibility, potential immunogenicity, rapid systemic clearance, inefficient cellular internalization, uncontrolled drug release kinetics, and inadequate target specificity. This can be improved by surface modification [152,156]. Liu and colleagues engineered a biomimetic nanoplatform through sequential fabrication processes: initially developing RBCM-ZM@TD by encapsulating DNAzymes within Mn-ZIF-90 nanoparticles and coating them with red blood cell membranes (RBCM) to prolong systemic circulation (Fig.5c). Subsequently, they constructed Vir-ZM@TD by functionalizing the surface with RGD and HA2 peptides, creating a herpes virus-mimetic nanostructure. This innovative design mimics the mtDNA stress typically induced by herpes virus infection, triggering the cGAS-STING pathway-mediated innate immune response and demonstrating potent antitumor efficacy [130].

The activation of cGAS-STING is acknowledged as an auspicious immunotherapeutic approach to elicit innate antitumor immune responses. Nevertheless, it is insufficient in activating the cGAS-STING pathway due to numerous immunosuppressive cells entering the TME, which undermines antitumor immunity. The multifunctional architecture of MOFs facilitates the concurrent integration of STING agonists, hence providing targeted and individualized cancer immunotherapy.

Increasing evidence shows that certain chemotherapeutics, such as paclitaxel (PTX), oxaliplatin (OX), and doxorubicin (DOX), can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) to lead to a pro-inflammatory and immunogenic TME. Consequently, it is essential to formulate creative methods to enhance the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). and enhance the efficacy of ICB. And MOFs can utilize their metal ions to directly activate the cGAS-STING pathway while generating ·OH to enhance the effect of DNA damage. Notably, the ·OH produced by MOFs not only directly caused cell death, but also effectively and synergistically amplified the effect of chemotherapy-induced ICD. Multiple approaches synergistically amplified the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and thus enhanced the effects of immunization. For example, Wang et al. developed a manganese (Mn²⁺)-based MOF nanosystem (PEG-MnMOF@PTX) (Fig.6a) [132]. The nanosystem can release Mn2+under acidic conditions to directly resolve the cGAS-STING pathway while generating ·OH and promoting H2O2to generate O2in situ. The released PTX normalizes tumor blood vessels and improves microenvironmental immunosuppression. In addition, ·OH combined with the released PTX induce ICD of tumor cells. The combination of multiple pathways has increased the efficacy of immunotherapy. Cells treated with PEG-MnMOF@PTX showed significant cytotoxicity, inducing apoptosis up to 43.1% (Fig.6b). In the in vitro CT26 tumor model, PEG-MnMOF@PTX significantly inhibited tumor growth, with a tumor inhibition rate (TGI) of up to 68.2% (Fig.6c). When PEG-MnMOF@PTX was combined with the PD-L1 immune checkpoint blocker, the antitumor effect was significantly enhanced, and the 40-day survival rate increased from 40 to 80% (Fig.6d). In the systematic safety evaluation, PEG-MnMOF@PTX showed good biosafety in vivo. The research demonstrates the PEG-MnMOF@PTX nanosystem not only exhibits significant effects in antitumor and immune activation, but its good in vivo safety also provides important support for its future clinical application.

RT is a crucial cancer treatment in the clinic, which directly damages the DNA of tumor cells with high-energy rays to induce apoptosis or necrosis. DNA fragments can bind to cGAS and activate STING. In addition, RT induction can also cause in situ ICD, which can be demonstrated by the surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT) and high-mobility group 1 (HMGB-1). This process can also release tumor antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), TAAs, which can further stimulate immune cells. However, RT faces clinical limitations such as side effects, radioresistance, and inability to target metastatic lesions. Over the past thirty years, considerable efforts have been dedicated to identifying non-chemotherapy radiosensitizers to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy while minimizing severe side effects. Although preclinical studies demonstrate their potential to improve radiotherapy-induced cell death, non-chemotherapy radiosensitizers have yet to receive approval for clinical application from the US Food and Drug Administration [180]. The absence of clinical success has been ascribed to the fact that existing radiosensitizers enhance DNA double-strand breaks but are insufficient to overcome the immunosuppressive TME. Considering the constraints of current radiosensitizers, developing new sensitizers or combining them with other therapies may be an effective strategy to address current limitations. MOFs have been shown to not only act as highly effective radiosensitizers to significantly amplify RT-induced DNA damage, but can also load STING agonists through their porous structures or coordination effects, thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses [134]. For example, Lin et al. designed a hafnium (Hf)-based MOF nanomaterial loaded with MSA-2, called MOF/MSA-2 (Fig.7a) [133]. MOF/MSA-2 enhances the DNA damage effect of radiotherapy through its high Z characteristic Hf and achieves facilitates prolonged the STING pathway by loading MSA-2. MOF/MSA-2, in conjunction with low-dose radiation, markedly suppressed tumor proliferation and stimulated the tumor immune microenvironment. Additionally, incorporating anti-PD-L1 antibodies can efficiently manage distant metastatic lesions and elicit a systemic anticancer immune response (Fig.7b-c). Radiotherapy (RT) frequently encounters failures due to tumor tissue hypoxia, inflammation, adverse effects, and radioresistance. Heterojunction-based radiosensitizers garner significant attention for their lower excitation energy and exceptional catalytic activity compared to conventional transition metal radiosensitizers. MOFs-based heterojunctions are also utilized in biomedicine for cancer treatment, drug transport and release, and imaging, benefiting from their high surface area, uniform and adjustable pore structure, controllable chemical properties, and the variety of metal/ligand subunits. Notably, Hf and thorium (Th) secondary building units have been demonstrated to absorb X-rays to excite ruthenium (Ru) or iridium (Ir)-based photosensitizers in nanoscale MOFs, thereby enhancing free radical generation and facilitating improved RT-RDT. Lu et al. first constructed a bimetallic Mn-MOF by introducing Mn²⁺ into the ruthenium complex and finally introduced gold nanorods (AuNRs) into the system to construct a heterostructured radiosensitizer Au@Mn-MOF (Fig.7d) [135]. Au@Mn-MOF can react to the tumor’s acidic milieu and release the ruthenium complex and Mn²⁺ in a controlled manner. Furthermore, to eradicate immunosuppression in NK cell therapy and augment the efficacy of immunotherapy, the incorporation of AuNRs can absorb high-energy X-rays and transfer energy to Mn-MOF, thereby enhancing radiodynamic therapy and activating NK cell-mediated immunotherapy via the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in an increased apoptosis rate of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to 67.11% (Fig.7e). In the nude mouse breast cancer model, the tumor growth inhibition rate (TGI) of the combined treatment group reached 86.31%, and the survival rate within 42 days reached 83.3% (Fig.7f). Au@Mn-MOF not only showed good antitumor effects in in vitro and in vivo models but also had good biocompatibility and in vivo distribution characteristics. This study provides new ideas for designing new biofunctionalized MOFs materials and developing combined tumor treatment strategies. Indeed, RT can induce immune activation while simultaneously leading to various immunosuppressive issues, rendering it a double-edged sword in tumor immunomodulation [181]. Chen et al. found that RT significantly triggered autophagy in HCC cells, which in turn restricted the activation of ICD and CGAS stimulation, making the combined treatment effect limited [136].

PDT refers to a non-invasive treatment method in which photosensitizers (PS) produce ROS under specific wavelength light conditions, which kill tumor cells. It is usually used as a supplementary means of tumor treatment. In recent years, PDT has shown remarkable results in regulating the immune system, primarily innate and adaptive immunity. On the one hand, PDT-induced local tumor tissue damage can trigger an acute inflammatory response, a direct pathway to clearing damaged tissue and restoring homeostasis. On the other hand, PDT can effectively stimulate the innate immune response and activate the adaptive immunological response through the ICD mechanism and cGAS-STING activation mechanism, thereby forming long-term immune memory. This process depends on a series of DAMPs released after PDT-induced tumor cell damage, which acts as “danger signals” to promote the recruitment and activation of APCs. STING activation, when combined with other treatment techniques, has been shown to reverse the TIME, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy synergistically. Integrating PDT and STING may be advantageous for augmenting immunotherapeutic efficacy [61,168]. It is noteworthy that MOFs enable a more effective synergistic enhancement of tumor immunotherapy by concurrently combining PDT and STING activation. Specifically, MOFs potentiate the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway either intrinsically or through the delivery of agonists, while simultaneously promoting PDT-induced DNA damage by targeting ROS generation. As most photosensitizers are highly conjugated molecules that tend to aggregate in aqueous media, PS-based MOFs have been extensively used to overcome solubility limitations [182].

Ge et al. developed an oxidation-responsive PolyMOF nanoparticle named SR@PMOF (Fig.8a) [144]. SR@PMOF can co-deliver a STING agonist, SR-717, and a photosensitizer, TCPP. After intravenous injection, SR@PMOF nanoparticles accumulate at the tumor site. Upon light irradiation at the tumor location, the photosensitizer TCPP generates singlet oxygen (1O2), which induces tumor cell apoptosis. This process releases fragmented DNA and tumor-associated antigens, activating the immune system. Simultaneously, the structure of SR@PMOF nanoparticles contains thiol bonds that can be disrupted by1O2, leading to the rapid release of SR-717. The released SR-717 activates the STING pathway, augmenting the immunological response and reversing the TIME. This synergistic effect promotes antitumor immune responses. Experimental findings indicate that SR@PMOF nanoparticles significantly impede the proliferation of both primary and metastatic cancers (Fig.8b-c), demonstrating the promising potential for clinical applications. Meanwhile, SR@PMOF showed a favorable safety profile both in vivo and in vitro.

Notwithstanding promising advancements, photodynamic immunotherapy continues to exhibit a low response rate. Subsequent research indicated inadequate clinical efficacy was primarily due to low immunogenicity and TIME. Research demonstrates that PS generates ROS within the cell nucleus, and the resultant damaged DNA fragments discharged into the cytoplasm can more effectively activate innate immunity via the cGAS-STING pathway [183]. Therefore, Shi et al. advocated for using effective nuclear DNA damage and release to enhance photodynamic immunotherapy by stimulating an innate immune response [138]. Studies have shown that glutathione (GSH), a metabolite of glutamine, confers antioxidant properties to cancer cells, thereby limiting the effectiveness of PDT [184]. Therefore, interrupting glucose and glutamine metabolism simultaneously to hinder the energy intake of cancer cells is beneficial for reversing the immunosuppressive TME and damaging tumor cells. To this end, Li et al. proposed the “internal failure and external aggression” strategy. Specifically, they constructed a functional immunomodulator denoted as ReSZ(FB). ReSZ(FB) induced mitochondrial damage through PDT to release mtDNA, which coordinated with Zn2+from Zn-MOF to activate the cGAS-STING pathway while fastening and reprogramming TME, enhancing the immune response and achieved internal and external synergistic antitumor effects [153].

However, uncontrolled leakage or excessive exposure of agonists may result in inadvertent activation of non-target cells. To address this problem, Ren et al. developed a MOF-based nanocontroller, designated DZ@A7, which employs tumor microenvironment/near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered decomposition for localized tumor-specific STING activation and photodynamic metalloimmunotherapy (Fig.8d) [163]. Precisely, the DZ@A7 nano agonist comprises a polydopamine-modified zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) concurrently with the photosensitizer IR780 and the hypoxia drug aquinone dihydrochloride (AQ4N). Mitochondrial-targeted ROS generation via near-infrared irradiation can cause oxidative harm to cancer cells, exacerbated by polydopamine-induced reduction of intracellular GSH. Furthermore, this phenomenon markedly facilitates the release of mtDNA, which is known to activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Subsequently, hypoxia-responsive drugs can increase the accumulation of damaged cytoplasmic DNA by inhibiting the repair of ncDNA, thereby further strengthening the STING pathway. In addition, the overloading of nutrient metal ions (e.g., Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+) in cancer cells might further raise cGAS enzyme activity and synergistically amplify STING activation. This tumor-specific STING activation and photodynamic-metal immunotherapy significantly enhanced the immune response and antitumor effect. This tumor-specific STING activation and photodynamic-metal immunotherapy significantly enhanced the immune response, with a tumor inhibition rate of 79.77%. It also does not affect the safety and biocompatibility of DZ@A7.

Despite its numerous advantages, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is constrained by the restricted penetration depth of short-wavelength visible light in tissues, rendering it appropriate solely for surface cancers. These limitations have affected its clinical application and therapeutic effect to a certain extent. To tackle this difficulty, photosensitizers activated by light in the near-infrared spectrum (> 700 nm), particularly within the second near-infrared region (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm), have been created [185,186]. In comparison to light in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 700–900 nm), the longer-wavelength NIR-II light reduces the degree of tissue scattering, promises deeper tissue penetration, reduces phototoxicity, and permits a greater maximum allowable power [187,188]. However, the hypoxic characteristics within tumor cells significantly reduce the efficiency of photosensitizers in generating reactive oxygen species, thereby weakening the cytotoxicity of PDT [189–191].

Recent research indicate that PDT and PTT can complement each other to achieve excellent antitumor effects [192]. On the one hand, the hyperthermia effect of PTT can improve intracellular delivery of PS and increase oxygen perfusion, thereby promoting PDT efficacy [193]. On the other hand, PDT-generated ROS can attack the heat shock proteins (HSPs), thus negating the self-protection effect of tumor cells and improving PTT efficacy [194]. However, due to the commonly mismatched absorption spectra of agents, current combined photodynamic and photothermal therapy strategies primarily rely on different lasers or multiple functional components. This reliance can compromise therapeutic efficacy, cause energy inefficiency, prolong treatment time, and increase operational complexity [195,196]. Consequently, it is significant to create single-component materials capable of being irradiated by a singular NIR-II laser to concurrently facilitate PDT and PTT, thereby improving both therapeutic effectiveness and clinical applicability.

PDT is an oxygen-reliant process, and the hypoxic environment of the TME often limits its therapeutic effectiveness. This hypoxia is primarily caused by malformed and dysfunctional tumor vasculature. Tumor vasculature is characterized by its tortuous, disorganized, and leaky nature with decreased pericyte coverage. These vascular abnormalities exacerbate TME hypoxia, posing a significant obstacle to PDT. Thus, vasculature normalization has emerged as a prospective strategy to mitigate hypoxia and enhance PDT efficiency. Beyond its established roles in coordinating the innate immune response and facilitating adaptive immunity activation, recent studies highlight the potential of the STING pathway activation to promote vascular normalization, alleviate hypoxia, and improve T lymphocyte infiltration. Combining STING activation with PDT is a promising strategy based on these insights to produce synergistic antitumor effects and improve therapeutic outcomes.

Because of the above scientific issues, Zhao et al. developed an SR-717 (a STING agonist) loaded iron-tetrahydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Fe-THBQ) MOF, specified as Fe-THBQ/SR (Fig.8e) [137]. The platform introduced a PS that can be activated by NIR-II, which solved the problem of limited light penetration of traditional photosensitizers. By integrating NIR-II PDT, NIR-II PTT, ferroptosis induction and STING activation, the antitumor effect was significantly enhanced, and the TME was improved. The platform achieved multiple therapeutic effects under single NIR-II laser irradiation, with the advantages of simple operation, high precision and few side effects, providing a new strategy for cancer treatment. In 4T1 breast cancer and B16-F10 melanoma murine models, Fe-THBQ/SR + NIR-II laser irradiation significantly inhibited tumor growth, with tumor inhibition rates reaching 92.9% and 100%, respectively. PDT and PTT are promising for activating ICD and cGAS-STING pathways, but challenges remain. Organic molecules offer structure, biocompatibility, and adjustable functionality, but insufficient potency and severe photodegradation hinder strong immune activation. The development of intelligent organic photosensitizers with high efficacy and on-demand activated photoimmunotherapy properties is needed. Qi et al., using the innovatively designed hypoxia-activated probe called BN-O and vascular disruptor CA4P in Zn-MOF body and further disguised with M1-like macrophage membrane, formed a multifunctional nanoplatform named BC@ZM [148] (Fig.8f). This platform responds to the hypoxic environment, realizes the opening of NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic signals, triggers photodynamic and photothermal effects, activates the STING pathway, and enhances the immune response. BC@Z-M, in conjunction with 730 nm laser irradiation, markedly suppressed the proliferation of primary tumors and showed an inhibitory effect on unirradiated distant tumors (85% inhibition rate) (Fig.8g), showing strong immune activation and remote effects. The survival rate of mice treated with BC@Z-M + L was significantly improved within 40 days (Fig.8h), and they showed good antitumor immune memory in tumor rechallenge experiments. BC@Z-M also showed good biocompatibility as well as safety by histological analysis of organs and examination of blood. Although NIR-II PDT has shown great potential in tumor treatment, light intensity attenuation is still significant in deep tissues. In addition, NIR-II photosensitizers still face many challenges in terms of material stability, TME adaptability, imaging and treatment synergy, and clinical application bottlenecks. Future research needs to further optimize the material system, improve targeting, and deeply explore the synergistic mechanism of multimodal treatment to promote the clinical application of NIR-II PDT.

Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) utilizes sonosensitizers (SS) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (US) for targeted tumor ablation [197]. Due to the high penetrative power of ultrasonic radiation, SDT can target deep-seated tumors. It is reported that intense SDT-induced damage can trigger tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) to elicit systemic immune responses against primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. However, GSH overexpression in the TME creates a reductive milieu that protects tumor cells from ROS-induced oxidative damage. T-cell insufficiency within the tumor impedes immune responses. Therefore, SDT-driven production of ROS cannot completely eradicate tumors, highlighting the need for rationally designed SS that can modulate the TME and activate antitumor immune responses. Utilizing SS and SDT to directly modulate the activation of cGAS-STING and the subsequent antitumor immune response could be a potential strategy. Conventional organic sonosensitizers, such as porphyrins and their derivatives, are mostly hydrophobic compounds that aggregate easily and have dose-dependent toxic effects. Thus, the introduction of MOFs significantly expands the dynamics of the SDT field and provides more promising SS materials. Nonetheless, SDT-induced ICD primarily targets the destruction of specific tumor cells and exerts a limited regulatory influence on the immune system, potentially resulting in inadequate therapeutic efficacy in instances of multiple tumor lesions. Combining MOFs with the STING activation function with SDT is expected to solve this dilemma. Importantly, the rationale for utilizing MOF-based systems to amplify immunotherapeutic efficacy through SDT synergy involves two key mechanisms: (i) amplifying ultrasound-triggered ROS generation to exacerbate mtDNA/nDNA damage, and (ii) releasing metal ions that synergize with the damaged DNA to potentiate cGAS-STING activation. For example, in order to achieve better SDT immunotherapy effects, Yang et al. combined the mitochondrial targeting ligand triphenylphosphine (TPP) with cobalt-based metal-organic framework (CoTCPP) nanosheets to form TPP@CoTCPP nanoagonists (Fig.9a) [139]. Ultrasound stimulation induced ROS production by TPP@CoTCPP, resulting in mitochondrial damage that caused mtDNA to leak into the cytoplasm, thereby activating the cGAS-STING pathway. This transformation converted the TIME into an immunogenic target for immune cells. Cobalt ions, serving as the metal node of the metal-organic framework, enhance STING activity in a cGAMP-dependent manner following their dissociation from the TPP@CoTCPP nanosheet. Consequently, this initiated a cascade of immune responses, primarily involving dendritic cell and CD8+T cell infiltration, facilitating effective immunotherapy against local tumor burden and distant metastasis. However, GSH overexpression in TME creates a reductive milieu that protects tumor cells from ROS-induced oxidative damage like in PDT. To this end, Feng’s team developed a new Z-type heterojunction structure (MnxOy/(A/R)TiO₂, MTO for short) by adjusting the heteroatom doping concentration and interface formation in MOFs (Fig.9b) [147]. MTO directly kills tumor cells through SDT and Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and enhances the antitumor effect by activating the immune response. In conjunction with ICB therapy, MTO can induce long-term immunological memory and successfully suppress tumor recurrence and metastasis. In 4T1 breast cancer cells, MTO-0.9 showed significant cytotoxicity under ultrasound irradiation, with a half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of approximately 20 µg/mL. In a bilateral tumor model, MTO-0.9 combined with ultrasound irradiation and ICB therapy inhibited the primary tumor and significantly inhibited the growth of distant tumors. In healthy mice, MTO-0.9 showed good biocompatibility and did not cause significant weight loss or tissue damage. This multifunctional nanoplatform provides a new strategy for cancer treatment.

Recent studies reveal that cancer cells urgently require metal ions for proliferation and progression, prompting them to reshape their metabolic network to maintain higher intracellular metal ion levels. Therefore, new therapies targeting metal ion metabolism, such as ferroptosis inducers and cuproptosis inducers, have shown broad prospects in the field of cancer treatment. Both cuproptosis and ferroptosis are accompanied by mitochondrial damage, releasing a large amount of mtDNA, and activating innate immunity through the cGAS-STING pathway [58,198–202]. Fe-MOFs and Cu-MOFs in MOFs are excellent inducers of ferroptosis and cuproptosis and can also induce strong innate immunity through synergistic cGAS-STING agonists.

Li et al. developed Fe-MOF (MIL-101) using FeCl3and aminobenzoic acid, loaded with artesunate (DHA) to reprogram TAMs and enhance antitumor immunity (Fig.10a) [141]. Through the synergistic activation of ferroptosis and DNA damage signaling pathways, the cGAS-STING pathway was activated (Fig.10b), promoting the polarization of TAMs to the M1 phenotype and achieving effective immunotherapy for lung cancer (Fig.10c). However, extracellular vesicles secreted by tumor cells can induce abnormal TAM polarization, shifting M1 to M2-like TAMs and creating a TME, ultimately leading to poor immune responses [203,204]. To address this challenge, Huang et al. developed a nanometal-organic framework (MTO-Cu) by coordinating the chemotherapeutic agent mitoxantrone (MTO) with copper ions, incorporating the macropinocytosis and exosome secretion inhibitor amiloride (AMI), and surface-modifying it with chondroitin sulfate (CS) to create the CS/MTO-Cu@AMI nano adjuvant (Fig.10d) [159]. This nanoadjuvant induces cuproptosis-related mitochondrial malfunction, resulting in the depletion of energy necessary for macropinocytosis and exosome release, whereas AMI directly obstructs these processes. Moreover, the damaged dsDNA produced after CS/MTO-Cu@AMI therapy activates the cGAS-STING pathway, augmenting antitumor immunity.

Single metal therapy may not achieve satisfactory antitumor effects. Synergistic induction of cuproptosis and ferroptosis can overcome the limited efficacy of independent treatments [205,206]. Because studies have shown that in addition to promoting GSH depletion to produce ·OH [207–209], Cu²⁺ can also inhibit the formation of iron-sulfur clusters, increase the suicidal uptake of Fe²⁺ by malignant tumors, and thus induce severe ferroptosis [210,211]. Therefore, the ROS storm caused by ferroptosis and copper death in tumor cells leads to many double-stranded DNA breaks. Combined with agonists such as Zn2+or Mn2+, it can better stimulate cGAS-STING. However, the ultimate goal of immune activation is to infiltrate effector T cells. Regrettably, aberrant and dysfunctional tumor vasculature obstructs the infiltration and efficacy of effector T cells. Following the research mentioned above, Zhao et al. engineered a defective copper-based MOFs single-site nanozyme (F@D-CHTP SN) co-encapsulated with MSA-2 and furiquintinib, an inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) (Fig.10e) [142]. The conjugated organic ligands and prominently exposed unsaturated Cu-O2 single-atom sites confer exceptional reactive oxygen species generation activity to F@D-CHTP SN, which can disturb cellular redox equilibrium, compromise mitochondrial function, and ultimately trigger copper death and ferroptosis, thereby augmenting tumor immunogenicity. Concurrently, intratumoral STING activation and VEGFR inhibition synergistically facilitate tumor vascular normalization, remodel the immunosuppressive milieu, augment T-cell infiltration, and increase tumor suppression. Our research illustrates the viability and substantial synergistic impact of triggering a cascade of augmented immunity by integrating copper-induced cell death and ferroptosis with STING activation and tumor vascular normalization.

CDT utilizes Fenton or Fenton-like reactions within the acidic tumor microenvironment to catalytically convert H₂O₂ present in tumor tissues into highly reactive ·OH. These ·OH radicals induce DNA damage. However, the therapeutic efficacy of CDT is often compromised by the limited endogenous H₂O₂ concentration within tumor cells.Combining CDT with immunotherapy offers a strategy to enhance tumor cell killing. CDT-induced DNA damage can directly engage cGAS, thereby activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and eliciting antitumor immunity. The rationale for employing MOFs to augment CDT-induced DNA damage encompasses two key aspects: (i) Metal Ion Dual Functionality: Metal ions released during CDT not only mediate the chemodynamic process but also serve as agonists to activate the cGAS-STING pathway, achieving synergistic therapeutic effects. (ii) TME Modulation: MOFs can be engineered to modulate the TME, addressing factors that limit CDT efficiency, such as the elevated GSH levels characteristic of suppressive tumor microenvironments.

Li et al. developed an iron-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) to co-deliver therapeutic agents, encapsulated within an outermost layer of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) (Fig.11a). Within this system, Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ ions mediate the chemodynamic effects. The MnO₂ coating serves a dual purpose: (i) It consumes GSH while concurrently generating ·OH radicals, synergistically enhancing the Fe-ion-driven chemodynamic process. (ii) It activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway The Fe-MOF@MnO₂@PB@HA (FMPH) nanosystem leverages hyaluronic acid (HA) to enhance tumor-targeting capability. The released Prussian (PB) effectively disrupts angiogenesis and impedes cell proliferation. The MnO₂ component functions to deplete GSH and exerts CDT by generating hydroxyl ·OH. PTT synergizes with ·OH to cooperatively induce ICD in tumor cells. Concurrently, the released Mn²⁺ ions both catalyze Fenton-like reactions and directly activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. These multimodal mechanisms act synergistically to amplify the efficacy of immunotherapy. Tumor cells treated with FMPH exhibited potent apoptosis (Fig.11b). In 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse models, FMPH demonstrated significant antitumor effects. Biocompatibility assessments included an in vitro hemolysis assay and evaluation of the impact of FMPH treatment on major organs in mice in vivo (Fig.11c). Collectively, both in vitro and in vivo results confirmed the favorable biocompatibility and safety profile of the FMPH nanosystem [146].

Immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment; nonetheless, its effectiveness is constrained in numerous malignancies because of inadequate immunogenicity. The cGAS-STING signaling system, which connects innate and adaptive immunity, has become a prospective therapeutic target in immuno-oncology. Notwithstanding considerable progress in creating STING agonists, problems remain regarding their stability, delivery efficacy, and therapeutic accuracy. MOFs, characterized by their exact nanostructures, adjustable porosity, and biocompatibility, present a promising platform to address these limitations and improve immunotherapy results. In this review, we aimed to comprehensively review the progress of activation of cGAS-STING by MOFs for immunotherapy. We delineate the structure and route mechanisms associated with cGAS-STING-related proteins and categorize the prevalent types of agonists and their modes of action. We focus on outlining the unique advantages of MOFs in activating the cGAS-STING pathway. In contrast to conventional agonists, which have disadvantages such as susceptibility to catabolism and limited activation efficiency, MOFs have advantages in activating the cGAS-STING pathway for immunotherapy: (i) utilizing MOFs as nanocarriers to deliver STING agonists, which enhances the delivery and efficiency of STING agonists; (ii) employing metal components in MOFs as direct STING activators; and (iii) facilitating MOFs-enabled combination therapies that integrate chemotherapy, PDT, PTT, RT-RDT, and CDT with STING activation. In this review, we cross-sectioned the MOFs introduced in this review, and we can classify them into two main categories: (1) the cGAS-STING pathway activated by ions in the MOFs themselves; (2) the various drugs loaded in the MOFs (the loaded drugs can be classified into two categories: chemotherapeutic drugs, photosensitizers, etc., which can activate the cGAS-STING pathway by inducing DNA damage and direct STING agonists.) MOFs, as carriers for loaded drugs, have the advantages of optimized particle sizes and appropriate stability by modifying the surface and changing the synthesis method. Current research mainly emphasizes MOFs as agonist carriers or metal ionbased activators, with inadequate focus on activation processes facilitated by organic ligands or the comprehensive MOF structure.

Various mechanisms and strategies to activate the cGAS-STING pathway based on MOFs were elucidated. In addition to simple delivery of ions and STING agonists, most notably MOFs-based delivery systems are used in immunotherapy combining multiple therapeutic treatments. Whether combined with chemotherapy, sonodynamic, photodynamic, or any other therapy, the underlying mechanism is to enhance DNA damage and thus immune activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. However, combination therapeutic approaches offer both promise and obstacles. Although MOFs facilitate the simultaneous delivery of immunological agents, photosensitizers, and diagnostic probes, this combinatorial strategy necessitates meticulous attention to the mechanisms of action: (i) possible antagonistic interactions among therapeutic components; (ii) intricate formulation procedures; and (iii) the potential for excessive immune activation. Consequently, the formulation of combination therapies must be informed by a comprehensive comprehension of the molecular interactions among various treatment modalities, guaranteeing synergistic rather than antagonistic outcomes. Future research should develop more focused mechanistic studies of combination therapies that equilibrate therapeutic efficacy with immune regulation while ensuring robust safety profiles via thorough preclinical evaluation.

1) Intricate formulation procedures. The preparation of functionalized MOFs usually involves complex synthetic steps. To achieve clinical applications, it is necessary to ensure that the materials can be produced easily in large quantities and maintain functional stability.

2) Safety. The in vivo safety and compatibility of MOFs for clinical use needs to be more validated than simple experimental studies in the preclinical stage. Toxicity and biocompatibility of MOFs are still the major influencing factors for the lack of large-scale clinical use. Therefore, in the future, we need to focus more on systematically examining the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of MOFs modules to enhance their therapeutic index and safety profile.

3) In-depth study of the mechanism: As a chemically synthesized nanomaterial, the mechanism of action of MOFs in vivo and the morphology of their action in vivo still need to be further investigated. Currently, the study is superficial, and in the future, researchers need to focus on exploring the in-depth mechanism of its action, so as to provide a more powerful scientific basis for the application of MOFs in clinical translation.

In summary, although MOFs-mediated cGAS-STING activation signifies a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, its practical implementation necessitates overcoming existing constraints via interdisciplinary research, new material development, and comprehensive assessment of therapeutic results. The ongoing progress in this domain offers significant potential for creating more effective and accurate cancer immunotherapies.
