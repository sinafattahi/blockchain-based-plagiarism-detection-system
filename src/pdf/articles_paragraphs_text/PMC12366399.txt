Pain management and prevention of muscle atrophy are key rehabilitation challenges following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Despite the potential muscle atrophy-reducing and analgesic effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), evidence supporting its use in post-ARCR rehabilitation remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of home-based NMES intervention for promoting early functional recovery after ARCR.

A total of 63 ARCR patients were randomized into the NMES group (n= 32) and MENS (Micro-current electrical nerve stimulation) group (n= 31), both receiving a 6-week home-based intervention (5 sessions weekly, 30 min per session) following surgery. The NMES group used neuromuscular electrical stimulation equipment, while the MENS group used identical devices without current output. The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley Shoulder (CMS) score, with secondary outcomes including resting and active visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, deltoid muscle thicknes, shoulder range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia scores. Assessments were conducted preoperatively, at 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively.

At 6 weeks postoperatively, the NMES group exhibited a significantly higher CMS than the MENS group (76.10 ± 9.43 vs. 71.22 ± 9.2p= 0.032), along with superior active pain relief (active VAS: 4.1 ± 0.9 vs. 3.4 ± 0.7p= 0.003), greater forward flexion ROM (151.7 ± 11.3 vs. 141.8 ± 13.6p= 0.003), and thicker deltoid muscle thickness (1.02 ± 0.06 vs. 0.91 ± 0.06p< 0.001). The NMES group also demonstrated lower TSK scores (31.06 ± 6.69 vs. 35.42 ± 7.76p= 0.020) and greater adductor strength (40.9 ± 16.7 vs. 33.5 ± 12.2p= 0.048). By 3 months postoperatively, intergroup differences persisted only in abductor ROM, muscle strength, and deltoid thickness, with no significant disparities in other measured indices.

Home-based NMES effectively accelerates functional recovery, enhances pain management, and mitigates kinesiophobia within 6 weeks post-ARCR, with partial maintenance of these benefits at the 3-month follow-up. This intervention offers a safe adjunctive strategy for early rehabilitation, particularly suited to patients requiring rapid functional restoration; however, long-term efficacy remains to be confirmed.To evaluate the acceptability of MyCheck for asymptomatic sexually transmissible infections (STIs) testing.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is the gold standard procedure for the treatment of rotator cuff tears [1]. With an aging population and increased sports injuries, approximately 300,000 patients worldwide undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair each year [2].

Rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair has always been a hot area of clinical research, and its core goal is to establish a dynamic balance between biological healing of the repaired tissues and functional recovery of the shoulder joint through a scientific rehabilitation program. Current evidence indicates that postoperative rehabilitation following ARCR faces two predominant clinical challenges: activity-induced pain and concomitant periapical muscle atrophy [3], both of which demonstrate significant correlations with suboptimal shoulder functional recovery outcomes. An ultrasound-based cohort studies have demonstrated a marked reduction in deltoid muscle thickness among patients following ARCR, with this atrophic condition persisting without significant reversal at 12-month postoperative evaluations [4]. Current research suggests that this phenomenon may originate from two interrelated mechanisms: preoperative motion restriction secondary to pain-induced joint disuse and postoperative muscle wasting associated with prolonged therapeutic immobilization. Such atrophy not only compromises the shoulder’s dynamic stabilization system but also potentiates adverse biomechanical consequences, including increased mechanical stress concentration and progressive fat infiltration within the repair site [5,6]. Clinical investigations have found that 60%−70% of ARCR patients exhibit moderate-to-severe postoperative pain during rehabilitation, with pain-related kinesiophobia prompting voluntary movement restriction. This behavioral adaptation may predispose patients to secondary complications including articular adhesion formation, soft tissue contractures, and pathological mechanical overload at the surgical site [7].

Emerging evidence demonstrates that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) exhibits therapeutic potential for mitigating postoperative muscular atrophy and enhancing pain control across various surgical contexts, while maintaining an acceptable safety profile [8]. Nevertheless, clinical implementation of NMES in ARCR rehabilitation protocols remains suboptimal, a phenomenon attributable to multifactorial technical barriers including elevated implementation costs, suboptimal patient compliance due to device-related discomfort, and treatment-limiting neuromuscular fatigue [9,10]. Due to the lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of NMES in preventing muscle atrophy after rotator cuff repair, coupled with the fact that most of the existing devices are general-purpose and lack precise electrode design and parameter settings for the postoperative population to meet the needs of reparative tissue protection, clinicians are therefore more inclined to recommend well-established, reliable, and traditional rehabilitation methods. NMES deserves to be further explored as a complementary option to conventional postoperative rehabilitation programs due to its non-pharmacological nature and potential to counteract postoperative analgesia and prevent muscle atrophy after ARCR. The present study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess whether a 6-week home NMES intervention after ARCR could reduce patient pain, prevent muscle atrophy, and improve joint function. To minimize the placebo effect, we created an electrical stimulation placebo group, and patients in this group received an ineffective electrical stimulation regimen.

A power analysis using G*Power 3.1 software (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) was conducted based on CMS scores from a pre-experiment, yielding an effect (difference in CMS between groups) size of 0.77. Assuming a 5% type I error rate and 80% statistical power, 70 participants were required—calculated to account for a 20% dropout rate.

Among patients who met the inclusion exclusion criteria and signed an informed consent form, a computer-generated block randomization sequence (block lengths were kept confidential) was used by an independent statistician, and group assignment was done instantly through a centralized randomization system. To ensure blinding, the randomized sequences and treatment protocols were administered by independent personnel in a sealed manner, and neither the outcome assessor nor the statistical analyst had access to subgroup information throughout the study.

Both cohorts received standardized rehabilitation comprising: including wall climbing exercises in the coronal and sagittal planes, dorsal stretching exercises, and closed-chain exercises for door pushing. The shoulder was immobilized with an abduction brace for the first 6 weeks postoperatively, and range of motion (ROM) exercises for the elbow, wrist, and fingers, pendulum movements, and shrugs were started immediately after surgery. Passive ROM exercises were started in the 2nd postoperative week, and in the 3rd postoperative week, patients performed active assisted ROM exercises. Active activities were started in the 6th postoperative week, and thereafter shoulder mobility and weight bearing gradually increased. Patients were accounted for outpatient follow-up of joint mobility, pain, and muscle strength at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Based on the results of the follow-up, the physician recommended a rehabilitation program for the next phase.

The experimental cohort received the standardized rehabilitation protocol supplemented with adjunctive home-based NMES therapy. NMES intervention was implemented using a portable EMS device (Jinzhun, China) (Fig. 1). This device, small and convenient, simple operation is suitable for patients at home for rehabilitation use. And the device is bound to the patient’s WeChat, which allows background monitoring of the patient’s usage. Prior to stimulation delivery, standardized cutaneous preparation was performed with the upper extremity maintained in the standardized abduction orthosis. Self-adhesive flexible electrodes were positioned over the inferoanterior and posterior deltoid regions, with strategic anatomical landmark labeling to ensure application consistency across treatment sessions (Fig. 2). The NMES therapeutic protocol commenced at 24 h postoperatively and was maintained over a 6-week therapeutic period, adhering to a standardized delivery schedule of five daily 30-minute treatment sessions per week. The stimulation parameters were set as rectangular waves (pulse width 360 µs) in a 2–40 Hz variable frequency mode, and the intensity was gradually increased according to the patient’s tolerance. All participants received comprehensive NMES application training from certified rehabilitation therapists during hospitalization to ensure correct application techniques and safety compliance. Scheduled postoperative clinical evaluations verified procedural fidelity, while treatment completion metrics were derived from device-recorded usage parameters archived within the therapeutic platform.

Both groups of patients were followed up at least once a week by telephone and through the background data of the patient’s use, reminding the patients who did not use in time for the rehabilitation of electrical stimulation to ensure that we can complete the program, if the patient did not complete the program five times a week, we will be excluded from the data of this part of the patient, according to the data of our background of the patient’s adherence is satisfactory.

To remove the bias that patients expected to benefit from active treatment, patients in the sham-stimulation group received a simulated micro-current electrical nerve stimulation (MENS) device [11] and were told that the device applied imperceptible MENS to relieve pain. In contrast, patients in the NMES group were told that, in addition to causing muscle contraction, NMES had a pain-relieving effect, thus distributing the placebo effect evenly across the two groups. The MENS intervention was similarly initiated 24 h postoperatively and continued for 6 weeks, with a treatment frequency of 30 min five times per week.

All procedures were performed under general anesthesia by a designated surgical team comprising fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons specializing in arthroscopic shoulder reconstruction, ensuring procedural consistency across the study cohort. This procedure is performed by extracorporeally positioning the arthroscope into the subacromial space to confirm a full rotator cuff tear and observe the size of the tear, the degree of tendon retraction, and tissue degeneration. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression is routinely performed to create a flat subacromial surface. For combined dislocations, subluxations, or tears of > 50% of the transverse diameter of the biceps long head tendon, tenodesis or tenotomy is chosen based on the patient’s age and activity demands. Intraoperatively, the tear margin was thoroughly debrided to the normal tendinous tissue, and ARCR was performed according to the morphology and extent of the tear. Anatomical repositioning and biomechanical stabilization were achieved using single- or double-row suture bridge techniques, and the firmness of the repair was confirmed by intraoperative pull tests.

All outcome assessments were conducted by a blinded independent assessor to ensure measurement objectivity. Participants received standardized instructions emphasizing allocation confidentiality throughout the study period to preserve blinding integrity across experimental cohorts.

The Constant-Murley Score (CMS) is an internationally recognized tool for assessing shoulder function and consists of 4 dimensions: pain (15 points), ability to perform daily activities (20 points), shoulder mobility (40 points), and muscle strength (25 points), with a total score of 0-100, with the higher the score the better the function [12]. Measurements were taken preoperatively, 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively.

The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is widely used to assess postoperative pain [8]. The patient selects his or her own pain score on a 0–100 mm horizontal axis, with every 10 mm representing a score of 1, with 0 indicating “no pain” and 10 indicating “worst pain”. Resting pain was measured after the shoulder was kept at rest for at least 30 min. Pain during activity was measured immediately after abduction to maximum angle for 5 s. Resting pain was measured preoperatively and at postoperative weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 3 months, and VAS scores at activity were measured at weeks 4, 5, 6, and 3 months.

Isometric contraction strength of shoulder abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation was quantified using a calibrated hand-held dynamometer (HHD). Measurements were conducted in standardized anatomical positions with consistent joint angles across assessments. The final strength value was documented as the mean of three consecutive maximal-effort trials. Shoulder muscle strength was assessed preoperatively at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively.

The thickness of the deltoid muscle was measured by a trained physician using ultrasound. The measurement was performed in a standing position, with the affected hand on the contralateral shoulder, and the thickness of the deltoid muscle belly was measured at the anterolateral border of the acromion. (Fig.3) The measurement plane was the coronal plane [13]. During measurements, avoid excessive pressure from the ultrasound probe on the skin over the deltoid muscle and endeavor to take measurements in the same position each time [14]. The thickness of the deltoid muscle was measured using electronic calipers based on the distance between the nearest and farthest boundaries of the deltoid muscle belly at the location of the probe placement. Deltoid muscle thickness was measured preoperatively, at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively.

Active forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation were measured using a long arm protractor Measurements were taken in the supine position to avoid scapular substitution. Shoulder mobility was assessed preoperatively, 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively.

The TSK is a standardized tool for assessing avoidance of exercise behaviors due to fear of pain in adults, with 17 entries [15,16]. A 4-point Likert scale (1 = “strongly disagree” to 4 = “strongly agree”) was used, with 13 items scored positively (agreeing means high score) and 4 items scored negatively (needing to be converted for scoring), for a total score of 17 to 68, with higher scores The higher the score, the more significant the tendency of kinesiophobia. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of this scale is 0.68 ~ 0.86, with good reliability and validity [17,18]. The kinesiophobia scores were performed preoperatively, 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively, respectively.

Statistics were processed using SPSS 27.0 statistical software withp< 0.05 as the threshold of significance. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (X ± S). The Pearson chi-square test was used to compare the demographic differences between the NMES and MENS groups. After confirming that the data conformed to normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the significance of differences in preoperative continuous variable information between groups was assessed using an independent t test to ensure baseline comparability. A mixed ANOVA was used to assess the interaction between time (before and after) and group (NMES and MENS groups). If significant interactions between factors were found, post hoc paired t-tests for multiple comparisons and Bonferroni corrections were applied.

From July 2024 to January 2025, 70 participants were prospectively enrolled 35 in the NMES group and 35 in the MENS group. During the follow-up period, three participants in the NMES group and four in the MENS group withdrew from the trial. The results included a total of 63 patients. None of the patients who participated in this study experienced electrical stimulation-related adverse effects. The study flow chart is shown in Fig.4. Baseline clinical and demographic details are shown in Table 1. The study population (N= 63) had an average age of 60.2 years, was predominantly female (74.6%), and had an average height and weight of 160.5 cm and 60.7 kg, respectively. Most had received basic education. The preoperative baseline was similar in both groups.

We found that the CMS scores of patients in the NMES group were higher than those in the MENS group at postoperative week 6, and the difference was statistically significant (76.10 ± 9.43 vs. 71.22 ± 9.24p= 0.032) (Table 2). CMS scores increased by 9.16 in the NMES group and 3.41 in the MENS group at postoperative week 6, whereas at postoperative month 3, CMS scores increased by 19.75 in the NMES group and 17.71 in the MENS group, which were not statistically different.

Comparative analysis demonstrated that by postoperative week 2 following ARCR, both cohorts exhibited significant reductions in resting VAS scores compared to week 1 assessments (p< 0.05), with sustained analgesic benefits persisting throughout subsequent follow-up evaluations (Fig.5). Compared to the MENS group, the NMES group had lower resting VAS scores at postoperative week 1 (p< 0.001) and this advantage persisted for at least 4 weeks (p= 0.003). However, there was no significant difference in pain scores at rest between the two groups starting at week 5. Time effects (p< 0.001) and group interaction effects (p= 0.004) were significant for resting pain. At postoperative week 4, the active VAS scores of patients in both groups, decreased from baseline and maintained the improvement in pain during the follow-up period. (Fig.6) The NMES group had lower active VAS scores at postoperative week 4 compared to the MENS group (p= 0.013) and this advantage persisted for at least 6 weeks (p= 0.003). However, there was no significant difference in pain at rest scores between the two groups starting at month 3. The time effect (p< 0.001) was significant for activity pain, whereas the group interaction effect had no effect on activity pain.

Quantitative analysis of TSK scores demonstrated superior kinesiophobia mitigation in the NMES cohort compared to the MENS group at the 6-week postoperative assessment (31.06 ± 6.69 vs. 35.42 ± 7.76;p= 0.020). Longitudinal analysis identified temporal progression as a significant modifier of kinesiophobia trajectories (p< 0.001), though intergroup differences at the 3-month follow-up did not reach statistical significance.

In terms of shoulder joint ROM, at 6 weeks post-surgery, the FLEX ROM in the NMES group was significantly higher than that in the MENS group (151.7 ± 11.3 vs. 141.8 ± 13.6,p= 0.003); Additionally, there was a significant difference in ABD range of motion between the groups (154.7 ± 11.6 vs. MENS group 143.4 ± 18.8,p= 0.005). At 3 months postoperatively, the differences in ABD range of motion between groups remained significant (160.2 ± 8.8 vs. 154.6 ± 8.9,p= 0.046). ER range of motion showed no significant differences between groups at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. The time factor had a significant positive effect on range of motion in all three directions (FLEX, ABD, ER) at 3 months postoperatively (p< 0.001). Muscle strength results showed that at 6 weeks postoperatively, the NMES group had higher FLEX strength than the MENS group (40.9 ± 16.7 vs. 33.5 ± 12.2,p= 0.048), ABD strength also differed between groups (p= 0.039), but there was no significant difference in ER strength. At 3 months postoperatively, the difference in ABD strength between groups remained significant (p= 0.046), while there was no statistically significant difference in FLEX and ER strength between groups. The time factor also had a significant positive effect on FLEX, ABD, and ER muscle strength at 3 months postoperatively (p< 0.001).

We found significant differences in deltoid muscle thickness between the two groups at postoperative week 6, and both groups at 3 months, (6 weeks 1.02 ± 0.06 vs. 0.91 ± 0.06p< 0.001; 3 months 1.12 ± 0.08 vs. 1.01 ± 0.08p< 0.001). Time factor had a significant effect on muscle thickness (p< 0.001).

This study demonstrated that NMES provided significant advantages in early rehabilitation after ARCR, with the NMES group exhibiting greater improvements in shoulder function and pain control and lower levels of kinesiophobia compared to the MENS group at 6 weeks postoperatively. Additionally, the NMES group showed significantly better forward flexion and abduction ROM, muscle strength, and deltoid thickness at 6 weeks postoperatively than the conventional group. However, these advantages did not persist as statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes—except for abductor mobility, muscle strength, and deltoid thickness—at the 3-month postoperative follow-up, suggesting that NMES primarily accelerates early functional recovery rather than altering long-term prognosis.

Passive training is recommended in the early postoperative period after ARCR to ensure the safety of tendon bone healing, and it is only after 6 weeks that patients are allowed to perform active and strength training [19,20].Longer postoperative immobilization in the early period leads to muscle atrophy and reduced muscle strength; patients with more severe muscle atrophy and increased fat infiltration exhibit a higher risk of postoperative recurrence and poorer clinical outcomes compared with those with milder muscle atrophy [21,22].NMES serves as an adjunctive tool in postoperative rehabilitation to enhance muscle strength and mitigate muscle atrophy. It counteracts muscle inhibition by promoting recruitment of pain- or effusion-inhibited muscles and overcomes impaired muscle activation through increased motor unit recruitment and rate coding (motor unit firing rate). Literature dating to the 1990 s supports using NMES to enhance recovery of quadriceps muscular force production in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [23].

Research on the role of NMES in postoperative rehabilitation after ARCR remains limited and yielding mixed conclusions. Lee et al. reported that an NMES protocol improved postoperative deltoid atrophy, though clinical outcomes did not differ significantly between groups [8]. Conversely, Michael et al. found that neuromuscular electrical stimulation significantly enhanced postoperative muscle strength recovery irrespective of patient age, tear size, current intensity, or postoperative duration [24]. Lee reported similar findings in a clinical study on NMES use after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), noting that the NMES group exhibited significantly greater ROM and external rotation strength compared with the non-NMES group at 3 months post-RSA, and greater external rotation ROM at 6 months postoperatively; however, no significant intergroup differences were observed in VAS, ASES, or Constant scores at any follow-up timepoint [25]. Our findings differ from those mentioned above. Although the NMES group did not show superior clinical outcomes at 3 months post-surgery, at 6 weeks post-surgery, the NMES group demonstrated significant advantages in shoulder joint function, pain, TSK scores, deltoid muscle thickness, shoulder joint range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength (excluding external rotation). We believe that NMES can alleviate moderate pain within the first 6 weeks postoperatively and lay the foundation for early rehabilitation training. Due to the better training foundation established early on, clinical outcomes in the earlier postoperative stages also showed advantages. Since we did not initiate rehabilitation training for external rotation too early postoperatively, the NMES group did not demonstrate advantages in external rotation ROM and muscle strength. As time progressed, the rehabilitation programs of the two groups converged and the early gap could be bridged by progressive loading [26], thus the clinical outcomes of the 2 groups at 3 months postoperatively did not show a gap.

Kinesiophobia represents a maladaptive psychological construct characterized by a pathological fear response involving irrational apprehension toward movement-related activities. This phenomenon is specifically defined as a debilitating anxiety centered on catastrophic misinterpretation of movement-induced injury risk or re-injury exacerbation during physical exertion [27]. The condition typically manifests in persistent movement avoidance patterns that significantly impair functional rehabilitation adherence. Recent studies indicate kinesiophobia acts as a barrier to rehabilitation compliance, inducing patient fear of resuming exercise and thereby compromising postoperative rehabilitation outcomes [28]. Prior research has indicated that kinesiophobia development may be associated with lower education levels, cognitive bias, and insufficient disease awareness [29]. Elevated kinesiophobia levels in ARCR patients compromise short-term recovery trajectories and potentiate risks of secondary complications, including articular stiffness and muscular deconditioning, through diminished adherence to active rehabilitation protocols [30]. The improvement in TSK scores suggests that NMES may alleviate kinesiophobia through early postoperative pain relief and enhanced self-efficacy via improved rehabilitation task completion, breaking the “pain-fear-immobilization” vicious cycle. The present study’s results further align with Wang et al.’s proposal that early identification and prevention of kinesiophobia benefit patients after rotator cuff repair [31]. Under the conditions of this study, NMES overcomes the limitations of traditional rehabilitation, offering a safe and effective novel option for early postoperative rehabilitation in the immediate postoperative phase. The portable electrical stimulator, integrating telehealth capabilities, enabled patients to engage in home-based rehabilitation while allowing investigators to provide regular remote supervision and guidance. Previous studies have also highlighted the benefits of home-based therapy following ARCR [32]. Although no significant differences in clinical outcome measures were seen between the two groups at the three-month postoperative time point, NMES may have improved patients’ early rehabilitation experience at 6 weeks postoperatively. However, patient satisfaction with rehabilitation was not assessed in this study, so the potential impact of NMES on the psychological dimension of patients could not be explored. Based on these observations, the present study suggests that the use of NMES in the early postoperative period after rotator cuff repair may have a positive effect. Future studies could further explore the optimal timing of NMES application in rotator cuff repair rehabilitation to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Second, investigations into the synergistic mechanisms between neuromuscular electrical stimulation and exercise training would provide a more robust scientific foundation for rehabilitation protocols. Additionally, long-term follow-up studies are warranted to assess the impact NMES-based rehabilitation programs on patients’ sustained functional recovery over extended periods.

Limitations of this study include: (1) the inability to assess long-term intervention efficacy due to the relatively short 3-month follow-up period; (2) The measurement of deltoid muscle thickness using ultrasound imaging technology has limitations in terms of spatial resolution compared to magnetic resonance imaging [33]; (3) the need for future RCTs to explore optimal intensity parameters for NMES stimulation; (4)the statistical methodology used in this study adds the risk of Type I error.

Home-based NMES, a novel rehabilitation modality after ARCR, significantly enhances shoulder function, alleviates pain, and mitigates kinesiophobia within 6 weeks postoperatively. While clinical efficacy aligns with conventional rehabilitation at 3 months, its role in accelerating early functional recovery remains significant—particularly for patients requiring rapid rehabilitation progress.
