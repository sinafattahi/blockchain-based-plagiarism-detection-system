This study investigates the photocatalytic performance
of Cu2O surfaces modified with halogen-substituted phenylacetylenes
(4-XA), including 1-ethynyl-4-fluorobenzene (4-FA), 1-chloro-4-ethynylbenzene
(4-CA), and 1-bromo-4-ethynylbenzene (4-BA), using an integrated theoretical
and experimental approach. Through density functional theory (DFT)
calculations and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements,
we analyze how these molecular decorators affect charge transfer dynamics
and the electronic structure of the Cu2O {100}, {110},
and {111} facets. Two distinct photocatalytic mechanisms are proposed:
one where electrons reach the vacuum level through the molecular decorator
and another where electrons escape directly through the Cu2O surface via molecular-induced hybridized states. Our results show
that 4-BA-modified {100} surfaces exhibit the strongest enhancement,
which is attributed to the presence of in-gap molecular states, increased
charge separation, and a significantly reduced work function. Experimental
degradation of methyl orange validates the trend 4-BA > 4-CA >
4-FA,
consistent with theoretical predictions. These findings highlight
the crucial role of band structure engineering and provide guidelines
for the rational design of high-performance molecularly decorated
photocatalysts.

Photocatalysts have received
considerable attention over the past
few decades due to their extensive applications in areas such as air
and water purification, green chemistry, active surface engineering,
and energy conversion.−Enhancing photocatalytic activity for processes such as dye degradation,,water splitting,−CO2reduction,,and organic transformation reactions,remains a
critical goal for advancing sustainable technologies. A comprehensive
understanding of the reaction mechanism is pivotal in the design of
highly efficient photocatalytic materials.

For many reported
photocatalysts employed in water splitting,−reactants must
adsorb onto the surface to proceed with subsequent
reaction steps. This prerequisite highlights the role of diffusion
from the bulk aqueous environment and mass transport as limiting factors
in these processes. Conversely, these constraints can be effectively
addressed by leveraging free-radical-based mechanisms, which are particularly
advantageous for organic reactions. In these systems, photoexcited
electrons transfer to dissolved oxygen, generating superoxide anion
radicals that subsequently react with organic molecules.,Meanwhile, numerous semiconductor materials, including Cu2O, CeO2, Ag2O, Ag3PO4, and SrTiO3, display strong facet dependence in photocatalytic
activity.−For example, Cu2O rhombic dodecahedra (RD) manifest high
photocatalytic activity, while cubes are simply inert due to the lack
of radical formation upon light illumination. This phenomenon can be explained by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, which reveal that the facet dependence of Cu2O originates from its electronic structure.

To enhance photocatalytic activity, various strategies have
been
explored, including surface decoration with metal particles and graphene
sheets, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and
the formation of semiconductor heterostructures.,−DFT calculations demonstrate that functionalization of Cu2O crystals with specific adsorbates can significantly modify their
band structures, enhancing their suitability for photocatalytic applications. For example, molecular functionalization of
Cu2O cubes with 4-ethynylaniline (4-EA) has been shown
to transform otherwise inert cubes into highly active photocatalysts. Cu2O octahedra and RD also exhibit
modest activity improvements upon 4-EA decoration. This enhancement
is attributed to the creation of new electronic states within the
band gap, as confirmed by band-decomposed charge density analyses.
Among the molecular decorators studied, 4-trifluoromethylphenylacetylene
(4-TFMA) has demonstrated unique ability to enhance photocatalytic
performance. Decoration of Cu2O surfaces with 4-TFMA significantly
improves photocatalytic activity on {100} and {110} facets due to
the introduction of in-gap states and enhanced charge separation.
However, the {111} surface shows diminished performance upon 4-TFMA
decoration, primarily due to the absence of in-gap states and electron
localization effects between the 4-TFMA molecule and the Cu2O surface. These findings highlight
the facet-dependent nature of 4-TFMA-induced photocatalytic activity
and its potential as a cost-effective and efficient molecular decorator.

The use of alternative molecular decorators has provided deeper
insights into photocatalytic mechanisms. Functionalization with 2-ethynyl-6-methoxynaphthalene
(2E-6MN) leads to distinct photocatalytic behaviors, with notable
changes in band structure for {100} and {110} surfaces, while no new
bands appear within the band gap for the {111} surface. Similarly, 4-nitrophenylacetylene (4-NA) enhances
photocatalytic performance by facilitating electron injection and
achieving a small energy difference between the 4-NA molecule and
the vacuum level, as corroborated by DFT calculations. These findings underscore the potential of molecular
decoration in tailoring photocatalytic activity for specific applications,
such as aryl sulfide oxidation, oxidative
amine coupling reactions, and arylboronic
acid hydroxylation. Furthermore, Bader
charge difference and charge density analyses reveal that 4-cyanophenylacetylene
(4-CNA) acts as an efficient electron transfer pathway, facilitating
electron migration away from the Cu2O surface.

In this study, we investigate halogen-substituted phenylacetylenes
as molecular decorators, focusing on 1-ethynyl-4-fluorobenzene (4-FA),
1-chloro-4-ethynylbenzene (4-CA), and 1-bromo-4-ethynylbenzene (4-BA).
These halogen substituents were deliberately chosen to systematically
probe the effects of substituent electronegativity and resonance interaction
on Cu2O band structure modulation. They offer a simplified
and tunable framework for studying how molecular properties influence
interfacial charge transfer. Fluorine, chlorine, and bromine offer
a progressive decrease in electronegativity, which can influence the
degree of electron-withdrawing interaction formation at the molecule–surface
interface. Using DFT calculations, we evaluate the charge transfer
behavior on Cu2O {100}, {110}, and {111} surfaces through
charge density difference, Bader charge analysis, planar average potential
distribution, and energy band diagrams. Our results reveal the formation
of new molecular-induced bands within the band gap after surface decoration,
significantly enhancing photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, our
calculations predict that the photocatalytic efficiency follows the
trend 4-BA > 4-CA > 4-FA, consistent with our experimental results.
Notably, we propose a novel mechanism for decorated Cu2O surface systems, wherein electrons preferentially transition to
vacuum-level states through the Cu2O surface rather than
via molecular decorators. This mechanism diverges from previous findings.−

,Through a combination of theory
and experiment, we identify two key factors influencing photocatalytic
enhancement: (i) the emergence of molecular-induced hybrid states
near the band edge and (ii) the modified surface electronic potential
that facilitates electron escape. These insights offer a new mechanistic
understanding of facet-specific molecular decoration and provide a
rational basis for designing next-generation photocatalytic systems.

To determine the nature of the three molecules (4-BA, 4-CA, 4-FA)
prior to decoration, we analyzed their molecular electrostatic potential
(MEP) and electron localization function (ELF).Figurepresents the MEP and ELF distributions for
these molecules. In the MEP analysis, the isosurface distribution
represents the charge density, while the color indicates the electrostatic
potential. The bromo substituent exhibits a green-to-blue color gradient
(seeFigurea), indicating
a lower electrostatic potential compared to the fluoro substituent,
which predominantly appears red (seeFigurec). Notably, the electrostatic potential
follows the trend: F– > Cl– > Br–. This
observation
suggests that the electron-withdrawing effect is strongest for the
bromo group and weakest for the fluoro group. Additionally, the isosurface
analysis reveals that the bromo substituent has the highest charge
density among the three molecules. Subsequently, the ELF analysis
quantifies the likelihood of electron localization around specific
atoms. Results show that the bromo substituent exhibits the highest
probability of electron localization, followed by the chloro and fluoro
substituents, which display weaker electron-withdrawing behavior.
Integrating the MEP and ELF findings, we conclude that the electron-withdrawing
property of the substituents follows the sequence: 4-BA > 4-CA
> 4-FA.
Interestingly, this trend is opposite to their electronegativity values,
highlighting the unique electronic environment created by the bromo
group.

of the electron localization function (right panels) of (a) 4-BA,
(b) 4-CA, and (c) 4-FA. The isosurface value of the charge density
is set to 0.025 e/Bohr3.

Halogen substituents withdraw electrons through
the inductive effect
due to their high electronegativity, while their lone pairs may also
engage in resonance with the benzene ring, partially offsetting this
effect. Among them, fluorine shows the strongest resonance interaction
owing to its well-matched 2porbital, weakening its
net electron-withdrawing ability. In contrast, bromine exhibits the
weakest resonance effect, and despite its relatively low electronegativity,
it achieves the strongest overall electron-withdrawing capacity. Consequently,
the electron-withdrawing ability follows the trend: 4-BA > 4-CA
>
4-FA. This trend enhances photocatalytic performance, as the stronger
withdrawal effect of 4-BA facilitates charge separation and suppresses
electron–hole recombination under illumination. By integrating
the MEP and ELF results, we find the strong potential of these molecular
properties to influence photocatalytic performance. Given its superior
electron-withdrawing behavior, 4-BA is expected to significantly enhance
the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O crystals. These predictions
are further explored in subsequent sections.

The decorated structures for the Cu2O {100} surface
are demonstrated inFigure S1. Due to the
metal cation−π interactions and the disappearance of
the acetylenic hydrogen featured peak of the functionalized Cu2O crystal observed in the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra from previous studies,−
,the H atom of alkynyl termination needs to be removed for the decorators.
For the {100} surface, there are four bridge sites based on the different
Cu–Cu and O–O distances, which are denoted as Cu–Cu
long-range, Cu–Cu short-range, O–O long-range, and O–O
short-range (seeFigure S1d–f).
The most stable binding site for three decorating molecules is the
Cu–Cu long-range bridge site. The corresponding binding energies
for 4-FA-, 4-CA-, and 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {100} surfaces
are −3.95 −3.98, and −3.95 eV, respectively.
These considerable negative values mean that the binding between the
Cu2O {100} surface and three decorating molecules is relatively
stable. The detailed analysis of the binding configurations and the
corresponding binding energies can be seen in theSupporting Information.

Following the determination
of stable binding configurations, the behavior of charge transfer
between the semiconductor surface and the conjugated molecule would
be investigated. As seen inFigurea, the planar average charge density difference (CDD),
along the surface normal for the 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {100}
surface, and the side view in the 3D representations are provided.
The red dashed line in the plot is used to separate the Cu2O surface from the 4-BA molecule, which is defined as the middle
of the alkynyl carbon atom and the binding Cu atom. The integral values
for the upper side and lower side separated by the red dashed line
are 1.341e and −1.592e, respectively. The positive value means
charge accumulation at the 4-BA molecule, whereas the negative value
signifies charge depletion for the Cu2O surface. Therefore,
the CDD result illustrates that the electron tends to transfer from
Cu2O to the 4-BA molecule. The CDD calculations for 4-FA-
and 4-CA-decorated Cu2O {100} surfaces are presented inFigure S3, which also suggest a similar result
that electrons are inclined to transfer from the Cu2O surface
to decorating molecules. To further compare the level of charge separation
in the decorated Cu2O {100} surface, the integral values
of CDD are also provided. The values for 4-BA-, 4-CA-, and 4-FA-decorated
surfaces are 1.176e, 1.160e, and 1.152e, respectively. These values
suggest that 4-BA promotes the most effective charge separation, aligning
with its anticipated superior photocatalytic activity. To quantify
the investigation of charge transfer behavior, Bader charge difference
(BCD) calculations are also performed. The BCD values for decorating
molecules are 0.036e, 0.050e, and 0.049e for 4-BA, 4-CA, and 4-FA
cases, respectively, indicating that decorating molecules tend to
obtain electrons. Besides, the BCD values for the Cu atoms bonded
to decorating molecules are −0.160e for three cases, signifying
that electrons are inclined to transfer out of Cu2O surfaces.

represents the average potential of the decorating molecule.

Next, molecular functionalization should tune the
surface band
structure of Cu2O to display different photocatalytic activities.−

,Figureb,c presents the band structure of the Cu2O {100} surface before and after 4-BA molecule decoration.
Apparently, there are two new molecular-induced bands located between
the band gap after 4-BA decoration, denoted as band-1 and band-2,
respectively. These molecularly induced bands do not exhibit the characteristics
of deep trap states, which typically localize charge and hinder transport.
Instead, band-decomposed charge density analysis reveals that band-1
and band-2 possess hybridized characteristics, with charge density
delocalized over the Cu2O surface and partially extended
into the molecular region (as shown inFigured,e). This spatial distribution suggests
that these states act as intermediate “electron bridges,” promoting directional charge transfer toward the vacuum
level. Such hybridization lowers the energy barrier for electron escape
and enhances charge separation, thereby improving the photocatalytic
efficiency. More specifically, the charge density of band-1 is concentrated
near the junction between the Cu2O surface and the 4-BA
molecule, while band-2 exhibits broader delocalization across both
the molecule and part of the surface. The projected band structures
of the Cu2O {100} surface decorated with 4-BA are shown
inFigure S4. Within the energy range of
−0.5 to 1.5 eV, there is no notable contribution from H atoms.
Band-1 is mainly composed of surface Cu and -O atoms, while the C
atom contribution is minor. Similarly, band-2 also originates primarily
from Cu and O atoms, with a small contribution from the C atom and
a slight contribution from the Br atom.Figure S5demonstrates the band structure and band-decomposed charge
density calculation results for 4-FA- and 4-CA-decorated {100} surfaces,
which are similar to those in the 4-BA case. Hence, these two new
molecular-induced bands can be treated as another energy-efficient
pathway for electrons to escape from Cu2O surfaces, thus
optimizing the photocatalytic activity.

Another way to evaluate
photocatalytic activity is a comparison
of the work function, as a smaller work function results in preferable
photocatalytic activity. Work function
is a key parameter influencing the surface electron transfer and photocatalytic
efficiency. While it is commonly associated with hole energetics in
the valence band, its effect on electron mobility is equally critical.
A reduction in the work function lowers the energy barrier for electron
escape, promoting enhanced charge separation and reducing recombination
rates. In our study, the observed decrease in work function upon molecular
decoration correlates with improved photocatalytic activity, supporting
the hypothesis that tuning the work function can be an effective strategy
for optimizing photocatalytic performance.Figuref portrays the planar average electrostatic
potential along the surface normal for the 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {100} surface with a work function of 5.91 eV (i.e., energy difference
between the vacuum level and Fermi level). Compared to the value of
the pristine Cu2O {100} surface, which is 6.88 eV, the
4-BA decorated Cu2O {100} surface displays a considerable
decrease in work function to largely improve the photocatalytic performance.
Although work function and ionization energy are ground-state properties,
their variation reflects the absolute shift of energy levels relative
to the vacuum. Since photocatalysis involves photoexcited electrons
in the conduction band, a reduced work function corresponds to a CBM
closer to the vacuum level, lowering the escape barrier for electrons.
While the CBM position relative to the Fermi level remains nearly
unchanged (Figureb,c), the absolute CBM energy decreases, in line with the work function,
explaining the enhanced photocatalytic activity upon molecular decoration.
The work function values for 4-FA- and 4-CA-decorated Cu2O {100} surfaces are provided inFigure S6, which are 5.99 and 5.94 eV, respectively. Thus, the sequence of
work function follows the pattern: 4-BA < 4-CA < 4-FA, while
the efficiency for photocatalytic activity is opposite: 4-BA >
4-CA
> 4-FA. Besides, we also calculated the average potential of the
4-BA
molecule (orange dashed line inFiguref), which is very close to the vacuum level. The counted
range is from 13.35 to 20.13 Å, which is the same as the length
of the 4-BA molecule. The potential difference between this molecule
level and the vacuum level is 0.31 eV, elucidating that electrons
are easier to transfer out to the vacuum for further radical formation
after reaching the 4-BA molecule. However, it seems that electrons
face a substantial energy barrier to reach the 4-BA molecule, which
can be seen in the plot where the potential range from approximately
13.35 to 15.13 Å exceeds the vacuum level. This phenomenon can
affect the outcome of the photocatalytic activity. A similar situation
can be found for 4-FA- and 4-CA-decorated Cu2O {100} surfaces,
which are presented inFigure S6.

Previous
studies−

,have suggested that the photocatalytic
mechanism of the functionalized Cu2O surfaces follows the
schematic depicted inFigurea. DFT calculations reveal that new molecular decoration with
species such as 4-EA, 2E-6MN, 4-NA, 4-CNA, and 4-TFMA introduces new
molecular-induced electronic states within the band gap. These states
facilitate electron transfer from the Cu2O surface to the
decorating molecules, enabling the decorating molecule to serve as
an intermediary “springboard” for photoinduced electrons
to reach the vacuum level and participate in subsequent photodegradation
reactions under light illumination.

Schematic diagram of two possible photocatalytic
mechanisms.

However, our study proposes a distinct photocatalytic
mechanism,
as illustrated inFigureb. Several compelling pieces of evidence support this revised
mechanism. First, the analysis of the potential beyond the vacuum
level at the interface of the 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {100}
surface (Figuref)
and the exceptionally small BCD value for the 4-BA molecule (0.036e)
indicates that photoinduced electrons face significant difficulty
transferring to the 4-BA molecule. Additionally, band-decomposed charge
density analyses provide further insights. The charge density corresponding
to band-1, which is located higher in energy than band-2 in the band
structure, is distributed primarily around the Cu2O surface
(Figurec,d). This
finding implies that electrons accumulating near the Cu2O {100} surface can reach the vacuum level with a lower energy barrier,
bypassing the need to transfer them to the 4-BA molecule.

Thus,
the proposed mechanism suggests that electrons do not preferentially
reach the vacuum level through the decorating molecule. Instead, for
the 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {100} surface, the 4-BA molecule
facilitates a novel pathway for electrons to escape via the Cu2O surface itself. This alternative mechanism highlights the
critical role of molecular decoration in modifying the electronic
landscape of semiconductors and enabling more efficient photocatalytic
processes.

To elucidate the energy level shifts of the frontier
orbital before
and after molecular decoration,Figureshows a comparative band diagram for Cu2O {100} surfaces, both undecorated and decorated with 4-FA, 4-CA,
and 4-BA. The red and blue bars represent the conduction band and
valence band, respectively. The values of the conduction band minimum
(CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) suggest two important factors
that directly affect the photocatalytic activity, which are ionization
energy and electron affinity. First, ionization energy, defined as
the energy difference between VBM and vacuum level, reflects the difficulty
for electrons to escape from the valence band. Analogous to work function,
a higher ionization energy means fewer electrons can reach the vacuum
level, thereby diminishing photocatalytic activity. The ionization
energy follows the order: 4-FA (5.77 eV) > 4-CA (5.72 eV) >
4-BA (5.69
eV); thus the 4-BA molecule makes a great figure in photocatalytic
performance. In our proposed photocatalytic mechanism, molecular decoration,
particularly with 4-BA, facilitates a novel pathway for electrons
to escape via the Cu2O surface. A lower ionization energy,
as observed with 4-BA decoration (5.69 eV compared to 6.66 eV for
the undecorated surface), indicates a reduced energy barrier for electrons
to reach the vacuum level, enhancing surface electron transfer and
photocatalytic activity. This is consistent with our findings that
the charge density is primarily distributed around the Cu2O surface, enabling electrons to reach the vacuum level without transferring
to the decorating molecule.

4-FA, 4-CA, and 4-BA decoration.Evacstands
for the energy of the vacuum level and is aligned to zero (orange
dashed line). The upper and lower values represent the CBM and VBM,
respectively.

Second, electron affinity, defined as the energy
difference between
the CBM and vacuum level, reflects the energy released when an electron
transitions from the vacuum level back to the Cu2O surface.
A higher electron affinity increases the likelihood of electrons returning
to the surface, resulting in a shorter lifetime in the vacuum level
and reduced photocatalytic activity. The order of the electron affinity
is 4-FA (5.24 eV) > 4-CA (5.19 eV) > 4-BA (5.16 eV), further
highlighting
the advantage of 4-BA in photocatalytic performance due to its lower
electron affinity. Furthermore, a comparison of the Cu2O surface before and after molecular decoration shows significant
reductions in both ionization energy (from 6.66 eV to lower values)
and electron affinity (from 6.12 eV to lower values). These decreases
contribute to improved photocatalytic performance by facilitating
electron ejection and reducing recombination likelihood. The observed
trends underscore the effectiveness of molecular functionalization,
particularly with 4-BA, in optimizing the electronic properties of
Cu2O {100} surfaces for enhanced photocatalytic applications.

Figure S2demonstrates
the binding structures for Cu2O {110} and {111} surfaces
decorated with a 4-FA molecule. The most stable binding sites for
both cases are top sites, and the corresponding binding energies for
4-FA-decorated Cu2O {110} and {111} surfaces are −2.16
and −4.32 eV, respectively. For the 4-BA cases, the binding
energies are −2.16 eV and −4.29 eV for the {110} and
{111} surfaces, respectively. These large chemisorption energies indicate
that both 4-FA and 4-BA bind strongly to the Cu2O surfaces.Figure S7presents the CDD results. The red dashed
line is denoted the same as in the Cu2O {100} case. We
find electron accumulation at the 4-FA molecule and electron depletion
at the Cu2O surface. The integral values of CDD for 4-FA-decorated
{110} and {111} surfaces are 0.872e and 1.275e, respectively. The
smaller value for the {110} surface suggests poor charge separation
after molecular modification, thus strongly affecting the photocatalytic
activity. For the 4-BA-decorated surfaces, the integrated values of
CDD are 0.870e and 1.286e for the {110} and {111} surfaces, respectively,
which are comparable to those of the 4-FA cases. Bader charge difference
shows that the surface Cu atom and the 4-FA molecule both tend to
obtain electrons in the case of the decorated {111} surface, reducing
the amount of electrons reaching the vacuum level, which impedes its
photocatalytic performance. Also,Figure S8provides the band structure of the 4-FA- and 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {110} and {111} surfaces. One 4-FA-induced band exists in
the case of the {110} surface after functionalization (seeFigure S8b), denoted as band-1,
andFigure S8ddisplays the band-decomposed
charge density of band-1, showing the charge localization at the junction
between the Cu2O surface and 4-FA molecule. Similar band
structure and charge density distribution of the molecule-induced
band can be seen for 4-BA cases (Figure S8c,e). On the other hand, no new bands appear in the case of the {111}
surface after decoration, giving rise to poor photocatalytic enhancement.

To evaluate the ability of electrons to reach the vacuum level
and conduct further reactions, work function, electron affinity, and
ionization energy are also calculated.Figures S9 and S10present the planar average potential analysis and
energy band diagram for 4-FA- and 4-BA-decorated Cu2O {110}
and {111} surfaces, respectively. Work functions for 4-FA-decorated
Cu2O {110} and {111} surfaces are 5.72 and 5.32 eV, respectively.
Comparable work function values are shown in 4-BA-decorated surfaces
(Cu2O {110}-4-BA: 5.73 eV, Cu2O {111}-4-BA:
5.35 eV). The work function of the decorated surface remains almost
the same as compared to the pristine surface (Cu2O {110}:
5.71 eV, Cu2O {111}: 5.29 eV) for both the {110} and {111}
surfaces. As for electron affinity and ionization energy, it is apparent
that the CBM and VBM for decorated Cu2O {110} and {111}
surfaces deviate from the pristine Cu2O {110} and {111}
surfaces only by a small margin (seeFigure S10). Therefore, we conclude that the ability for electrons leaving
the Cu2O surface would not differ obviously before and
after molecular decoration, expecting slight photocatalytic activity
improvement.

Photocatalytic
experiments were performed to validate the theoretical calculations.Figurea shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the synthesized Cu2O cubes, confirming that the exposed facets are predominantly {100}.Figureb demonstrates the
results of methyl orange (MO) photodegradation for 4-FA-, 4-CA-, and
4-BA-decorated Cu2O cubes. The results for 4-FA-functionalized
octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra are also presented inFigure S11. The extent of MO photodegradation
largely increases in the case of Cu2O cubes after 4-XA
decoration, while only slight enhancement was noted for Cu2O octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra. Notably, 4-BA-modified cubes
achieve complete MO degradation within 90 min, which aligns well with
our DFT results. The moderate enhancements for Cu2O {110}
and {111} surfaces are also in line with the calculation analysis.
To further investigate the impact of surface functionalization on
the electronic structure, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
was employed. As shown inFigure, the experimental work function of Cu2O
cubes increases from 6.4 to 7.0 eV after 4-XA decoration. While this
appears to contradict the work function predicted by DFT, the discrepancy
can be rationalized by the proposed mechanism, as shown inFigure. Our work function
calculations are based on the local vacuum level near the decorators,
where the interface effects induced by the halogen substituents lower
the local potential barrier, facilitating electron transfer from the
surface to the decorator. In contrast, the UPS signal predominantly
originates from the underlying Cu2O surface and reflects
an average over the illuminated region. The net electron withdrawal
from Cu2O to the molecule, as supported by Bader charge
analysis, results in a more positively charged substrate and, thus,
a higher experimental work function. This behavior is also observed
in RD (Figure S12), whereas octahedra exhibit
a negligible change in work function due to their less favorable molecular
interaction.

cubes, (c) 4-CA-modified cubes, and (d) 4-BA-modified cubes.

After a series of studies for molecular functionalization
based
on Cu2O systems,−

,our study identifies
two crucial factors that significantly influence photocatalytic performance:
the presence of a molecule-induced band and the capability of electrons
to leave the surface. The significant improvement of photocatalytic
activity for the decorated Cu2O {100} surface can be attributed
to the molecule-induced band within the band gap, large charge separation,
decreased value of work function, electron affinity, and ionization
energy. On the other hand, for the Cu2O {110} surface,
although the 4-FA-induced band exists within the band gap, the ability
for electrons escaping from the Cu2O surface during the
photoexcitation process remains nearly the same, which can be explained
by the results of the integral value of CDD and the value of electron
affinity and ionization energy. Thus, the photocatalytic performance
remains almost unchanged in the case of the Cu2O {110}
surface. As for the Cu2O {111} surface, the poor photocatalytic
activity can be attributed to the absence of a molecule-induced band,
charge localization between the Cu2O surface and 4-FA molecule,
and the value of work function, electron affinity, and ionization
energy remaining nearly the same after decoration. UPS spectra further
provide important evidence to the charge transfer, which validates
our proposed mechanism.

In this study, we employed
DFT calculations to investigate the
charge transfer behavior, electronic structure, and energy band diagrams
of Cu2O {100}, {110}, and {111} surfaces modified with
4-BA, 4-CA, and 4-FA molecules. Our findings reveal two distinct photocatalytic
mechanisms governed by the energy barrier for electrons transferring
to the decorating molecules. The calculated results align well with
experimental observations, demonstrating that the 4-XA-decorated Cu2O {100} surface exhibits significant photocatalytic enhancement,
whereas Cu2O {110} and {111} surfaces show only moderate
improvements. UPS results prove the charge transfer behavior on the
Cu2O surface. Additionally, we identified two critical
factors influencing photocatalytic performance: the presence of molecular
states within the band structure and substantial changes in the electron
capability from the surface. These insights provide a robust framework
for the rational design and optimization of high-performance, eco-friendly
photocatalytic systems.

The Vienna Ab initio simulation
package (VASP),was implemented in the first-principles
calculations based on DFT
with the projector augmented wave,method. The
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional
within the generalized-gradient approximations was conducted for the structure optimization, electronic
structure, and the band-decomposed charge density calculations. The
cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set was 460 eV, and the 8 ×
8 × 8 Γ-centeredk-point meshes were utilized
to depict Brillouin zone of the Cu2O primitive cell. The
Cu 3d104s1, O 2s22p4,
H 1s1, C 2s22p2, F 2s22p5, Cl 3s23p5, and Br 4s24p5electrons were treated as valence electrons. Gaussian
smearing was used, and the smearing width was 0.01 eV. The optimized
lattice constant was 4.31 Å, agreeing with the previous studies. On the other hand, for decorating molecules
4-FA, 4-CA, and 4-BA, a 1 × 1 × 1k-point
grid was used. The geometric structure of the Cu2O crystal
and the decorating molecules was relaxed by using the conjugated-gradient
method. We used a 1.0 × 10–5eV energy convergence
criterion for both the Cu2O crystal and the decorating
molecules for electronic relaxation and 1.0 × 10–4eV energy convergence for ionic relaxation.

where ρdecois the charge density of the decorated surface; ρCu2Oand ρ4‑XAare the charge densities
of the pristine Cu2O surface and the 4-XA molecule, respectively.
We also performed the Bader charge difference analysis to quantify
the charge over the decorated Cu2O surface, which is defined
as the Bader charge of the decorated surface minus that of the unmodified
one.,A positive value indicates a tendency of
the atom to acquire electrons. We also present the planar average
charge density difference along the z direction and energy diagram
of different Cu2O surface systems.
