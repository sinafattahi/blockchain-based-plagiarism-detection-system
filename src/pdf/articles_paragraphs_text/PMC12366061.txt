Combined anterior-posterior fixation offers significant advantages in reconstructing spinal stability, correcting kyphotic deformities, and achieving neural decompression. However, osteoporosis increases the surgical risks associated with this technique, and relevant studies remain limited. This study aimed to analyze the biomechanical characteristics of posterior short-segment fixation combined with expandable polyetheretherketone (PEEK) vertebral body replacement (VBR) in osteoporotic spines, with the goal of optimizing surgical strategies and material selection.

Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to evaluate the biomechanical performance of T12 vertebral body replacement. CT images of the T10-L2 segment were imported into Geomagic Warp to construct a digital model. Four fixation models were developed using SolidWorks based on different posterior fixation methods and VBR materials. M1: Intermediate bilateral screws combined with titanium alloy VBR. M2: Intermediate bilateral screws combined with PEEK VBR. M3: Cement-augmented screws spanning the fractured vertebra combined with PEEK VBR. M4: Intermediate bilateral screws and cement-augmented screws combined with PEEK VBR. The models were imported into ANSYS Workbench to evaluate the range of motion (ROM), as well as the maximum von Mises stress and strain in the fixation system and adjacent endplates under four loading conditions (flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation).

① Compared with M1, the ROM values of M2 were higher under all four motion conditions. The largest ROM occurred during left rotation, with values of 0.83° for M1 and 0.86° for M2. The von Mises stress on the VBR and adjacent segment endplates were lower in M2 than in M1, with all values remaining below the material fatigue thresholds. ② Among the M2, M3, and M4, the M4 exhibited the smallest ROM under all four motion conditions, while M2 showed the largest ROM during extension, left bending, and left rotation. However, the ROM differences among these three models did not exceed 0.1°. The internal fixation system in M4 demonstrated the lowest stress and strain values. The maximum von Mises stress on pedicle screws in M3 reached 97.9 MPa during left bending, which was 62.3% higher than that in M4. Nonetheless, the stress and strain levels in all fixation systems remained below the fatigue limits of their respective materials, and the differences in VBR and endplates stress among the three models were all within 5.0%.

This study demonstrates that in osteoporotic finite element models, the biomechanical performance of PEEK VBR is comparable to that of titanium alloy VBR and may be superior in reducing endplate stress and mitigating the risk of implant subsidence. Posterior short-segment fixation combined with PEEK VBR provides sufficient biomechanical stability. Among various configurations, intermediate bilateral screws and cement-augmented screws offer the best biomechanical performance. In contrast, cement-augmented screws spanning the fractured vertebra may increase the risk of screw fatigue failure. Intermediate bilateral screws without cement augmentation may serve as a viable alternative in selected cases.

With the global trend of population aging, the prevalence of osteoporosis is steadily increasing, accompanied by a significant rise in osteoporotic fractures. These fractures have emerged as a major public health concern worldwide. In China alone, the number of osteoporotic fractures is projected to reach approximately 4.83 million by 2035, and over 6 million by 2050 [1]. Among these, osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) impose a particularly heavy burden, with a reported prevalence of up to 50% in individuals over 50 years old [2]. However, due to their frequently asymptomatic nature, the incidence of OVFs is likely underestimated in clinical practice.

Among OVFs, burst fractures account for nearly one-third of thoracolumbar injuries and are associated with high rates of surgical intervention, and long-term disability [3]. According to the Osteoporotic Fracture (OF) classification and modified scoring system proposed by the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma (DGOU), burst fractures with severe structural compromise and vertebral collapse are classified as OF type 4. These cases are typically recommended for posterior fixation, with or without anterior column reconstruction [4]. However, short-segment posterior fixation alone has been associated with relatively high failure rates in the treatment of unstable OVFs [5]. To improve fixation stability, several augmentation strategies have been proposed, including vertebroplasty, intra-vertebral bone grafting, and vertebral body replacement (VBR) [6]. Nevertheless, minimally invasive techniques are not without limitations. Common complications include cement leakage, fragment migration, and incomplete vertebral reduction [7].

VBR has shown distinct advantages in the treatment of complex vertebral fractures, including the ability to restore anterior column support, correct deformities, maintain vertebral reduction, and achieve neural decompression [8]. With the increasing number of patients suffering from traumatic vertebral fractures or those who fail conservative or minimally invasive treatments, in-depth research on VBR has become particularly important. The clinical utilization rate of VBR in osteoporotic patients remains relatively low, at approximately 6% [9]. On the one hand, the procedure is highly invasive and associated with greater surgical risk, making minimally invasive treatments the preferred clinical choice. On the other hand, osteoporosis-related complications, such as screw loosening and implant subsidence, further increase the technical challenges of the surgery. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that advanced age and osteoporosis should not be considered absolute contraindications for anterior column reconstruction. Combined anterior–posterior approaches have been shown to be both safe and effective in this patient population [8,10].

Cement augmentation and increasing the number of pedicle screws are commonly used strategies to enhance screw purchase [11,12]. But extending the fixation segments may restrict physiological spinal mobility and increase the risk of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD). Previous studies have demonstrated that short-segment pedicle screw fixation through the fractured vertebra can provide a favorable balance between construct stability and spinal mobility, while maintaining clinical safety [13–15]. In addition, Zahaf et al. [16–18] emphasized that implant stiffness and material compositioninfluence stress transmission and overall structural response. Therefore, selecting implant materials with an elastic modulus similar to that of native bone is recommended to minimize stress shielding and better preserve physiological biomechanics.

Although titanium alloy VBRs are widely used due to their high mechanical strength, they present certain limitations such as radiographic artifacts and stress concentration on adjacent endplates [19]. In contrast, PEEK VBRs offer several advantages, such as excellent radiolucency, favorable biocompatibility, and intraoperative adjustability. Their elastic modulus is also closer to that of native bone tissue [19]. While PEEK VBRs have demonstrated clinical efficacy in anterior column reconstruction for spinal tumors and trauma in non-osteoporotic patients [20,21], biomechanical evidence supporting their use in osteoporotic conditions remains limited, particularly in combination with varied posterior fixation strategies.

Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the biomechanical performance of a novel expandable PEEK VBR (DePuy Synthes, Switzerland) combined with different short-segment posterior fixation techniques in osteoporotic vertebrae using FEA. This study seeks to provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing fixation strategies and implant material selection in the treatment of OVFs using VBR.

A finite element (FE) model of the intact thoracolumbar spine (T10-L2) was developed based on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images with a slice thickness of 0.625 mm, obtained from a 30-year-old healthy male volunteer using a Siemens CT scanner (Healthineers, Germany). This study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee (672HEBC20241213-K78), and informed consent was obtained from the participant.

The modeling process involved the following steps: First, the CT data were imported into Mimics 21.0 (Materialise, Belgium), where bone structures were extracted using threshold segmentation and region-growing algorithms to generate triangular surface models in STL format. The model surface was then smoothed and repaired in Geomagic Wrap 2021 (3D Systems, USA). Subsequently, the thoracolumbar vertebrae (T10-L2) were reconstructed as solid models in SolidWorks 2017 (Dassault Systèmes, France), As shown in Fig.1. The three-dimensional geometry was then meshed in HyperWorks 10.0 (Altair Engineering, USA), and the final FEA was performed using ANSYS Workbench 21.0 (ANSYS Inc., USA), where material properties, boundary conditions, and contact definitions were applied. This stepwise multi-software modeling process was adopted to leverage the unique strengths of each software in medical image processing, geometric reconstruction, and finite element simulation, thereby ensuring high geometric fidelity, mesh quality, and simulation reliability.

The material assumptions for the model were as follows: cortical and cancellous bone were modeled using 10-node tetrahedral elements (Solid187), with a uniform cortical bone thickness of 1 mm. Both cortical and cancellous bone were assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. The cartilage endplates were set to a thickness of 0.5 mm and modeled with 8-node hexahedral elements (Solid185) to enhance structural continuity. Intervertebral disc was modeled following the protocols of Goel et al. [22] and Byun et al. [23]. The annulus fibrosus matrix was defined as a linear elastic material with an elastic modulus of 4.2 MPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.45. The annulus fibers were embedded at ± 30° orientations and modeled using truss elements, functioning only under tension. Although the nucleus pulposus behaves physiologically as a nearly incompressible fluid-like tissue, it was simplified as a linear elastic material with an elastic modulus of 1.0 MPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.499 to reduce computational complexity. The volume ratio of the nucleus pulposus to the annulus fibrosus was set at 4:6. Both the annulus fibrosus matrix and the nucleus pulposus were meshed using 8-node hexahedral elements (Solid185) to improve mesh quality [24].

The spinal ligamentous system included seven major ligaments: anterior longitudinal, posterior longitudinal, ligamentum flavum, supraspinous, interspinous, intertransverse, and capsular ligaments. These were modeled using 2-node nonlinear spring connector elements, defined as one-dimensional tension-only elements. All material properties were assigned based on published literature. To simulate osteoporotic conditions, the elastic modulus of cancellous bone was reduced by 67%, while that of cortical bone, endplates, and posterior elements was reduced by 33% [25]. Detailed material properties are summarized in Table1.

This study selected T12 vertebra, with a high incidence of OVFs, as the research subject. A subtotal corpectomy model was developed based on the methodology proposed by Sircar et al. [35]. Using SolidWorks 2017 (Dassault Systèmes, France), approximately three-fourths of the anterior T12 vertebral body and the anterior longitudinal ligament were removed, while bilateral pedicles, the posterior longitudinal ligament, and posterior ligamentous complex were preserved. The intervertebral discs at T11/T12 and T12/L1 were resected, while the bony endplates of T11 and L1 were retained to simulate the intraoperative procedure. The internal fixation system was also modeled in SolidWorks and imported, using 8-node hexahedral elements (Solid185).

The posterior instrumentation system was designed with reference to previous studies [36]. Pedicle screws (diameter: 6.0 mm; length: 45 mm) were inserted into T11 and L1, and shorter screws (diameter: 6.0 mm; length: 25 mm) were placed into T12 pedicles. Connecting rods with a diameter of 5.5 mm were used to complete the posterior fixation. As shown in Fig.2A. The VBR device adopted in this study was an expandable type made of PEEK, with its structural design illustrated in Fig.2B. Both the superior and inferior surfaces of the implant featured sloped designs to optimize the angle of contact with the endplates—measuring 6.5 mm anteriorly and 2.0 mm posteriorly on the top surface, and 8.5 mm anteriorly and 2.5 mm posteriorly on the bottom surface. The superior and inferior endplates of the implant were elliptical (30 mm × 26 mm), and the central body of the implant was a cylindrical structure with a diameter of 18 mm. The VBR was centrally placed on the endplate, with full contact between its upper and lower surfaces and the corresponding endplates. The contact area accounted for approximately 64.01% of the total endplate surface, as shown in Fig.2C. The implant was height-adjustable to accommodate individual anatomical variations during surgery. To eliminate structural bias, the expandable titanium alloy VBR with identical geometry was modeled, differing only in material properties, allowing for direct comparison of the biomechanical performance between PEEK and titanium alloy.

Previous studies have demonstrated that bone cement distributed in a cylindrical shape provides better holding strength and torsional resistance than a spherical shape when injected at the same volume [37]. Guo et al. [38] also reported that unilateral cement volumes ranging from 1.5 mL to 2.5 mL have no significant impact on adjacent segment degeneration. Since the variables in this study were internal fixation methods and implant materials, the morphology and distribution of bone cement were standardized to an ideal condition to minimize confounding effects. Specifically, a cylindrical bone cement distribution of 1.5 mL per side was applied, uniformly filling the anterior two-thirds of screw length to ensure consistency across all models.

After completing the modeling of all components, the internal fixation assemblies were constructed, and four finite element models were established. M1: Intermediate bilateral screws combined with titanium alloy VBR. M2: Intermediate bilateral screws combined with PEEK VBR. M3: Cement augmented screws spanning the fractured vertebra combined with PEEK VBR. M4: Intermediate bilateral screws and cement augmented screws combined with PEEK VBR. As shown in Fig.3.

Considering the reduced pullout strength of pedicle screws in osteoporotic vertebrae, a sliding contact interface was defined between the pedicle screws and the surrounding vertebral bone, with a friction coefficient of 0.8 [39]. Meanwhile, a bonded condition was applied between the pedicle screws and the connecting rods to simulate rigid fixation. Similarly, the interfaces between pedicle screws and bone cement, as well as between the bone cement and cancellous bone, were also modeled as fully bonded to ensure construct stability. The interface between the VBR device and the adjacent superior and inferior endplates was defined as a frictional contact with a friction coefficient of 0.8 [40].

All nodes on the inferior endplate of the L2 vertebral body were fully constrained by fixing all six degrees of freedom, simulating its immobilization in the experimental setup. The loading conditions were set in accordance with the standardized boundary protocols proposed by Schmidt et al. [31] for spinal biomechanical studies. Although the finite element model was reconstructed from actual CT data, to ensure comparability with previously published studies [30,41], a vertical axial load of 400 N and a pure moment of ± 7.5 N·m were applied to the superior endplate and facet joint surfaces of the T10 vertebra. This loading scheme was used to simulate mechanical responses under four motion conditions: flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, as illustrated in Fig.4.

For each model, the ROM of the T11-L1 segment was analyzed under flexion, extension, left bending, and left rotation. Additionally, the maximum von Mises stress and strain of the internal fixation system, as well as the T11 inferior endplate and L1 superior endplate, were evaluated.

A mesh convergence analysis was performed on the complete T10-L2 spinal model. Four mesh schemes were generated using element sizes of 1.0 mm (4463411 nodes, 2895351 elements), 1.5 mm (1546287 nodes, 944941 elements), 2.0 mm (785612 nodes, 460036 elements), and 3.0 mm (233400 nodes, 136600 elements). All models were constrained at the inferior surface of L2 in all six degrees of freedom, and a vertical load of 50 N was applied to the superior surface of T10. The maximum von Mises stress in the cortical bone was calculated for each mesh to evaluate stress convergence and determine the optimal mesh density.

As summarized in Table2, the corresponding computation times for the four mesh schemes were approximately 122, 87, 45, and 28 min, respectively. The difference in maximum von Mises stress between the 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm models was less than 5.0%, indicating good convergence [42]. Although the 1.0 mm mesh provided the highest accurate results, it involved more than 2.8 million, resulting in significantly increased computational cost. The 3.0 mm mesh, on the other hand, introduced larger deviations. Therefore, considering both computational efficiency and accuracy, the 2.0 mm mesh density was selected for the final simulations. In addition, to improve the reliability of the simulation data, we applied local mesh refinement in the endplates, screw-bone interfaces, and implant contact regions, reducing the element size in these regions to below 2.0 mm.

After applying a ± 7.5 N·m torque load, the ROM of the T10-L2 intact spinal model under different conditions was assessed. The angular displacements under six loading modes—flexion, extension, left bending, right bending, left rotation, and right rotation were 4.61°, 4.13°, 3.99°, 3.47°, 1.70°, and 1.89°, respectively. According to the validation strategy mentioned by Keddar et al. [43], these values closely align with previously published finite element and cadaveric biomechanical studies conducted under comparable boundary and loading conditions [44–46]. All data in this study fall within the statistical range (mean ± standard deviation) of the referenced studies, and the deviations for flexion, extension, and lateral bending were all less than 10.0%, demonstrating the biomechanical validity of the finite element model, as shown in Fig.5.

A comparison between M1 and M2 revealed that the ROM of M1 in flexion, extension, left bending, and left rotation (0.44°, 0.23°, 0.62°, and 0.83°, respectively) was reduced by 2.7%, 10.4%, 0.2%, and 2.9% compared to M2. Among the M2, M3, and M4 models, M4 exhibited the smallest ROM across all four motion directions, measuring 0.43° in flexion, 0.18° in extension, 0.56° in left bending, and 0.78° in left rotation. In contrast, M3 demonstrated the highest ROM during flexion (0.46°), while M2 exhibited the largest ROM in extension (0.25°), left bending (0.62°), and left rotation (0.86°). However, the ROM differences among these three models were all within 0.1°, indicating similar segmental stability. Detailed results are presented in Fig.6.

As shown in Fig.7, stress concentrations in the pedicle screw-rod system were primarily located at the screw-pedicle interface and the screw-rod junction, suggesting a higher risk of microfracture and screw loosening in these regions.

When comparing M1 and M2, the pedicle screws and rods in M1 exhibited lower von Mises stress values across all four motion directions (pedicle screws: 57.8 MPa, 85.1 MPa, 80.4 MPa, 70.7 MPa; rods: 39.2 MPa, 104.1 MPa, 129.5 MPa, 99.0 MPa), with differences ranging from 0.6 to 12.9% compared to M2. However, M1 showed higher stress on the VBR itself in flexion, extension, left bending, and left rotation (29.6 MPa, 29.2 MPa, 29.3 MPa, and 27.3 MPa, respectively), representing increases of 8.6%, 13.5%, 6.8%, and 6.7% over M2. These findings suggest that the titanium alloy VBR bore a greater portion of the anterior column load, thereby reducing stress transmission to the posterior pedicle screw-rod system.

Among the M2, M3, and M4 models, the greatest differences in fixation system stress were observed in the pedicle screws. M4 demonstrated the lowest pedicle screw stress values in all four motion states (57.7 MPa, 69.1 MPa, 66.4 MPa, and 64.1 MPa, respectively). In contrast, M3 exhibited the highest screw stresses, which were 62.3%, 33.1%, 47.5%, and 50.2% higher than those in M4. M2 also showed moderately increased screw stress, with respective increases of 0.8%, 24.6%, 23.4%, and 12.8% compared to M4. For the connecting rods, M4 again exhibited the lowest von Mises stress values (37.4 MPa, 102.3 MPa, 127.5 MPa, and 94.9 MPa, respectively). M3 presented the highest rod stress during flexion (46.8 MPa, + 25.2%), while M2 exhibited the highest stress during extension (106.4 MPa), left bending (134.8 MPa), and left rotation (101.9 MPa), with increases of 4.0%, 5.7%, and 7.3% compared to M4. These results indicate that intermediate screw placement can effectively redistribute and reduce the stress on screws. The stress differences among the three VBR implants were small, with M4 showing the lowest values and M2 the highest. Notably, the maximum intergroup variation in VBR stress did not exceed 5.0%.

Since the von Mises criterion is based on distortion energy theory, it provides an effective means to evaluate the yield behavior of ductile materials under multiaxial loading. According to the fatigue safety evaluation method mentioned by Mestar et al. [47], the maximum von Mises stress observed in all models remained well below the fatigue limit of Ti-6Al-4 V (310–610 MPa) [48], and the PEEK VBRs exhibited maximum stress values within the material’s fatigue strength range (70–100 MPa) [49]. These results suggest that the internal fixation systems in all models maintain good mechanical stability under the given loading conditions. Detailed data are presented in Fig.8.

Figure note: The left, middle, and right panels represent the pedicle screws, connecting rods, and VBR implants, respectively.

Similarly, the distribution pattern of the von Mises strain in the internal fixation system across the four models was consistent with that of the von Mises stress. The maximum von Mises strain was primarily concentrated at the screw-pedicle interface and the screw-rod junction. The maximum von Mises strain values of the pedicle screws in the four models were 775.1 µε, 784.2 µε, 972.6 µε, and 711.5 µε, respectively. For the connecting rods, the maximum von Mises strain values were 1180.7 µε, 1229.0 µε, 1184.9 µε, and 1162.7 µε, respectively. The corresponding maximum von Mises of the VBRs were 279.7 µε, 1554.7 µε, 1546.3 µε, and 1521.2 µε, respectively.

Notably, the VBR in the M1 exhibited lower strain than in the other models, which can be attributed to the higher stiffness of the titanium alloy. This finding supports the notion that PEEK implants, due to their lower elastic modulus, are more prone to compression and deformation under loading compared to titanium alloy. However, all measured strain values across all models remained well below the reported fatigue strain limits of Ti-6Al-4 V (5000–6000 µε) [50] and PEEK (8000–12000 µε) [51]. These results confirm that all components of the internal fixation system operated within the elastic range under the simulated physiological loads, demonstrating satisfactory mechanical safety. Detailed results are illustrated in Figs.9and10.

Figure note: The left, middle, and right panels represent the the pedicle screws, connecting rods, and VBR implants, respectively.

When comparing M1 and M2, the maximum von Mises stress on the T11 inferior endplate in M1 during flexion (15.1 MPa), extension (9.5 MPa), left bending (15.9 MPa), and left rotation (11.8 MPa) was higher, increasing by 1.1%, 5.6%, 0.3%, and 4.6%, respectively, compared to M2. Similarly, the maximum von Mises stress on the L1 superior endplate in M1 was also greater than that in M2, with increases of 3.2%, 4.7%, 4.6%, and 1.9% under the corresponding loading conditions.

Further comparisons among M2, M3, and M4 revealed that the M4 exhibited the lowest endplate stress in all four motion directions. The maximum von Mises stress on the T11 inferior endplate in M4 was 15.0 MPa, 8.9 MPa, 15.8 MPa, and 11.3 MPa, and on the L1 superior endplate was 13.7 MPa, 5.4 MPa, 13.9 MPa, and 10.0 MPa, under flexion, extension, left bending, and left rotation, respectively. In contrast, M3 showed the highest von Mises stress on both the T11 inferior and L1 superior endplates, but the differences compared to M4 did not exceed 4.7%, indicating similar stress distribution patterns across the three models. Detailed data are presented in Fig.11.

Figure note: The left side represents the T11 inferior endplate, while the right side represents the L1 superior endplate.

High strain regions were primarily concentrated at the outer edge of the contact surface between the VBRs and the endplates for both adjacent vertebrae, especially during left bending. The maximum von Mises strain on the T11 inferior endplate in the four models were 2450.5 µε, 2444.2 µε, 2446.2 µε, and 2432.9 µε, respectively, while those on the L1 superior endplate were 2215.2 µε, 2120.2 µε, 2121.1 µε, and 2116.1 µε, respectively. The strain induced by the titanium alloy VBR on the endplates was higher than that of PEEK VBR, but all values were below the vertebral fatigue strain threshold (7000 µε ± 600 µε) reported by Morgan and Keaveny [52]. These findings suggest that the endplate-level mechanical safety of all implant configurations remained within acceptable limits under the applied loading conditions. As shown in Fig.12.

OVFs are among the most common spinal injuries in the elderly population. In patients with severely compromised spinal stability—particularly those with intervertebral disc, neurological injury, or progressive kyphotic deformity—anterior column reconstruction is considered essential to achieve long-term structural support [53,54]. However, the decreased bone quality associated with osteoporosis poses significant biomechanical challenges, increasing the risk of complications such as screw loosening, hardware failure, and VBR subsidence. These risks are closely influenced by both implant design and the mechanical properties of the materials used.

Currently, expandable titanium alloy VBRs are widely used due to their high mechanical strength and reliable structural support. Adler et al. [55] demonstrated that in non-osteoporotic spines, both PEEK and titanium alloy VBRs provide comparable stability under various loading conditions. However, biomechanical results derived from non-osteoporotic models may not be directly translatable to osteoporotic conditions. Sircar et al. [35] subsequently confirmed the torsional strength of titanium alloy VBRs in osteoporotic cadaveric specimens, validating their effectiveness in anterior column reconstruction. Nevertheless, biomechanical evidence on the performance of PEEK VBRs in osteoporotic vertebrae remains scarce. Therefore, the present study employed a FE model to systematically compare the biomechanical behavior of expandable PEEK VBRs combined with various short-segment posterior fixation techniques in osteoporotic spines.

Our results demonstrated that M1 (titanium alloy VBR) exhibited lower ROM values compared to M2 (PEEK VBR) under all four motion conditions. However, the differences in flexion, left bending, and left rotation were all within 3.0%. This suggests that both materials provide comparable segmental stability. In addition, the maximum von Mises stress and strain observed in all internal fixation components remained well below their respective fatigue thresholds, supporting the mechanical feasibility of both titanium alloy and PEEK VBRs for anterior column reconstruction in osteoporotic spines. Notably, M1 showed higher von Mises stress values in both the VBR and the adjacent endplates. Meanwhile, the strain within the titanium alloy VBR was lower than that in the PEEK VBR. These findings reflect the higher stiffness and reduced deformability of titanium alloy. This allows greater anterior load-bearing, but may also lead to localized stress concentration and potential stress shielding, consistent with the findings of Pokorni et al. [56]. Therefore, PEEK VBR may provide a more favorable stress distribution profile. This may help reduce the risk of endplate damage and implant subsidence.

In addition to VBR material selection, the posterior fixation method also plays a critical role in determining surgical outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated that long pedicle screws inserted through the fractured vertebra can provide stability comparable to that of traditional long-segment fixation [57]. Nevertheless, whether short pedicle screws inserted through the fractured vertebra offer similar clinical benefits in combined anterior-posterior fixation remains unclear. The present study further revealed that the ROM in M2, M3, and M4 was lower than that of the intact spine in all four motion directions. Among them, M4 showed the smallest ROM across all motions. However, the maximum difference among the three models was less than 0.1°, indicating that all three fixation strategies provided comparable and satisfactory primary stability. This result likely reflects the strong anterior support offered by the VBR. It may also help explain why posterior short-segment fixation alone is prone to failure over time in severe osteoporotic fractures classified as OF type 4 [58].

Stress and strain were primarily concentrated at the screw-pedicle interface and the screw-rod junction across all models. These areas are well known to be prone to fatigue failure and loosening. In all three models (M2, M3, and M4), the maximum von Mises stress and strain values in the screw-rod system remained below the fatigue threshold of Ti-6Al-4 V. Additionally, all corresponding safety factors exceeded 2.0, indicating favorable fatigue resistance and mechanical stability of the constructs [59]. However, differences in stress magnitude were observed among the fixation configurations, particularly in the maximum stress of pedicle screws. M3 showed the highest pedicle screw stress under all loading conditions, exceeding those of M4 by 33.1–62.3%. These results suggest that inserting intermediate short screws through the fractured vertebra (as in M4) can effectively reduce stress concentration and enhance the long-term stability. This finding is consistent with previous research showing that short-segment fixation through the fractured vertebra significantly improves axial load-bearing capacity while preserving spinal mobility [60,61]. Therefore, for patients with severely compressed or burst OVFs, we recommend the use of additional intermediate pedicle screws at the fracture level to optimize mechanical performance.

For the VBR, the posterior fixation system bore the most of the load, resulting in relatively low stress on the VBR itself. Although the maximum von Mises stress of the VBR in M2 was higher than that in M3 and M4, the increase did not exceed 5.0%. Furthermore, the maximum von Mises stress under all four motion conditions ranged from 25.7 MPa to 27.5 MPa, which remains well below the reported fatigue strength of PEEK materials [49]. Similarly, although PEEK is more prone to deformation than titanium, the observed strain remained within the elastic range, indicating a low risk of fatigue failure in the VBR. These findings further support the notion that reinforced posterior fixation can reduce the mechanical burden on anterior implants, thereby potentially improving implant longevity.

Moreover, given the increased fragility of endplate structures in osteoporotic vertebrae, stress and strain distribution at adjacent endplates becomes a critical determinant for surgical success. In this study, the maximum von Mises stress and strain were primarily concentrated at the outer edge of the contact surface between the VBRs and the endplates for both adjacent vertebrae, particularly under flexion and left bending. Among the three models, M3 exhibited the highest endplate stress and strain, while M4 showed the lowest. However, all values remained below the fatigue limit of cortical bone, and the maximum intergroup variation was less than 5.0%. This outcome may be attributed to the lower elastic modulus of PEEK, which facilitates more uniform load transfer at the bone-implant interface. Additionally, all three fixation configurations provided comparable structural support, suggesting similar protective effects against ASD. Nonetheless, preserving the structural integrity of adjacent endplates during surgery remains essential for optimizing long-term outcomes.

This study has several limitations. (1) In osteoporotic patients, notable alterations in bone geometry are often present, which may affect implant load transmission and interface stress distribution. Future studies are planned to incorporate CT data from elderly or osteoporotic individuals to enhance the anatomical fidelity of the model. (2) The analysis was based on a single spinal geometry and one set of material parameters, which may not capture the variability among different patients. The use of a single model also limits the ability to perform statistical testing. Nonetheless, intergroup comparisons offer valuable insights into relative biomechanical trends. (3) The model did not include spinal muscles, and differences in modeling methods, material properties, and loading conditions may lead to variations in results. (4) The analysis was based on static loading and did not account for long-term biomechanical adaptation or cumulative fatigue effects during dynamic motion. Previous studies have demonstrated that dynamic or fatigue loading is more sensitive to material properties than static loading [62–64]. Such conditions may alter the natural frequency of the system and increase the risk of damage under vertical vibration. Furthermore, dynamic analysis overcomes the basic assumption of uniform stress distribution within the annulus fibrosus. The resulting element-level damage predictions provide insights into the initiation site and progression pattern of annular fatigue failure, enabling the simulation of long-term load exposure scenarios. Future work should integrate time-dependent cumulative loading effects during motion to better understand the risk of progressive, fatigue-induced damage over time. (5) Cadaveric validation may be needed. (6) The expandable VBR was used in this study and modeled as a fully integrated structure. However, the potential loosening of the locking system was not considered, which may differ from actual clinical behavior. In practice, multi-component implants can lead to changes in contact conditions and local stress concentration. Future work will incorporate more detailed VBR models with higher structural fidelity. (7) The annulus fibrosus was modeled as a single layer to simplify the analysis. However, multi-layer structures better capture fiber orientation and shear behavior. Future studies will incorporate layered models to improve load response accuracy in adjacent segments. (8) The current model has limited mesh resolution at the endplates and screw regions, and the contact settings may affect local stress distribution. Future work will aim to improve the accuracy of mechanical predictions. (9) This is a single-center study, and repetition of the experiments elsewhere would be desirable, although it seems unlikely that others would want to replicate the complex experiments of this study.

This study developed an osteoporotic vertebra FE model to evaluate the biomechanical performance of short-segment pedicle screw fixation combined with an expandable PEEK VBR. Under various loading conditions, we analyzed the ROM, maximum von Mises stress and strain of the fixation system and adjacent endplates.

The results demonstrated that expandable PEEK VBRs provided biomechanical stability comparable to that of titanium alloy VBRs, with improved resistance to implant subsidence. Posterior short-segment fixation combined with expandable PEEK VBRs achieved satisfactory overall stability, and the stress and strain values in both the internal fixation system and adjacent endplates remained well below the respective fatigue limits, indicating mechanical safety and clinical feasibility in osteoporotic patients.

Among the fixation strategies evaluated, intermediate bilateral pedicle screws combined with bone cement augmentation proved most effective in enhancing screw purchase and reducing internal fixation stress and strain, thereby representing the optimal choice. In contrast, cement-augmented screws spanning the fractured vertebra markedly increased the risk of screw fracture and should be used with caution. Intermediate bilateral screws without cement augmentation may serve as a viable alternative in selected cases. The knowledge gained from study of this model might be useful in the management of OVFs.
