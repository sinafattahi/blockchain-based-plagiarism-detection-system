Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare in the esophagus, accounting for less than 2% of all cases1. While treatment approaches remain under discussion, submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection has shown favorable outcomes2. However, in the narrow submucosal space, locating the tumor without exposing its surface can be difficult, increasing the risk of capsule injury and tumor seeding. Here, we report a successful case of GIST resection using direct muscle layer incision without creating a submucosal tunnel.

A 56-year-old woman with no medical history was referred for treatment of a <3-cm mid-esophageal GIST (Fig. 1). Endoscopic full-thickness resection (Video 1) was planned using a GIF-H290T endoscope (Olympus) with a distal attachment (Space Adjuster; TOP)3, a Triangle Tip Knife J (TTJ; Olympus), and an electrosurgical unit (VIO3; ERBE, Endocut I mode: 1–3-3). After marking and submucosal injection, a mucosal incision was made to expose the muscle layer. Direct muscle dissection was then performed without tunneling (Fig. 2a–d), enabling full-thickness resection along the tumor margin. Connective tissue between the esophageal adventitia and pericardium was meticulously detached. The tumor was then inverted into the lumen and removed en bloc (Fig. 3a–d). The large defect, with the pericardium clearly visible, was initially approximated using the Loop-9 technique4, followed by complete closure with anchor-pronged clips (MANTIS; Boston Scientific). Resection was completed without capsule injury (Fig. 4a–d).

The distal knot is grasped using biopsy forceps inserted through the outer sheath. By simultaneously pulling the forceps and advancing the sheath, the loop is tightened. During this maneuver, the pledget functions as an anchor to facilitate closure.bFollowing the Loop-9 technique, defect closure is primarily achieved using anchor-pronged clips (MANTIS; Boston Scientific).cA total of six anchor-pronged clips (MANTIS; Boston Scientific) and three hemoclips (SureClip; Micro-Tech) are used to achieve complete closure of the defect.dEn bloc resection of the gastrointestinal stromal tumor is completed without capsule injury.

The postoperative course was uneventful. Follow-up endoscopy on postoperative day 1 revealed no stricture or wound dehiscence (Fig. 5). The patient resumed a regular diet and was discharged on postoperative day four as planned.

Compared to leiomyomas, GISTs are more fragile and prone to fragmentation. Therefore, direct muscle layer incision without creating a submucosal tunnel may offer an effective approach to facilitate en bloc resection while minimizing the risk of tumor fragmentation.
