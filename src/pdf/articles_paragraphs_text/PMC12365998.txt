Cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the most common clinical endpoints of many cardiovascular diseases and is characterized by a markedly poor prognosis both in-hospital and out of hospital [1]. Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been shown to impact cardiovascular disease risk [2], and this effect is not completely explained by traditional cardiac risk factors alone [3]. This suggests a potential modifying effect of autoimmune diseases on cardiovascular function and pathology. Despite this established link, whether and how SLE and RA affect cardiac arrest outcomes remains unexplored.

Here, we utilized the National Inpatient Sample dataset [4], for the years 2016 to 2020 to investigate the potential relationship between SLE or RA diagnosis and cardiac arrest outcomes. We first extracted data for 1,099,235 hospitalizations representing adult patients (18 years old and above) diagnosed with cardiac arrest (CA ICD-10: I46). We then grouped these into four patient groups: those diagnosed with SLE but not RA (SLE ICD-10: M32,n= 5745); those diagnosed with RA but not SLE (RA ICD-10: M06.9,n= 16,920), those diagnosed with both SLE and RA (n= 895), and those diagnosed with neither SLE nor RA. We conducted the analysis using STATA (version 18 SE) and statistical associations we assessed using multivariate logistic and linear regression, for categorical and continuous outcome variables, respectively. A p-value of < 0.01 was considered to indicate statistical significance. The comorbidities, demographic factors, and hospital factors controlled for are listed in Table1. The primary outcome studied was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes are outlined in Table2. This study was exempt from requiring IRB approval because of the de-identified nature of the data used.

Notably, SLE patients were significantly younger than RA patients (mean age for RA: 70.5 years, mean age for SLE: 54.4 years). We also observed several significant differences in the distribution of various demographic factors and comorbidities across patient groups being studied, and these have been summarized in Table1.

Compared to CA patients without SLE, CA patients with SLE had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (AOR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.26–1.64, p: <0.001) (Table2) (Fig.1). On the other hand, the effect of RA on in-hospital mortality did not reach statistical significance (AOR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01–1.18, p: <0.023). Notably, patients with both RA and SLE had an even more pronounced mortality effect (AOR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.20–2.33, p: <0.001). No other CA outcome showed a significant relationship with SLE or RA diagnosis, except for ventricular arrhythmia, which had a lower likelihood of occurrence among patients with RA (OR: 0.87, p: 0.005) compared to those without RA (Table2).

Finally, we questioned whether the in-hospital mortality effect of SLE among CA patients could be explained by the general mortality of SLE in the broader adult population. To answer this, we investigated the independent and combined mortality effects of SLE and CA in the general adult inpatient population. Expectedly, patients with CA alone were approximately 60 times more likely to experience in-hospital death than non-CA patients were (OR: 60.08, 95% CI: 59.0–60.2,p< 0.001). In contrast, patients with SLE alone were less likely to experience in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.86–0.94,p< 0.001) than non-SLE patients were. However, patients with both SLE and CA had twice the likelihood of in-hospital death (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.74–2.50, p: <0.001) than CA patients without SLE did. Notably, these results were obtained after adjustment for comorbidities and hospital factors, and the study population includes all cardiac-arrest hospitalizations, irrespective of location of arrest. Together, we find that SLE, but not RA, independently increases the risk of in-hospital mortality among CA patients.

Few studies have investigated how cardiovascular outcomes are impacted by autoimmune diseases. A study by Yafasova and colleagues revealed a greater risk of all-cause mortality as well as various cardiac outcomes among SLE patients compared to a matched population without SLE [5]. In that study, SLE patients were approximately 1.5 times more likely to experience all-cause mortality compared to control patients [5], aligning with our findings here. While both SLE and RA carry an elevated cardiovascular risk, SLE is characterized by more widespread systemic and more myocardial involvement than RA [2], which may explain our observed SLE effect on CA mortality.

To conclude, our study reports a novel adverse interaction between SLE and CA that doubles in-hospital mortality in CA patients who also have SLE, compared to CA patients without SLE. We anticipate that this finding will influence treatment considerations for such comorbid patients and inspire broader research into the effect of other autoimmune diseases on CA outcomes and other cardiac diseases. Further studies are also necessary to understand the potential physiological mechanisms that underlie this adverse clinical interaction.
