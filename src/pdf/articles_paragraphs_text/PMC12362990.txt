Prediabetes is a reversible condition, and timely interventions can prevent long-term complications. Family support is crucial in managing this condition. This study evaluated the impact of a family health nurse (FHN) model for blood sugar control in middle-aged prediabetic individuals.

This study adheres to the CONSORT 2010 statement guidelines. This study is a clinical trial involving 72 prediabetic middle-aged individuals from health service centers in Isfahan in 2023. The participants were selected through convenience sampling on the basis of the inclusion criteria and randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. Data collection included a glucose meter, a calibrated scale, a demographic information form, and blood tests for HbA1c and fasting blood sugar (FBS). 15 training sessions based on the FHN model were conducted for the intervention group. Assessments were conducted before the intervention and three months later. The data were analyzed via SPSSv26with descriptive and inferential statistics.

The research findings indicated no significant difference in FBS or HbA1c levels between the two groups before the FHN model was implemented (P> 0.05). However, significant differences were observed immediately after the intervention and three months after the intervention (P< 0.001). Results showed that the mean hemoglobin A1c score in the intervention group decreased from 5.41 mmol/L before the intervention to 5.27 mmol/L three months later (p value < 0.05). In the control group, the mean score increased from 5.88 mmol/L to 6.05 mmol/L, but this change was not statistically significant (p value > 0.05). These results highlight the potential of the family health nurse model to improve blood sugar control in prediabetic individuals.

This study indicates that a family-centered intervention using the FHN model can effectively enhance healthy lifestyle behaviors and blood sugar levels in prediabetic patients. These findings suggest that the model may be helpful for researchers and health practitioners, and we recommend its evaluation and implementation in broader communities.

Prediabetes is a reversible condition in which blood glucose levels are elevated but not high enough to be classified as diabetes (fasting glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL, and the glucose tolerance test results range from 140 to 199 mg/dL) [1] Timely management during this critical period can help avoid long-term complications [2]. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 541 million adults worldwide are affected by impaired glucose tolerance [3]. Research indicates that the prevalence of prediabetes is approximately 25.4–25.8% in iran [4,5] Those with prediabetes face a heightened risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, making them key candidates for prevention programs [6–8]. Several factors contribute to the onset of prediabetes, such as age, obesity, low education, lifestyle choices, and family history [9–14].

Chronic illness in one family member impacts the entire family, forcing them to manage the disease while balancing their own needs [15]. The role of behavioral and social factors in managing prediabetes is significant, as pharmacological interventions are not initiated at this stage. Educating and counseling patients and families can help modify these factors, underscoring the need for family-centered interventions [16]. The concept of family health nursing emerged from the Vienna Nursing Conference in 1988 but was introduced as a new role by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998 [17]. The FHN model emphasizes the family as the primary unit in patient care and includes key strategies such as addressing health needs and empowering family health [17]. In a study conducted by Keshvari et al. (2011) titled “Explaining the Process of Providing Health Services to Families Covered by Rural Health Centers in Isfahan: Designing an Appropriate Model for Providing Family Health Care,” a localization of the FHN model was achieved by combining the WHO and Denham’s models.

Providing services on the basis of the actual health needs of families.

Strengthening and supporting robust referral networks among different levels of service providers.

Reforming human resource structures to enhance coordination and appropriate intersectoral convergence.

Addressing needs and improving the environment and human resources in centers to enhance service quality and job satisfaction [18].

In this study we used the first to third strategy. The other two strategies were excluded from the present study due to the inability to implement the measures in the present study and the necessity of making macro-level decisions and changes in policies.

Studies have shown that people with chronic diseases, including diabetes and prediabetes, seek help from family members to manage their disease and receive emotional support [19] and seek information from family members [20]. Integrating family and friends into diabetes treatment plans can reduces HbA1c [21].

Although the role of families in diabetes care is well recognized, the localized Family Health Nurse (FHN) model by Keshvari et al. has not been previously evaluated in Iran, this study was conducted with the aim of examining “The Effect of a Family Health Nurse Model on Blood Sugar Control in Prediabetics Middle-Aged”. The results of this study, by examining the role of the family health nurse in diabetes prevention, can be effective in decision-making and programs related to health promotion and can be utilized accordingly.

This study adheres to the CONSORT 2010 statement guidelines. This is a single blinded (for participants) multi-center randomized clinical trial involved two groups(case (center A) and control (center B)).

The participants were middle-aged individuals with prediabetes seeking care at comprehensive health care centers in isfahan. The required sample size for this study was calculated to be 66 individuals, using a 95% confidence level, 80% test power, and an effect size of 0.18 [18]. After accounting for a 10% dropout rate, the final sample size was 72, with 36 participants in both the intervention and control groups.

The researcher received written permission and ethics approval from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. With the help of the research team, Center A was chosen as the intervention center, and Center B was selected for control after consulting with provincial health authorities. The researcher visited both centers to introduce the study and obtain consent from the managers. The “SIB1” system was implemented for all data registration and reporting. Systematic random sampling was used to compile a list of eligible individuals.

Have an active care record in the center’s Sib system.

Confirm prediabetes through a fasting blood sugar test and registration by a physician in the Sib system.

Have the desire and informed consent to participate in the study.

Failure to complete the questionnaires or incomplete completion of them.

Absence of diseases such as iron deficiency, anemia, etc. that can affect the level of HbA1c.

The study population was divided by the required number of subjects to determine K, and a random number less than ten, referred to as N, was generated. The subjects were then selected via the sequence N, N + K,N+ 2 K, and so on until the necessary number was reached. Sampling continued until 36 participants were recruited at each center. Upon arrival, the participants received an explanation of the research methods and signed a written consent form. The researcher implemented the intervention in the intervention group on the basis of a localized FHN model, focusing on three strategies.

After receiving test results, home visits were scheduled via phone to discuss participation. The participants were contacted the day before each visit to ensure that all family members, particularly health decision-makers, could attend. A total of 56 home visits were conducted. The researchers arrived at the home and introduced themselves to the family. They explained the research’s purpose and the importance of individual and family participation for trust-building. To familiarize themselves with the family, they created a genogram, a graphical representation of the family tree, with input from the members. They assessed family routines and developed an eco-map, illustrating the systems in the patient’s life, with the help of an FHA. Together, they identified and prioritized the patient’s issues. On the basis of the nursing diagnoses, care plans were created with family involvement, and referrals were made to a patient care center. Each home visit lasted between 45 min and one hour. Each family received between 1 and 2 sessions, with additional home visits arranged as needed on the basis of their cultural background and socioeconomic status. At the end of each meeting, key points were summarized, family strengths were highlighted, and the family’s next visit was made.

After the sessions, the researcher aimed to follow up with the participants to increase their self-esteem and facilitate experience sharing through self-care groups. The sessions aimed to foster positive relationships, empathy, and emotional support through sharing experiences and coping strategies. Members discussed what they learned in each session with their peers to increase their self-esteem, and light refreshments were provided. A WhatsApp group was also created to ask questions and share information.

Three months after the intervention, the participants returned to the center for fasting blood tests, and their demographic information was updated. As a token of appreciation for their participation, they received gifts, including reminder boxes and educational booklets.

One family member from each household was chosen as a FHA. A FHA is a member of the patient’s family who is literate and willing to participate in meetings and accept responsibility for the family’s health. The Family Health Ambassador played an active role in all stages of this study.

The center director referred health-related needs to the relevant units (nutrition unit, doctor, psychologist, etc.) and non-health-related issues, such as financial issues, to external units and ensured their follow-up.

They provided demographic information, including age, gender, marital status, education level, employment status, duration of prediabetes and income. The participants completed questionnaires before the intervention and three months later. The researcher measured their weight and height via calibrated scales and recorded their body mass index (BMI). To ensure accuracy, all measurements were taken by one person via standardized equipment at the selected centers. One individual conducted all the sampling, and tests were performed in a single laboratory via standardized methods and identical kits. The participants were instructed to fast for at least six hours; if not, samples were taken on another day. The researcher collected all the samples and quickly sent them to an approved laboratory for FBS and HbA1c tests in cold boxes.

The control group samples were referred to healthcare providers for routine care. The sample selection method and data collection method are the same as the intervention group.

Statistical analysis was conducted via SPSSv26. Descriptive statistics were employed to determine the frequency, mean, and standard deviation, along with independent and paired t tests for data analysis.

All trial protocols were approved by the Iranian Clinical Trials Registry (WHO subgroup) under clinical trial registration number IRCT20230516058206N1(2023-07-26). Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the project’s ethical guidelines and national norms and standards (IR.MUI.NUREMA.REC.1402.054).

The participants aged 33–59 years (mean age 49.18 years) had an average prediabetes duration of 8.66 months (Table2). The results of the independent t-test show that there is no statistically significant difference in the mean score of glycosylated hemoglobin before the intervention between the case and control groups (p> 0.05), but comparing the mean score three months after the intervention shows a statistically significant difference (p< 0.05) (Table3). The results of the independent t-test show that there is no statistically significant difference in the mean fasting blood sugar score before the intervention between the case and control groups (p> 0.05), but comparing the mean score three months after the intervention shows a statistically significant difference (p< 0.05) (Table4). Regarding BMI, the test results showed a significant decrease in the mean score in the case group. In contrast, the mean BMI of the control group did not increase significantly (p> 0.05) (Table5).

This study explored the effects of a Family Health Nurse-based intervention on blood sugar control in middle-aged individuals with prediabetes. In a previous version of this article, we demonstrated the protocol of this clinical trial [18]. The findings of this study are important in the fields of obesity and diabetes prevention. The changes in anthropometric indices, such as height, weight and body mass index, were significantly more pronounced in the intervention group than in the control group. This aligns with the results of Ortiz et al.‘s study, titled “The Effect of a Family-Based and Interdisciplinary Intervention for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial,” which also supports the current findings [22]. Additionally, the study conducted by Arnaz et al. corroborates these results [23]. Both studies demonstrated that family-based interventions focused on lifestyle changes improved anthropometric indicators and led to indirect enhancements in glycemic control.

Some studies emphasize that factors such as genetics, socioeconomic status, mental health, and environmental influences play significant roles in overall health. For instance, individuals may follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly but still experience health issues due to genetic predispositions or chronic stress [24].

The present study revealed that the mean change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) significantly decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group. These results are consistent with those of Lothfa et al.‘s study on family empowerment and support in type 2 diabetes patients [25]. Similarly, Al-Mahdi et al. and Cheraghi et al. reported comparable findings [26,27]. Setioadi’s research also aligns with our results, as does Shorideh et al., who emphasized the importance of patient empowerment and family education in improving HbA1c levels [28,29]. Torres et al. demonstrated that a nine-month educational program involving group sessions, home visits, and telephone interventions significantly improved HbA1c levels [30], further supporting our findings. Additionally, the mean changes in fasting blood sugar were significantly lower in the intervention group. Ortiz et al.‘s study on family and interdisciplinary interventions for preventing type 2 diabetes corroborated our results, as did Setioadi’s literature review on family empowerment [22,30]. While previous studies focused on exercise, family, and lifestyle separately, this study integrated all these strategies. In the control group, the scores for some variables did not significantly decrease over time, and some even increased, likely reflecting routine health center interventions. Thus, it is recommended “to maintain current practices while adopting more systematic family-based interventions.

Meanwhile, an equivalent number of previous structured education programs demonstrated contradicting results.

Among the conflicting studies, one can mention the study by Sturt JA entitled Effects of the Diabetes Manual 1:1 structured education in primary care.This study aims to determine the effects of The Diabetes Manual for improving the control, diabetes-related distress and confidence to self-care of patients with type 2 diabetes. The authors found that There was no significant difference in HbA1c between the intervention group and the control group [31].

M J Davies’ study entitled Effectiveness of the diabetes education and self management for ongoing and newly diagnosed (DESMOND)programme for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: cluster randomised controlled trial showed that Haemoglobin A1c levels at 12 months had decreased by 1.49% in the intervention group compared with 1.21% in the control group. After adjusting for baseline and cluster, the difference was not significant: 0.05% (95% confidence interval − 0.10–0.20%) [32].

Kamlesh Khunti’ study entitled Effectiveness of a diabetes education and self management programme (DESMOND) for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus: three year follow-up of a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care showed that HbA1c levels at three years had decreased in both groups. After adjusting for baseline and cluster the difference was not significant (difference − 0.02, 95% confidence interval − 0.22 to 0.17) [33].

However, the insignificant findings of these studies could be attributed to a low power, a ceiling effect (the participants had relatively good glycemic control at baseline), the utilization of an active comparator, and an inappropriate time point for intervention initiation (immediate structured education for individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes in the course of intensive medical treatments) or model of intervention delivery (self-instructed without supervision).

Although psychological tools were not used, recommending future studies to examine psychosocial factors (e.g., self-efficacy, quality of life, social support) could broaden the implications of this work., it is also recommended that future studies address other chronic diseases (including Diabetes, Hypertension, and COPD) and in broader study populations.

Given that one of the main stages of this study was a home visit, the distance, security issues, the need to coordinate with the samples before the visit, and the large number of samples caused the data collection process to be lengthy, which was resolved with the patience of the research team.

Given the healthcare system’s current focus on treatment rather than prevention, the role of FHNs becomes increasingly vital. Their proactive approach to disease prevention can significantly reduce healthcare costs and improve overall community health outcomes. To maximize this potential, it is essential to conduct further testing of the FHN model in larger communities. Such research could provide valuable insights for its integration into national healthcare strategies, ultimately fostering a more preventive-oriented system that prioritizes long-term health and wellness for all citizens.
