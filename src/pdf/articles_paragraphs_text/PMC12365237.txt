Salinity stress severely limits the growth and floral quality of ornamental plants in arid regions. This study evaluated the combined effects of foliar-applied methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ascorbic acid (AA) on salinity tolerance in pot marigold (Calendula officinalisL.) under 8.64 dS m⁻¹ salinity stress. A factorial greenhouse experiment tested three MeJA concentrations (0, 100, 200 µM) and three AA concentrations (0, 100, 200 mg L⁻¹), with three replicates of six plants per treatment (18 plants total per treatment). The combined 200 µM MeJA and 200 mg L⁻¹ AA treatment significantly enhanced flower number (80%), diameter (37%), and longevity (33%), as well as shoot biomass (up to 50%) and root biomass (up to fourfold) compared to controls. It also reduced electrolyte leakage by 53% and increased relative water content (21%), photosynthetic efficiency (400%), and photosystem II performance (71.8%) relative to controls. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase: 38.3%; peroxidase: 50%), proline accumulation (188.6%), and protein content (159.5%) increased compared to controls, reflecting enhanced osmotic regulation and cellular protection. These findings demonstrate that MeJA and AA synergistically improve salinity tolerance, boosting physiological resilience and floral quality under salt stress. Further field trials are needed to validate and optimize this approach for broader application.

Soil salinity is a critical abiotic stressor that limits the growth and productivity of ornamental plants in arid regions, disrupting ionic homeostasis, inducing osmotic stress, and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause cellular damage, reduced photosynthetic efficiency, and inhibited biomass accumulation1–3. Pot marigold (Calendula officinalisL.), a commercially valuable ornamental and medicinal species, faces significant challenges in saline soils due to its sensitivity to ionic imbalance and oxidative stress4–6. Although pot marigolds possess inherent antioxidant systems, extreme salinity often overwhelms these defenses, necessitating innovative strategies to enhance stress resilience7. Phytohormones and antioxidants, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ascorbic acid (AA), have shown promise in mitigating salinity stress by enhancing antioxidant defenses and osmotic adjustment8. MeJA, a lipid-derived signaling molecule, upregulates antioxidant enzymes, glyoxalase systems, and photosynthetic machinery, reducing oxidative damage in salt-stressed plants9,10. For instance, MeJA has been shown to lower electrolyte leakage and enhance photosynthetic efficiency under salinity in crops like rice10. Similarly, AA, a primary ROS scavenger, stabilizes cellular membranes and boosts antioxidant enzyme activity, improving salinity tolerance in halophytes likeLimonium stocksii11, barley (Hordeum vulgare)12pea (Pisum sativum)13.

Despite these advances, critical gaps remain in understanding the combined effects of MeJA and AA on salinity tolerance in pot marigold. While individual applications of MeJA and AA have been studied under salinity9–13, and their combined effects have been explored under non-saline conditions in species like red willow14no research has investigated their synergistic potential in alleviating salt-induced oxidative and osmotic stress in pot marigold, particularly for improving floral traits and physiological resilience. This gap is significant, as synergy between MeJA and AA could offer a novel approach to enhance salinity tolerance by simultaneously targeting antioxidant defenses, osmotic adjustment, and photosynthetic performance.

This study hypothesizes that the co-application of MeJA and AA synergistically enhances pot marigold salinity tolerance by improving ion homeostasis, photosynthetic efficiency, and oxidative stress mitigation. The objective is to evaluate their individual and combined effects under 8.64 dS m⁻¹ salinity stress to develop a phytomanagement strategy for improving floral quality and plant resilience in saline environments.

The highest flower number (18) was observed in the 200 µM MeJA + 100 mg/L AA treatment, an 80% increase compared to the control (10 flowers; Fig.1a). Flower diameter reached a maximum of 72.59 mm in the 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment, a 37% increase over the control (52.94 mm; Fig.1b). Flower longevity peaked at 12.19 days in the same treatment, a 33% increase compared to the control (9.16 days; Fig.1c).

Shoot fresh weight peaked at 90.97 g in the 200 mg/L AA treatment without MeJA, a 55% increase over the control (58.57 g; Fig.1e). Shoot dry weight reached 11.25 g in the same treatment, a 53.5% increase compared to the control (7.33 g; Fig.1f). Root fresh weight (51.97 g) and root dry weight (16.35 g) both peaked in the 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment, showing approximately fourfold increases compared to the control (10.25 g and 3.12 g, respectively; Fig.1g, h).

Two-way ANOVA showed significant main and interaction effects of MeJA and AA on photosynthetic parameters. Significant MeJA × AA interactions were observed for net photosynthesis (F = 4.85,p≤ 0.01), transpiration rate (F = 3.28,p≤ 0.05), stomatal conductance (F = 7.31,p≤ 0.01), intercellular CO₂ concentration (F = 11.40,p≤ 0.001), water use efficiency (F = 6.99,p≤ 0.01), and relative water content (RWC) (F = 4.17,p≤ 0.05) (Table2). Net photosynthesis peaked at 10.79 µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ in the 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment, a 400% increase compared to the control (2.16 µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹; Fig.2a). Transpiration rate was lowest at 2.81 mmol H₂O m⁻² s⁻¹ in the same treatment, a 55% reduction from the control (6.27 mmol H₂O m⁻² s⁻¹; Fig.2b). Stomatal conductance (0.17 mmol m⁻² s⁻¹) and intercellular CO₂ concentration (156.6 µmol mol⁻¹) also peaked in this treatment, increasing by 183% and 62.4% compared to the control (0.06 mmol m⁻² s⁻¹ and 96.42 µmol mol⁻¹, respectively; Fig.2c, d). Water use efficiency (2.33 µmol CO₂ mmol⁻¹ H₂O) and RWC (66.67%) were highest in this treatment, with increases of 228% and 21% over the control (0.71 µmol CO₂ mmol⁻¹ H₂O and 55%, respectively; Figs.2e, f).

Two-way ANOVA revealed significant main and interaction effects of MeJA and AA on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Significant MeJA × AA interactions were detected for Fo(F = 19.21,p≤ 0.001), Fm(F = 28.54,p≤ 0.001), Fv/Fm(F = 31.69,p≤ 0.001), and ΦPSII (F = 11.61,p≤ 0.001) (Table2). The lowest Fo(82.67) was recorded in the 200 mg/L AA treatment without MeJA, a 25.4% reduction compared to the control (103.67; Fig.3a). The highest Fm(380.67) was observed in the 200 µM MeJA treatment without AA, a 30.8% increase over the control (291.10; Fig.3b). Fv/Fmpeaked at 0.77 in the 200 mg/L AA treatment without MeJA, a 30.5% increase compared to the control (0.59; Fig.3c).

Two-way ANOVA showed significant main and interaction effects of MeJA and AA on photosynthetic pigments. Significant MeJA × AA interactions were observed for chlorophyll a (F = 20.21,p≤ 0.001), chlorophyll b (F = 6.92,p≤ 0.01), total chlorophyll (F = 13.42,p≤ 0.001), and carotenoids (F = 4.68,p≤ 0.01). However, the main effect of AA on carotenoids was not significant (F = 2.53,p> 0.05) (Table3). Chlorophyll a peaked at 1.23 mg g⁻¹ FW in the 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment, a 44.7% increase compared to the control (0.85 mg g⁻¹ FW; Fig.3e). Chlorophyll b (0.73 mg g⁻¹ FW), total chlorophyll (2.13 mg g⁻¹ FW), and carotenoids (0.31 mg g⁻¹ FW) also peaked in this treatment, with increases of 160%, 71.7%, and 34.7% compared to the control (0.28 mg g⁻¹ FW, 1.24 mg g⁻¹ FW, and 0.23 mg g⁻¹ FW, respectively; Fig.3f–h).

Significant MeJA × AA interactions were found for catalase activity (F = 5.60,p≤ 0.01), peroxidase activity (F = 3.53,p≤ 0.05), total soluble protein (F = 9.67,p≤ 0.001), and proline content (F = 3.38,p≤ 0.05) (Table3). Catalase activity peaked at 0.65 U mg⁻¹ protein in the 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment, a 38.3% increase compared to the control (0.47 U mg⁻¹ protein; Fig.4a). Peroxidase activity reached 0.06 U mg⁻¹ protein in the same treatment, a 50% increase compared to the control (0.04 U mg⁻¹ protein; Fig.4b). Total soluble protein was highest at 389.83 µg g⁻¹ FW in the 200 µM MeJA treatment without AA, a 159.6% increase compared to the control (150.17 µg g⁻¹ FW; Fig.4c). Proline content peaked at 4.30 µmol g⁻¹ FW in the 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment, a 188.6% increase compared to the control (1.49 µmol g⁻¹ FW; Fig.4d).

The combined application of 200 µM MeJA and 200 mg/L AA significantly increased flower number by 80%, flower diameter by 37%, and flower longevity by 33% in pot marigold (Calendula officinalisL.) under 8.64 dS m⁻¹ salinity stress (Fig.1a–c). These improvements align with findings in summer savory15, which demonstrated enhanced flower number and essential oil yield under drought stress, although flower diameter and longevity were not evaluated in that study. MeJA also mitigated salinity stress in purple basil (Ocimum basilicumL.)16and narcissus17, improving flower quality and longevity, but these studies did not quantify flower diameter. Moreover, AA (200 mg L⁻¹) doubled lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorumL.) vase life by stabilizing cell membranes and reducing water loss18. In anthurium, AA treatments reduced chilling injury and extended vase life during cold storage19. In chrysanthemum, AA maintained petal turgor and chlorophyll content two days longer than controls20. Despite differing life cycles, AA’s enhancement of flower longevity via ROS scavenging and turgor maintenance is likely applicable to pot marigold, given their shared physiological responses to oxidative stress13. The synergistic of MeJA and AA promotes floral development by enhancing cell expansion, nutrient uptake, and cellular integrity, mitigating salinity-induced stress.

The 100 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment significantly reduced electrolyte leakage by 53% (Fig.1d), indicating enhanced membrane stability. MeJA reduced electrolyte leakage by 7.8–35% in perennial ryegrass21and peppermint22under salt stress by upregulating antioxidant enzymes that mitigate oxidative damage to membrane lipids. AA directly contributes to this reduction by scavenging ROS that damage membrane lipids, as shown in pea13, where AA stabilized membranes under 100 mM NaCl, and in barley12, where AA reduced ion leakage by enhancing redox homeostasis. This synergistic action of MeJA and AA minimizes ion leakage by protecting membrane integrity and reducing oxidative stress, as evidenced by lower malondialdehyde levels23. These mechanisms collectively enhance cellular stability, enabling pot marigold to maintain physiological functions under salinity stress.

Treatment with 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA increased fresh and dry weights of shoots by over 50% and roots by approximately fourfold (Figs.1e–h). MeJA promotes growth and alleviates stress-induced damage through enhanced nutrient uptake and osmolyte accumulation (e.g., proline, increased by 188.6% in our study; Fig.4d), as observed in maize under drought stress24andCosmos bipinnatusunder cadmium stress25. Combined MeJA and AA treatments in red willow increased leaf production, boosting biomass by mitigating oxidative damage14. This synergy supports cellular expansion and metabolic activity under salinity stress.

The 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment enhanced net photosynthesis by 400%, stomatal conductance by 183%, intercellular CO₂ concentration by 62.4%, and water use efficiency by 228% (Figs.2a–e). MeJA protects photosynthesis in wheat26and polyethylene glycol-treated plants27, though dose-dependent reductions were noted in soybean28. The treatment also improved relative water content by 21% (66.67% vs. 55%; Fig.2f), consistent with MeJA’s role in maintaining leaf water content in summer savory15and peppermint29. MeJA can delay plant dehydration by enhancing osmolyte accumulation and stomatal regulation, as demonstrated in strawberry, where it increased relative water content and reduced water loss30,31. These effects, combined with AA’s role in mitigating photoinhibition, support photosynthetic efficiency under salinity stress.

The 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment increased the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII) by 71.8% (Fig.3d) and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) by 30.5% (Fig.3c). MeJA enhances PSII efficiency by stabilizing the D1 protein and reducing photoinhibition under abiotic stresses, as observed in heat-stressed wheat32, drought-stressed pepper (Capsicum annuumL.)33, and salinity-stressed saffron (Crocus sativusL.)34. In maize, MeJA upregulated carotenoid biosynthesis, enhancing photoprotection and electron transport efficiency35. AA mitigates photoinhibition by scavenging ROS in chloroplasts, as reported in pea under salinity, where it enhanced ΦPSII and maintained photosynthetic activity13. This synergy improves light utilization and electron transport, supporting photochemical efficiency and stress resilience in pot marigold.

The 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment significantly increased chlorophyll a by 44.7%, chlorophyll b by 160%, total chlorophyll by 71.7%, and carotenoids by 34.7% (Figs.3e–h). MeJA protects chloroplasts by upregulating antioxidant enzymes and stabilizing photosynthesis-related proteins, as observed inCrithmum maritimum36, where it mitigated salinity-induced chlorophyll degradation. Similarly, in maize, MeJA enhanced carotenoid biosynthesis, supporting photoprotection35. AA is recognized for maintaining chlorophyll content, as evidenced by our data showing a 71.7% increase in total chlorophyll and in pea13, where AA increased chlorophyll a by 41.1% and chlorophyll b by 56.1% under 100 mM NaCl by scavenging ROS and reducing lipid peroxidation. This aligns with findings in barley, where AA improved chlorophyll stability under salinity stress, enhancing photosynthetic capacity12. The synergistic action of MeJA and AA preserves photosynthetic pigments by mitigating oxidative damage to chloroplast membranes, maintaining electron transport efficiency, and supporting photochemical reactions under salinity stress. These enhancements are critical for sustaining photosynthesis and overall plant resilience in saline environments.

This study demonstrated that MeJA and AA, particularly at 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA, significantly enhanced antioxidant defense systems, total protein content, and proline levels in pot marigold under salinity stress (Figs.4a-d). The results of this study are aligning with findings that MeJA reduces ROS accumulation under salinity36, drought24, heat37and cod38stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities39. MeJA enhanced photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen uptake, promoting plant health in wheat under heat stress40and in grapevines under drought stress41. Synergistic effects with antioxidants like melatonin further amplified antioxidant enzyme activities, reducing oxidative stress more effectively40. AA, a key non-enzymatic antioxidant, directly scavenged ROS and supported APX activity, maintaining redox homeostasis and complementing MeJA’s effects24,40. Consistent with our findings, MeJA treatment increased proline content inAnchusa italicaunder salinity stress42and in maize under drought stress24which correlated with enhanced relative water content and antioxidant activity. MeJA’s mechanism involves osmotic regulation, membrane protection, and ROS scavenging, while also elevating AA levels to enhance stress tolerance23,39.

MeJA activates jasmonic acid signaling through COI1 receptor binding, promoting MYC2-mediated expression of genes involved in antioxidant enzyme activity (e.g., catalase, peroxidase) and osmolyte biosynthesis (e.g., proline synthase)23,43, as seen inArabidopsis9. This pathway reduces ROS accumulation and enhances osmotic adjustment, critical for salinity tolerance. AA scavenges ROS and supports ascorbate-glutathione cycle activity, stabilizing redox-sensitive components like MYC2, as reported in pea13. Crosstalk between jasmonic acid and abscisic acid signaling, mediated by MYC2 and ABI5 transcription factors, upregulates NAC family genes (e.g., ANAC019) and osmotic stress-responsive genes (e.g., RD29A), promoting water retention44–46. MeJA-induced heat shock proteins (e.g., HSP70) and NAC transcription factors further support protein stability, as seen in maize47, while AA ensures proper protein folding through redox buffering48.

However, the study’s limitations include the absence of a salinity-free control, limiting baseline comparisons, and the use of greenhouse conditions, which may not reflect field variability. Testing a single cultivar in one season (autumn 2024) and evaluating only two doses of MeJA and AA restrict generalizability and dose-response insights. Additionally, the study did not assess long-term effects or economic feasibility of MeJA and AA applications. Future research should incorporate salinity-free controls, field trials, diverse cultivars, multi-season studies, broader dose ranges, and cost-benefit analyses to optimize application protocols and enhance practical applicability.

This study demonstrates that exogenous application of MeJA and AA, individually and in combination, significantly enhances growth, physiological, and biochemical responses of pot marigold under saline soil conditions (8.64 dS m⁻¹). The treatments improved flower number, diameter, longevity, and biomass of roots and shoots, with the combined 200 µM MeJA + 200 mg/L AA treatment producing the most pronounced benefits. Physiological and biochemical enhancements included increased chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, relative water content, antioxidant enzyme activities, and osmoprotectant accumulation, alongside reduced electrolyte leakage and oxidative stress, highlighting a synergistic enhancement of salt tolerance. However, given the study’s controlled environment, single-cultivar focus, and variability in some traits, further research is required. Future work should prioritize field trials across diverse cultivars and environmental conditions to validate these findings and optimize application strategies. Optimizing application methods (e.g., foliar sprays), dosages, and timing tailored to specific crops and local conditions will be critical. Integration of MeJA and AA treatments with current horticultural practices such as fertilization and irrigation, as well as consideration of economic feasibility and material availability, are essential for practical adoption by farmers and breeders. Overall, these preliminary results provide a promising approach for improving salinity tolerance in ornamental and medicinal plants, supporting sustainable horticultural production.

The experiment was conducted in autumn 2024 under natural daylight conditions in a research greenhouse at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Iran (30°N, 57°E, 1754 m altitude), with no supplemental lighting. The average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was approximately 600–800 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ during the 16-hour photoperiod. The autumn season ensured stable temperatures (20.5 °C) and relative humidity (20–25%), minimizing seasonal fluctuations that could influence plant responses. The soil mixture used consisted of sand, clay, and decomposed manure in a ratio of 2:1:1 by volume, with an electrical conductivity of 8.64 dS m⁻¹. Seedlings of pot marigold (Calendula officinalisL.) were transplanted into pots (dimensions: 25.5 cm diameter and 25 cm height), with one plant per pot after establishment; each pot contained one plant, which served as the experimental unit for all measurements. A nutrient solution containing 10% nitrogen (N), 8% phosphorus (P), 4% potassium (K), 0.1% iron (Fe), and 0.1% zinc (Zn) was applied through irrigation.

The experiment was designed as a completely randomized design (CRD) to evaluate the interactive effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ascorbic acid (AA) on pot marigold under salinity stress (8.64 dS m⁻¹). Two factors were tested: MeJA at three levels (0, 100, and 200 µM) and AA at three levels (0, 100, and 200 mg/L), resulting in a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement with 9 treatment combinations. Each treatment was conducted with three independent replicates, each containing six individual plants (pots), yielding 18 plants per treatment (3 replicates × 6 plants per replicate). The total number of experimental units was 9 treatments × 18 plants = 162 plants. Pots were assigned treatments randomly in the greenhouse to ensure a completely randomized design and minimize positional effects. Data from the six plants per replicate were averaged to obtain a single value per replicate for statistical analysis.

Foliar applications of MeJA and AA were performed three times during the experiment: five weeks after transplantation, at the 4–6 leaf stage, and then at two-week intervals. Each plant was sprayed with 50 mL of the respective solution (containing MeJA and AA in deionized water with 0.1% Tween-20 as a surfactant) until runoff on the leaves. Spraying was done in the morning between 8:00 and 9:00 AM under stable greenhouse conditions (temperature 20–22 °C, relative humidity 20–25%, and light intensity 400–600 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹) to ensure optimal absorption and minimal environmental variability. The control group consisted of plants grown under saline conditions (8.64 dS m⁻¹) without MeJA and AA application; these were sprayed only with deionized water containing 0.1% Tween-20 following the same spraying schedule and conditions as the treatments. A salinity-free control group was not included because the study’s objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of MeJA and AA in alleviating salinity stress.

Morphological traits (flower number, diameter, and longevity) were assessed throughout the flowering period, with daily counts of flower buds to quantify total flower number, aligning with the plant’s reproductive phase. Physiological and biochemical measurements, including electrolyte leakage, photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, enzymatic activities (catalase and peroxidase), total soluble protein, and proline content, were conducted 7 days after the final foliar application of MeJA and AA, at the peak flowering stage of pot marigold, to capture stabilized treatment effects under salinity stress. Shoot and root fresh and dry weights were measured at the end of the experiment during plant harvesting, when plants were uprooted.

To quantify the total number of flowers, daily counts of flower buds were conducted after each blooming event. A cumulative count was maintained throughout the experimental period to determine the total number of flowers produced49. Flower diameter was measured on fully open flowers to ensure consistency. For each plant, three flowers were randomly selected and measured. The diameter was recorded as the longest distance across the flower, passing through the center, using a digital caliper with an accuracy of 0.01 mm50. The duration of flower longevity was determined from the moment the petals began to open slightly, revealing the stamens, until they wilted or dropped off. For each replication, 10–12 newly emerging floral buds were randomly selected from 3 to 5 plants. Throughout the flowering season, the dates of opening and wilting for each flower were meticulously recorded to assess the longevity of individual flowers51.

Plants were carefully removed from pots, and soil around the roots was gently washed off. Shoots and roots were separated, and their fresh weights were measured using a precision scale. Samples were dried in an oven at 70 °C until a constant weight was achieved, after which dry weights were recorded53.

Photosynthetic gas exchange parameters were measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) system (LI-COR LI-6800, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Fully expanded leaves were selected and allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 30 min prior to measurement. Under controlled environmental conditions—light intensity set at 1,500 µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹, CO₂ concentration maintained at 400 ppm, and leaf temperature regulated at 25 °C—key physiological parameters were recorded, including: net photosynthetic rate (Pn) expressed in µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹, stomatal conductance (gs) measured in mmol H₂O m⁻² s⁻¹, intercellular CO₂ concentration (Ci) in µmol mol⁻¹, transpiration rate (E) expressed in mmol H₂O m⁻² s⁻¹, and water use efficiency (WUE) in µmol CO₂ mmol⁻¹ H₂O. Measurements were performed between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM to reduce variability caused by diurnal changes54.

Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency was measured using a pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometer (Junior_PAM, WALZ, Germany). Fully expanded leaves were dark-adapted for 30 min to allow photosynthetic apparatus relaxation before exposure to a saturating light pulse of 3,000 µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹. This procedure enabled the determination of the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), calculated as (Fm− Fo)/Fm, where Fois the minimum fluorescence of dark-adapted leaves and Fm is the maximum fluorescence following the saturating pulse. Additionally, the effective quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) was recorded under actinic light to evaluate the operational efficiency of PSII during photosynthesis56.

Fresh leaves weighing 0.5 g were collected and immediately ground in 5 mL of ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) using a chilled mortar and pestle. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant, referred to as the “enzyme extract,” contains soluble enzymes and was used for enzyme activity assays and protein quantification. Enzyme extracts were analyzed immediately or stored on ice at 4 °C for no longer than 2 h.

Catalase (CAT) activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the decomposition of H₂O₂ at 240 nm according to the method of Aebi58. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mM H₂O₂, and enzyme extract. The decrease in absorbance at 240 nm was monitored for 2 min. One unit (U) of CAT activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that decomposes 1 µmol of H₂O₂ per minute per mg of protein, expressed as U mg⁻¹ protein, where 1 U equal 1 µmol H₂O₂ decomposed per minute under assay conditions (pH 7.0, 25 °C).

Peroxidase (POD) activity was assayed by monitoring the oxidation of guaiacol in the presence of H₂O₂ at 470 nm as described by Chance and Maehly59. The assay mixture included 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 20 mM guaiacol, 10 mM H₂O₂, and enzyme extract. The increase in absorbance at 470 nm was recorded for 3 min. One unit (U) of POD activity is defined as the amount of enzyme causing an absorbance increase of 0.01 at 470 nm per minute per mg of protein, expressed as U mg⁻¹ protein, where 1 U equals an absorbance increase of 0.01 at 470 nm per minute under standard assay conditions (pH 7.0, 25 °C).

Protein concentration in the enzyme extracts was measured using the Bradford assay60. In brief, 100 µL of the enzyme extract was mixed with 5 mL of Bradford reagent and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance was read at 595 nm, and protein levels were calculated from a standard curve prepared with bovine serum albumin (BSA).

Free proline content in leaf tissues was quantified using the spectrophotometric61. Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) were homogenized in 10 mL of 3% sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 10 min to pellet debris. The supernatant (2 mL) was mixed with 2 mL of acid ninhydrin reagent and 2 mL of glacial acetic acid, then heated in a boiling water bath at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling in ice, 4 mL of toluene was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 30 s using an Orbital MX-F Vortex Mixer (Drawell Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., China) at a fixed speed of 3000 rpm to ensure thorough mixing. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 520 nm. Proline concentration was determined using a standard curve of L-proline and expressed as µmol per gram fresh weight (µmol g−1FW).

The experiment was conducted with three replicates, each including 6 individual plants (pots), in a factorial design with 9 treatment combinations (3 MeJA × 3 AA), totaling 18 plants per treatment. Data from the 6 plants per replicate were averaged to obtain a single value per replicate. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using SAS version 9.4. Mean comparisons were conducted using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test atp≤ 0.05. Results are presented as mean ± standard error (SE), with ANOVA results summarized in Tables1,2and3.
