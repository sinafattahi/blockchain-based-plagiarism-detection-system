A case-control study was conducted to assess glycemic variability (GV) in individuals diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as in those with either condition independently.

This study encompassed 2897 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with diabetes at the Department of Endocrinology, Ningbo No.2 Hospital. Patients with MASLD were matched to patients without MASLD based on age and sex. GV was evaluated utilizing glucose standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). HOMA-IR and HOMA-β indices were used to assess insulin resistance and islet β-cell function. The degree of hepatic fibrosis was graded using the FIB-4 score. SPSS software (version 26.0) was used for the statistical analysis.

1. MASLD was diagnosed in 41.66% of T2DM inpatients. Among individuals with normal body weight, 32.45% suffered from MASLD, whereas the prevalence significantly escalated to 77.55% among those classified as obese. Based on the FIB-4 index, 47.11% of DM + MASLD patients were at risk for the development of hepatic fibrosis, with 7.85% classified as at high risk for advanced liver fibrosis. 2. In contrast to the DM+Non-MASLD cohort, the DM+MASLD group displayed markedly reduced GV, lower incidence of hypoglycemia, and elevated HOMA-IR and HOMA-β values (allp< 0.001). 3. The CV showed a direct positive correlation with HbA1c (β =0.367,p< 0.001) in patients with coexisting T2DM and MASLD.

Patients with T2DM and MASLD exhibit reduced GV and a lower incidence of hypoglycemia but more serious insulin resistance. Effective control of HbA1c is essential to mitigate GV in these patients.

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is strongly associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is acknowledged as the predominant chronic liver ailment globally [1,2]. Glycemic variability (GV), defined as fluctuations in blood glucose levels over a defined period, is recognized as an unstable condition [3]. Regardless of the blood glucose levels, GV has been identified as a significant contributor factor to the development and progression of diabetic complications [4,5]. Currently, there is a paucity of research examining GV in individuals with diabetes mellitus complicated by MASLD, particularly concerning liver fibrosis and blood glucose fluctuations. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate GV in patients with both diabetes and MASLD, compared to those with diabetes alone. Additionally, as a secondary objective, we explored the relationship between GV and the severity of liver fibrosis. To address these aims, we conducted a retrospective case-control study involving 2,897 hospitalized patients with diabetes.

This case-control study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningbo Second Hospital (Ethical Lot No: YJ-NBET-KY-2022-130-01), with a waiver for informed consent granted due to the use of anonymized data. Under strict privacy and confidentiality safeguards, we collected data from 4,657 consecutive diabetic inpatients at Ningbo No. 2 Hospital between June 2019 and March 2022. Of these, 2,897 met the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1(A)), and were enrolled in this retrospective case–control analysis. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥ 18 years, (2) diagnosis of T2DM, and (3) complete inpatient medical records. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) previous diagnosis of other chronic liver diseases (viral, autoimmune, etc.), major diseases such as liver cirrhosis or tumors (n= 473), (2) acute complications of diabetes mellitus or severe infections (n= 170), (3) long-term alcohol consumption (n= 35), (4) repeated hospitalizations (n= 577), and (5) incomplete clinical data (n= 505). Diagnostic criteria: T2DM was diagnosed based on the 2020 ADA Medical Standard for Diabetes [6]. Diffuse fatty liver was characterized by specific manifestations in imaging, blood biomarkers, or liver pathology that fulfill the diagnostic criteria. Two of the following three manifestations observedviaabdominal ultrasound were indicative of diffuse fatty liver: (a) diffuse enhancement of the near-field echo of the liver, commonly referred to as ‘bright liver’, with the echo intensity surpassing that of the kidney, (b) obscured intrahepatic duct structures, and (c) progressive attenuation of the far-field liver echo. Additionally, MASLD was diagnosed based on meeting the above criteria for hepatic steatosis and any one of the following combined: T2DM, overweight/obesity, and metabolic dysfunction (characterized by at least two risk factors for metabolic disorders) [7]. Hypoglycemia was defined as a reduction in blood glucose levels below 3.9 mmol/L.

Study flow and prevalence of MASLD.(A) Participant flowchart: Adults with T2DM were screened; after exclusions, the final analytic sample comprised 2897 participants. (B) Overall prevalence of MASLD in the total cohort (1207 of 2897 participants; 41.66%). MASLD prevalence stratified by FIB-4 risk (C) and BMI (D) categories in the age- and sex-matched T2DM cohort. Percentages were shown on the corresponding pie slices. Abbreviations: MASLD: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease; T2DM: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; FIB-4: Fibrosis-4 index; BMI: Body-Mass Index.

A total of 1207 patients were diagnosed with T2DM complicated by MASLD. Among these, 1057 patients with both diabetes mellitus and MASLD (DM+MASLD) were matched by age and sex to 1057 patients with diabetes mellitus but without MASLD (DM+Non-MASLD), who served as the control group. The participants were divided into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI): normal weight (BMI < 24 kg/m2,n= 946), overweight (24 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m2,n= 825), and obese (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2,n= 343). According to HbA1c levels, the patients were divided into HbA1c < 7% (n= 425), 7%≤HbA1c ≤ 9.5% (n= 907), and HbA1c > 9.5% (n= 782) groups. The fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), calculated as age (years) × aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (U/L)/platelet count (PLT) (× 109/L) × alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (U/L)1/2was also used for stratification [8]. F1 (FIB-4 < 1.3) indicated low risk or no significant fibrosis, F2 (1.3 ≤ FIB-4 ≤ 2.67) suggested the possibility of liver fibrosis, and F3 (FIB-4 > 2.67) indicated high risk, fibrosis of grade 3–4 or above, and the possibility of advanced fibrosis.

This retrospective study analyzed clinical data, including routine hepatic ultrasonography and standard hematological tests, from hospitalized patients diagnosed with diabetes at our institution between June 2019 and March 2022. Among these, the liver ultrasound examination aligned with the hepatic steatosis detection standards recommended in corresponding Chinese Guidelines [9–11]. Basic clinical information, such as sex, age, weight, height, and pertinent auxiliary examination results, were extracted from inpatient medical records. Serum biomarker analyses encompassed fasting serum C-peptide (FCP), postprandial 2-hour C-peptide (2h CP), and blood lipid profiles, including total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein. The GlucoWise Intelligent Glucose Monitor (LifeScan Medical Equipment Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China) was employed to measure fasting blood glucose (FPG), postprandial 2-hour blood glucose (2h PG), bedtime blood glucose, and random blood glucose levels during the patients’ hospitalization. The average blood glucose levels, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), and GV metrics, including Standard Deviation (SD) and Coefficient of Variation (CV), were derived from the recorded blood glucose measurements. The SD represented the standard deviation of multiple blood glucose values at multiple points [12]. The CV was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean blood glucose over a period of at least two days. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were evaluated using the modified homeostasis model assessment based on C-peptide levels, employing the following formulas: Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) =1.5+(FPG [mmol/L] × FCP [nmol/L])/2800; Homeostasis Model Assessment of β-cell Function (HOMA-β) = 0.27 × FCP[nmol/L]/FPG[mmol/L] [13]. It should be noted that, these examinations above encompassed all parameters necessary to calculate the FIB-4 score: AST, ALT, PLT, and age. All tests were ordered by the attending clinicians as part of routine clinical care and were conducted independently of the present research.

Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation, whereas categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Theχ2test was used to compare categorical variables, while thet-test, ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare continuous variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to explore the correlations between various metabolic factors and blood glucose fluctuations. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 26.0), with a significance threshold set at ap-value of less than 0.05.

In our study, the overall prevalence of MASLD among the 2,897 T2DM patients initially enrolled was determined to be 41.66% (refer to Figure1A and B). After 1:1 matching based on age and gender, we ultimately encompassed a cohort of 2114 hospitalized patients diagnosed with T2DM, with an average age of 57.05 ± 12.16 years. Among them, 39.6% were female, while 60.4% were male. According to the FIB-4 score, 47.11% of DM+MASLD patients were identified as being at risk for developing hepatic fibrosis, and 7.85% of diabetic patients within the MASLD group were categorized as being at high risk for liver fibrosis (refer to Figure1C). Based on BMI, a prevalence of 32.45% was observed among individuals with normal weight, while 77.55% was found in those classified as obese (refer to Figure1D).

In comparison to the DM+non-MASLD cohort, individuals in the DM+MASLD group exhibited significantly higher BMI values (p< 0.001), as well as elevated levels of total cholesterol levels (p= 0.001), triglycerides (p< 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (p< 0.001), and uric acid (p< 0.001). Furthermore, they demonstrated a higher propensity for hypertension (p< 0.001).

Compared to the DM+non-MASLD group, patients in the DM+MASLD group exhibited no statistically significant difference in HbA1c levels (p=0.082) (Figure 2(A)). However, they showed reduced GV (Figure 2(B)), as evidenced by lower glucose SD (3.72 ± 1.34 vs. 3.32 ± 1.21), glucose CV (0.36 ± 0.10 vs. 0.33 ± 0.09) and MAGE (14.82 ± 5.86 vs. 13.16 ± 5.19) (allp< 0.001). Accordingly, when stratifying GV into quartiles (Q1-Q4), a clear inverse trend was observed: as GV increased, the prevalence of T2DM with concomitant MASLD progressively declined. (Figure 3(A–C)). Furthermore, the DM+MASLD group exhibited elevated levels of serum C-peptide (FCP and 2h CP) (Figure 2(C)), HOMA-IR (Figure 2(D)), and HOMA-β (Figure 2(E)) (allp< 0.001). Concordantly, when serum C-peptide, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β were categorized into quartiles (Q1-Q4), an increasing trend in the prevalence of MASLD among T2DM patients was observed with higher quartiles of these parameters (Figure 3(D-G)). Additionally, in comparison to DM+non-MASLD group, the DM+MASLD group demonstrated significantly elevated FPG levels and reduced 2h PG levels (allp< 0.001). Furthermore, this group demonstrated a substantially lower incidence of hypoglycemia, but higher incidence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, along with decreased prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (allp< 0.001) (Table 1).

Patients were divided into normal weight, overweight, and obese groups according to their BMI values. As presented inTable 2, within the normal weight category (BMI < 24 kg/m2), the DM + MASLD group demonstrated lower HbA1c levels (p= 0.020), glucose SD (p< 0.001), glucose CV (p< 0.001), and MAGE (p< 0.001), but higher FPG (p= 0.010), 2h PG levels (p= 0.016), serum C-peptide levels (FCP and 2h CP) (p< 0.001), HOMA-IR (p< 0.001), and HOMA-β (p= 0.003) than the DM+non-MASLD group. Among overweight individuals (24 ≤ BMI < 28 kg/m2), the DM+MASLD group exhibited elevated levels of FPG (p= 0.021), FCP (p< 0.001), 2h CP (p= 0.003), HOMA-IR (p< 0.001), and lower SD (p= 0.030), CV (p= 0.005), and MAGE (p= 0.039) in comparison to the DM+non-MASLD group. No statistically significant differences were observed in HbA1c, 2h PG and HOMA-β between the two groups. Similarly, among obese patients (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2), in comparison to the DM+non-MASLD group, the DM+MASLD group exhibited higher FCP (p= 0.004), 2h CP levels (p= 0.003), HOMA-IR (p= 0.020), and HOMA-β (p= 0.036) compared to the diabetes-only group without MASLD. Additionally, glucose SD (p= 0.029) and MAGE (p= 0.035) were lower in the DM + MASLD group.

The patients were categorized into three groups based on HbA1c levels: HbA1c <7% (n= 425), 7% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 9.5% (n= 907), and HbA1c > 9.5% (n= 782). Regardless of the disparity in HbA1c levels, analysis presented inTable 3indicated that the DM+MASLD group exhibited significantly lower glucose SD (2.33 ± 0.86 vs. 2.60 ± 0.93 (p= 0.003), 3.13 ± 0.98 vs. 3.55 ± 1.16 (p< 0.001), 4.09 ± 1.17 vs. 4.53 ± 1.17 (p< 0.001)), glucose CV (26.88 ± 8.17 vs. 29.61 ± 8.32, 31.21 ± 7.61 vs. 34.63 ± 9.04, 37.20 ± 8.05 vs. 40.39 ± 8.21) (allp< 0.001), and MAGE (8.70 ± 3.61 vs. 9.93 ± 4.31 (p= 0.002), 12.43 ± 4.25 vs. 13.94 ± 4.86 (p< 0.001), 16.43 ± 4.94 vs. 18.47 ± 5.14 (p< 0.001)) compared to the DM+non-MASLD group, respectively. Conversely, the DM+MASLD group showed elevated FCP, 2h CP, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β, except in HbA1c < 7% group (allp< 0.001).

As shown inTable 4, DM+MASLD patients were divided into three groups based on the FIB-4 index score: F1 group (FIB-4 < 1.3,n= 559), F2 group (1.3 ≤ FIB-4 ≤ 2.67,n= 415), and F3 group (FIB-4 > 2.67,n= 83). The F2 and F3 groups exhibited significantly elevated mean blood glucose levels (p= 0.009), 2h PG (p= 0.004), glucose SD (p= 0.022), and MAGE (p =0.005) compared to the F1 group. However, no significant differences were identified among the three groups concerning glucose CV, FPG, HbA1c, serum C-peptide levels, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β.

Within the DM+MASLD cohort, the dependent variables of GV (SD, CV, and MAGE) were analyzed in relation to various independent variables, including age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, FPG, 2h PG, FCP, 2h CP, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β (refer toSupplementary Table 1).Table 5revealed that glucose SD was positively correlated with HbA1c (β =0.342,p< 0.001), FPG (β =0.304,p< 0.001), and 2h PG (β =0.291,p< 0.001), while it was negatively correlated with FCP (β= −0.155,p< 0.001) and 2h CP (β= −0.156,p< 0.001). Similarly, when analyzing CV as the dependent variable alongside the same set of independent variables, the results demonstrated a positive correlation between glucose CV and HbA1c (β =0.367,p< 0.001), 2h PG (β =0.163,p< 0.001), and FPG (β =0.127,p= 0.028), while exhibiting a negative correlation with postprandial FCP (β= −0.591,p< 0.001) and 2h CP (β= −0.101,p= 0.010). Correspondingly, when considering MAGE as the dependent variable, the analysis demonstrated positive correlations with HbA1c (β =0.367,p< 0.001), 2h PG (β =0.301,p< 0.001), FPG (β =0.217,p< 0.001), and age (β =0.144,p< 0.001), while showing a negative correlation with postprandial 2h CP (β= −0.124,p< 0.001).

Integrating these findings, the multivariate analysis suggested that within the FIB-4 < 1.3, 1.3 ≤ FIB-4 ≤ 2.67, and FIB-4 > 2.67 group, GV as measured by SD, CV, MAGE, was most strongly positively correlated with HbA1c and negatively correlated with 2h CP. Notably, these relationships were not affected by the extent of liver fibrosis (refer toSupplementary Tables 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3).

MASLD is a metabolic disorder characterized by disrupted glucose and lipid metabolism and is closely linked to T2DM. Prior research has indicated that the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among T2DM individuals is 55.5%, which is double the prevalence observed in non-T2DM populations [14]. Moreover, more than 90% of obese individuals with T2DM are affected by MASLD [15]. However, our study found that only 41.66% of hospitalized patients with T2DM had comorbid MASLD (Figure 1(B)), a lower percentage than those reported in earlier studies. This discrepancy may be due to the exclusion of 1,183 diabetic patients from our study, based on their history of alcohol consumption, hepatitis, or acute complications, among whom 465 patients showed imaging findings indicative of fatty liver. Consistent with previous findings, 77.55% of obese diabetic patients in our study exhibited fatty liver (Figure 1(D)). Our study also revealed that 47.11% of patients with coexisting T2DM and MASLD developed hepatic fibrosis (Figure 1(C)). A meta-analysis conducted on T2DM patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease estimated that the overall prevalence of advanced fibrosis was 17% [16]. In this study, utilization of the FIB-4 index indicated that 7.85% of patients with T2DM and MASLD may experience progression to advanced fibrosis (Figure 1(C)). Given the frequent co-occurrence of diabetes and MASLD, it is crucial to screen for MASLD within diabetic cohorts. Furthermore, individuals with concurrent diabetes and MASLD are at an increased risk for severe liver disease, necessitating the assessment of potential liver fibrosis.

Previous investigations on blood glucose in T2DM patients with MASLD had predominantly focused on glycemic control, with limited focus on GV. Current evidence suggested a potential link between elevated glycemic variability and fatty liver disease progression, although this finding was predominantly derived from study in non-diabetic populations [17]. In contrast, the present study revealed that T2DM patients with MASLD exhibited reduced glucose SD, glucose CV, and MAGE across a range of both similar and varying HbA1c levels. Insulin is a critical hormone in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Insulin resistance, characterized by impaired responsiveness to insulin, is a key pathological and physiological factor in the onset and progression of T2DM and plays a central role in the development of MASLD. Numerous studies have demonstrated a strong association between hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and MASLD irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes [18–20]. Therefore, in our study, we compared insulin resistance and pancreatic function in T2DM patients with and without MASLD. Our findings indicated that T2DM patients with MASLD exhibited elevated levels of C-peptide, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β, irrespective of BMI and HbA1c levels. Linear regression analysis indicated the 2h CP level as a significant negative influencing factor for GV.

The results suggested that hyperinsulinemia may contribute to the reduced GV observed in patients with T2DM and MASLD, although its molecular basis remained unclear. Under normal conditions, the insulin signaling pathway in the liver activates the IRS1/2→PI3K/Akt cascade through insulin receptors. After meals, insulin inhibits hepatic glucose production (HGP), promotes glycogen storage and de novo lipogenesis (DNL), thereby reducing postprandial blood glucose. However, in Type 2 diabetes patients, abnormal manifestations include HGP that is not suppressed by insulin, accompanied by excessive DNL. This phenomenon of "ineffective inhibition of glucose metabolism but excessive promotion of lipid metabolism" is known as "selective hepatic insulin resistance." Some researchers showed that this selective hepatic insulin resistance may be related to insulin concentration, where higher insulin concentrations can selectively inhibit hepatic glucose output (HGO) through continuous activation of the hepatic IRS-2/Akt pathway, thereby reducing blood glucose fluctuations [21]. Similarly, previous studies indicated that individuals with T2DM and MASLD require higher insulin dosages to attain comparable HbA1c levels as those without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, several clinical studies demonstrated that thiazolidinediones, which enhance insulin sensitivity, exhibited greater efficacy in diabetic patients with MASLD [2,22].

The liver is integral to glucose and lipid metabolism in humans, and dysfunctions in hepatic function can lead to fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Conversely, significant fluctuations in blood glucose can also contribute to liver damage associated with metabolic disorders [23–25]. The relationship between cirrhosis and impaired glucose homeostasis has been well-documented. In this study, we used the noninvasive FIB-4 score to assess liver fibrosis. Our findings indicated that 47.11% of patients with coexisting T2DM and MASLD may exhibit liver fibrosis, whereas 7.85% may present advanced fibrosis (Figure 1(C)). Moreover, we observed an increase in SD and MAGE among patients classified as F2 compared to F1 (Table 4). Hashiba et al. utilized continuous glucose monitoring systems to assess the intraday variability of blood glucose in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and investigated its correlation with the severity of liver fibrosis determined by liver biopsy [26]. Their study revealed a significant increase in daily blood glucose variability among patients with severe fibrosis compared to those with mild fibrosis. This observation could be attributed to the progressive nature of liver fibrosis, which resulted in a decline in liver glycogen content and an enhancement in gluconeogenesis [27]. Consequently, there is an augmented release of glucose from the liver and a reduction in glucose uptake, resulting in heightened fluctuations in blood glucose levels. The occurrence and progression of MASLD may be further aggravated by lipotoxicity and glycotoxicity [28]. Fluctuations in blood glucose levels could contribute to hepatic damage in MASLD by facilitating monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, activating inflammatory cytokines, inducing inflammation, and triggering oxidative stress [29–31]. Numerous clinical studies demonstrated that diabetes can accelerate the advancement of MASLD. Decreased blood glucose fluctuations were crucial in patients with concurrent diabetes and MASLD. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that HbA1c was the paramount determinant exerting a positive influence on GV in DM+MASLD patients (Table 5). Therefore, to mitigate GV in these patients, greater emphasis should be placed to controlling HbA1c levels.

In conclusion, among T2DM patients, 41.66% exhibited comorbidities with MASLD, 47.11% were at risk for developing hepatic fibrosis, and 7.85% were identified as being at high risk for liver fibrosis. In the context of T2DM, concurrent MASLD was characterized by reduced GV, increased insulin resistance, and a lower frequency of hypoglycemic events. Simultaneously, the presence of liver fibrosis in these individuals was associated with increased GV. Notably, among patients with both T2DM and MASLD, the primary determinants of GV were HbA1c and 2h CP levels.

The present study primarily relied on ultrasound examinations for the diagnosis of MASLD. However, it is important to note that the sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting MASLD is limited, particularly when the degree of hepatic cell steatosis is below 20%. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound is inadequate in severely obese populations. Compared to other imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abdominal ultrasound avoids ionizing radiation and is more cost-effective, making it a safer and more economically viable option. Additionally, our team included highly skilled and experienced physicians specializing in abdominal ultrasonography. Their expertise ensured accurate interpretation of ultrasound images and precise diagnostic assessments.

Given the retrospective design of this study, the analysis was constrained by the reliance on preexisting clinical records, which lacked standardized grading for hepatic steatosis, documentation of diabetes duration, and detailed information on antidiabetic medication use, thus hindering a thorough evaluation of disease severity. In our study, GV was assessed using multi-point capillary glucose measurements obtained during hospitalization for the 2897 eligible patients. It should be noted that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers superior surveillance of glycemic excursions compared to fingertip multi-point blood glucose monitoring, especially for postprandial peaks, nocturnal nadirs, and other subtle fluctuations. A study compared CGM and capillary sampling in measuring postprandial blood glucose responses in 15 healthy adults after fasting and exposure to food stimuli. The results showed that CGM recorded significantly higher postprandial glucose levels than capillary sampling, with a mean difference of +0.9 ± 0.5 mmol/L (p< 0.001). Without baseline adjustment, CGM overestimated the duration of hyperglycemia (blood glucose >7.8 mmol/L) by about fourfold, and even after adjustment, it still overestimated by approximately twofold (p< 0.01). Additionally, the glycemic index (GI) measured by CGM was 69 (95% CI: 48–99), significantly higher than the capillary value of 53 (95% CI: 40-69,p= 0.05) [32]. However, comparative data on CGM in patients with MASLD and diabetes mellitus is currently lacking. Considering the above analysis, we hypothesize that, within the population we retrospectively reviewed, the use of CGM may detect greater glucose fluctuations.

Notably, the duration of diabetes and the use of antidiabetic medications could serve as potential confounding variables in the analysis of GV. However, the incomplete nature of these data hindered a more in-depth investigation into the relationship between GV and MASLD. Evidence indicated that long-standing diabetes led to progressive β-cell failure and autonomic neuropathy, resulting in amplified postprandial hyperglycemia, exaggerated nocturnal glucose excursions, and elevated MAGE [33–34]. Additionally, antidiabetic medications exhibit considerable variability in their impact on GV. For instance, sulfonylureas exacerbated GV due to delayed hypoglycemia [35]. In contrast, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced glycemic excursions through delaying gastric emptying and inhibiting glucagon secretion [35], whereas SGLT2 inhibitors attenuated daytime GV [36–37]. While insulin effectively lowers blood glucose and thus reduces glycemic variability in patients, it can also induce hypoglycemia, thereby potentially increasing glycemic variability. Pharmacotherapies, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones, may offer benefits for fatty liver regression. These therapeutic interrelationships and disease chronicity parameters compound the complexity of evaluating antidiabetic agents’ impacts on GV in MASLD patients. Comparing diabetic patients without fatty liver and those with concurrent fatty liver, who are at similar stages of disease progression and receiving the same class of oral hypoglycemic agents, could help minimize the influence of such confounding factors. However, achieving such matching is challenging in real-world settings. Therefore, future prospective studies should incorporate standardized hepatic steatosis grading systems and systematically collect data on disease duration and treatment regimens to enhance the study’s rigor and the reliability of its conclusions.

Finally, this study proposed that the FIB-4 index may serve as a partial substitute for liver biopsy, offering the advantage of cost-effectiveness. This is consistent with the American Diabetes Association’s 2025 Standards of Care in Diabetes [38], which recommend the FIB-4 index as the initial screening modality for hepatic fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, liver biopsy continues to be regarded as the definitive gold standard for diagnosing both hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.
