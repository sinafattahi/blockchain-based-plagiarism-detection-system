Imes et al. (e00001-25) report similar phenotypes in the symbiotic light organs
of the well-known Hawaiian bobtail squid and the hummingbird variety that is robust
to laboratory husbandry and amenable to genetic manipulation. This makes the
hummingbird bobtail squid a strong symbiosis model for future functional
studies.

Timely review by Chin et al. (e02479-24) of an understudied yet ubiquitous bacterial genus
(Mangrovibacter) that is key to bioremediation and
biodegradation applications, as well as in the enhancement of plant growth and food
processing.

Past mining operations have left ecosystems of waste with microbial communities
adapted to the unique geochemistry of their environment. Best et al. (e00434-25) show that these microbes represent
important resources for bioremediation and bioreclamation of valuable elements.

In this study by Vieira and colleagues (e00869-25), amicoumacins produced by aBacillusisolate show promise as biocontrol agents against the Huanglongbing disease that
devastates citrus trees worldwide.

A new methanotroph in theActinomycetotahas broad pH tolerance and
high resistance to ammonia, a ubiquitous competitive inhibitor of methanotrophy.
These findings by Kambara et al. (e00796-25) challenge current knowledge of methanotrophic physiology
and the ecological niches that could serve as methane sinks.

Pogner and team (e00163-25) share a new ELISA method for the identification of
airborne fungal spores that greatly improves bioaerosol surveillance and the
detection of disease-causing agents.

Caravaca-Fuentes et al. (e00734-25) share that bactericidal lipopeptides with specificity for
the lipopolysaccharide ofXylella fastidiosaafford opportunities
for control of this phytopathogen and protection of crops of economic
importance.

A PCR-based method by Paudel and colleagues (e02382-24) simplifies measurements of bacterial growth rates in the
host to more accurately assess the success of pathogens in establishing
infections.
