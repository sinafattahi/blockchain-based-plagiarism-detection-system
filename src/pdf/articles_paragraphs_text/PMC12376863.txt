Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3samples were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method. Structural analysis revealed that the samples crystallized in an orthorhombic structure phase with aPbnmspace group. The average crystallite sizes were around 283 nm and 574 nm for Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3, respectively. Derivative absorption spectrum fitting (DASF) and first-derivative reflectance (dR/dλ) methods confirmed that the samples possess a direct wide band gap, with energies of 5.93 eV and 5.90 eV, respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3underλex= 377 nm excitation exhibits a green emission and intense sharp red lines at 680 nm, 697 nm, 705 nm, 717 nm and 758 nm. The green emission corresponds to the transitions2H11/2→4I15/2and4S3/2→4I15/2of Er3+ions, while the sharp red lines are attributed to transitions between intrinsic defect centers related to the GdAlO3host coupled to B3g(4) and B1g(7) vibrational modes. Efficient energy transferviaresonant phonon-assisted and cross-relaxation processes from Er3+and intrinsic defect centers to Cr3+is responsible for the decrease in green and red emission line intensities in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3. The energy transfer from Er3+and intrinsic defect centers indicates that red emission lines at 697 nm and 726 nm in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3mainly originate from the2T1(2G) →4A2(4F) and2Eg(2G) →4A2g(4F) transitions of Cr3+ions.

Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3samples were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method.

Perovskite compounds serve as excellent host materials for various optical applications due to their chemical and thermal stability.1,2They follow the generic formula ABO3. Rare-earth orthoaluminates (REAlO3), such as gadolinium aluminate (GdAlO3), possess significant optical, thermal, and mechanical properties, making them appropriate as solid-state laser hosts.3GdAlO3is also known for its relatively high dielectric constant, making it valuable for electronic applications, and is being developed as a potential material for neutron absorption and control rod applications.4In cubic perovskites, the tolerance factor istobs=1,5whereas for GdAlO3with thePbnmspace group,tobs= 0.986,6indicating a slight distortion from the cubic structure. GdAlO3, formed with Gd3+ions having a relatively large ion radius (180.4 pm), closely approaches the ideal cubic perovskite crystal cell (Pm3̄m). GdAlO3with thePbnmspace group demonstrates a high accommodation capacity within the perovskite structure and assists in the modulation of its electronic and spectroscopic properties through the substitution of Gd3+with various rare-earth activators (e.g., Eu3+, Er3+, Tb3+, Ce3+, Yb3+, Dy3+) and Al3+with a transition metal activator ion such as Cr3+and Mn4+. In this structure, the Gd3+ion occupies a non-centrosymmetric site, leading to mixing of the 4fnstates with the first excited configuration 4fn−15d. This mixing is caused by the odd terms in the crystal field, and is responsible for the strength of induced electric dipole transitions. GdAlO3with thePbnmspace group is appropriate for generating intense 4f electric dipole transitions, thereby enabling efficient luminescence. In recent years, trivalent rare-earth ions (RE3+) and transition-metal fluorescence in diverse host matrices have attracted significant attention due to their applications in persistent luminescent materials, photo-functional materials and luminescence thermometry.7–10Doping GdAlO3with transition metals and rare-earth ions is therefore of great interest for the development of advanced optical materials. Cr3+, in particular, is a transition-metal ion that acts as both a trapping and recombination center and has been widely studied in persistent luminescence research. Its unique properties can enhance the performance of imaging techniques, providing valuable insights into biological systems forin vivobioimaging.11,12However, the concentration of Cr3+must be carefully optimized: a low concentration results in weak luminescence, whereas a high concentration leads to quenching, thereby reducing both the intensity and afterglow duration. A recent study by Jinan Xuet al.13demonstrated that La0.9898Er0.01Sm0.0002Al0.995Cr0.005O3exhibits long-term persistent luminescence at 1553 nm due to the Er3+: (4I13/2→4I15/2) transition, as well as at 734 nm, due to the Cr3+: (2E (2G) →4A2(4F)) transition. In ZnGa2O4: Cr3+14the persistent luminescence intensity increases with Cr3+concentration up to 0.4–0.6%, after which concentration quenching reduces both intensity and lifetime. Moreover, in recent studies, the emission intensity of Cr3+reaches its optimum at 0.5 mol% Cr3+concentration and can be further enhanced by Li+ion in Cr3+/Li+co-doping ZnGa2O4phosphor15. The lifetimes of the4T2(4F) and2E states of Cr3+decrease with increasing concentrations of Cr3+and Cr3+/Li+ions.15Similarly, a recent study reported by Ekta Raiet al.16demonstrated that in Cr3+and Eu3+co-doped LaVO4, the emission intensity is optimal at 0.5 mol% Cr3+and 1 mol% Eu3+concentration. The emission intensity at 614 nm, corresponding to the5D0→7F2transition in the Eu3+doped LaVO4phosphor, reduces when Cr3+ion is co-doped due to energy transfer between Cr3+and Eu3+.16This energy transfer was confirmed by the decrease of the lifetime of the5D0level of Eu3+ions in Eu3+, Cr3+co-doped LaVO4phosphor.16Understanding the energy levels of dopant ions, traps states, in GdAlO3host and the energy transfer process between them is crucial for evaluating the suitability of material for optical applications such as LEDs, plant growth lighting, andin vivooptical imaging. The experimental origin of luminescence in GdAlO3is studied by K Dhahriet al.17The energy levels of Cr3+combined with various trivalent lanthanides in GdAlO3have been studied by Hongde Luo and Pieter Dorenbos18. However, to the best of our knowledge, Er3+, Cr3+Co-doped GdAlO3has not yet been explored. Taking this into account, the present work reports for the first time the synthesis and investigation of a Er3+, Cr3+co-doped GdAlO3. This study aims to elucidate the energy transfer process occurring between Er3+, Cr3+, and traps states (intrinsic defects). Furthermore, based on both experimental results and theoretical optical considerations, we propose a detailed mechanism for the energy transfer involving Er3+, Cr3+, and the trap states.

The GdAlO3, Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3samples were prepared using a conventional solid-state reaction method. Gd2O3(99%), Al2O3(99%), Cr2O3(99%), and Er2O3(99%) were used as starting raw materials in stoichiometric amounts. The precursor materials were ground into fine powders using an agate mortar. The powders were initially annealed at 700 °C and then reground, pestled, and gradually heated to 1200 °C in an alumina crucible, where they were sintered for four hours. Finally, the powders were pressed into pellets with an 8 mm diameter. Several techniques were employed to characterize the physical and structural properties of the compounds. The phase compositions of Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer utilizing CuKαradiation (λ= 1.5406 Å) over a range of 20°–100°, with a step size of 0.02°. The powder morphology and chemical homogeneity were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a TESCAN VEGA3 SBH instrument equipped with an energy dispersive microscopy (EDS) detector. Raman spectra were recorded in the range of 50–1100 cm−1using a Horiba LabRam HR Evolution micro-Raman confocal system, with wavelength laser excitations atλ= 532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm. Absorption and reflectance spectra were recorded using a (SHIMADZU, UV-3101PC) UV–vis–IR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence emission (PL) and excitation (PLE) measurements were recorded using a Horiba–Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog 322 spectrometer in time-resolved mode, using a pulsed lamp with a 0.05 ms post-flash delay.

The morphological characterization of Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3and Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3compounds was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as illustrated inFig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The SEM images show that the particles are approximately spherical. Due to the high surface energy of the nanoparticles, the synthesized samples exhibit noticeable aggregation at the annealing temperature.29The grain size distribution, shown in the inset ofFig. 4(a) and (b), was analyzed using Image J software, and the resulting histograms were fitted to a Lorentzian function. The average grain size distribution revealed peaks around 300 nm for Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and 639 nm for Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3as presented inFig. 4(a) and (b), and summarized inTable 1. Furthermore, energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were recorded for both samples, as illustrated inFig. 4(c) and (d). The EDS spectra confirm the existence of the expected constituent elements: Gd, Er, Al, Cr, and O. These results further confirm the compositional purity of the synthesized compound.

whereRand IR denote, respectively, their Raman and infrared spectral activity.Fig. 5and6display the Raman spectra of Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3respectively, recorded using excitation wavelengths of 532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm. By comparing the spectra obtained with various excitation wavelengths, it is possible to distinguish between Raman scattering and luminescence based on their distinct natures: bands with fixed locations are true Raman bands, whereas bands that shift in position are associated with luminescence.31By extending the collection range to 1100 cm−1, our measurement revealed several intense and clearly non-vibrational extra bands above 579 cm−1. These bands were attributed to fluorescence as they resemble the characteristic f–f transitions of trivalent lanthanide ions. The appearance of resonance Raman, resonance fluorescence and relaxed fluorescence can be attributed to the excitation energies of the wavelength's excitation 532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm which are resonant with the transitions4I15/2→4S3/2,4I15/2→4F9/2,4I15/2→4I9/2of Er3+, respectively.32Raman spectra of Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3collected with 532 nm laser excitation are shown inFig. 5 (a)and6(a). They present prominent peaks at 330 cm−1, 355 cm−1, 403 cm−1, 468 cm−1, 507 cm−1, 545 cm−1, 579 cm−1assigned respectively to Resonance Raman and resonance fluorescence associated to the vibrations modes B3g(3), Ag(5), B3g(4), B2g(4), B1g(6), B3g(5), B1g(7).30The peaks at 281 cm−1, 625 cm−1, 677 cm−1, 734 cm−1, 807 cm−1, 892 cm−1, 947 cm−1, 1026 cm−1are assigned to the vibration modes 2B2g(1), 2Ag(4), 2B3g(3), 2Ag(5), 2B3g(4), 2Ag(6), 2B2g(4), 2B1g(6)30related to relaxed fluorescence. The bands of Raman spectra of Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3recorded with 785 nm laser excitation in the vicinity of 1000 cm−1are clearly due to relaxed fluorescence. Some vibration modes such Ag(3) at 235 cm−1(ref.30) occur only under 785 nm excitation, the vibrations mode B1g(3) at 220 cm−1appear only under 633 nm excitation, whereas the vibrations mode at Ag(4) at 314 cm−1appear only under 633 nm excitation. The bands at 403 cm−1and 579 cm−1due to B3g(4) and B1g(7) vibration modes are true Raman bands since they have fixed locations and do not depend on the wavelength excitation. They appear under all the wavelengths excitations of 532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm.

The plot left side ofeqn (11)for Gd0.99AlEr0.01O3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3samples is shown inFig. 8. The peak maxima can be used to determine the band gap energy, as seen inFig. 8, atthe peak maximum discontinuity occurs. The optical band gap is computed asUsing the obtained λg, the resulting values are (5.93 ± 0.01) eV and (5.90 ± 0.01) eV for Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3respectively. Marottiet al.showed that for direct band gap semiconductors, dR/dλpeaks close toEg, whereas for indirect band gap compounds, it approaches zero.Fig. 9confirms the direct character of the optical band gap Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3, indicating that dR/dλreaches a maximum at about 5.93 eV and 5.90 eV for Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3samples. The optical band gap values determinedviathe derivation of absorption spectrum fitting (DASF) and the first derivative of reflectance, dR/dλ, are the same. This supports the correctness of the band gap energy values found. The decrease in the band gap of Gd0.99AlEr0.01O3when doped with low concentration of Cr3+ions introduces localized energy levels within the band gap which act as both deep electron and deep hole traps within the Gd0.99AlEr0.01O3band gap. These traps are localized and do not merge with the conduction or valence bands at low doping levels. At low concentrations, these levels do not significantly alter the overall electronic structure or the positions of the conduction and valence bands.18The increased hybridization Cr–O between the Cr-3d and O-2p orbitals due Cr3+incorporation modifies slightly the top of the valence band which may shift upward (due to Cr 3d–O 2p interactions) or the bottom of the conduction band may shift downward.38So, the band gap remains nearly unchanged.

whereΩλare the Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters. The terms in brackets represent the doubly reduced matrix elements in intermediate coupling.Jis the total angular momentum of the initial state,his the Planck constant,cis the speed of light,Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019is the mean wavelength corresponding to the specific absorption band of a transition |S,L,J> to the state|S′,L′,J′> andnis the refractive index of GdAlO3. Assuming that the host matrix has minimal influence on these values, we take this value as the value of Er3+in aqueous solutions (aq), or Er3+in LaF3crystal as mentioned in ref.44. The transitions from the ground state4I15/2to the excited states2H11/2and4G11/2are characterized by large reduced matrix elements of the unit tensor.32Thus, they present a high population densities of Er3+ions in these excited state4G11/2and2H11/2. According toeqn (5)and(6), this may result in strong absorption exhibited in the PLE spectrum.32The existence of a significant electric dipole transition4I15/2→4G11/2implies that Er3+ions occupy non-centrosymmetric sites in the GdAlO3lattice. The appearance of the emission line at 542 nm (4S3/2→4I15/2) transition under 377 nm excitation can be attributed to three factors: firstly, strong absorption to the4G11/2state sinceλex= 377 nm is a resonant excitation, secondly the rate of multiphonon relaxation4G11/2→2H9/2→4F3/2→4F5/2→4F7/2→2H11/2→4S3/2exceeds the probability of radiative decay transitions to the ground state4I15/2; finally, the high energy separation between the emitted level4S3/2and4F9/2level. However, the high intensity of the emission line at 542 nm under 521 nm excitation (4I15/2→2H11/2) can be attributed to the large reduced matrix elements of the unit tensor of this transition, leading to high cross-absorption to the2H11/2state. Moreover, the lowest energy separation (approximately 1000 cm−1) between the emitted level4S3/2and2H11/2levels increases the multiphonon relaxation. Hence, the multiphonon relaxation from2H11/2to4S3/2level is efficient, which induces the population of4S3/2level. The increase of the intensity of the 542 nm emission line (4S3/2→4I15/2) with decreasing wavelength excitation from 406 nm to 487 nm can be explained by the multi-phonon relaxation between the excited level and the emitting level4S3/2, which is governed by the energy-gap law or phonon law.45The multi-phonon relaxation rate (Wnr) increases with decreasing energy separation between the excited levels and the emitting level4S3/2. Hence, the emission at 542 nm increases with decreasing wavelength excitation from 406 nm (4I15/2→2H9/2) to 487 nm (4I15/2→4F7/2). The energy separation between the4S3/2and4F9/2levels is approximately 3100 cm−1,32requiring five phonons (579 cm−1each) to bridge the gap. Therefore, the non-radiative relaxation from4S3/2to4F9/2highly inefficient. As a result, the red emission intensity at 655 nm is lower than the green emission intensity at 542 nm under 377 nm excitation in Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3(Fig. 10). The Photoluminescence process at 542 nm under 377 nm excitation in Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3is shown inFig. 15.

B0= 918 cm−1,C0= 4133 cm−1,48ξ0= 275 cm−1andα0= 30 cm−1,48which refer to the free ion parameters of Cr3+. The matrix elements of the crystal field, spin–orbit, and Trees Hamiltonians in the basics are provided by Y. Y. Yeung and C. Rudowicz.50The full Hamiltonian matrixH(as defined ineqn (14)) was diagonalized to derive the energy levels as a function of the Racah parametersBandC, the crystal field parameterDq, and the spin–orbit coupling constant. This diagonalization was performed using unique code developed in our lab with the Maple program. The theoretical computed values areB= 635 cm−1,C= 3008 cm−1andDq= 1776 cm−1with (Dq/B= 2.79). The calculated parameters were used to calculate the energy levels at room temperature, as listed inTable 2. The Tanabe–Sugano diagram for Cr3+ions in octahedral site symmetry, shown for the ratioC/B= 4.73 inFig. 17, illustrates the overall behavior of Cr3+energy levels in terms ofDq/Brelative to the local field intensity. The vertical line corresponds to the calculatedDq/Bvalue from our theoretical computation of Cr3+levels in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3. It is well known that whenDq/B< 2.3, Cr3+ions experience a weak crystal field, resulting in broad-band emission. However, whenDq/B> 2.3, the ions exhibit strong and narrow peak emission through the2E(2G) →4A2(4F) transitions.51In our case, the calculatedDq/B= 2.9, confirms that the energy of the2E state is the lowest excited energy level. These results demonstrate that Cr3+ions experience a strong crystal field, exhibiting sharp2E(2G) →4A2(4F) emission at 726 nm.

τErandτEr,Cr, are the life times of the Er3+:4S3/2level in Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3respectively. The ET efficiency (ηET) from Er3+:4S3/2to the Cr3+: as indicated from the energy level diagram inFig. 19can be estimated to be 76%. Which indicate highly efficient energy transfer from Er3+:4S3/2to the Cr3+:4T2g(4F). In rare-earth ion systems, energy transfer exchange interactions are generally negligible due to the small spatial extent of 4f orbitals, making multipolar mechanisms dominant. Specifically, in GdAlO3, efficient trapping of excitation energy by Cr3+and rare earth ions like Er3+is attributed to multipolar interactions when there is spectral overlap, while exchange interactions play a minor role and are only significant for rare earth ions lacking allowed absorption bands.52Therefore, for Er3+–Cr3+pairs in GdAlO3, multipolar interactions are expected to dominate the energy transfer process, provided there is suitable spectral overlap between their energy levels. The non-radiative energy transfer in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3is taken place through the following cross-relaxations: (2H11/2+4A2(4F) →4I15/2+4T2(4F)), (4S3/2+4A2(4F) →4I15/2+4T2(4F)) transitions andviaresonant phonon-assisted energy transfer (Fig. 19). This energy transfer process involving Er3+ions explain the strong luminescence quenching of the emission bands at 542 nm, 521 nm and the appearance of an intense emission line at 726 nm when Cr3+is incorporated. The decay of the emission at 697 nm under 377 nm excitation in Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3is bi-exponential with lifetimesτ′= 2.61 ms. andτ′′ = 1.18 ms. Biexponential decay indicates that there are two different mechanisms that affect the decay dynamics and energy transfer may be one of these mechanisms. The decay curve shows two lifetimes: a longer time 2.61 ms (no transfer), a shorter time 1.18 (efficient transfer). This fact indicates that there is energy transfer from intrinsic defects to Er3+ions in Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3. However, the decay curve at 697 nm under 377 nm excitation in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3is described by a double-exponential equationI(t) =I01exp(−t/τ1) +I02exp (−t/τ2), whereIis the luminescence intensity;I01= 1844 andI02= 1258 are constants;trepresents time,τ1= 1.69 ms andτ2= 10.77 ms are decay times for the respective exponential components. The absence of the bands at 565 nm and 413 nm in the PLE spectrum of Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3monitored at 697 nm indicates that the 697 nm emission line arise not only from electron transition between intrinsic defects centers, but also from the transition2T1(2G)→4A2(4F) of Cr3+. This assignment is justified since the experimental value 697 nm (14 347 cm−1) is well reproduced by theoretical value of the transition inTable 2. Moreover, the highest-value lifetimeτ2= 10.77 ms is characteristic of the spin-forbidden transition.τ1= 1.69 ms is fluorescence lifetime of 697 nm emission coming from the electron transition between two defects centers. The co-doping with chromium leads to a reduction of fluorescence lifetime of 697 nm emission from 2.61 ms to 1.69 ms, indicating that there is an increase in the transfer rateKTconstant. A dramatic decrease in the 697 nm emission line intensity and the appearance of an intense emission line at 726 nm support the energy transfer from oxygen-vacancies to Cr3+ionsviaresonant phonon-assisted energy transfer from oxygen defect to Cr3+:4T2(4F) level and cross-relaxation processes (Fig. 19). The value of the constantsI01andτ1in the PL decay at 697 nm under 377 nm excitation in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3indicate that a very low partI01exp(−t/τ1) of the emission at 697 nm is originating from electron transition between two intrinsic defects centers coupled to the B3g(4) and B1g(7) vibrational modes. The highest partI02exp (−t/τ2) of the emission at 697 nm inGd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3is originating from the transition2T1(2G) →4A2(4F) of Cr3+. The energy transfer from Er3+, defects centers to Cr3+and the high multiphonon relaxation from2T1(2G) to the2E (2G) level, induces the intense line at 726 nm through the transition2E (2G) →4A2(4F) of Cr3+(Fig. 19). Based on the experimental results and the theoretical optical considerations, the energy transfer process between Er3+, Cr3+and oxygen-vacancies underλex= 377 nm is presented inFig. 19and (Table 3).

Gd0.99Er0.01AlO3and Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3samples were successfully synthesized using the solid-state reaction method. XRD analysis confirmed that both samples crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with aPbnmspace group. Using the Derivation of absorption spectrum fitting (DASF) and the first derivative of reflectance dR/dλmethods, the optical band gaps were determined to be 5.93 eV and 5.90 eV, respectively. Red emission peaks at 680, 697, 705, 717, and 758 nm were observed in both samples and are ascribed transition involving intrinsic defects coupled with the B3g(4) and B1g(7) vibrational modes. Co-doping with Cr3+induced a significant decrease in Er3+emission intensity, particularly the intensity of red lines at 680, 697, 705, 717 nm. The weak peak at 693 nm and the intense peak at 726 nm are assigned to the2T1(2G) →4A2(4F) and2Eg(2G) →4A2g(4F) transitions of Cr3+. PL spectra and decay curves at 697 nm and 542 nm under 377 nm excitation confirmed efficient non-radiative energy transfer from Er3+and intrinsic defects to Cr3+ions. The energy transfer occursviaresonant phonon-assisted processes from the Er3+ 2H11/2and4S3/2levels to the Cr3+:4T2(4F) level, followed by cross-relaxations (2H11/2+4A2(4F) →4I15/2+4T2(4F)),(4S3/2+4A2(4F) →4I15/2+4T2(4F)). Decay curves at 697 nm indicate that the lower part of this emission originates from transition involving intrinsic defects coupled with vibrational modes, while the highest part of the emission at 697 nm in Gd0.99Er0.01Al0.995Cr0.05O3is due to the Cr3+ 2T1(2G) →4A2(4F) transition. Finally, energy transfer from Er3+, defect to Cr3+and the high relaxation from2T1(2G) to the2E (2G) level induce the intense line at 726 nm due to the transition2E (2G) →4A2(4F) of Cr3+.
