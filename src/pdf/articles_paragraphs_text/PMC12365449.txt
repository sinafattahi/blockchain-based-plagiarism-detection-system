The COMPASSION-15 clinical trial demonstrated that cadonilimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved clinical benefits in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.

We compared three treatment regimens based on the COMPASSION-15 trial, including chemotherapy, cadonilimab plus chemotherapy, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) test-guided treatment. A partitioned survival model was constructed at 21-day cycle lengths over a 10-year time horizon to predict total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) under the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three times the gross domestic product per capita ($40,334.05). Model parameters were obtained from a public bid-winning database and published literature. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the model.

In the base case, the costs of chemotherapy, PD-L1 test-guided treatment, and cadonilimab plus chemotherapy were $7,207.78, $15,776.35, and $22,294.58, with QALYs of 0.59, 0.71, and 0.79, respectively. The ICERs of PD-L1 test-guided treatment and cadonilimab plus chemotherapy were $68,751.00 and $76,120.27 per QALY. The ICERs of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy were $58,469.16 and $121,123.92 per QALY for PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ⩾ 5 and <5 HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. The cost of cadonilimab and patient weight were the most influential model parameters. Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy had a 0.01% cost-effectiveness in China.

Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy might be a cost-effective regimen when the unit cost of cadonilimab was $151.48 (58% discount) and $188.04 (72% discount) for overall and PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma.

This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for patients with HER2- advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on the COMPASSION-15 clinical trial from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. The results indicated that PD-L1 test-guided treatment and cadonilimab plus chemotherapy were not cost-effective at current price and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ($40,334.05). Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy might be a cost-effective regimen when the unit cost of cadonilimab was $151.48 (58% discount) for advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the third cause of cancer-related death and the fifth common malignancy in China, with 358,700 new cases and 260,400 deaths in 2022.1Despite the decreasing trend in incidence and mortality, GC continues to exert a significant impact on the cancer burden in China, as the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages.2Gastric adenocarcinoma is the predominant histological type of GC, most of which are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−).3Anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) plus chemotherapy remains the standard first-line treatment of HER2− locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma by the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO).4The survival benefit of PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy was relatively favorable in patients with high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.5Therefore, novel treatments are urgently needed.

Cadonilimab was first approved in China on June 29, 2022, and reimbursed under the basic medical insurance for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.7,9In September 2024, the cadonilimab-related combination regimen was approved as a first-line treatment for unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, and recommended by the guidelines of CSCO Gastric Cancer 2025.4However, it is not yet known whether the survival benefit of cadonilimab justifies the high cost. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. Our analysis provided the first economic evidence to support clinicians in making clinical decisions and decision-makers in allocating limited healthcare resources.

This economic evaluation was based on modeling techniques, price databases, and published literature, so ethics committee approval was exempted. Methodology adhered to the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022)10(Supplemental Table 1).

We developed a partitioned survival model with three mutually exclusive health states (PFS, progressive disease, and death) to predict disease regression of advanced or metastatic HER2− G/GEJ adenocarcinoma over a 10-year time horizon from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system (Figure 1). A 21-day cycle length was chosen for all treatment strategies, as cadonilimab and chemotherapy were administered every 3 weeks.8Patients entered the model from the PFS state, and could either remain in the PFS state or progress to progressive disease or death states.11Once disease has progressed, the patient could only remain in the progressive disease state or transfer to death.11Primary model outcomes included the total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) under the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ($40,334.05).12All costs and QALYs were discounted annually at 5% with a range of 0%–8%, and half-cycle correction was applied.12The model was programmed in Microsoft Excel 2019. All costs were adjusted using the Consumer Price Index for healthcare and converted to US dollars with an exchange rate of 1$ = 7.1217 CNY.

Kaplan–Meier curves for PFS and OS by treatment strategies were extracted to obtain estimates of individual patient data (IPD) using GetData Graph Digitizer 2.26. Then, we reconstructed the Kaplan–Meier curves with the IPD estimates based on the algorithm from Guyot et al.13To extrapolate progression and death beyond the follow-up period, seven parametric survival models were employed to fit survival curves of various intervention arms in the COMPASSION-15 trial, including exponential, Weibull, gamma, generalized gamma, Gompertz, log-normal, and log-logistic models.14Statistical analysis was carried out in R 4.3.2. We selected the optimal parametric survival model based on the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, visual inspection, and clinical plausibility.15In overall patients, Log-normal distributions were used to fit PFS curves, gamma and log-logistic distributions were used to fit OS curves in the chemotherapy and cadonilimab groups, respectively. In PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 patients, log-normal distributions were used to fit PFS and OS curves of cadonilimab groups, and in PD-L1 CPS < 5 patients, log-normal, and log-logistic distributions were used to fit PFS and OS curves of chemotherapy groups, respectively. In accordance with the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society of Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) Task Force Report on Model Transparency and Validation, face validity was assessed by two clinicians, and internal validity was assessed by extreme parameters and substantial code checking.16The fitted results are shown inSupplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figures 1–12.

Each health state was assigned a health utility value anchored in 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health), which was used to calculate QALYs.22Health state utility values for PFS and PD states were 0.853 (95% CI: 0.819–0.887) and 0.610 (95% CI: 0.575–0.645), respectively.23,24The utility value for PFS state was extracted from a cross-sectional study enrolling 243 Chinese GC patients, which used the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) scale and the Chinese value set to calculate utility values.24The utility value for progressive disease was obtained from the RAINBOW clinical trial, which used EQ-5D-3L to measure patient-reported outcomes of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel for previously treated G/GEJ adenocarcinoma.23The loss of QALYs due to severe AEs was estimated by multiplying the incidence of AEs by the corresponding disutility values.25Disutility values caused by severe AEs were collected from published studies.26–29The costs and utilities are presented inTable 1.

One-way (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the base-case results. In the OWSA, the estimated plausible range of the model parameters was based on either 95% CI in the published literature or assuming a 20% change from the base-case value.31The results of OWSA were presented in the form of tornado diagrams. For the PSA, we specified probability distributions to the model parameters, and performed 10,000 second-order Monte Carlo simulations by simultaneously sampling the key parameters from prespecified distributions.32Costs were characterized by Gamma distributions, and utilities, disutility values and incidence by Beta distributions.33The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated to illustrate the most cost-effective treatment regimen under various WTP thresholds.

Compared with chemotherapy, PD-L1 test-guided treatment and cadonilimab plus chemotherapy provided incremental QALYs of 0.12 and 0.20, and incremental LYs of 0.69 and 0.89 with incremental costs of $8568.56 and $15,086.80, respectively. The ICERs were $12,485.82 per LY and $68,751.00 per QALY for PD-L1 test-guided treatment, and $17,025.79 per LY and $76,120.27 per QALY for cadonilimab plus chemotherapy, respectively, in the first-line treatment of HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. Compared with PD-L1 test-guided treatment, the ICERs of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy were $32,615.45 per LY and $88,605.08 per QALY (Table 2).

In comparison to the base-case results, cadonilimab plus chemotherapy provided higher LYs and QALYs with a lower ICER of $58,469.16 per QALY for PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 patients. However, cadonilimab plus chemotherapy provided lower LYs and QALYs with a higher ICER of $121,123.92 per QALY for PD-L1 CPS < 5 HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma (Table 2).

When the unit cost of cadonilimab was $151.48 (58% discount) and $125.36 (48% discount), cadonilimab plus chemotherapy and PD-L1 test-guided treatment would be the high-value options. When the unit cost of cadonilimab was $188.04 (72% discount) and $88.80 (34% discount), cadonilimab plus chemotherapy would be cost-effective for PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 and <5 HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, respectively (Figure 2). Employing health utility values from other sources would increase ICERs, but neither cadonilimab plus chemotherapy nor PD-L1 test-guided treatment was cost-effective compared with chemotherapy (Supplemental Table 3). At the 5-year time horizon, the ICERs of PD-L1 test-guided treatment and cadonilimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy were $70,895.58 per QALY and $78,019.48 per QALY, respectively (Supplemental Table 4).

The most influential parameters were the cost of cadonilimab and patient weight. However, none of the parameters reduced ICERs below the WTP threshold. The ICERs ranged from $57,997.71 to $79,504.29 for PD-L1 test-guided treatment versus chemotherapy, and $59,271.35 to $92,969.18 for cadonilimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (Figure 3). The results of the OWSA confirmed that our model was robust. At the WTP threshold of $40,334.05, cadonilimab plus chemotherapy had 0.01% and 1.13% probabilities of being cost-effective compared with chemotherapy for overall and PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma (Figure 4andSupplemental Figures 13 and 14).

Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration for the treatment of cervical cancer and G/GEJ adenocarcinoma.6–8To our knowledge, this was the first cost-effectiveness analysis of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. This economic evaluation revealed that the ICERs of PD-L1 test-guided treatment and cadonilimab plus chemotherapy were $68,751.00 and $76,120.27 per QALY compared with chemotherapy, both exceeding the WTP threshold of $40,334.05 in China. Our findings provided critical insights for healthcare decision-makers and supported reimbursement decisions for medical insurance.

The unit cost of cadonilimab and patient weight were the most critical variables driving the results of the model. Although cadonilimab-based combination regimens significantly improved the survival benefits for HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, the current pricing of cadonilimab dramatically exceeded its marginal clinical value. As a result, substantial price reductions would reverse its cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness threshold analysis suggested that when the unit cost of cadonilimab was reduced to $151.48 and $125.36, the ICERs for cadonilimab plus chemotherapy and PD-L1 test-guided treatment were $39,895.11 per QALY and $40,254.78 per QALY lower than the WTP threshold of $40,334.05. Compared to overall and PD-L1 CPS < 5 HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, cadonilimab plus chemotherapy had a higher probability of being cost-effective in PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 patients because lower price reductions were needed. In addition to the cost of cadonilimab, patient weight was another critical parameter because cadonilimab was administered based on body weight.6–8Thus, cadonilimab would be unfavorable in overweight or obese patients because of the higher dosages and expenditures required. Future clinical trials should investigate the suitable dosage and evaluate whether varying dosages influence the clinical efficacy and incidence of severe AEs associated with cadonilimab.

Apart from cadonilimab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, sintilimab, and zolbetuximab were other available regimens for the first-line treatment of HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma.5Three economic evaluations based on the CheckMate 649 clinical trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic HER2− G/GEJ adenocarcinoma using state-transitioned Markov models, and demonstrated that the ICER of nivolumab plus chemotherapy ranged from $191,266 per QALY to $430,185 per QALY, considerably higher than the WTP threshold of three times GDP per capita.20,34,35Nivolumab plus chemotherapy was unlikely to be a cost-effective first-line therapy in advanced HER2− G/GEJ adenocarcinoma from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.20,34,35Lang et al. developed a Markov model based on the KEYNOTE-859 clinical trial and revealed that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was cost-effective compared with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 10 locally advanced or metastatic HER2− G/GEJ adenocarcinoma in China.36Two cost-effectiveness analyses established partitioned survival models to investigate the cost-effectiveness of sintilimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy by the ORIENT-16 clinical trial and indicated that sintilimab plus chemotherapy was a cost-effective first-line treatment option for overall, PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 and <5 advanced HER2− G/GEJ adenocarcinoma in China.37,38Zolbetuximab, a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody, significantly prolonged PFS (HR: 0.687, 95% CI: 0.544–0.866) and OS (HR: 0.771, 95% CI: 0.615–0.965) compared with chemotherapy in the first-line therapy for patients with CLDN18.2-positive, HER2− locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2− G/GEJ adenocarcinoma.39Three studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of zolbetuximab plus CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) based on the GLOW clinical trial and showed that the ICER of zolbetuximab plus CAPOX ranged from $185,353 per QALY to $388,186 per QALY in China.19,40,41In general, compared to imported drugs, domestically produced innovative drugs have become high-value therapeutic options by virtue of their relatively lower market prices.

Cervical and G/GEJ cancers were important indications for cadonilimab, and multi-center randomized controlled trials have been conducted in China.6–8In the COMPASSION-16 trial, cadonilimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved median PFS (12.7 months vs 8.1 months; HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.49–0.80) and median OS (27.0 months vs 22.8 months; HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.48–0.86) compared to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.6Three cost-effectiveness analyses revealed that cadonilimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab was not cost-effective as first-line treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.42–44The cost-effectiveness probability of cadonilimab would exceed 52% if the price of cadonilimab were reduced by 50%.42Therefore, cadonilimab was more likely to be cost-effective in cervical cancer than HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, as fewer price reductions were required.

Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy and PD-L1 test-guided treatment might not be cost-effective compared with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma in China. When the unit cost of cadonilimab was $151.48 (58% discount), $188.04 (72% discount), and $88.80 (34% discount), cadonilimab plus chemotherapy was a cost-effective option for overall, PD-L1 CPS ⩾ 5 and <5 HER2− advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, respectively.
