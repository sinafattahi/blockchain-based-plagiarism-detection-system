Environmental and social factors, such as the place of residence, social relations quality, and cell phone addiction, may influence the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of social relations quality and cell phone addiction in the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life among medical students residing in dormitories. In this cross-sectional study, 380 medical students who resided in the university dormitory participated. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), WHO Quality-of-Life Scale, Social Relational Quality Scale, and Cell phone Addiction Scale were used. Pearson correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling were used for data analysis through Macro PROCESS SPSS (Model 4). This study indicated that medical students residing in dormitories who experienced better sleep quality and stronger social relations quality reported an enhanced quality of life. The indirect effect of sleep quality on the quality of life was mediated by social relations quality (Effect=˗0.09, 95% CI: ˗0.18 to ˗0.02). The cell phone addiction did not mediate the effect of sleep quality on the quality of life (Effect=˗0.006, 95% CI: ˗0.04 to 0.02). Given the mediating role of social relations quality in the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life in medical students residing in dormitories, by increasing in quality of sleep using improved quality of social relations led to a better quality of life.

Living conditions may affect sleep1. The sleep environment in dormitories posed significant challenges for many students, with common issues including uncomfortable room temperatures and frequent noise disturbances2. Crowded places were associated with short sleep duration1. Medical students residing in dormitories frequently report concerns related to subjective sleep quality, prolonged sleep latency, and daytime dysfunction3. It indicated potential challenges in maintaining optimal sleep health in medical students. The mean score of sleep quality of the medical students residing in dormitories indicated a poor level3. It reflects significant challenges in maintaining healthy sleep patterns in such living environments. Researchers revealed that approximately half of the medical students reported good subjective sleep quality4. A study showed that half of the students slept less than 7 h a night5. While studies indicate high rates of poor sleep quality among medical students (e.g., 62˗86%)6,7there is a lack of consensus, which may reflect differences in participants, cultural context, or assessment tools. These inconsistencies highlight the need for context-specific research, particularly within structured environments such as dormitories.

Several key factors were associated with an increased likelihood of poor sleep quality, including high academic stress, high employment stress, dissatisfaction with dormitory hygiene, poor self-rated physical health, poor self-rated mental health, and higher mobile phone dependency8. Furthermore, poor sleep quality among medical students residing in dormitories is not only a widespread concern but also a critical issue due to broader implications. Inadequate sleep could have several negative outcomes, including increased anxiety levels, deterioration of sleep hygiene practices, higher likelihood of current alcohol and tobacco use9and poor medical performance10and academic achievement11. Given the demanding nature of medical education and the intensity of students’ academic and clinical responsibilities12poor sleep can increase the risk of occupational accidents, clinical errors, and compromised patient safety13. Addressing sleep-related challenges is, therefore, essential not only for the students’ personal health and academic success but also for ensuring safe and effective future healthcare practice.

Living arrangements such as residence in dormitories may affect not only sleep quality but also other aspects of overall quality of life. This effect may be attributed to higher room density and closer proximity to communal areas, which can lead to increased crowding and reduced privacy14. Researchers revealed that the built environment significantly influences the students’ health across healthcare disciplines, including medicine, nursing, midwifery, and related fields15. These dormitory-related stressors can be explained using “Environmental Stress Theory”, which highlights how physical surroundings—such as noise, overcrowding, and limited privacy—can lead to psychological strain and disrupt quality of life. In this context, such stressors may impair the sleep quality, contribute to emotional fatigue, and reduce students’ quality of life. They may also influence how students cope, leading to behaviors like cell phone addiction or greater dependence on social interactions for support16. A study conducted on medical students residing in dormitories at Shahid Beheshti University in Iran revealed that 60% of participants experienced severe levels of stress17. It highlighted the significant psychological challenges associated with their living conditions. In addition to environmental factors such as dormitories, the academic schedule of medical students may also affect their lives. A study reported that medical curriculum might link to a reduced quality of life among medical students, particularly in the physical and psychological aspects18. A study conducted on medical students in Sao Paulo revealed that quality of life dimensions –physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environmental factors- were generally at a moderate level. However, this research did not specifically focus on students residing in dormitories, as it included both dormitory and non-dormitory residents19.

In response to environmental stressors present in dormitory life and based on environmental stress theory, social relations may serve as an important coping resource. Studies indicated that medical students residing in dormitories reported higher levels of perceived social support from family, friends, and others compared to those living in student housing and private homes20. A greater number of family members with medical backgrounds affect belonging to the field and better grade expectations21. Another study indicated that medical students often received emotional support from their peers, roommates, families, and, in some cases, even patients. Most of the participants identified their peers as a crucial source of both support and knowledge, with trust in these relationships deepening over time22. On the other hand, researchers revealed that 60.3% of medical students reported they had experienced reduced levels of social support20. Although some findings suggested higher levels of perceived support in dormitories, others reported a reduction in social support among medical students. These mixed results point to the complex and potentially dual role of dormitory living—both as a source of connection and of strain—depending on the quality of interpersonal relationships and coping resources.

Another common response to dormitory-related stress and reduced face-to-face interaction is increased reliance on digital communication tools, particularly cell phones. Recently, the use of social networks via cell phones has become increasingly prevalent, particularly among medical students, as a means of communication and learning. In dormitory settings, where medical students are often separated from their families, they may develop a heightened reliance on social media or other digital platforms. A meta-analysis study showed that medical students primarily used their cell phones for text messaging, with photo sharing and social networking being the next most common activities23. According to studies, excessive cell phone usage was observed in 10.7% and 48% of medical students24,25. A meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of cell phone addiction to be 39% among medical students23. Another study reported that 44% of medical students had cell phone addiction4.

The challenges faced by medical students residing in dormitories can be understood within the biopsychosocial framework26which considers how biological factors (such as sleep quality), psychological factors (like stress and phone addiction), and social elements (such as social relations quality) interact to influence the quality of life. This approach highlights the importance of addressing not just individual behaviors but also the social and environmental context in which medical students live and study. Applying this lens helps to frame poor sleep and reduced quality of life not as isolated problems, but as interconnected outcomes shaped by multiple interacting influences.

In this study, researchers posed the question: What factors might affect the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life in medical students? There were only a limited number of studies in this area. One study reported that quality of life was associated with sleep quality and depression in medical students19. It was reported that neighborhood and building problems were related to more sleep disturbance and poorer sleep quality1. Roommate relationships significantly affect the sleep quality of medical students living in dormitories3. It highlighted the role of social dynamics in sleep health. Social support is associated to subjective well-being27and stress28in medical students. Research indicated that poor sleep quality served as a significant risk factor for cell phone addiction among medical students29.

1) Poor sleep quality is negatively associated with quality of life among medical students residing in dormitories.

2) Higher social relations quality is positively associated with quality of life, while greater cell phone addiction is negatively associated with the quality of life among medical students residing in dormitories.

3) Higher social relations quality is negatively associated with lower mean score of sleep quality, while greater cell phone addiction is positively associated with higher mean score of sleep quality among medical students residing in dormitories.

4) Social relations quality will mediate the negative effect of poor sleep quality on the quality of life among the medical students residing in dormitories.

5) Cell phone addiction will mediate the negative effect of poor sleep quality on the quality of life among medical students residing in dormitories.

This is an analytical and cross-sectional study. An analytical cross-sectional design was chosen because the study aimed not only to describe the levels of sleep quality, quality of life, cell phone addiction, and social relations quality among medical students residing in dormitories but also to examine the relationships and potential mediating effects among these variables.

Shiraz University of Medical Sciences was the setting of this study.

The participants were students of medicine, nursing, operating room nursing, midwifery, pharmacy, dentistry, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, healthcare services management, radiography and imaging sciences, laboratory science, emergency medical services, anesthesiology, environmental health, community health, public health, and nutrition sciences.

The inclusion criteria for this study were medical students enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs, aged 18 years or older, students who had resided in dormitories for a minimum of one semester and spent at least four days per week in the dormitories.

Students were excluded if they self-reported a diagnosed psychiatric disorder or neurological condition that might impact their sleep or quality of life. Additional exclusion criteria included the use of medications affecting sleep or mental health, a history of substance abuse, not residing in the dormitories for at least four days per week during the past semester or providing incomplete responses to key sections of the questionnaire.

In this study, the sample size for the structural equation model was calculated based on the guideline of having 10 to 15 participants per observed variable30. With 21 observed variables, including sleep quality and its seven dimensions, quality of life and its four dimensions, social relations quality and its two dimensions, and cell phone addition with its three dimensions, the minimum required sample size was determined to be 315 (21 × 15). According to the potential 20% dropout rate, the final target sample size was adjusted to approximately 380 medical students.

Sample size for each stratum = (stratum size /population size) × total sample size.

For instance, with 430 nursing students among 4000 students, the sample size for this stratum was calculated as (430/4000) × 380 = 41 nursing students. Once the number of students for each discipline was determined (e.g. 41 nursing students), a list of students residing in dormitories was compiled. These students were then randomly invited to participate in the study.

The social relations quality scale comprises 17 items, with responses scored using a four-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” (scored as 1) to “strongly agree” (scored as 4). The overall scores on this scale can range from 17 to 68. It is designed to evaluate people’s relationships with family and friends and consists of three subscales: family intimacy (e.g., “I feel emotionally close to my family members”), family commitment (e.g., “I am willing to make personal sacrifices for the well-being of my family”), and friendship (e.g., “I have friends I can rely on when I need help”)32. The subscales have demonstrated strong internal consistency among patients with permanent colostomies, with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.80, 0.82, and 0.75, respectively33. The Persian version of the scale was validated with a content validity ratio (CVR) exceeding 0.60 and a content validity index (CVI) of 0.80 or higher for each item, confirming its content validity. Construct validity was supported through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Additionally, the internal consistency of the Persian adaptation among Iranian patients under hemodialysis was established with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.7734. In this study, the internal consistency of the Persian version of the scale was approved with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79 among medical students.

The cell phone addiction scale consists of 20 items and was originally developed by Koo to assess cell phone addiction among Korean adolescents. This scale is composed of three sub-dimensions: withdrawal/tolerance (e.g., “When I can’t use a cell phone, I am exasperated”), life dysfunction (e.g., “I can’t do my homework or study because of cell phone use”), and compulsion/persistence (e.g., I never turn off my cell phone at during the day”). Each item is scored from 1: “not at all” to 4: always). The internal consistency of the original Korean version was reported as 0.92. Scores ranging from 20 to 62 reflect moderate cell phone usage, while scores between 63 and 69 indicate high usage. Scores in the range of 70 to 80 suggest cell phone addiction35. In the current study, the Cronbach’s alpha values for the overall scale and the subscales withdrawal/tolerance, life dysfunction, and compulsion/persistence were 0.96, 0.93, 0.92, and 0.88, respectively, indicating high reliability.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), consisting of nine questions, was employed to evaluate the sleep quality of medical students. This tool assessed seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficacy, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Example items: “During the past month, how would you rate your sleep quality overall?”, “How long (in minutes) does it usually take you to fall asleep each night?”, and “How many hours of actual sleep do you get at night?” Each component is scored on a scale from zero to three, and the total score is calculated by summing the scores of all components, resulting in a range from 0 to 21. A total score below 5 indicates good sleep quality, while scores above 5 suggest poor sleep quality36. The reliability of the Persian version of the PSQI has been confirmed with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.83 and 0.8537.

The WHOQOL-BREF, created by the World Health Organization, evaluates the quality of life across various populations. It includes 26 questions divided into four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Example items: “To what extent do you feel that physical pain prevents you from doing what you need to do?”, “How much do you enjoy life?”, “How satisfied are you with your personal relationships?”, and “How satisfied are you with the conditions of your living place?” Responses are scored using a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 represents “very dissatisfied” or “very poor”, and 5 indicates “very satisfied” or “very good”. Scores are standardized on a scale from zero to 100, with higher scores reflecting a better quality of life38,39. Studies report high internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha values for domains generally exceeding 0.70, indicating acceptable reliability38. This tool is validated in multiple languages, applicable to diverse populations, and enhances its global utility40. In the current study, the Cronbach’s alpha value for the overall WHOQOL-BREF was 0.87, indicating high reliability.

Data were gathered using a stratified random sampling method with proportional allocation among medical students residing in dormitories. After obtaining informed consent forms, participants completed paper-based standardized questionnaires in person in a private setting to ensure confidentiality and minimize response bias. Data collection was carried out for 6 months [from October 2023 to March 2024], and all completed questionnaires were reviewed for completeness before analysis.

This research was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the Schools of Nursing and Midwifery, Management and Medical Information Science – Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (IR.SUMS.NUMIMG.REC.1402.094) in alignment with the principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration. At the outset, the medical students were briefed on the study objectives; then, they provided their written informed consent. The written informed consent form signed by the medical students in this study. Medical students were also made aware of their right to withdraw from the study at any point. Throughout the research, measures were taken to ensure the confidentiality and anonymity of the participants’ information. The medical students were assured that their participation or non-participation in the study would have no impact on their education or grades and that participation in the study was voluntary.

The research data were processed using SPSS software, version 22. Descriptive statistical techniques, including mean, standard deviation, percentage, and frequencies, were applied for data analysis. The inferential analysis utilized the Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the relationship between the variables. Additionally, the SPSS macro PROCESS V 4.2 by Andrew F. Hayes was employed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects among the variables.

Three hundred and eighty medical students who resided in dormitories participated in this study. The mean age of the subjects was 23.54 (SD = 4.40). They lived in dormitories with a mean of 5.52 (SD = 1.66) days a week. The number of their roommates was 3.95 (SD = 1.46). As Table1shows, 52.9% of the subjects were female. One-fourth of them were married. Moreover, 35.0% of the research participants were in the second year of their education. Approximately, half of the subjects were doing bachelor degree in education (Table1).

Demographic and sleep characteristics among the medical students residing in dormitory.

As Table2shows, the quality of life mean score was 49.71 (SD = 10.58). Based on the mean scores of quality-of-life dimensions, the lowest mean score was related to environmental health (Table2).

Mean scores of cell phone addiction, sleep quality, and social relations quality among medical students residing in dormitories.

The mean score of sleep quality in medical students residing in dormitories was 6.73 (SD = 2.91). As Table2shows, the students had more complaints regarding sleep latency; they reported the efficacy of their sleep. Based on Figs.1and 68.1% of the subjects reported poor sleep quality. The number of hours sleeping a night was 6.06 (SD = 1.07) in medical students residing in dormitories. As Table1displays, one-fourth of the research participants had slept more than 7 h a night and the others slept less than 7 h a night. Moreover, 85.3% of the subjects fell asleep more than 15 min after lying down. Furthermore, approximately half of the research participants reported a fairly good subjective sleep quality (Table1).

The level of sleep quality in medical students residing in dormitories.

The mean score of social relations quality was 48.39 (SD = 7.36) in medical students residing in dormitories. Based on this mean score, it was in a moderate level.

As shown in Table2, the mean score of cell phone addiction was 56.25 (SD = 14.07). As Fig.2displays, 67.6% of the subjects used cell phones at a moderate level.

As Table3displays, a significant negative association was observed between poor sleep quality and quality of life (r= ˗ 0.22,p< 0.001), indicating that medical students residing in dormitories with better sleep quality tended to report higher quality of life. Overall quality of life was associated with all the components of sleep quality except for “sleep duration”. Moreover, total sleep quality was associated with all the dimensions of quality of life except for “social relationship health”. These findings partially support hypothesis 1.

**. Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).

*. Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed).

As Table3shows, a significant negative relationship was found between sleep quality and social relations quality in medical students residing in dormitories (r= ˗ 0.15,p= 0.003). On the other hand, the relationship between sleep quality and cell phone addiction was not significant (r= 0.05,p= 0.29). Based on the results of this study, some parts of hypothesis 3 were approved.

However, as Table3shows, the association between physical health of the quality of life and cell phone addiction and its dimensions including withdrawal/tolerance, life dysfunction, and compulsion/persistence was statistically significant. The association between quality of life and sleep quality dimensions with social relations quality and cell phone addiction subscales in medical students residing in dormitories is shown in Table3.

Based on the SPSS macro PROCESS, and Table4, the first model of the effect of the medical students residing in dormitories sleep quality and quality of life with social relations quality as a mediator was fit with the following index: MSE = 105.05, F = 16.02,p-value < 0.001. The direct effect of sleep quality significantly correlated with the quality of life in the medical students residing in dormitories (β = ˗ 0.70, t-value = ˗ 3.82,p-value = 0.0002). Social relations quality directly affected the quality of life (β = ˗ 0.25, t-value = 3.54,p-value = 0.0004). The indirect effect of sleep quality on the quality of life was mediated by social relations quality in the medical students residing in dormitories (Effect = ˗ 0.098, Boot SE = 0.04, 95% CI: ˗ 0.18 to ˗ 0.02). This model indicated that sleep quality and social relations quality accounted for 7% of the quality of life in the medical students residing in dormitories (R= 0.28, R2= 0.07,p-value < 0.001). Thus, hypothesis 4 which was “Social relations quality will mediate the negative effect of poor sleep quality on the quality of life among the medical students residing in dormitories” was approved. In our study, social relations demonstrated a partial mediating effect in the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life, as evidenced by both the significant direct effect of sleep on life quality (β = -0.70,p= 0.0002) and the significant indirect pathway through social relations (β = -0.098, 95% CI: − 0.18 to − 0.02), indicating that poorer sleep not only directly reduces life quality but also indirectly diminishes it by eroding social relations.

Based on the SPSS macro PROCESS, and Table5, the second model of the effect of sleep quality and quality of life with cell phone addiction as a mediator in the medical students residing in dormitories was fit with the following index: MSE = 108.23, F = 9.67,p-value = 0.0001. The direct effect of sleep quality significantly correlated with the quality of life in the medical students residing in dormitories (β = ˗ 0.79, t-value = ˗ 4.31,p-value < 0.001). However, cell phone addiction did not have a direct effect on the quality of life (β = ˗ 0.02, t-value = ˗0.61,p-value = 0.53). The cell phone addiction did not mediate the effects of sleep quality on the quality of life (Effect = ˗ 0.006, Boot SE = 0.01, 95% CI: ˗ 0.04 to 0.02). The second model indicated that sleep quality and cell phone addiction accounted for 4% of the quality of life in the medical students residing in dormitories (R= 0.22, R2= 0.04,p-value = 0.0001). Thus, hypothesis 5, “Cell phone addiction will mediate the negative effect of poor sleep quality on the quality of life among medical students residing in dormitories” was not approved. The analysis revealed no significant mediating effect of cell phone addiction in the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life, as evidenced by a non-significant indirect effect (β = -0.006, 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.02) and a non-significant path from sleep quality to cell phone addiction (β = 0.25,p-value = 0.29), while the direct effect of sleep quality on the quality of life remained significant (β = -0.79,p-value < 0.001).

This study indicated that medical students residing in dormitories experienced moderate quality of life, poor sleep quality, and moderate cell phone addiction. A significant negative correlation was found between sleep quality and quality of life, while social relations quality partially mediated this relationship. However, cell phone addiction did not show a significant mediating role. These findings highlight the interplay between sleep, social relations, and overall quality of life in the medical students residing in dormitories.

Our findings showed that the quality of life mean score was 49.71 (SD = 10.58) in medical students residing in dormitories. Based on the mean scores of quality of life dimensions, the lowest mean score was related to environmental health. On the other hand, a study on medical students in Karachi, Pakistan, reported that the highest mean score of quality of life was related to environmental health41. According to our findings, the dormitory environment requires interventions to be improved to probably increase the environmental health of the quality of life among medical students.

This study indicated that 68.1% of the medical students residing in dormitories reported poor sleep quality and the mean score of sleep quality was 6.73. Similarly, a study on Iranian medical students reported that the mean score of sleep quality was 6.32, and 60% of them had poor sleep quality42. Based on environmental stress theory, it seems that sleeping in a semi-private room (2 or more people in a room) and probably the crowded dormitory environment led to poor sleep quality in 68% of medical students in our study. In addition, having rotating shifts in clinical environments and returning to the dormitories among medical students probably makes it difficult for the student to sleep during the day, and this had a negative effect on the quality of his/her sleep.

In the present study, the students residing in dormitories complained more about sleep latency, and they reported the efficacy of their sleep. In line with our study, researchers indicated that medical students complained more regarding sleep latency6,43. They used less sleep medication6,43and reported good and sufficient sleep efficacy6. Regarding environmental stress theory, it appears that certain environmental conditions within dormitories, such as noise, temperature, or lighting, contributed to increased sleep latency among residents. Despite these delays in falling asleep, individuals still reported experiencing a sense of sleep efficacy, suggesting that when they were asleep, they felt their sleep was restorative or adequate.

This study showed 85.3% of the subjects fell asleep more than 15 min after lying down. As the normal time it takes people to fall asleep at night is between 10 and 20 min, more than two-thirds of the subjects had sleep latency. Similarly, other studies in Brazil and Nepal indicated that 28% and 34% of medical students spent normal time in falling asleep, respectively4,44. A systematic review reported that poor sleep quality was common among Iranian medical and other health professions students45.

The number of hours sleeping a night was 6.06 in medical students residing in dormitories. In addition, in a current study, one-fourth of the research participants had slept more than 7 h a night and the others less than 7 h a night, which might be an issue. Similarly, a study showed that 35.9% of medical students slept for more than 7 h a night in Nepal4. Probably, morning and evening classes and curricula or rotating shifts in hospitals could lead to poor sleep quality among medical students. In addition, living in the dormitory puts the responsibility of life on the shoulders of the student and this might negatively affect their sleep.

Our study reported that the mean score of social relations quality was 48.39 in medical students residing in dormitories. Based on this mean score, it was at a moderate level. Moreover, family intimacy, commitment, and friendship were important for medical students. Researchers indicated that family intimacy was associated with the peer relationship46. Researchers believed that community relationships were more effective than family relationships in the improvement of field belonging in medical students21.

This study indicated that approximately 15.1% of the medical students residing in dormitories used cell phones at a high level, and 17.1% of them were addicted to its use. The prevalence of overuse of cell phones was reported in 10.7% of medical students24. Researchers showed that living in a better environment had a lower risk for smartphone addiction25. It is possible that the environment of the dormitory as a social relationship caused the prevalence of cell phone addiction in medical students to be lower than in other studies whose samples were dormitory and nondormitory residents.

Our study demonstrated that medical students residing in dormitories who experienced higher sleep quality also reported a greater overall quality of life, thus supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, the medical students who had better subjective sleep quality and sleep efficacy and did not have sleep latency and daytime dysfunction reported better quality of life. Our study on medical students also showed that sleep latency was associated with quality of life and its dimensions except for social relationship health. Consistent with our findings, a study in Brazilian medical schools also identified a link between sleep quality and overall quality of life19. Similarly, research among Turkish university students found that better sleep quality was associated with higher quality of life across multiple domains47supporting the relevance of our results.

The present study supported our hypothesis, showing that medical students residing in dormitories who had better social relations quality reported better total sleep quality and subjective sleep quality. Moreover, medical students with better social relations quality had less daytime dysfunction and the use of sleep medication. In addition, our study indicated that family intimacy and commitment among medical students living in a dormitory was associated with sleep quality. A study reported that having better relationships with classmates caused the students to have higher sleep quality43. Another study showed that family support was associated with sleep quality among college students48. These findings suggest that strong social and familial connections may play a protective role in promoting healthier sleep patterns among medical students residing in dormitories.

The results of this study indicated that the total qualities of life, as well as its dimensions, such as physical, psychological, and social relationship health, were correlated to social relations quality among medical students residing in dormitories, thus supporting our hypothesis. Consistent with previous research, adult friendship and socializing with friends have been identified as predictors of well-being49. Family relationships have been shown to play a crucial role in well-being across the life course50. Both family and friends are important for social support and well-being51. These findings align with our study, emphasizing the importance of both family and peer support in shaping the quality of life and well-being among medical students.

Our study indicated that cell phone addiction was associated with poorer sleep disturbance, and more use of sleep medication in medical students residing in dormitories, supporting our initial hypothesis. A study showed that sleep quality was one of the predictors of smartphone addiction among medical students52. Based on environmental stress theory, cell phone addiction may function as an environmental stressor that disrupts sleep quality, leading to greater sleep disturbances and increased use of sleep medication among medical students residing in dormitories.

Our study showed that cell phone addiction was associated with poorer physical health of quality of life in medical students residing in dormitories. Similarly, a study showed that Internet addiction was associated with physical and psychological health, social relationships, and environmental dimensions of quality of life among medical students in Chosun University53.

The results of the study largely support our initial hypotheses. It was confirmed that sleep quality directly influences the quality of life among medical students residing in dormitories, aligning with our hypothesis that better sleep would be associated with improved quality of life. Additionally, we found that social relations quality directly impacted the quality of life, which was anticipated based on previous research highlighting the importance of social connections in overall quality of life. Furthermore, we observed that the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life was partially mediated by social relations quality, which was also consistent with our hypothesis. This suggests that interpersonal connections can buffer the negative effects of poor sleep on overall quality of life. The model demonstrated that both sleep quality and social relations quality together explained 7% of the variance in quality of life, reinforcing the importance of physiological and psychosocial factors in promoting the students’ quality of life. These findings underscore the importance of considering the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors in promoting the students’ quality of life, highlighting the need for interventions that address both sleep patterns and social support systems to enhance the overall quality of life. In a review of literature, it was shown that few studies were conducted regarding this part of our study. Therefore, we had to compare our findings with roughly similar studies. Researchers indicated that social support moderated the relationship between sleep quality and mental health49. Another study reported the association between mobile phone addiction and depression mediated by sleep quality among Chinese medical students54.

Our study findings partially support our initial hypotheses. While overall cell phone addiction was not associated with total quality of life, analysis of specific subscales revealed significant relationships. Consistent with part of our hypothesis, a higher level of cell phone addiction was associated with lower physical health. Moreover, the withdrawal/tolerance dimension of cell phone addiction was associated with poorer social relationship health. Furthermore, the life dysfunction dimension of the cell phone addiction scale was associated with environmental health. However, contrary to our initial hypothesis, cell phone addiction did not mediate the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life. These findings are in the same line with previous research in Malaysian medical students, indicating that excessive smartphone use was related to poorer physical health, social relationships, and environmental health25and that mobile phone addiction was negatively associated with mental health49. Although there was a connection between sleep quality and quality of life, cell phone addiction does not appear to be the underlying mechanism linking the two. Regarding the mediating effect of cell phone addiction, it seems that other psychological, behavioral, or environmental factors may better explain how sleep quality influences overall quality of life.

Our study showed that the lowest mean score of quality of life was related to environmental health. Therefore, it seems that the dormitory environment needs to be assessed and improved for the medical students. Practical measures may include improving ventilation, lighting, and reducing noise levels. As more than half of the medical students reported poor sleep quality and approximately three-fourths of them did not have normal hours of sleep at night, further studies to determine the reasons for these issues and strategies to improve their sleep quality by conducting a grounded theory study is suggested. Since there is a relationship between the quality of life and the sleep quality of medical students, it is suggested that we should improve the quality of life of medical students by holding educational interventions on maintaining regular sleep schedules which aim at improving sleep quality. According to the present study, one of the strategies could be improving the quality of social relationships with family and friends. Specific interventions could include fostering family engagement programs or peer support groups intervention in dormitories to help the medical students build stronger social networks. Since medical students who had better social relations quality were less addicted to cell phones, it is recommended that the problem of cell phone addiction should be reduced by improving social relations quality with the family and friends of dormitory students. Encouraging group activities that foster face-to-face communication is suggested.

This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design prevents causal inferences about the relationships between sleep quality, social relations, cell phone addiction, and quality of life. Second, reliance on self-reported measures may introduce biases, such as recall inaccuracies or social desirability effects, particularly for sensitive behaviors like phone use. Third, the findings may lack generalizability, as the study focused solely on medical students in dormitories, excluding other populations. The mediation analysis also assumes unidirectional effects, while bidirectional relationships (e.g., poor sleep worsening phone addiction and vice versa) could exist. Furthermore, subjective measures without objective validation (e.g., sleep trackers) may compromise data precision. Finally, the homogeneous sample limits applicability to broader student groups. Future longitudinal studies with diverse samples and objective tools could address these constraints.

Our study contributed to existing research by examining how sleep quality, cell phone addiction, and social relations affect the quality of life of medical students residing in dormitories, an often overlooked group in quality of life research. Our findings showed that poor sleep was common among these students and was linked to lower overall quality of life, especially when combined with problematic cell phone addiction. Notably, we identified the quality of social relations as a key factor that mediates the link between sleep quality and quality of life. This highlights the potential impact of enhancing social support networks to improve both sleep and overall quality of life in medical students residing in dormitories.
