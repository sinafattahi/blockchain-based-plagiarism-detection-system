Traditional harvest of non-timber forest products (NTFP) offers an economic alternative to local communities by providing income without significantly altering current land use while reinforcing deeply rooted local knowledge. Analyzing NTFP value chains helps understand the actors, relationships, stages, and sustainability of these products. This study focuses on the piassava palm (Attalea funiferaMartius), examining its value chain structure, social and economic indicators, and sustainability challenges.

Our study focused on communities in the Environmental Protection Areas of Pratigi and Tinharé-Boipeba in Bahia, Brazil. We examined five local communities involved in piassava harvesting, using semi-structured interviews and participant observation to gather data on actor roles, socioeconomic aspects, and sustainability issues, like economic vulnerabilities, social challenges, and environmental threats. Using a mixed-methods approach—combining semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and quantitative descriptive analysis—we investigated the roles of key actors, relationships, and threats within the piassava value chain. Findings were analyzed using content analysis and basic statistical measures to understand the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability.

We observed diverse stages, actor roles, and final products in the piassava value chain, identifying three primary raw materials: fibers, leaves, and fruits. Four main stages were noted: harvest, transportation, fiber separation, and product sales, with ecotourism emerging as a potential stage in the value chain analyzed here. The piassava value chain’s structure varies based on the materials and products involved, with key actors being harvest workers, partitioners, roofing artisans, and handicraft artisans. Respondents identified 20 threats to the piassava value chain, categorized into economic, social, and environmental issues, with the most cited being the scarcity of harvest workers, lack of interest among young people, and deforestation, respectively.

Our results suggest policy recommendations for reconciling social, economic, and ecological aspects. These include promoting community-based tourism as a complementary income source. Recognizing and disseminating piassava value chain outcomes as sociobiodiversity products, for example, strengthening legal and commercial frameworks to certify piassava products, or encouraging investment in local processing infrastructure to enhance value addition and market access. Finally, the results analyzed here underscore the importance of including local perspectives in discussions and highlight the need for further research to evaluate strategies for sustainable community forest management.

Forest services and products are essential for maintaining the human population by providing food, medicine, climate regulation, and CO2sequestration, along with various timber and non-timber products [1]. Among the latter, the harvest of non-timber forest products (NTFP) has the potential to counteract high levels of degradation caused by other uses such as monocultures, and pastures, since NTFP serves as a source of income for local communities without changing the land use that prevents subsequent forest regrowth [2,3]. Furthermore, NTFP can help maintain local knowledge through the transmission and sharing of information within the stages and components of the value chain. Conducting a thorough analysis of value chain systems can reveal the actors, relationships, stages, activities, and trade routes involved, spanning from the first step of conception and production to product delivery [4]. In this sense, this analytical approach becomes a valuable tool for comprehending multiple intertwined aspects associated with the NTFP chain. Incorporating the concept of sustainability, which emphasizes the continuity of resources for subsequent generations, integrates a pertinent lens for value chain analysis.

Sustainability recognizes the interdisciplinarity of relationships between social, economic, and environmental dimensions [5]. In this context, traditional ecological knowledge is a central interest of ethnobiological research, focused on relationships among peoples, biota, and environments. This emphasis is particularly relevant to recognizing the crucial role of biocultural diversity in maintaining healthy ecosystems [6]. As a result, Indigenous Peoples hold valuable knowledge that has enabled them to live in harmony for generations while responsibly managing the resources of their ancestral territories, offering guidance toward a more sustainable future [6].

However, the traditional knowledge system and its role in maintaining Earth´s ecosystems are not only a quantitative issue but also require a qualitative analysis of their structure. In the case of non-timber forest product value chains, social and economic disparities often exist between phases and actors, impacting outcomes and perceptions. Key actor differences often are associated with gender, age, profitable activities developed, income, and work hours, among other attributes [7]. Understanding the stages and socioeconomic characteristics of the actors and their relationships is essential to identifying threats, implementing actions to enhance chain value, expanding beyond a limited set of actors, and ensuring chain continuity for future generations [8].

In this context, the value chain ofAttalea funiferaMartius (piassava) in the northeastern state of Bahia, Brazil stands out. This Arecaceae endemic species has historical significance as it is exploited in one of the most important biodiversity centers of the Atlantic Forest. Piassava palms grow naturally or through planting in the south of Bahia, where they are a dominant species. However, despite its importance for fiber production and the Brazilian bioeconomy [9], studies on piassava palms primarily focus on the physical and chemical structure of their fibers, with limited attention to the marginalized communities engaged in piassava harvest and the sustainability of the value chain [10].

To help fill this existing knowledge gap, our research addresses the following questions: (1) What is the structure of the non-timber forest product chain? (2) Which social and economic indicators are associated with actors’ roles and vulnerability? and finally, (3) What problems threaten the sustainability of this non-timber forest product chain? Focusing on the dynamics of the piassava palm as our case study, we integrate local and academic knowledge into our value chain analysis, considering economic, social, and environmental aspects within a sustainability framework.

The value chain can be defined as “the full range of activities which are required to bring a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production (involving a combination of physical transformation and the input of various producer services), delivery to final consumers, and final disposal after use” [11]. In this context, the value chains analysis (VCA) systematically presents information such as the stages, actors, relationships, and resulting products. It serves as a foundational framework for comprehending the defining characteristics of these elements and the factors that may influence and modify them [12].

In the realm of natural resource exploitation, particularly within communities reliant on traditional practices, VCA provides valuable data that may help to inform and implement policies equitably [10]. For instance, the VCA of mangroves in Kenya identified both “losers” and “winners” in the trade, revealing critical outcomes and providing insights about the inclusion of equitability into sustainable harvesting [12]. Similarly, in the context of non-timber forest products harvest, acknowledging social heterogeneity within the value chain, as well as considering livelihoods and perceptions, becomes imperative. Actors may hold differing views on the sustainability of the chain, emphasizing the need to comprehend and integrate these perspectives [8].

This nuanced understanding of social dynamics in the value chain is crucial as it allows for the identification of threats and the formulation of solutions. Moreover, it facilitates the integration of perspectives from groups often marginalized in decision-making processes. By incorporating these insights, the VCA not only becomes a powerful tool for dissecting the intricacies of value chains but also aids in crafting inclusive and sustainable strategies that address the diverse needs and perceptions of various actors.

Sustainability is a widely used term in socioecological research, projects, and policies. Simply stated, the intent is to guarantee that resources used today are available for the next generation. However, in recent years, the sustainability concept has undergone discussions and adaptations, encompassing interdisciplinary perspectives that enhance its characteristics. Additionally, sustainability has gained more prevalence than the term “sustainable development,” which has faced numerous criticisms due to its imprecise definition. In an analysis of both terms through a review of previously published studies, Ruggerio [13] suggests that the conceptual model of sustainability must adhere to specific criteria. As a point of reference, it should include the consideration of economic, ecological, social, and political factors, as well as intergenerational and intragenerational equity, and the hierarchical organization of nature. These criteria encompass topics outlined by Crojethovich et al. [14] on how sustainability is conveyed through networks and chains, with the potential to fluctuate at each stage.

Carter and Rogers [5] introduced the sustainability concept to supply chain thinking, focusing on the long-term economic viability of an organization through the integration of three pillars: economic, environmental, and social. Typically, the environmental pillar covers aspects related to biodiversity resilience and natural resource management. Classifying factors within the social and economic pillars may pose challenges, but the former is more closely associated with culture, history, and identity, while the latter involves market-related issues. In this context, we can apply the concept of sustainability to the value chain of non-timber forest products, aiming to analyze future possibilities based on the integration of these pillars. In our analysis, threats to the sustainability of the value chain signify social, economic, and environmental concerns that could hinder the chain’s continuity for future generations.

Our study focused on communities of two protected areas in the northeast of Bahia, Brazil: the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of Pratigi and the Islands of Tinharé and Boipeba. The EPA Tinharé and Boipeba encompass six villages and the Pratigi EPA spans five municipalities [15,16]. Both areas consist of the Restinga (i.e., coastal sandy ecosystem), Dense Ombrophylous Forests (i.e., high rainfall and dense vegetation cover), and coastal marine ecosystems [17,18]. The climate is humid tropical, marked by high temperatures and substantial precipitation.

In this region, communities primarily composed of Afro-descendants inhabit the area, with three of the studied locations recognized asquilombolacommunities—formed by descendants of enslaved black people who sought freedom from the dominant slave society [19,20]. Preliminary identification of communities involved in or historically engaged in piassava harvest was conducted through research, analysis of the management plan of protected areas, information from the management councils’ participants, community residents, and discussions with researchers active in the Southern Bahia region (northeast of Brazil). Following initial contact and authorization from community association members and local leaders, we selected five communities (Fig.1) associated with the piassava harvest: Jatimane (Nilo Peçanha), Rio do Campo (Ituberá), Moreré, Cova da Onça, and Galeão (Cairu). Only Rio do Campo and Cova da Onça are not quilombola communities which are defined as: “Ethnic-racial groups, according to self-identification criteria, with their own historical trajectory, specific territorial relations, and presumed Black ancestry linked to resistance to historical oppression” [21].

In the Jatimane community, located in the municipality of Nilo Peçanha (13°41′36"S, 39°2′42"W) and situated within the Pratigi Environmental Protection Area (EPA), the extraction and utilization of piassava fiber represent a central livelihood activity, deeply embedded in the community’s daily life. This traditional practice coexists with artisanal fishing and, to a lesser extent, tourism. The Jatimane River flows through the community, passing through riparian forests and coastal ecosystems such as restinga and mangroves, before reaching the Santarém River.

Jatimane has been officially recognized as a quilombo remnant community since 2005, with certification granted by the Palmares Cultural Foundation [22]. According to its bylaws, the Jatimane community holds collective ownership of its traditional territory, which has been occupied for over 350 years. The community assumes responsibility for the governance and management of the lands and assets belonging to the Quilombo Remnant Community (Comunidade Remanescente de Quilombo).

Close to Jatimane is Rio do Campo community, located in the municipality of Ituberá, Bahia, is a traditional rural settlement characterized by its reliance on small-scale agriculture, piassava harvest, and artisanal fishing as primary economic activities. Studies focusing on the Baixo Sul region of Bahia highlight that communities like Rio do Campo maintain practices linked to family farming, including the cultivation of manioc (Manihot esculenta), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), and other regional crops, which are crucial for local food security and cultural identity [23,24]. Artisanal fishing, often carried out by men within the community, complements agricultural activities and contributes significantly to household income and subsistence [25].

Located on the Environmental and Protected Areas of Tinharé and Boipeba Islands in the municipality of Cairu (Bahia, Brazil) are Galeão, Moreré, and Cova da Onça. The Galeão community is officially recognized as a remnant quilombo community by the Fundação Cultural Palmares. This certification was formalized through Portaria nº 25 on March 13, 2007 [26]. Such recognition affirms the community’s historical and cultural identity, rooted in the resistance of Afro-Brazilian populations against slavery and systemic oppression [27]. Galeão’s historical roots trace back to the seventeenth century, with the construction of the São Francisco Xavier Church in 1623. Archaeological and historical research points to the presence of former quilombos in the area, such as Champrão and Iquira, reinforcing the significance of this region as a territory of refuge and autonomy for formerly enslaved people and their descendants [28].

In 2023, Galeão entered a land titling process with the Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária (INCRA), under process nº 54,000.118401/2023–49. This aligns with Article 68 of the Brazilian Constitution’s Transitional Provisions, which ensures land rights to quilombola communities [29,30]. Due to its proximity to Morro de São Paulo—a major tourist destination receiving over 200,000 visitors annually [31]—Galeão has experienced growing tourism impacts.

The Moreré community, located on Boipeba Island in the municipality of Cairu, Bahia, Brazil, is officially recognized as a quilombola community, meaning it is a remnant of Afro-Brazilian populations descended from enslaved Africans who established autonomous settlements during the colonial period. This recognition is supported by its certification by Fundação Cultural Palmares, the Brazilian governmental body responsible for acknowledging quilombola communities, which grants them collective rights to their traditional territories in accordance with the National System of Conservation Units—SNUC from the Brazilian Federal Law No. 9,985/2000 and the Brazilian Federal Constitution [29,32–34].

The social and economic dynamics of Moreré remain deeply rooted in traditional livelihoods such as artisanal fishing, small-scale agriculture, and community-based tourism. Studies have shown that the community relies heavily on sustainable use of natural resources, including mangrove ecosystems and coastal fisheries, which are vital for food security and cultural preservation [35,36]. Fishing, primarily conducted by men using traditional methods, targets reef and estuarine species fundamental to both subsistence and income generation [37]. In recent years, Moreré has experienced growth in tourism, which offers economic opportunities but also presents challenges related to environmental degradation and social change. Researchers have warned that unsustainable tourism development could threaten the cultural integrity and ecological balance maintained by the community [38,39].

Last, the Cova da Onça community (also known as São Sebastião), located on Boipeba Island in the municipality of Cairu, Bahia, Brazil, is recognized as a traditional fishing community with a long history of artisanal extractive practices [34,40]. The community’s economy is largely based on artisanal fishing and small-scale agriculture, alongside the extractivism of mangaba (Hancornia speciosa), a native fruit species of the Brazilian northeast and coastal regions. Mangaba plays an important socioeconomic and cultural role, as it is harvested seasonally for consumption, local sale, and use in artisanal products such as jams and juices [41,42]. The sustainable management of mangaba trees contributes to the conservation of native vegetation and supports food sovereignty within the community [42].

These livelihoods have been maintained over generations, reflecting strong socioecological knowledge and sustainable resource use practices [41]. Studies highlight the critical role of traditional fishing techniques and community-based resource management in preserving local biodiversity and ensuring food security for residents [43].

From a legal perspective, Rio do Campo and Cova da Onça fit the category of “traditional populations” as defined by the Brazilian National Policy for the Sustainable Development of Traditional Peoples and Communities (PNPCT) established by Decree No. 6,040/2007 [44]. This policy recognizes communities whose ways of life are based on the sustainable use of natural resources and cultural practices passed down through generations. While lacking quilombola certification, São Sebastião/Cova da Onça may benefit from certain protections related to territorial rights and sustainable development under this framework [45].

The pressures of expanding tourism on Boipeba Island pose challenges to the community’s traditional livelihoods. Research indicates that increased tourist activity can lead to resource conflicts, environmental degradation, and sociocultural shifts within the community [39]. Nonetheless, local initiatives promoting participatory governance and sustainable tourism have been identified as promising pathways for balancing development and cultural preservation [46].

Belonging to the Arecaceae family,Attalea funiferaMartius, commonly known aspiaçava-da-Bahiaor piassava, is an endemic palm (Fig.2a) found in the Atlantic Forest and central to piassava fiber production in Brazil [9]. In 2008, the List of Species of Brazilian Flora classified piassava as data deficient [47], and the National Center for Flora Conservation [48] identified it as near threatened in the red list of Brazilian flora. However, research on the piassava value chain remains limited [10], and studies conducted for this species primarily focus on the utilization of its fibers and fruits due to their quality properties [49,50].

The economically harvested parts of the plant are mainly fibers (Fig.2b). According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the state of Bahia ranked as the largest national producer of piassava fiber in 2023, with a production value estimated at USD 1.35 million [51]. This figure highlights the substantial economic contribution of the piassava sector to the state’s forest-based economy. Furthermore, data from the 2020 edition of the Survey of Natural Forest Extraction and Silviculture (IBGE) indicate that, in 2019, the Low South region of Bahia—encompassing the communities assessed in this study—accounted for approximately 35% of the total tonnage of piassava fiber production in the state [52]. Leaves and fruits (Fig.2c, d, e, and f) are also collected to produce items for sale or to meet the subsistence needs of local communities.

We identified participants using the snowball method, a non-probabilistic sampling technique often employed in study sites with difficult access and no known population list [53]. Initial contacts were pinpointed through community association leaders, with the first people interviewed being active members or people related to the associations contacted. During these initial interviews, additional names emerged—individuals either directly involved in extraction or able to provide complementary, corroborating, or contrasting perspectives relevant to the study. Thus, our selection process was intentional and non-random [54], with participant recruitment continuing until thematic saturation was reached—that is, when no substantially new information was added through additional interviews. At the same time, new interviewees were added through observation and field conversations.

We reached the saturation point after interviewing 83 individuals through a semi-structured questionnaire, supplemented by informal conversations with those currently or previously involved in piassava-related activities. The interviews delved into their roles in the value chain, as well as information pertaining to socioeconomic aspects and sustainability issues. Specifically, we gathered data on work hours, income, knowledge transmission, cultural identity, and products. We utilized a previous list of threats identified for neotropical palm trees managed by local communities (Table S1—Araujo-Santos, Grenno, and Schiavetti, unpublished data) and used the free list technique to document threats identified through local perception. Answers were recorded on a tablet or cell phone using ODK Build and Collect software, along with a digital recorder, facilitating subsequent interview transcription. Participant observation was also employed during trail walks around piassava-rich and forest areas near the communities, daily fieldwork, and informal meetings within the communities.

We adopted a holistic approach by combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies to conduct comprehensive data analysis. Qualitative data analysis involved extracting, summarizing, scrutinizing, and synthesizing information. This process progressed from specific details to overarching perspectives, revealing key issues and themes, and establishing relationships and patterns. Content Analysis [55], a qualitative tool, was specifically employed to gain insights into the organization, historical context, and local perceptions within piassava harvest communities.

The development of a piassava value chain diagram depended on the identification of actors, relationships, variations, products, and socioeconomic data through patterns uncovered in interview results. We categorized actors based on stages identified in the non-timber forest product literature and during interviews [7]. Social and economic data were instrumental in pinpointing factors characterizing value chain actors and their vulnerabilities. Threats to the piassava chain, as identified in the interviews, were coded based on sustainability dimensions: social, environmental, and economic.

We applied quantitative analyses using R to generate frequency tables and percentages from survey data. We also counted the number of interviewees citing each threat per community. This data was used to create a heatmap in Python, with color intensity indicating citation frequency.

We observed that the piassava value chain encompasses diverse stages, roles, and final products (Fig.3). We identified three primary raw materials: fibers, leaves, and fruits, organizing the value chain based on the palm material harvested by local communities. Generally, we noted four main stages in the piassava value chain: harvest, transportation, separation of fibers, product sales, and an emerging product: piassava-centered ecotourism. However, in the case of leaves and fruit products, the separation stage was not a predominant phase. Results indicate that the structure of the chain is variable and could differ depending on the raw materials and final products involved.

We observed that piassava fiber harvest is exclusively carried out by men. They collect from low palm trees or climb tall individuals, typically found in forests near communities whereA. funiferapopulations naturally regenerate or grow in old plantations (Fig.4a). Interviewees highlighted changes over the years related to the piassava fiber chain. Historically, harvest workers often traveled to distant locations and stayed there for several days, a practice still observed in some communities. However, it is now common for harvest workers to select specific areas for piassava fiber collection, paying landowners for area access and fiber harvesting based on amounts they had collected. This marks a significant shift from the past when workers were usually contracted by landowners. With fewer people engaged in harvesting, individuals can now choose areas and select specific palm individuals, resulting in higher compensation perarroba(a unit of weight equivalent to 15 kg).

The few artisans engaged in fruit handicrafts typically collect fruits near communities when needed, during excursions to waterfalls or farms, or while guiding tourists. The artisan fruit selection process typically involves assessing appearance for the absence of flaws and stains, as well as considering their physiological maturity. Fiber harvest workers also collect fruits upon request from artisans who make jewelry or traditional porridge. For this last use, fruits are gathered close to maturity, locally referred to as"sapateiro,"indicating that the fruit mesocarp is in optimal condition for preparing porridge.

The harvest and use of leaf rachises are uncommon in the studied communities, but we did find some artisans involved uniquely in this practice. These artisans collect rachises fromA. funiferaindividuals in nearby forests or purchase them from fiber harvesters.

We documented various methods of transporting fibers across the piassava value chain. Initially, harvest workers carry the material themselves, typically transporting around 70 kg to the nearest road from where they collect the fibers. Subsequently, themondongos(Fig.4b), the local term for tied piassava fibers, are transported using motorcycles, boats, animals, and ultimately trucks to reach the next destination.

Following harvest, the fibers, referred to as covers and stumps at this stage, are transported to locations known ascatadouros, where the material undergoes separation using tools locally called combs (Fig.4c). In this stage, we interviewed 20 women, and 1 man involved in the process. They categorized the fibers into materials with distinct local names, such as piassava, bagasse (bagaço), bark (casca), and ribbon (fita).

Fibers are manually or machine cut, mostly by men, to achieve the desired lengths, employing specific tools in thecatadoros. The cut fibers are then transported either to a local broom factory or artisans specializing in crafting handmade brooms. Additionally, fibers, along with bagasse, bark, and ribbon, serve in the production of roof materials, a crucial economic activity and the primary motivation for harvesting in communities situated beyond the islands. These fibers also constitute the primary material for the artisanal creation of diverse handicrafts, including bags, baskets, coasters, hats, mandalas, mirror ornaments, and pencil holders, among other products (Fig.4d).

Certain artisans exclusively work with leaf rachises to create mats and blinds (Fig.4e). We documented the utilization of various parts of the piassava fruit in the market chain. The endocarp and seeds are used to craft jewelry, including necklaces (Fig.4f), earrings, and souvenirs like keychains. The mesocarp is utilized for cooking porridge. Interviewees indicated that in the past, they sold a substantial quantity of fruit without the epicarp to the international market to produce seed oils or religious items.

A novel approach to exploitingA. funiferavalues was through tourism, with some individuals in certain communities working as guides. Ecotours offered specific itineraries that showcased various stages of the piassava chain, including the harvest and the production of bio-jewels. It was noteworthy that these tours often included an explanation of piassava management, emphasizing its significance in maintaining the Atlantic Forest. Tourism routes sometimes included explanations of the community’s past, showcasing other traditional sources of income such as fisheries and gastronomy, and guiding tours to waterfalls, rivers, and mangroves. Additionally, these communities were observed to engage in partnerships with external tourism companies. In Jatimane, where community-based tourism linked to the piassava chain appears most robust, the community association took on a primary role in this emerging sector (Table1).

We observed four key actors in the piassava value chain: (1) harvest workers; (2) partitioners; (3) roofing artisans; and (4) handicraft artisans (Table2).

The fiber harvest workers typically were men aged 26 to 56 years (43 ± 9.9). Most of them had only completed elementary school (53.8%), identified themselves as the main providers for their households (92.9%), and around 57.1% were involved in two or more stages of the piassava chain. None of the workers at this stage had a formal contract. They usually worked four days a week, dedicating seven hours a day to their tasks. On average, they collected about six arrobas per day (1 arroba ≈ 15 kg) and received approximately USD 3 per arroba. Interviewees indicated changes in the number of hours and days worked, noting that in past harvests, they spent more hours in the forest.

Regarding the fiber separation phase necessary for making brooms and roofs, many members of the community recalled performing this stage as children. Currently, however, in studied communities where piassava harvests remain economically significant, fiber separation was primarily undertaken by women. The average age of workers in the fiber separation phase was 45 years, and nearly half of them (47.62%) had only attended elementary school. Approximately 57.14% identified themselves as the primary contributors to household income, nearly 10% worked in other piassava chain stages, and only one had a formal contract, but from a different job. They worked about seven hours a day, separating and cleaning approximately three arrobas, and receiving almost USD 1.50 per arroba.

As for artisans, we observed distinct patterns depending on the plant product fabricated. Roof artisans were mostly men aged 18 to 54 years (33.67 ± 10.9), with educational levels ranging from elementary school to high school. These key actors typically worked around seven hours a day, producing an average of 21 combs and receiving nearly USD 0.27 or USD 0.50 for each, depending on the piassava material used. Most (77.78%) also worked in other stages of the piassava chain. For handicraft artisans, gender dynamics varied across communities. In communities where handicrafts were the main activity, only men were artisans, while in others, where the entire piassava chain was active, only women worked as artisans. The percentage of handicraft artisans who studied until elementary school or high school was the same (35.71%). Almost all (92.85%) indicated that they worked in another piassava stage, mainly in collecting materials or selling products, and 71.43% were responsible for the primary income of their households. The values of the products varied, ranging from USD 1.32 (keychains) to USD 85 (mandalas). Overall, the economic return for handicraft artisans varied significantly, depending on factors such as the community location (tourism intensity), time of year, types of products, and sales locations.

A total of 20 distinct threats to the continuity of the piassava value chain were identified by respondents, with 78.05% of interviewees acknowledging that the activity faces risks in their communities. On average, respondents reported 2.06 (± 1.53) perceived threats each. Most respondents identified economic threats (70%), followed by social (40%) and environmental threats (36%). The most frequently cited threat was the scarcity of harvest workers (53.22%), particularly in communities where fiber extraction remains central, such as Jatimane. The lack of youth interest (33.87%) and deforestation (8.06%) were also prominent. These threats varied between communities, reflecting differences in value chain dynamics and the historical configuration of each territory (Supplementary Material 2, Fig.1). Table3summarizes the main threats cited within each pillar, along with the proportion of respondents who mentioned them and contextual examples.

Economic threats were the most frequently reported and were primarily associated with the fiber value chain, which remains active in the communities of Galeão, Jatimane, and Rio do Campo. Despite the abundance ofAttalea funiferain Galeão, the declining market value of piassava fiber and the growing appeal of alternative income opportunities—such as tourism on neighboring islands—have led to a decrease in local participation. Historical accounts provided by respondents indicate a shift from multiplecatadoros(processing centers) in the past to only one currently operating in Galeão and three in Rio do Campo. In Moreré, the piassava chain has shifted toward small-scale handicraft production, with tourism and fishing now serving as the community’s primary sources of income. They also attributed this to the shift to industrialized products like plastic brooms and processed foods. These patterns suggest that economic threats are not only a matter of pricing or labor availability but are also linked to broader changes in land use and local development trajectories.

“(…) The work with piassava is a job that we know the importance of, but on the other hand, it is a kind of slave work, right? These slavery things are still connected, mainly to the women’s part.” – Partitioner woman.

In other communities, piassava work was described as a source of past humiliation, linked to power imbalances between landowners and laborers. These legacies persist today in the form of vulnerable working conditions, low financial return, and a preference among local workers, particularly younger generations, for fishing, which is perceived as more profitable and better regulated in terms of rights and health risks. This last issue encompasses responses such as vision problems, back pain, and osteoarthritis, as well as reports of accidents, such as workers falling from palm trees during fiber harvests and incidents of poisoning by venomous animals like snakes (Bothropsspp.) and scorpions.

Environmental threats were cited by approximately one-third of respondents. Among these, deforestation was the most frequently mentioned and was linked to tourism infrastructure, real estate development, and land conversion for agriculture (e.g., cocoa, cassava, pineapple, and rubber plantations). Although forest fires, droughts, and the overharvest of fruits were mentioned less frequently, these threats were also recognized for their potential to compromise the regeneration and health ofA. funiferapopulations. While most respondents described harvesting practices as cautious, avoiding damage to the apical meristem and allowing time for palm recovery, some noted that the inexperience of newer or younger workers could pose a long-term risk to palm viability.

Local communities rely on traditional knowledge for harvesting non-timber forest products; however, external factors, including economic, social, and environmental influences, disrupt and shape how this knowledge and NTFP values and activities change over time [7]. The findings of our study shed light on distinct trajectories undertaken by communities utilizing diverse materials extracted from a single palm species endemic to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Unlike most NTFP value chain analyses that highlight economic and environmental challenges, our examination of the piassava palm suggests that environmental issues are less significant for this value chain. Economic threats, however, are clearly present, as are social issues, both driven by a combination of factors.

Additionally, our comparative research design of five geographically proximate communities delineated materials, stages, and non-timber forest products emanating from the piassava value chain. These materials traverse through varying phases, involving different actors, before culminating in final products [4]. Moreover, our value chain analysis elucidates the intricate relationship between local context and value chain variation, even among communities within the same region. In communities where the fiber chain is still active, such as Jatimane and Rio do Campo, harvest worker shortages constitute a significant threat, which might be attributed to youth disinterest, as well as the piassava chain´s history of slavery. However, in other coastal communities such as Moreré, Galeão, and Cova da Onça we observed other threats, such as deforestation and burning that linked with predatory tourism and changing land ownership.

Also, the slow legal time frames to recognize quilombola communities may impact capacities to protect traditional ecological knowledge and cultural history. For example, the Jatimane community, which collectively demonstrated piassava historical and sociocultural values, received formal recognition from the Palmares Foundation in 2003 [56]. In contrast, Moreré was only recognized as a quilombola community in 2023 [57], and Cova da Onça, despite being a traditional community, does not have any certification, in both cases, we only find the handicraft chain. These contrasts highlight the distinct trajectories undertaken by the communities analyzed here, which appear to influence the several levels of threat within the non-timber forest product value chain.

The results indicate that the structure of the chain is variable and could differ depending on the raw materials and final products involved. The most recognized threat to the sustainability of this value chain was the scarcity of fiber harvest workers, as interviewees indicated that younger individuals are not interested in this work and that the remaining workers are aging, as evidenced by the average age of the harvest workers. This lack of workers could limit the continuity of the entire chain since they are the ones who usually collect the piassava fibers, fruits, and leaves. Local perceptions described some concern about this issue, which seems to reflect complex interconnections among socioeconomic and sociocultural factors. Globally, many communities involved in the harvest of non-timber forest products work under unfavorable conditions, compromising their health and comfort [58]. Safety is a major concern in these contexts, as tall individuals need to be climbed to harvest, combined with the threat of venomous snakes and insects. In our study, no safety equipment was observed or reported, and personal insurance was nonexistent.

These precarious working conditions ultimately erode worker motivation [58]. Riungu et al. [12] reported on another demotivating factor for mangrove wood harvesters in Kenya, that of low monthly earnings, describing them as relative ‘losers’ in the mangrove wood harvest value chain. In our region, however, piassava harvesters earn better wages than they used to and have more autonomy in where to harvest. Yet, disinterest in harvesting piassava extends beyond safety or wage concerns. According to local perceptions, the unfavorable working conditions seem to be interconnected with a historical connection between harvest and slavery [59], with examples of cases of humiliation, lack of, or late payment. This context erodes the interest among the younger generation in continuing in the activity and may reflect why parents encourage them to seek better opportunities.

Young people´s disinterest analyzed here seems to reflect similar trends observed in other NTFP value chain studies, such as the babassu palm value chain [60], and sugar palms [61]. Reports highlight that younger people look for other work opportunities to improve their quality of life. Some note that parents who currently work in the value chain also express their desire for their children to get better jobs by increasing their education level [61]. In our context, these cross-generational desires changed the number of labor-intensive workers, as well as the continuity of the chain. It also may explain why youths are engaged in the artisanal roofing stage. This position in the value chain structure represents not only the possibility of lower-risk work but also a more regular income. From another perspective, the global consequences of youth disinterest and community out-migration lead to the erosion of traditional knowledge among newer generations [62–64].

Some studies and projects advocate involving young people in the transformation of value chains by exploring new services and products or improving existing ones [65]. These prospects, including initiatives such as ecotourism, community-based tourism, and eliminating intermediaries, could provide sustainable opportunities. Our analysis suggests that ethno-tourism`s emerging sector could be an opportunity to involve youth, reduce economic vulnerability, enhance community resilience, and promote local heritage. Another idea is to encourage an academic career, including, but not limited to, the training of researchers, which can promote empowerment and autonomy in the search for solutions to chain threats.

Finally, although the term “young people’s disinterest” used here reflects the responses of those interviewed, we emphasize that it should not be seen as a criticism, given the numerous threats identified by chain workers to their health, well-being, and survival. Seeking incentives for young people to work at the chain since socioeconomic factors of the value chain may not be enough to fulfill a desirable quality of life, since well-being depends on more factors than income [66–68].

The global trend of substituting natural resources with industrialized products contributes to decreased market demand, impacting non-timber value chains. Studies on the use ofAstrocaryum chambirain Colombia reveal similar patterns, where fiber extraction practices are closely tied to traditional knowledge, yet increasingly affected by market pressures and generational shifts [69,70]. In our case, local perceptions identified a trend in which traditional products are being replaced with industrialized and cheaper plastic products [71]. These trends, together with socioeconomic threats, have the potential to impact on the entire non-timber forest production chain, revealing variations within different stages. This highlights the need to expand work like this by integrating the dynamics between upstream (exploration and production), midstream (transport or storage), and downstream (distribution) activities that may take place in other regions of the country [72]. To address these challenges, efforts need to be made to add value to the chain and sustain the activity and, simultaneously, promote the preservation of the values of non-timber forest products through a more prominent position within sectoral and public policies.

Our findings prominently exposed how local communities’ history, culture, tradition, and political conditions can influence their perceptions of a value chain and threaten sustainability [73]. On one side, the recognition and identification of the piassava harvest as a traditional activity, coupled with the desire to maintain and preserve the culture, links it to the local history of the communities and the knowledge passed down through generations. On the other hand, the piassava chain is also associated with unfavorable working conditions and low economic returns linked to slavery, as emphasized by interviewees. These conflicting sentiments are mirrored by some traditional Amazonian communities that harvest piassava palms (Leopoldina piassabaWallace) and have reported comparing working conditions and lack of labor rights to slavery [74]. Still, some characteristics of Amazon fiber harvests were not observed in this study, such as the boss-harvest worker debt system and the use of violence. Nonetheless, our value chain informants volunteered reports about past humiliations and linkages to slavery—memories that remain fresh and influence current perceptions of the non-timber forest product value chain.

We emphasized that three of our five studied communities arequilombolas, and their narratives represent legacies spanning centuries of settlement and Portuguese rule, rooted in the exploitation of labor from enslaved Black Africans by European colonizers [75]. Given the continuity of class and race privileges in modern-day Brazil, it is not a surprise that they are still suffering from racism which affects their rights and current work conditions [76]. Although race identification was not explicitly sought during our interviews, this theme frequently emerged within local perceptions, illustrating how the intersectionality between race, class, and gender could amplify power imbalances within the value chain. As asked by Gonzalez [76] in her journal article “Black women, this quilombola”, where are black women in this conversation? Our findings confirm that women’s participation in the non-timber forest product value chain is largely confined to labor-intensive, lower-income roles such as fiber cleaning and artisanal production. This gendered division of labor reflects broader patterns documented in the literature linking contemporary inequalities to the legacy of slavery and ongoing marginalization [77–79]. By mapping gender-specific roles throughout the entire value chain, our study underscores the urgent need to understand how these roles contribute to vulnerability and limit women’s empowerment. This understanding is essential for designing interventions that address intersecting social inequalities and promote more equitable participation in sustainable livelihood activities.

In this sense, the non-timber forest product chain also shows an opportunity to analyze differences between the value chain phases and differentiated actor participation. In our cases, women engaged in the production of handicrafts seem to have more power than other women working in the cleaning process. Just as with young people, however, value chains are not static, and the expansion of opportunities within the chain could benefit women. Some studies recommend increased recognition of informal markets, collective initiatives, access to targeted training, and heightened gender awareness among stakeholders for women’s socioeconomic empowerment [80]. In the case examined here, women’s participation in product commercialization and tourism can support the sustainability of the non-timber forest product value chain and mitigate power imbalances. However, we acknowledge that other challenges may include the accumulation of functions and the triple shift resulting from domestic work [81]. For example, in agricultural systems in Ethiopia, studies show that the adoption of new technology is associated with more work for women [81]. This can be also seen globally in women’s participation in the value chain development due to the impact of product and process modernization demands [82].

Although we did not directly examine the environmental impacts of piassava harvest techniques, other researchers have highlighted the association of piassava management with high forest conservation [9,10], agreeing with our field observations and reported by our informants. However, the identified threats associated with the economic pillar of the piassava value chain may be fundamental to biodiversity conservation since land abandonment and deforestation, according to the communities’ local perceptions, are associated with land use change.

Just like with other non-timber products, ruptures in the piassava value chain may impact other natural resources in the region. As local actors abandon certain activities within the value chain, they search for other local economic activities. Given the location of these communities on the Brazilian coast, fishing and tourism activities can become more profitable employment options that are also associated with better access to labor rights. However, when these activities are not thoughtfully developed within a community and/or artisanal basis, they may be installed in a predatory manner, replacing local knowledge and/or exploiting natural resources. Over the years, this transformation has already been reflected in land conflicts and land use changes in some communities, where forest areas are replaced by large tourist developments.

In this way, we can infer that the threats to the chain of non-timber forest products, such as the case of piassava palm, can not only impact the maintenance of local knowledge and its sustainability but also may cause a ripple effect bringing major impacts on the conservation of biodiversity in forest fragments of great relevance, as well as other natural resources. Also, even though we know non-timber harvest is not always positive for biodiversity, it is important that future research also works on impacts on biodiversity conservation caused by other actors in the region [83,84].

This study is one of the first to explore the aspects that may affect the sustainability ofAttalea funiferaMartius products through a value chain perspective, using socioeconomic aspects and local perceptions as indicators. Our results show orientation and policy recommendations from the case study analysis regarding the need to seek solutions that reconcile the social, economic, and ecological aspects of the value chains [5]. One possibility is the search for options within national and international markets that add value to the products resulting from the fibers, leaf rachis, and fruits of piassava. Piassava handicrafts are considered Brazilian sociobiodiversity products. This recognition can enhance income for local communities because of its connection with the preservation of the Atlantic Forest and its production associated with traditional and local knowledge [85]. Also, market demand can change, as observed in other value chains such as Brazil nut [86]. Incentive policies and support for initiatives that may help the commercialization of the products are important, such as forest certification or the creation of seals that indicate the relationship of products with traditional communities and conservation, when applicable.

Another possibility is the expansion of community-based tourism, which, along with related wild species such as Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs), may support the sustainability of these communities [87]. It can add value to the piassava chain by providing for the conservation of forests and uplifting of local history, culture, and tradition of harvest, while also generating income for those involved in other economic sectors within the communities, such as bars, restaurants, and inns. However, we highlight the need for more studies to assess strategies, means, and risks of implementing these measures since community-based tourism can also add to and/or exacerbate conflicts [5,88].

Our results also corroborate with other studies that show the relationship between people and local forests can be highly context-specific [89]. Thus, we highlight the importance of including different people from the value chain in the discussion so that from their perspectives, they can point out stressors and priorities [90,91]. Including local people is even more essential when we know that traditional knowledge of palm use is vastly under-documented across different regions, ecosystems, and local communities [92]. Under this perspective, the analysis of sustainability at the local community scale gains significance [13]. This underscores the notion that, despite focusing on a particular species and communities within a specific region, the study yields valuable and replicable insights.

In this paper, we can see how community forest management is complex and how it is necessary to analyze several factors in search of the main threats that usually need more than an isolated solution [93]. For this, we need to listen to the communities and understand their history and local context, to seek initiatives that can be effective [84,94]. We recommend that future research should include the perception of other actors related to the value chain, as well as the empowerment of local institutions and the roles of economic and market forces in shaping opportunities for using market-based incentives to promote conservation and development [95].
