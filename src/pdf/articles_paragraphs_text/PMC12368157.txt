Emergency nurses face high demands that potentially lead to burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. This study aimed to identify and assess the predictive factors of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress among Emergency Nurses. A cross-sectional predictive design was employed. Data collected from 290 emergency nurses via Google Forms using convenience sampling from four government hospitals in Hail City, Saudi Arabia. Data collection was conducted between May and June 2024. The findings revealed that socio-demographic factors significantly predict these outcomes, with the regression model explaining 67.9% of the variance. Older age and being female (β = -6.532 for burnout) were consistently associated with lower levels of all three negative outcomes. While nurses with 6–10 years of experience reported lower levels (β = -5.071 for burnout), this benefit didn’t extend to the most experienced group. Shift patterns had a strong impact, with the 3 PM − 11 PM shift being most protective (β = -6.377 for burnout), while the 11 PM − 7 AM night shift correlated with significantly higher distress (β = 3.151 for burnout). Counterintuitively, higher education levels (e.g., Master’s β = 16.437 for burnout) were linked to increased negative outcomes, and the absence of social support (β = -8.726 for burnout) was surprisingly associated with lower levels of these outcomes. Younger nurses, male, and less experienced emergency nurses who are highly educated are more susceptible to burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. These phenomena reveal the need for integrated organizational and educational restructuring, emphasizing the intersection of sociodemographic and occupational characteristics. Strikingly, postgraduate-educated nurses display greater compassion fatigue and moral distress which paradoxically suggests that higher training may subject them to more frequent and heightened ethical dilemmas.

Burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress are considered some of the most critical psychosocial issues and occupational hazards among healthcare professionals. This is especially true in the context of fast-paced and high-tension environments found within emergency departments1,2. While these three constructs are distinct, yet they are interconnected. Each contributing to the growing strain on nursing staff and, in turn, compromising the quality of care rendered to patients. As the World Health Organization defines, burnout is a phenomenon which stems from unmanaged chronically stressful work environments, manifested through a feeling of deep exhaustion, detachment or distancing mentally from the job, and diminished work performance3. Compassion fatigue can be described as a form of secondary traumatic stress. It refers to an emotional burden that comes with caring for those who have been deeply hurt and traumatized which ultimately leads to loss of the ability to empathize4. Nurses experience moral distress when there are barriers that preclude them from performing actions aligned with their ethical beliefs. This tends to arise from institutional frameworks, culminating in powerlessness, frustration, and some form of assault on their morality5.

The global prevalence of these problems among nurses is concerning6. Studies indicate a considerable degree of burnout and dissatisfaction with one’s job coupled with exorbitant turnover intentions across different regions7. In Saudi Arabia, there is no shortage of studies that measure and evaluate these parameters because there are distinct local reasons that greatly affect their prevalence and severity. There is evidence that certain factors like the workplace and the degree of managerial support have a profound impact on burnout and compassion fatigue8,9for nurses working in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the organizational frameworks have been identified as main contributors to burnout and compassion fatigue in Saudi nursing workforce. This emphasizes the need to improve work environment conditions for mental health of healthcare personnel10. Conversely, a failure to address these conditions means that burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress11,12will persist, directly contributing to an increased intention to leave the profession.

Previous studies have identified burnout, moral distress, as well as compassion fatigue. It is as substantial and often interconnected problems within nursing, with a high prevalence across multiple areas and specialties13,14. However, certain demographic characteristics like education level, gender, and years of experience have not always been systematically examined. For instance, attaining advanced degrees such as a Master’s has shown to correlate with reduced burnout and compassion fatigue when compared to individuals with only a Bachelor’s degree13. Further, nurses, specifically those with an oncology background, show a greater propensity towards burnout with increased years of professional experience14. Nurses experience moral distress which actively leads to professional burnout and compassion fatigue, especially students or trainees amongst high-intensity cadres15. Compassionate satisfaction is an outcome that can be negatively impacted by psychological, behavioral, or more holistic interventions, resulting in decreased overall well being16. Psychological framing as well as demographic factors are vital in creating focused strategies aimed at improving the retention of nurses within the profession17. Despite these studies, there exists a significant knowledge gap regarding how specific demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, years of experience, shift patterns, education level, and social support) predict and influence these three outcomes simultaneously. Such an inquiry is urgent in order to understand these relationships deeply and derive appropriate, context-sensitive strategies aimed at protecting nurse well-being and improving the retention.

The Job Demands–resources (JD-R) model18was used to underpin the reasoning of this inquiry. As the model suggests, employee wellbeing is a function of the balance between job demands and resources. Along with these variables, some sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and level of education were explored alongside employment factors like experience, shift work, and social support as potential moderators of both job demands and job resources. For instance, limited coping skills may lead to greater perception of demands on the job for less experienced nurses. Conversely, strong social support networks can help mitigate the impact of these demands and serve as important resources.

This study is of paramount important that the findings from this study will facilitate an understanding of the complexities surrounding the working environment. This includes the unique professional socio-cultural setting in Saudi Arabia. Gaining this understanding will enable proper responses be formulated by health policy stakeholders, including stress management and relief protocols. This study aimed to identify and assess the predictive factors of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress among Emergency Nurses.

This was a cross-sectional predictive design. This design provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between certain factors (predictors) and the outcomes of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress in emergency nurses at a single point in time.

This study was conducted in the Hail region of Saudi Arabia, specifically in the four government hospitals in Hail city. These hospitals are well-known established medical centers with adequate facilities. Each has a bed capacity of over 200, and is among the most preferred hospitals in the area.

This study utilized convenience sampling for site selection and quota sampling for participant recruitment. Initially, we relied on convenience sampling in selecting the four hospitals located in the Hail City Region. This choice stemmed from the time and resource constraints associated with data collection in Emergency Departments (EDs), which needed to be time intensive and were accessible. The four hospitals chosen were already known to be the most utilized hospitals in Hail City. This is determined by a combination of bed capacity, annual patient throughput, and consultation with regional healthcare administrators.

After these hospitals were selected, we executed proportionate stratified quota sampling to ensure all groups were adequately represented. Based on the assumed distribution of ED nurses among the hospitals, 300 invitations were issued. Hospital A was allocated 80, Hospital B 75, Hospital C 70, and Hospital D 75. This distribution sought to ensure the sample captured the proportional representation of ED nurses in the participating hospitals, thus addressing biases introduced from a convenience sampling strategy.

To guarantee sufficient statistical power, an a priori power analysis was performed using G*Power software Version 3.1.9.7 (https://www.gpower.hhu.de/.) specifically multiple linear regression. The calculations estimated that 135 participants would be required to attain 80% power with a medium f² effect size of 0.15 and alpha of 0.05. Because the environment was expected to be busy and there would be attrition, 300 invitations were sent to the Emergency Department (ED) nurses. Of the invited participants, 290 responded, a response rate of 96.7%. The authors simultaneously exceeded their expected response rates and anticipated challenges toward the representativeness of the study. The exceptional response rate from nurses working in the four busiest hospitals located in Hail City illustrates the conduct towards the study from the available population. Otherwise, the data may signify a selection bias in the sense that the available nurses who seem to have a higher willingness to participate in such studies might be overrepresented.

All nurses who served in the emergency departments of public hospitals in the Hail Region of Saudi Arabia were regarded as respondents. The participants were expected to have at least one year of experience in an emergency. This approach was taken to guarantee that the participants had sufficient exposure to the demands and stressors involved in emergency nursing. This is to enable a more accurate estimation of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. Moreover, English fluency (reading and comprehension) was a mandatory requirement for all participants, alongside the experience and employment criteria.

Nurses with less than one year of experience may not have fully faced complex and often ethically challenging situations that could result in less representative or even skewed results. Conversely, nurses on official leave during the study period and those who did not provide informed consent were excluded.

The first part is the demographic and professional Information: This section gathered participants’ age (categorized into “<30”, “30–35”, and “>35” for analysis), gender (Male/Female), years of professional experience (categorized into “5 years and below”, “6 to 10 years”, and “11 years and above”), current shift pattern (7 AM to 3 PM, 3 PM to 11 PM, or 11 PM to 7 AM), highest educational qualification (Diploma, Bachelor of Science in Nursing [BSN], or Master’s), and perceived social support.

Burnout was measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI)19, a self-report scale consisting of 19 items and three dimensions: work-related (seven items), personal (six items), and client-related (six items). Each response was recorded on a 5-point Likert scale, and scores from each subscale were computed by adding item scores, with higher scores indicating more burnout in that dimension.

The Compassion Fatigue Scale (CFS)20, a self-report assessment, is a second questionnaire with 13 items. Items are rated on a 10-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (rarely/never) to 10 (Very Often). It should be noted that specific cutoff points for low, moderate, and high compassion fatigue have not been established for this scale. Total scores were calculated by summing responses across all items, with higher scores indicating greater levels of compassion fatigue.

The Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) was employed21to determine moral distress using 27 items. It quantifies the frequency and intensity of exposure to morally distressing experiences. For each item, frequency was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very frequently,’ and on the intensity scale, ‘none’ to ‘very distressing.’ Each item score was calculated from the frequency and intensity rating (0–16). The overall score of the MMD-HP (0-432) is the sum of item scores; higher scores indicate greater perceived moral distress.

Meanwhile, to assess the presence of social support among participants, a self-made, single-item questionnaire was included in the demographic section. Participants were asked, “Do you have the social support you need?” A dichotomous (Yes/No) response option was provided.

In previous studies, Cronbach’s alpha for the CBI was 0.8722, CF-SS was 0.80723, and MMD-HP was 0.9324. The set inclusion criteria required participants to speak English; hence, the three validated questionnaires (the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Compassion Fatigue Scale, and Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals) were administered in English, without any form of translation or adaptation. Validation was performed through expert evaluation by four practitioners in the area, two of whom were university researchers, one head nurse, and one supervisor nurse, who evaluated the relevance of the instruments to the study population. Furthermore, a pilot test was conducted using 18 emergency nurses that produced Cronbach’s alpha results of 0.89 for the CBI and CF-SS, and 0.97 for the MMD-HP, social support with 0.84 all of which demonstrated strong levels of internal consistency reliability for the sample tested in our study.

Formal permission was not sought for the use of the CBI, CFS, and MMD-HP. These instruments are deemed to be within the public domain or open access for non-commercial research, given the proper citation, which has been fully complied within this manuscript.

Before data collection, permission from the appropriate individuals in the hospital was required in parallel with the approval of the institutional board. Subsequently, research assistants approached eligible nurses through a generic invitation. Nurses willing to participate were briefed on the participant information sheet. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data collection employed Google Forms integrated with a specific link and the study ID was assigned to each participant to prevent duplicate submissions. The IP addresses were also recorded. The participants were guided and given at least 20 min to complete the questionnaire during their break from their shift. The data collection period was between May and June 2024.

All participants provided explicit informed consent prior to engaging in study activities. Consent documents substantiated their participation was voluntary. Detailed explanations of the study procedures were provided, and participants were encouraged to ask questions. Participants were informed of their right to withdraw at any time without any consequences.

The assumption of homogeneity of variances was first evaluated using Levene’s test. In scenarios where Levene’s test confirmed the assumption of equal variances (p> 0.05), a standard One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted. Conversely, in cases where Levene’s test signified a breach in the equal variances assumption (p≤ 0.05), Welch’s ANOVA was applied, which is a more favorable method for unequal variances and unbalanced group sizes. For all ANOVA analyses (standard and Welch’s), effect sizes (partial eta squared, ηp2) were also provided to assess the strength of the effects.

For the continuous demographic variables Age and Years of Experience, Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient () was applied to assess the monotonic association of these parameters with burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress.

Three multiple linear regression models were built in order to identify the determinants of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. In Model 1, burnout was predicted from its covariates, which were age, gender, shift, work experience, education level, social support, and the pre-identified variable social support. Model 2 predicted compassion fatigue, and Model 3 predicted moral distress. For each model, age, gender, shift, work experience, education level, and social support were included as independent variables. All defined statistical tests were two-tailed, and a significance threshold ofp< 0.05 was adopted.

Table1presents the sociodemographic aspects of 290 emergency nurses. The largest age group of the participants is younger than 30 years, accounting for 39.7% of the total population (mean age = 26.06 years). The sample was predominantly male (55.9%). In terms of professional experience, 47.6% had 5 years or less of experience (mean average = 2.87 years), indicating a younger workforce. Moreover, almost half of the nurses worked 3 PM to 11 PM shifts (49%), with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) as their highest educational qualification. Further, most nurses (76.9%) reported having social support.

Table2presents the differences in burnout, fatigue, and moral distress across various demographic characteristics. For gender, males had significantly higher mean burnout (58.23 ± 10.71), fatigue (79.23 ± 34.86), and moral distress (149.61 ± 118.16) than females (n= 128), with a substantial Cohen’s d of 0.95.

Differences between burnout, fatigue, moral distress, and socio-demographic characteristics of participants.

Concerning shift, significant differences were noted: the 7 AM − 3 PM shift (n= 45) exhibited high burnout (59.28 ± 5.16) and fatigue (91.13 ± 24.87), while the 11 PM − 7 AM shift (n= 103) had the highest moral distress (172.66 ± 130.15). The 3 PM − 11 PM shift (n= 142) reported the lowest levels across all three measures. Welch’s ANOVA was applied due to a Levene’s P-value of 0.003, with a partial eta squared (ηp2​) of 0.12.

Meanwhile, Master’s degree holders (n= 46) reported significantly higher burnout (56.58 ± 12.59), fatigue (75.58 ± 35.75), and moral distress (200.80 ± 49.85) compared to BSN (n= 223) and Diploma holders (n= 21). Welch’s ANOVA was applied here as well (Levene’s P-value < 0.001), yielding a very large partial eta squared (ηp2​) of 0.25.

Regarding social support, participants who reportednothaving social support (n= 67) exhibited lower mean burnout (49.43 ± 10.04) and fatigue (49.31 ± 20.34) compared to those who reported having social support (n= 223; burnout: 53.89 ± 11.06, fatigue: 65.38 ± 38.04). However, those without social support reportedhighermean moral distress (129.82 ± 73.45) compared to those with social support (110.07 ± 113.93). A t-test showed a significant difference for social support for all three outcomes (p= 0.003), with a Cohen’s d of 0.25.

Spearman’s correlations demonstrated significant associations between continuous demographic variables (Years of Experience and Age) with the outcomes (Burnout, Fatigue, Moral Distress). Years of Experience exhibited a strong negative correlation with burnout (ρ = −0.45), a medium-to-strong negative relationship with fatigue (ρ = −0.38), and a moderate negative correlation with moral distress (ρ = −0.25), all statistically highly significant (p< 0.01 orp< 0.001). This suggests increased experience is associated with a decrease in these negative outcomes. Likewise, Age correlated negatively and significantly with burnout (ρ = −0.30) and fatigue (ρ = −0.28), indicating older nurses tend to experience these challenges less. However, age had a very weak, non-significant correlation with moral distress (ρ = −0.05), suggesting no substantial relationship (Table3).

The multiple linear regression analysis various determinants of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress amongst emergency nurses (Table4). The comprehensive model which included age, gender, shift, work experience, education level, and social support accounted for 67.9% of adjusted variance (Adjusted R² = 0.679).

Factors affecting burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress among emergency nurses Variable.

R=0.830, R²=0.689, Adjusted R²=0.679. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, **p < 0.001.

Age remained a significant predictor across all three outcomes. Greater age was linked to decreased burnout (β = −0.803,p< 0.001), compassion fatigue (β = −0.795,p< 0.001), and moral distress (β = −0.81,p< 0.001). This indicates that each additional year a nurse aged, these adverse outcomes would reduce by about 0.8 units.

Within the context of gender, females significantly outperformed males on burnout (β = −6.532,p< 0.001), compassion fatigue (β = −6.45,p< 0.001), and moral distress (β = −6.6,p< 0.001) showing much lower scores.

Nurses with 6 to 10 years of experience showed a significant difference reporting lower burnout (β = −5.071,p< 0.001), compassion fatigue (β = −5.0,p< 0.001), and moral distress (β = −5.1,p< 0.001) compared to those with ≤ 5 years of experience. Still, those with 11 + years of experience did not differ from ≤ 5 years’ peers on any of the outcomes (p> 0.57).

Burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress were all significantly lower for employees working the 3 PM to 11 PM shift, when compared to those working the 7 AM to 3 PM shift (p< 0.001 for all: β = −6.377, −6.3, −6.4). However, the 11 PM to 7 AM shift showed a considerable increase in burnout (p= 0.034: β = 3.151), as well as compassion fatigue (p= 0.035: β = 3.1) and moral distress (p= 0.033: β = 3.2).

There was also a reversal of this trend for BSN holders. BSN trained nurses showed significantly higher rates of burnout (β = 14.281,p< 0.001), compassion fatigue (β = 14.2,p< 0.001), and moral distress (β = 14.3,p< 0.001). Even more alarming were the master’s prepared nurses, who exhibited even greater increases with burnout (β = 16.437,p< 0.001), compassion fatigue (β = 16.4,p< 0.001), and moral distress (β = 16.5,p< 0.001).

Finally, lacking social support was correlated with lower burnout (β = −8.726,p< 0.001) compassion fatigue (β = −8.7,p< 0.001) and moral distress (β = −8.75,p< 0.001), suggesting a complex role of social support that warrants further exploration beyond simple protective effects.

This study provides valuable insights into the factors associated with burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress among emergency nurses in Hail City, Saudi Arabia. The current results show that male nurses have reported, on average, greater levels of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress than female nurses. This is consistent with some studies suggesting higher burnout in men25,26. However, this is in conflict with other research proposing that women, due to caregiving roles and societal expectations, are more vulnerable to such phenomena27,28. Specific sociocultural factors impacting male nurses, like normative barriers to help-seeking and emotional expression, may heighten moral distress and burnout in this population29. On the other hand, norms permitting emotionally expressive behaviors may account for comparatively lower burnout among female nurses30. These results highlight the urgent need for cross-gender tailored, supportive interventions in healthcare frameworks, particularly given the context of some divisions of responsibility within the Saudi Arabian healthcare system which may impact gender disproportionally, emphasizing new avenues for targeted policies and programs from industrial psychology.

Working shifts had a tangible effect on the reported levels of burnout, fatigue, and moral distress. Burnout and fatigue were highest for the 7 AM to 3 PM shift while moral distress was highest for the 11 PM to 7 AM night shift. Our findings correspond to pre-existing literature that associates night shifts with increased stress and fatigue as well as decreased job satisfaction31–33and our regression model further confirmed that the 11 PM to 7 AM shift burned out employees, compassion fatigued them, and severely increased moral distress. Surprisingly, the 3 PM to 11 PM shift reported the lowest scores in all measures and this contradicts expectations based on sociobiological shifts which indicate that post evening shifts predispose increased burnout34. These findings draw to conclusion that there is a lack of primary research on the specific needs arising due to these shifts and the configurations of support systems in place.

The level of educational qualification held by nurses significantly impacted their experiences of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. Counterintuitively, nurses with a BSN and Master’s degree reported higher levels across all measures compared to diploma holders. Specifically, Master’s degree holders exhibited markedly greater burnout, fatigue, and moral distress than both BSN and diploma holders, and BSN-trained nurses also had higher levels than diploma holders. This “reverse pattern” from expectations might indicate that higher educational qualifications accompany heightened responsibilities, more complex decision-making, and deeper emotional and ethical burdens regarding patient care35. Scholars suggest that advanced ethical reasoning and emotional sensitivity might also lead to greater distress awareness in ethically challenging situations36,37. This critical finding reinforces the strong influence of educational qualifications on nurse well-being metrics. It underscores the need for targeted aid and policy adjustments for advanced-role nurses and a focus on organizational features alongside emotional work.

Consistent with existing literature, our analysis found that both age and years of experience were negatively correlated with burnout and compassion fatigue. More seasoned and older nurses tended to report lower levels of these negative outcomes, suggesting they may manage stress better due to greater coping skills, problem-solving abilities, and resilience developed over time38,39. While age also showed a negative correlation with moral distress, this relationship was very weak and non-significant in our correlation analysis, indicating a more complex interplay not fully captured by age alone. This finding contrasts with some research suggesting heightened moral distress among younger nurses due to perceived power deficits38,40. The regression analysis, however, showed age to be a consistent significant predictor, with increasing age associated with lower levels of all three outcomes. This divergence underscores the need to provide all age groups with necessary supportive structures, education, and training to effectively manage both burnout and moral distress. As such, healthcare organizations stand to benefit from targeted efforts. For instance, such as mentorship programs for younger and less experienced nurses that leverage the wisdom of senior nurses39,41and appropriate ethical support frameworks for older nurses facing unique moral distress issues42.

Finding of this present study regarding social support were particularly interesting. While social support generally acts as a critical protective buffer against burnout and fatigue in the literature43, our independent samples t-test indicated that nurses without social support reported lower mean burnout and fatigue. Furthermore, those without social support reported higher moral distress. However, our regression models showed that the absence of social support was associated with lower burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress, a counterintuitive finding. This complex relationship calls for further investigation. It suggests that while support may mitigate emotional exhaustion and cynicism, its role in reducing distress related to ethical conflicts or constraints on ethical action is less straightforward in our sample. It may also indicate a nuanced dynamic where individuals reporting “no” social support might possess different coping mechanisms or a perception of self-sufficiency that impacts their reported distress levels.

Using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model framework, several factors in this study can be classified as either job demands or resources. The high-pressure work environment of the emergency department, the challenges associated with certain shift patterns, and the increased responsibilities linked to higher educational levels can all be perceived as job demands. Similarly, younger age and less experience can limit available job resources and coping mechanisms that are not yet well-developed. By contrast, social support, despite its complex relationship in our findings, generally emerges as a significant mitigating job resource that can alleviate the effects of job demands on burnout and fatigue. The relationship between experience and outcomes suggests that a lack of experience may initially present a demand, but as nurses gain experience, their ability to utilize coping strategies may transform this experience into a resource. The specific factors they come to rely upon, alongside emotional resilience skills, add further nuances to this dynamic.

This research sheds new light on the well-being of emergency nurses in Saudi Arabia, underscoring its importance for practice, education, and policy. In our findings, cultural aspects such as social norms and age demographics specifically shape the phenomena of burnout and moral distress among emergency nurses in Saudi Arabia. The greater distress noted in master-prepared nurses indicates significant gaps in organizational support for role autonomy and resources. As for social support, its subtler effects alongside the considerable consequences of shift work highlight the urgent need for promotion of nurse well-being and their work-life balance. This research offers critical baseline information to shape more precise interventions.

From a practical standpoint, implement evidence-based staffing alongside flexible scheduling and mentorship initiatives. In education, incorporate stress management and ethics. Healthcare institutions need to assess these policies from the perspective of varying nurse experiences. These changes will, in the long term, enhance working conditions, decrease turnover, and improve patient care in emergency services across Saudi Arabia.

This study has limitations. The cross-sectional nature of the study leaves us unable to determine causation. Reliance on self-reported information creates the possibility of bias due to social desirability or recall. The use of convenience sampling may restrict the external validity of the results. Perhaps the most significant limitation is the failure to include nationality as a demographic variable. This is especially important within the context of Saudi Arabia as the country has a multicultural healthcare workforce which may substantially influence the experiences of burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. Nonetheless, our study establishes an important foundation and baseline data related to the identified issues in the emergency nursing workforce in Saudi Arabia.

Future studies should incorporate more rigorous designs such as longitudinal and qualitative approaches in order to explore causal pathways, and deeper understanding, respectively. We propose multicenter studies for greater external validity, as well as for the study of regional variations. Finally, intervention studies with controlled design are necessary to assess the impact of implemented strategies for their adjustment while controlling for social desirability and recall bias.

Younger nurses, male, less experienced, and more educated staff were found to be vulnerable to burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress. These factors collectively indicate a pressing need to develop tailored multidisciplinary interventions. Also, the study revealed that burnout, compassion fatigue, and moral distress are the cumulative impacts of a complex pattern of sociodemographic and occupational variables. This clearly highlighted the need for integrated systemic organizational and educational restructuring. Most remarkably, postgraduate education places nurses in increasing numbers of ethical dilemmas which is the paradoxical reason why emergency nurses with greater education tend to demonstrate higher levels of compassion fatigue and moral distress.
