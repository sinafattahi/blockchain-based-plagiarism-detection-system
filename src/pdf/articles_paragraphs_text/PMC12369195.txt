Ferroptosis-induced therapy is a promising approach for treating anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a highly lethal form of cancer. However, the specific effects of two anti-angiogenic agents, lenvatinib and anlotinib, on ferroptosis in ATC are not well understood.

Methods: To investigate the anticancer activity of lenvatinib and anlotinib in vivo, a subcutaneous tumor model was established in mice. The pharmacological effects of these agents on ATC cells were assessed using various assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, transwell, and sphere-forming assays. Angiogenesis was evaluated using a tubule formation assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured by flow cytometry, and levels of ferroptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were determined through western blot assays. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to profile the expression of GPX4, HO-1, PERK, and CHOP in tumor tissues.

Both lenvatinib and anlotinib demonstrated dose- and time-dependent inhibition of Luciferase-8505 C-induced subcutaneous tumors in mice, with anlotinib showing greater efficacy than lenvatinib. In vitro experiments revealed that while both drugs were effective at inhibiting angiogenesis, anlotinib displayed superior antitumor effects in terms of cell viability, proliferation, tumor sphere formation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistic studies indicated that anlotinib induced ROS-mediated ferroptosis through the ER stress pathway, a response not observed with lenvatinib treatment.

Anlotinib showed superior efficacy in treating ATC compared to lenvatinib, independent of their anti-angiogenic properties. The ability of anlotinib to induce ER stress-mediated ferroptosis suggests that targeting ferroptosis may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for ATC.

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with its incidence steadily increasing over the past few decades [1,2]. Although anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) accounts for less than 2% of all thyroid cancer cases, it is recognized as the most aggressive subtype, characterized by rapid progression and a median survival of only 5–12 months [3,4]. Despite the availability of multimodal therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, the clinical outcomes for ATC patients remain dismal due to the disease’s resistance to conventional treatments [5,6]. This dire prognosis underscores the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic strategies to improve survival outcomes in ATC.

Recent advancements in cancer biology have highlighted ferroptosis as a promising target for treating therapy-resistant cancers. Unlike apoptosis, ferroptosis is an iron-dependent regulated form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, offering a potential strategy to overcome resistance to traditional chemotherapeutics [7,8]. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated as a key upstream trigger of ferroptosis through the PERK-ATF4-GPX4-ROS signaling pathway [9–11]. These mechanistic insights suggest that activating ER stress could provide a novel approach to inducing ferroptosis in ATC.

Angiogenesis is another critical driver of ATC progression, and targeting angiogenesis has become a cornerstone of ATC treatment [12,13]. Lenvatinib and anlotinib, two clinically approved anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have demonstrated efficacy in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer [14,15]. However, as observed in several clinical trials, lenvatinib has shown limited effectiveness in ATC patients, likely due to its inability to address non-angiogenic mechanisms critical for ATC progression [16–18]. On the other hand, emerging evidence indicates that anlotinib inhibits angiogenesis and induces ferroptosis, making it a potentially superior therapeutic option for ATC [19,20].

Despite these promising findings, the pharmacological differences between lenvatinib and anlotinib in ATC remain poorly understood, particularly regarding their ability to trigger ferroptosis. Therefore, this study aims to systematically compare the anti-tumor mechanisms of lenvatinib and anlotinib, focusing on their capacity to induce ferroptosis via ER stress. Our findings are expected to provide a robust experimental basis for optimizing clinical treatment strategies for ATC.

Lenvatinib (Cat# E7080) and anlotinib (Cat# AL3818) were obtained from Selleck (USA). Tween 80 (Cat#T13947), TUDC (Cat# T6993) and PEG300 (Cat# T7022) were sourced from TargetMol (Shanghai, China). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#A0208) and goat anti-mouse IgG (#A0216) secondary antibodies were purchased from the Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (China).

Human thyroid epithelial cells (Nthy-ori 3 − 1), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cell lines (TPC-1 and IHH4), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cell lines (8505 C, KHM-5 M, Hth-7, C643, CAL-62, and BHT101) were obtained from certified cell repositories, including Procell Life Science & Technology (Wuhan, China), DSMZ (Germany), and the National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (Shanghai, China). Cell lines were authenticated using STR profiling and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Cat# S-FBS-SA-015, SERANA, Germany), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO₂.

The cytotoxic effects of lenvatinib and anlotinib were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay (Cat# A311-01; Vazyme Biotech, China). Cells (4,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with anlotinib (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 µM) or lenvatinib (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 µM) for 24, 48, or 72 h. After incubation with CCK-8 solution at 37 °C for 2 h, absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Synergy LX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek Instruments, USA).

ATC cells (8505 C and KHM-5 M; 1,000 per well) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ for 24 h. Detached cells were removed by washing three times with PBS, and cells were treated with anlotinib or lenvatinib (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 µM). After one week, colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min. Colony counts were quantified using ImageJ software.

Transwell chambers (Corning, USA) were used to assess cell migration and invasion. For migration, 3 × 104cells were seeded in the upper chamber with serum-free medium, while the lower chamber contained medium with 10% FBS and varying concentrations of anlotinib or lenvatinib (0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 µM). For invasion assays, chambers were pre-coated with Matrigel (1:4 dilution; BD Biosciences) for 1 h. After 24 h (migration) or 48 h (invasion) at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.01% crystal violet. Migrated and invaded cells were counted using ImageJ software.

8505 C and KHM-5 M cells were seeded in ultra-low attachment 6-well plates (Corning, USA) and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, and 20 ng/mL bFGF. Anlotinib and lenvatinib (0, 2, 4, and 8 µM) were added, and spheres were imaged under a microscope after one week.

Matrigel (BD Biosciences; diluted 1:2) was added to 96-well plates and solidified at 37 °C for 30–60 min. HUVECs (1.5–3 × 104cells per well) were suspended in a conditioned medium containing lenvatinib or anlotinib (0, 2, and 4 µM) and seeded onto the solidified Matrigel. Tube formation was imaged at 3, 6, and 12 h using an inverted microscope.

Cells were treated with anlotinib or lenvatinib for 24 h, then stained with DCFH-DA (10 µM, Cat#T15458, TargetMol) or C11 BODIPY 581/591 (20 µM, Cat# D3861, Thermo Fisher) in the dark for 30 min. After washing with PBS, ROS and lipid peroxidation levels were analyzed by flow cytometry (NovoCyte Advanteon, Agilent, USA).

Cell lysates were prepared using a lysis buffer containing PMSF. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher). SDS-PAGE separated equal protein amounts, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blocked with 5% skim milk. Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signals were visualized using a ChemiDoc-MP imager (Bio-Rad). Band intensities were analyzed using ImageJ.

Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-TFR (A19130, 1:5000), rabbit anti-FTH1 (A19544, 1:5000), rabbit anti-FTL (A11241, 1:5000), and HRP-conjugated β-Tubulin mouse mAb (AC030, 1:10000) from ABclonal, China; rabbit anti-HO-1 (10701-AP, 1:2000), rabbit anti-CHOP (15204-AP, 1:1000), and rabbit anti-ATF4 (10835-AP, 1:1000) from Proteintech, USA; rabbit anti-GPX4 (ab125066, 1:5000) from Abcam, USA; rabbit anti-PERK (#5683, 1:1000), rabbit anti-BiP (#3177, 1:1000), and rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2α (#3597, 1:1000) from Cell Signaling Technology, USA; and rabbit anti-eIF2α (AF6087, 1:1000) from Affinity, USA. Mouse anti-4HNE (ab48506, 1:25) from Abcam, USA. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Cat#: A0208) and anti-mouse (Cat#: A0216) IgG secondary antibodies were from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China.

Female BALB/c nude mice (3–4 weeks old) were subcutaneously injected with luciferase-expressing 8505 C cells (5 × 106cells/100 µL). Once tumors reached ~ 60 mm3, mice were randomized into five groups (n= 5) and treated with lenvatinib or anlotinib (2 or 4 mg/kg, i.p.) daily. Tumor growth and body weight were monitored. Bioluminescence imaging was conducted every five days using an IVIS Lumina III spectrometer. After 15 days, mice were euthanized, and tumors and organs were collected for histological and biochemical analysis. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (Approval No. 20231205163258888328).

Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0). After blocking with 3% BSA, sections were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Positive signals were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and images were captured with a fluorescence microscope.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA or t-tests. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n= 3), and statistical significance was defined asP< 0.05.

In vivo, imaging of tumor-bearing mice revealed that both lenvatinib and anlotinib significantly inhibited tumor growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner compared to the control group (Fig.1A-D). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of tumor tissues showed Consistent with the tumor growth suppression, H&E staining of excised tumors (Supplementary Fig.1) revealed extensive necrosis in the treatment group compared to controls, further supporting the efficacy of anlotinib. reduced tumor cell density in the treatment groups, with the lowest density observed in the anlotinib 4 mg/kg group (Supplementary Fig.1). Notably, at equivalent doses (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg), anlotinib demonstrated superior tumor inhibition, as evidenced by reduced tumor volumes and enhanced histological outcomes.

No significant changes in body weight were observed across all treatment groups, indicating a favorable safety profile for both drugs (Fig.1E). Similarly, HE staining of heart, liver, and kidney tissues revealed no pathological changes, and biochemical analyses of liver and kidney function (e.g., ALT, AST, BUN, ALP, UA, CR, ALB) showed no significant differences compared to controls (Supplementary Figs.1and2). These findings suggest that while both drugs exhibit acceptable safety, anlotinib outperforms lenvatinib in inhibiting ATC tumor growth, potentially due to their distinct pharmacological mechanisms.

Both lenvatinib and anlotinib are recognized angiogenesis inhibitors [21,22]. Consistent with this, our results showed that both drugs significantly inhibited the angiogenic potential of vascular endothelial cells, with no significant differences between them across varying concentrations and time points (Fig.2A). These data suggest that the differential anti-tumor efficacy of lenvatinib and anlotinib is unlikely attributable to their anti-angiogenic activity.

We next evaluated the cytotoxic effects of the two drugs on normal thyroid cells, papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cells, and ATC cells. The IC₅₀ values revealed that while both drugs exhibited anti-ATC activity, anlotinib demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity than lenvatinib (Fig.2B, Supplementary Fig.3). Notably, both drugs exhibited higher cytotoxicity in tumor cells than in normal thyroid cells, highlighting their tumor-specific effects (Fig.2C).

Further functional assays revealed that both lenvatinib and anlotinib inhibited colony formation, migration, invasion, and sphere formation in 8505 C and KHM-5 M cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figs.3A-B and4A-B). However, at higher concentrations (> 2 µM), anlotinib consistently showed superior anti-tumor activity compared to lenvatinib. These in vitro findings align with our in vivo observations, further emphasizing the distinct pharmacological advantages of anlotinib.

We previously demonstrated that anlotinib could trigger ferroptosis in ATC cells [23]. We measured intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid ROS levels to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Both drugs induced dose-dependent increases in ROS and lipid ROS levels; however, anlotinib consistently induced higher levels of both markers than lenvatinib at equivalent concentrations (Fig.5A-B).

Western blot analysis further revealed that anlotinib downregulated ferroptosis-associated proteins, including TFR, FTL, GPX4, and FTH, while upregulating HO-1 expression dose-dependently. In contrast, lenvatinib did not induce significant changes in the expression of these proteins (Fig.5C). Additionally, in ATC cells (8505 C and KHM-5 M), we treated the cells with lenvatinib (5 µM) and anlotinib (5 µM) at 0 h, 4 h, and 8 h, followed by Western blot analysis of ferroptosis-related markers GPX4 and HO-1 protein levels. We found that lenvatinib had no significant effect on the protein levels of ferroptosis markers, while anlotinib induced a time-dependent downregulation of GPX4 and a time-dependent upregulation of HO-1 protein levels, which was consistent with the results from our animal experiments (Fig.5D). These findings suggest that anlotinib effectively induces ferroptosis in ATC cells and exhibits both time- and concentration-dependent effects, a mechanism absent with lenvatinib treatment.

We examined the expression of ER stress-related proteins to investigate why anlotinib induces ferroptosis while lenvatinib does not. In 8505 C and KHM-5 M cells treated with lenvatinib, ER stress markers such as ATF4, BiP, CHOP, and p-eIF2α remained unchanged. In contrast, although the level of PERK was downregulated and eIF2α levels remained unchanged, anlotinib treatment significantly upregulated these markers (Fig.6A). Furthermore, in ATC cells (8505 C and KHM-5 M), we treated the cells with lenvatinib (5 µM) and anlotinib (5 µM) at 0 h, 4 h, and 8 h, followed by Western blot analysis of BiP and CHOP protein levels. We found that lenvatinib had no significant effect on ER stress, while anlotinib induced a time-dependent upregulation of BiP and CHOP protein levels, consistent with our animal experiment results (Fig.6B).

To further validate the role of anlotinib in inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in thyroid cancer (ATC) cells, we conducted experiments using the ER stress activator TUDC. The ATC cells were divided into four groups: a control group, an anlotinib monotherapy group, an ER stress activator TUDC group, along with a combined treatment group (anlotinib with TUDC). Through Western blot analysis, we observed the following results: after treating the ATC cells (8505 C and KHM-5 M) with TUDC (20 µM) for 24 h, the protein level of GPX4 was downregulated, while the protein expression levels of HO-1, BiP, and CHOP were upregulated. Furthermore, after the combined treatment of anlotinib (5 µM) with TUDC, Western blot results showed that the group receiving anlotinib combined with TUDC exhibited a greater downregulation of GPX4 protein levels and upregulation of HO-1, BiP, and CHOP protein levels compared to the group receiving anlotinib alone. These results suggest that anlotinib may promote ferroptosis in ATC cells by increasing CHOP-mediated ER stress and depleting GPX4, potentially enhancing tumor cell death through this mechanism (Fig.6C).

Immunohistochemical analysis of xenograft tumor samples confirmed these findings, showing increased expression of ER stress-related proteins and ferroptosis markers in the anlotinib-treated group (Fig.7). Together, these results indicate that anlotinib induces ER stress, critical in triggering ferroptosis in ATC cells. In contrast, lenvatinib does not elicit a similar response, highlighting a key mechanistic difference between the two drugs.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) progresses rapidly and has the poorest prognosis among thyroid malignancies, with a significant proportion of patients presenting with advanced disease at diagnosis [4,6]. Systemic treatment response rates remain below 15%, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to improve survival outcomes in ATC patients [24]. Current first-line treatments, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and sorafenib, have shown limited efficacy, often due to the activation of compensatory angiogenesis, which undermines therapeutic success [17,25]. Consequently, targeting angiogenesis has become a cornerstone of ATC therapy [26,27].

TKIs can alter the metabolism and iron homeostasis within tumor cells, potentially affecting the activity of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and inducing immune responses [28]. The combination with ferroptosis inducers may further modulate the tumor immune environment and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. Multi-target TKIs can change the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and suppressing angiogenesis, which may lead to alterations in iron homeostasis and promote ferroptosis [29]. For example, sorafenib, by inhibiting signaling pathways like VEGFR and PDGFR, could result in the accumulation of iron ions within tumor cells, creating conditions conducive to ferroptosis. When combined with ferroptosis inducers, it can alter the metabolism and iron homeostasis within tumor cells, potentially influencing the activity of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, further inducing immune responses and improving the effectiveness of immunotherapy [30].

Among anti-angiogenic therapies, lenvatinib and anlotinib are TKIs with significant efficacy in treating various malignancies, including ATC [31,32]. While lenvatinib has demonstrated some success in clinical trials, its therapeutic effects in unresectable ATC remain suboptimal [20,31,33]. Conversely, anlotinib has shown potent anti-tumor activity across multiple cancer types, yet its mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. Our study provides evidence that anlotinib exhibits superior efficacy compared to lenvatinib in inhibiting ATC growth in vitro and in vivo.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer [34]. Recent studies have shown that RAS-mutant cancer cells, which are highly prevalent in ATC (10–50% of cases), exhibit increased susceptibility to ferroptosis [35–37]. Additionally, dedifferentiated and apoptosis-resistant cancer cells, common in advanced ATC, are more sensitive to ferroptosis, further underscoring its therapeutic potential [38]. Recent studies have suggested that there may be an interaction between ferroptosis and ER stress in various cancers [39]. ER stress can influence iron metabolism by increasing iron absorption, altering the regulation of iron storage, and modulating iron release, thereby promoting the occurrence of iron death. The occurrence of iron death is accompanied by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which may damage the function of the ER, triggering an ER stress response [40,41]. This interaction plays a significant role in tumors such as colorectal cancer [42] and liver cancer [43]. Jointly modulating iron death and ER stress responses may provide new strategies for cancer treatment and holds important potential in personalized therapy.

Our findings reveal that anlotinib, not lenvatinib, induces ferroptosis in ATC cells by activating ER stress signaling.Previous studies, such as Ferrari et al., have demonstrated that lenvatinib exerts its anti-tumor effects primarily through apoptosis induction [44]. In contrast, our results highlight a distinct mechanism of action for anlotinib, wherein reciprocal signaling between ER stress and ferroptosis plays a pivotal role. Specifically, anlotinib induces significant ROS and lipid peroxide accumulation by upregulating key ER stress markers, including ATF4, BiP, CHOP, and p-eIF2α. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of anlotinib, which combines anti-angiogenic effects with the ability to trigger ferroptosis. This dual mechanism likely explains its superiority over lenvatinib in treating ATC.

The targeting of the ER stress-ferroptosis axis is emerging as a new strategy for cancer treatment, especially for solid tumors that are difficult to treat with traditional therapies [45]. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a cellular response to environmental stress, and excessive ER stress alters iron homeostasis, activating ferroptosis-related genes (such as TFRC, FTH1) and proteins (such as ACSL4, GPX4). This leads to the accumulation of free iron, triggering ferroptosis, which results in cellular membrane damage and death. With increasing resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, there is hope to reactivate the death mechanism of tumor cells by targeting the ER stress-ferroptosis axis, providing new directions for the development of anticancer drugs [46].

Our study also highlights the potential clinical relevance of ferroptosis as a therapeutic target. Given ATC’s resistance to traditional apoptosis-based therapies, strategies that exploit ferroptosis may represent a breakthrough in overcoming therapeutic resistance. Future studies should explore combinatory approaches integrating ferroptosis inducers with conventional therapies to maximize clinical benefits.

Certainly, our study has several limitations that warrant discussion. At the fundamental research level, the current investigation employs BALB/c nude mouse models which inherently lack a complete immune system. This biological constraint potentially compromises their ability to fully recapitulate authentic tumor microenvironment immune responses. Future investigations should prioritize exploring more physiologically relevant models, particularly patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that better preserve tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic response profiles. Additionally, multi-species validation approaches should be implemented to enhance the translational reliability and broaden the applicability of our findings.

From a clinical perspective, while anlotinib demonstrates greater clinical potential than Lenvatinib as a novel therapeutic agent, this preliminary observation requires rigorous validation through large-scale, multicenter clinical trials. To optimize therapeutic strategies, we propose two parallel research directions: First, systematic evaluation of combination therapies with ferroptosis inducers and Lenvatinib to potentially enhance treatment efficacy. Second, comprehensive clinical sample analysis should be conducted to validate the prognostic value of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (e.g., CHOP, ATF4) and ferroptosis-associated proteins (e.g., GPX4, HO-1) in anlotinib-treated patients. These biomarkers may serve dual purposes as predictive indicators and mechanistic validators for targeted therapy optimization.

This study identifies the reciprocal signaling between ER stress and ferroptosis as a critical mechanism underlying the superior efficacy of anlotinib in treating anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. By inducing ferroptosis, anlotinib provides a dual therapeutic approach that surpasses the anti-angiogenic effects of lenvatinib. Ferroptosis represents a promising therapeutic target for ATC, offering new avenues for developing effective treatment strategies for this highly aggressive cancer.
