Persons with dementia, their family/friend caregivers, and health systems agree that the preferred place of dementia care is a person’s home. Health systems have struggled to provide sufficient community-based dementia care supports, negatively affecting the health and well-being of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Therefore, dementia care and support of dementia caregivers are critical public health priorities. Adult day programs aim to simultaneously support the health and well-being of persons with dementia and their caregivers, but research focusing on these day program outcomes is lacking. The primary objective of this study was to compare various outcomes of day program attendees with dementia and their caregivers over time to outcomes of non-attendees with dementia in the community (with care needs similar to those of attendees) and their caregivers.

In each of four Canadian health regions (York Region, Ontario; Interior Health, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; Winnipeg, Manitoba), this study will recruit 250 day program attendees with dementia and their caregivers, and 500 community-based non-attendees with dementia and their caregivers. Applying criteria used by the health system to determine day program eligibility, we will identify non-attendees with care needs similar to those of attendees. We will combine participants’ longitudinal health administrative data with repeated (baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up) surveys to include variables not routinely collected by healthcare systems. Primary study outcomes are quality of life of the person with dementia and their caregiver. Secondary study outcomes include mental health (older adults, caregivers), cognitive and physical decline (older adults), time to admission to congregate care (older adults), and emergency room, hospital, and primary care use (older adults, caregivers). Using a day program survey, we will also assess day program characteristics. Using covariate-adjusted general estimating equations and time-to-event models, we will compare these outcomes between groups of day program exposure (no, low, medium, high).

Persons living with dementia, their caregivers, and health systems urgently need solutions to support living at home with a good quality of life. This study will generate provide evidence on the potential of day programs to address these critical public healt needs.

Globally and in Canada, the health and wellbeing of persons living with dementia [1–6], and of their family or friend caregivers are critical public health challenges [7–9]. Worldwide, in 2019, well over 57 million people were living with dementia [10], and in 2024 in Canada, this number was estimated to be over 700,000 [11]. By 2050, these numbers are expected to nearly triple [10,11]. Dementia is an umbrella term for various conditions that – often in combination – affect a person’s cognitive and daily function [12,13]. Care needs become more complex over time, posing significant challenges for caregivers, and increasing the risk of emergency, acute, or congregate care (e.g., assisted living, retirement, or nursing home) admission [14–22]. Experts agree that we are still a long way away from preventing or curing the various forms of dementia [1,6,23]. While research on the prevention and potential cures for dementia is critical, equal efforts are required in improving the care and quality of life (QoL) of those with dementia and their caregivers [1,6,23]. Dementia prevalence is expected to remain high for the decades to come (even with current and predicted decreases in incidence), and millions of individuals will live with dementia for approximately 5–10 years (up to 20 years) after their diagnosis [1,6,23]. These individuals and their caregivers need immediate and ongoing support, making this a public health priority [1,2].

Health and social care systems have struggled to provide adequate publicly-funded dementia care, particularly in light of an aging population [21,24–27]. In Canada, 61% of individuals with dementia live in the community [28], not in congregate settings, highlighting the necessity to build robust supports for the early stages of the disease. Persons with dementia often have multiple chronic conditions [29,30], and 25% of those with dementia in the community have severe cognitive impairment [28]. As a consequence, 28% of them require extensive assistance with activities of daily living [28]. Behavioural (25%) or depressive (25%) symptoms [28] amplify caregivers’ challenges to provide care. In addition, persons with dementia are often socially isolated or lonely, deteriorating their health, and wellbeing [31]. Remaining in the community safely and well for as long as possible is the preference of most older adults, their caregivers, and health systems [25,32–34], but dementia and caregiver challenges increase the risk for admissions to congregate care [35–37]. Partially as a result of changing continuing care policies, older adults have remained in the community longer in the last decades and have entered congregate care later, when their care needs are more complex [38,39]. Despite this, 10% of residents admitted to Canadian congregate care (up to 30% in some places) have care needs that potentially could have been met in the community with adequate support [34,40,41], highlighting the critical role of caregivers and appropriate community-based services.

In 2022, over 8.3 million people in Canada provided unpaid care to an adult family member or friend [19]. Of those receiving formally provided home care, 96% also have an unpaid caregiver [20]. The majority (57-81%) of caregivers of older adults are women [42], and while caregiving can be rewarding, over 70% of caregivers experience negative effects, including feeling tired (56%), worried/anxious (44%), overwhelmed (37%), short tempered/irritable (31%), or having disturbed sleep (29%), with women disproportionally affected [19]. Caregivers who are distressed (vs. not) provide twice the amount of care hours (38 h/week, equivalent to a full-time job) [20]. Those caring for someone with dementia provide more care hours than other caregivers (26 vs. 17 h/week), and experience greater distress (45% vs. 26%) [22]. Health system efforts to retain persons with dementia in the community longer have increased both the care needs of those with dementia in this setting and caregiver distress [14–18]. This care giving also accounts for considerable cost. In 2019, the replacement cost for the care provided by unpaid caregivers was ~$9 billion, estimated to increase to $27 billion by 2050 [21]. Caregivers’ out-of-pocket expenses add up to an additional $1.4 billion per year [22]. For persons with dementia to successfully age in place, we urgently need supports such as adult day programs that target both the person with dementia and their caregiver(s).

Day programs have potential to support aging in the community and save healthcare costs [43–45]. They are settings in which attendees receive some care and support for a few hours a day, while living at home [43,46–52]. There is wide variation of attendance patterns (from a few days a month to daily, and from a few hours per day to all day, or sometimes even overnight), admission criteria, supports and services offered, and funding models [43,46–52]. However, day programs have some common features that distinguish them from other continuing care services. In contrast to senior or community centres [53] and creative arts programs [54], day programs employ care and social support staff and admit people with physical, social and recreational care needs [44,50]. In contrast to home care [55] or one-on-one respite care [56], they support social interactions (e.g., with other day program attendees and staff), and because the attendee is away from home, they are thought to be more effective in providing caregiver respite [52]. Day programs may provide services for long-term periods of time (months/years) [44,50]. This differentiates them from geriatric day hospitals that provide short-term (days/weeks) medical, therapeutic, and rehabilitative care [57].

In a on-going realist review [58], our team identified 14 systematically conducted literature reviews [44,45,47–52,56,59–63], including 329 international studies, published between 1975 and 2021 that evaluated the effects of day programs for older adults (with and without dementia) and their caregivers. Studies are mostly quasi-experimental, small-scale, and observational, and reviews synthesizing these studies [44,45,47–52,56,59–63] suggest that, compared to those not attending day programs, attendees (and their caregivers) fared better on factors related to health and wellbeing. However, these studies have methodological limitations and inconsistencies. For example, two quasi-experimental international studies found that day program attendance decreased atendees’ levels of depression [64,65], while a randomized controlled study found no effect on depression [66]. Two studies found that day programs delayed admission to congregate care [67,68], while one study reported the opposite [52].

Canadian reports [43,44,46,68–92] were often expert opinions or experience reports [69–75,83], and research studies typically were of a single region, included a limited set of outcomes, did not specifically focus on persons with dementia, did not attempt to associate day program characteristics with effects, did not examine outcomes among equity-deserving groups, and failed to include qualitative data from persons with lived experience, their advocates, or knowledge users to add robustness to findings. More information is especially needed on experiences of discrimination due to ageism and ableism, and how racism, transphobia or homophobia exacerbate poor QoL for day program attendees with dementia [93,94]. Finally, challenges related to social determinants of health need explication, given most persons with dementia are women, and women also provide most unpaid and paid care, facing substantial healthcare costs and low income [95].

Our team is conducting a population-based, retrospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT06440447) in Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba, Canada [96]. We will use administrative healthcare data (2012 and 2024) to compare outcomes among day program attendees (with and without dementia) with a propensity score matched control group of non-attendees. This study will provide important insights into day program patters of use/non-use, characteristics of attendees/non-attendees, and factors that vary between provinces and over time. We will assess whether attendees compared to non-attendees enter congregate care later; use emergency, acute, or primary care less frequently; experience less cognitive and physical decline; have better mental health; and have less distressed caregivers. However, administrative healthcare data provide limited information on older adults’ social identities, quality of life, caregiver outcomes, and day program characteristics [1,2,97–108]. A prospective cohort study, linking primary survey data to administrative healthcare data is critical to overcome these limitations.

To assess whether a cohort of 1,000 day program attendees with dementia and their caregivers compared to a control group of 2,000 non-attendees with care needs similar to those of attendees and their caregivers have better primary outcomes (attendee and caregiver QoL), and secondary outcomes, including attendees’ later admission to congregate care, slower cognitive and physical decline, improved attendee and caregiver mental health, and reduced use of emergency, acute, or primary care.

To examine what attendee and caregiver health and social characteristics, and what day program characteristics are associated with these outcomes, and with the degree of day program use or non-use.

To explore perspectives of persons with dementia, their caregivers, advocates, day program staff/managers, and health system decision makers on why persons with dementia do or do not use a day program, and on how and why day programs have positive, negative, or no effects on attendees with dementia and their caregivers – especially those with multiple, intersecting vulnerabilities.

Applying an explanatory sequential mixed methods design [109], we will combine a Canadian prospective, cross-provincial cohort study (objectives 1 and 2, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT06496945) with a qualitative descriptive study (objective 3) to contextualize the quantitative findings. Using an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) approach [110,111], and informed by our ongoing day program realist review [58] and our population-based retrospective day program cohort study [96], we developed this study design with a diverse group of 32 collaborators. These include older adults, some with dementia, their caregivers, representatives of Alzheimer Societies and caregiver organizations, day program staff/managers, and health system and government policy makers. We will continue to collaborate with this group throughout the study. Our cohort study will link repeated survey data with longitudinal administrative healthcare data from day program attendees and their caregivers, and non-attendees and their caregivers. In advisory meetings and through qualitative work, our collaborators will provide intimate knowledge of day programs, and the experience of attending them, not attending them, or caring for an attendee or non-attendee. After each wave of quantitative data collection (baseline, and after 1 and 2 years, Fig. 1), we will prepare feedback reports, and discuss them with our collaborators and additional key informants in webinars with embedded semi-structured interviews and focus groups.

The cohort study will follow the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) [112], and the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) [113] guidelines. We will also follow the standards for reporting qualitative research [114], Creswell’s & Plano Clark’s work on mixed methods [109], and a mixed methods reporting guideline [115].

We will include publicly funded, community-based continuing care systems in four Canadian health regions: Calgary Health Zone (Alberta), Interior Health Region (British Columbia), Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (Manitoba), York Region (Ontario). We selected these regions because we already have long-standing relationships with local health system representatives, advocates (Alzheimer societies and caregiver organizations), older adults, and their caregivers in these regions. Building such relationships takes years, and they are critical for the success of our iKT approach. Further, continuing care systems in these regions are comparable, and they all offer publicly funded day programs. This is important because in Canada, each province and territory regulates continuing care individually, leading to considerable variation in organization and delivery [116,117]. Each selected region offers a range of publicly funded continuing care services that are provided in settings other than congregate care, such as household assistance, friendly visitors, personal care, nursing and other health professional care, caregiver support and respite, and adult day programs [118–130]. In each region, the healthcare system determines and enacts access criteria and provides services either directly or via contracted providers [118–130]. For day programs, this involves completion of one of the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) tools for use with older adults in the community [125,131–133]. These include the RAI Home Care (RAI-HC) [134], the interRAI-HC [135], or the RAI Community Health (CHA) [136]. All three of these are standardized, valid, reliable clinical assessment tools [134–137], and items and outcome scales relevant to this study are comparable between these three tools [137–139]. Day program eligibility includes the attendee’s ability to cope with activities of daily living to some extent, no or minimal need for assistance to ambulate/transfer, continence or requiring minimal assistance in managing continence needs, no unmanageable behavioural problems, and being alone for long periods within the day, or having a caregiver who needs respite [125,131–133].

In each region, we will invite all eligible day program attendees and their primary caregivers (the person most informed about and involved with the individual’s care) for participation, aiming for 250 day program dyads per region (1,000 in total). For every day program dyad, we will recruit 2 non-attendees with care needs similar to that of day program attendees and their caregivers for every attendee (500 non-attendee dyads per region, 2,000 dyads in total). We over-sample control dyads since we expect some of the non-attendees to start attending a day program during the course of our study. Our collaborators assure us that this study is essential and that persons with dementia and their caregivers will see the value of participation.

Similarity of care needs between cohorts will be ensured by applying day program eligibility criteria (see below) as inclusion criteria to non-attendees. While propensity score matching has been designed to ensure a similar distribution of baseline variables among treatment (attendees) and control (non-attendees) – akin to what random assignment aims to accomplish in randomized trials [140], applying this method in this study is not feasible. We will not have access to participants’ data needed for the matching until they have provided us with informed consent to access their data. Therefore, we decided to use conventional covariate adjustment of our models (details see statistical analyses). Studies have shown that conventional covariate adjustment performs as well as propensity score matching, and that selection between the two methods should depend on which method is most suitable [141].

To be eligible, day program attendees must (1) attend a publicly funded day program in either of the participating health regions (which means that a RAI assessment is available for them since this is the tool used to determine eligibility to publicly funded day programs), (2) have a primary caregiver, (3) have at least mild cognitive impairment (Cognitive Performance Scale [CPS] [142] score ≥ 2), and (4) be at least 55 years old.

Eligible non-attendees must (1) have a recent (≤ 6 months) RAI record on file, (2) have a primary caregiver, (3) have at least mild cognitive impairment (CPS score ≥ 2), (4) be at least 55 years old, and (5) meet regional day program eligibility criteria. Day program eligibility [125,131–133] includes (5.1) the ability to cope with activities of daily living to some extent (Activities of Daily Living – Hierarchy scale, ADLh [143] score of ≤ 2), (5.2) no or minimal need for assistance to ambulate/transfer (using the RAI mobility items), (5.3) continence or requiring minimal assistance in managing continence needs (RAI continence items), (5.4) no unmanageable behavioural problems (RAI behaviour items and Aggressive Behaviour Scale, ABS [144]), and (5.5) being alone for long periods within the day, or having a caregiver who needs respite (RAI caregiver availability and caregiver distress items).

We will exclude persons attending day programs that are not publicly funded, since admission criteria to these programs (and, therefore, attendee characteristics) may deviate substantially from those to public day programs. Also, characteristics of attendees and their caregivers who are able to afford paying private day program costs out-of-pocket (e.g., income, education, general health) are likely not comparable to characteristics of attendees and caregivers of publicly funded day programs. We will exclude attendees and non-attendees without a primary caregiver, and we will exlude dyads if either of the two persons declines to participate in the study.

If the person with dementia provides an answer to any of these questions that indicates ambivalence or hesitation, the study team will explore this topic further until they are reassured that the participant fully understands the study, their rights, and is fully willing to participate. Individuals failing to clearly and correctly respond to all of these questions are not able to provide informed consent on their own. For these persons we will obtain written informed consent from a substitute decision maker (who may or may not be the person’s primary caregiver), and we will complete assent with the person with dementia.

Our target sample of 3,000 dyads (1,000 day program dyads and 2,000 non-day program dyads) is large enough to detect the expected effects in our primary outcomes (quality of life for the person with dementia and that of their caregiver, DEMQOL, see below). To detect differences of 2.59 points in DEMQOL scores between groups and over time (smaller than the recommended minimum important difference of 5–6 points [147]) for attendees with different degrees of day program exposure (no, low, medium, high [68]), we require a total sample size of 1,280 persons with dementia (half of them attendees), allowing for 36% non-participation/attrition (as reported in similar cohort studies [148]). Estimates are based on simulations, using general estimating equations (GEEs), accounting for repeated measures using a fixed autocorrelation structure, adjusted for covariates, and using a Wald test of a non-central chi-square distribution (𝛼=0.05, power = 0.8) [149]. Based on the same method and assumptions, we require 1,120 caregivers (half of them to attendees) to detect the same effect size in C-DEMQOL scores (our caregiver QoL assessment tool, see primary study outcomes section).

We will administer surveys for persons with dementia and their caregivers at baseline and after 1 and 2 years to include variables not available in health administrative data. We will also survey caregivers of persons with dementia who died or were admitted to congregate care to obtain more information on factors leading up to death or transition, similar to a previous study in assisted living [150,151]. Surveys were adapted for this study from validated tools used by our team in previous studies [152–157]. We will apply an approach to data collection successfully used in previous prospective cohort studies involving older adults and their caregivers [148,158–160]. For this, trained research assistants, guided by our regional lead investigators, will visit older adults and their caregiver at home, obtain written informed consents, and, whenever possible, interview participants in succession (to reduce time and participant burden). Data will be entered into SimpleSurvey [161], a secure, Canadian survey platform used in previous studies [152–157]. Further, at baseline the regional leads will work with our collaborators to obtain data on the characteristics of each publicly subsidized day program in our regions, using a day program survey previously used in a Canadian study [92], and adapted with our experts, for use in this study.

For each individual in our cohort and using each person’s personal health number, regional health systems will identify an provide us with all of the person’s records available within the study time frame from the following databases: (1) Regional continuing care registries, containing information on the start/end of any community-based continuing care service, including day programs, change of these services over time, and admissions to congregate care. (2) Population registries for each participant’s demographic data (e.g., age, sex, date/place of death, relationship status, education). (3) RAI records, which are standardized, valid, reliable assessments [137]. Each person receiving long-term home care (6 + months) or who attends a day program is assessed annually. The information includes medical conditions, functional dependence, pain, cognitive impairment, mood, and behavioural problems. It also includes information on a person’s marital/partnership status, caregiver availability, whether that caregiver lives with the older adult, and caregiver distress. We will work with our regional health system experts to ensure a RAI-HC assessment is available for each participant at each time of data collection. (4) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) documents all inpatient hospital stays, including diagnoses and length of stay. (5) National Ambulatory Care Report System (NACRS) (plus the physician payment file in British Columbia where NACRS is not collected in some emergency departments [162]) for all emergency department visits and diagnoses. (6) Databases on out-patient prescription medications filled through a community pharmacy and covered by provincial drug formulary. (7) General and specialist care provider health service claims submitted for payment (e.g., by general practitioners, nurse practitioners, geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, therapists).

Day program use will be determined based on information from the provincial continuing care registries, documenting the dates a person starts/stops attending a day program, and days of attendance. Using an approach reported by Kelly at al. in a retrospective cohort study in British Columbia [68], we will first calculate an attendance index (AI) for each person. We will multiply each person’s total number of days attended by the total number of months between their first and last date of attendance, divided by 30 (~ number of days/month). We will categorize day program use as no (AI = 0), low (AI > 0, but ≤ 7.2), medium (AI > 7.2, but ≤ 38.4), or high (AI > 38.4) [68].

Our primary outcomes will be QoL for each, persons with dementia and caregivers, an outcome whose importance advocates have emphasized alongside quality of care and symptom management [1,2,101–108]. We will use the DEMQOL suite of instruments [163,164], developed and validated to measure QoL of persons with dementia, and of their caregivers. We will use the DEMQOL [165,166] for older adults who can self-report. For those who cannot self-report, we will use the DEMQOL-Proxy [165,166], a caregiver’s proxy report of an individual’s QoL. For caregiver QoL, we will use C-DEMQOL [100]. All three tools have demonstrated robust internal consistency reliability (close to or above 0.9), content validity, factorial validity, and construct validity (correlation with related constructs as expected) [100,165–167]. The DEMQOL and the DEMQOL-Proxy have also demonstrated robust test-retest reliability (close to or above 0.7) [165–167]. Our team has used the DEMQOL in Canada and demonstrated its feasibility, acceptability, reliability, and validity [152,153]. Self-reports are the gold standard for QoL assessment, but many of our participants may have severe cognitive impairment. QoL self- and proxy reports, as well as proxy reports from different sources (e.g., care staff vs. family/friends) should not be mixed because these scores differ systematically, compromising comparability [168]. To be inclusive of all persons with dementia (including those with moderate to severe cognitive impairment), we will collect and compare caregiver proxy reports for all participants with an available caregiver. However, we will collect additional QoL self-reports whenever possible for separate analyses.

We will administer the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Short Form (CES-D10 [169]) to caregivers. The scale is well established and validated, and has been used in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging [170] and in our own work [156,157]. We will use a CES-D10 cut-point of ≥ 10 to identify clinically significant depressive symptoms (sensitivity 89%, specificity 47% for major depressive disorder) [171].

We will administer the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7 [172,173]) to caregivers. Like the CES-D10, the GAD-7 is well established and validated, and has been used in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging [170] and in our own work [156,157]. We will use a GAD-7 cut-point of ≥ 8 to define clinically significant anxiety disorder (sensitivity 92%, specificity 70%) [174].

We will administer the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to caregivers [175,176]. The NPI is a widely established, reliable and valid tool to measure the severity of each of 12 neurological and behavioural symptoms of dementia and the level of distress each of these causes to the caregiver.

From routinely collected RAI-HC assessments, we will obtain information on symptoms of depression, available for all persons with dementia in our study. The RAI-HC Depression Rating Scale (DRS) [177] is validated. Scores range from 0 to 14. A cut-point of 3 or higher represents clinically meaningful depressive symptoms [177,178].

We will capture these outcomes, using routinely collected and well validated RAI-HC scales [137]: the ADLh scale [143] and the CPS [142]. Both scales range from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment), and our outcomes will be any difference between the previous and follow up measurement in each of these scales.

Using regional continuing care registries, we will measure time from first receipt of community-based continuing care to care home admission.

Using care practitioner claims data, we will generate rates of different types of primary and specialist care use (e.g., family physician, specialists, nursing practitioner, allied health providers). We will use the DAD and NACRS databases to generate rates of emergency room registrations, hospital admissions, and days in hospital (including alternative level of care; ALC) [88]. We will generate rates separately for persons with dementia and their caregivers, stratified by day program use.

We will collect data on a comprehensive set of social identities for persons with dementia and caregivers. Most of these variables are not routinely collected in Canada, and not included in our health administrative data. However, social determinants of health, the non-medical factors and conditions of people’s daily lives, are the major drivers of health inequities [179–184].Intersecting identities, such as class, age, gender, race/ethnicity, disability, and religion create variations in experiences of privilege and discrimination, all of which can affect health and wellbeing [185,186]. Therefore, using our validated surveys [152–157], we will collect data on participants’ age, marital status, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic/cultural identity, first language, immigration status, relationship between the older adult and the caregiver, household composition and income, employment status, level of financial concerns, and education. Clinical and functional data will be sourced from RAI, DAD, NACRS, and pharmaceutical and claims records. We will use these variables to derive the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, a measure of health status and expected healthcare costs [187]. Lastly, using our day program survey, we will assess day program characteristics such as the number of spaces, staffing numbers/mix, ownership model, type of programming/services, program specialization (e.g., dementia, arts-based), number of persons on wait list, average time on wait list, transportation options, and any fees that require co-payment.

We will compare sample characteristics and study outcomes between attendees and non-attendees (and between caregivers of attendees and non-attendees) at baseline, year 1 and year 2, using bivariate statistical tests (e.g., Chi2or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables, t tests or analyses of variance [ANOVA] for continuous variables, and their non-parametric equivalents if variables violate statistical assumptions). We will stratify our descriptive analyses by health region, gender, ethnic/cultural identity, and various other social variables (collapsing categories if needed to ensure sufficient cell-size and confidentiality). We will also test whether our matching variables are equally distributed in the matched cohorts and compare social identity variables between groups.

We will specify separate GEE models [188] for QoL of persons with dementia, caregiver QoL, and for each of the secondary outcomes (except for time to care home admission). We will assess whether outcomes after 1 and 2 years are better for those with vs. without day program exposure and for those with higer vs. lower degrees of day program exposure (to account for transitions to a day program during our study). We will adjust models for repeated assessments of participants (random repeated measures term), nesting (random intercepts for participants nested within day programs or community care organizations), baseline differences in outcome scores, participant covariates (social identities, day program eligibility variables, medical and functional conditions), and day program/community care characteristics. We will use an identity link function for continuous outcomes and a logit link function for dichotomous or categorical outcomes.

To assess the effect of day program usage on time to care home admission, we will specify a multi-level time-to-event model with a region-level random effect [189]. The model will include day program usage as an independent variable and will be adjusted for the same covariates as the GEEs.

Using our day program-only cohort, we will run similar GEEs and time-to-event models as described in the previous section. However, we will include participant social identities and day program characteristics identified as important in objective 1 analyses as independent variables. This will provide insights into the differential effects of day programs on persons with dementia and their caregivers based on social identities and day program characteristics.

The proposed set of matching and model adjustment variables is comprehensive and based on strong evidence of their association with our outcomes [35,98,153,190–193]. However, we acknowledge that causal attribution is limited in observational studies. Day program attendance cannot be randomized, so we are not able to account for unobserved variables. To strengthen our analytic approach, we will compare our study sample to the overall population of persons with dementia in the respective region, using population-based health administrative data currently used in our retrospective day program cohort study [96]. We will not be able to do this in the York Region, where we cannot identify day program attendees in administrative healthcare data, and we will have to limit this to available variables (largely clinical and functional). However, this approach will show whether our samples differ substantially from the regional populations.

At three time points following the quantitative data analyses (baseline and after 1 and 2 years, Fig. 1), we will prepare feedback reports, including lay summaries and visuals of key findings. In team meetings, we will explore patterns of outcomes and outcome trajectories, identify results that we wish to seek input on from our collaborators and additional key informants (older adults in need of care, including those with dementia, and their caregivers). We will then disseminate these reports to collaborators and key informants one week before we present the reports to them in web-based feedback summits. Embedded in each of the feedback summits will be focus groups with our collaborators, and semi-structured interviews with additional key informants.

During each of the three feedback summits, we will conduct 6–8 semi-structured interviews with older adults, including some with dementia, and/or their caregivers. We aim to interview the older adult and their caregiver as a pair, but we will interview participants individually if desired by participants. We will purposefully select participants based on outcome patterns identified in the descriptive analyses (e.g., unexpected day program use patterns, groups experiencing access barriers or particularly good or poor effects), or based on recommendations from our experts. For example, we may purposefully select individuals of racialized or gender-diverse communities, or persons potentially eligible for but not attending a day program.

At each of the three feedback summits, we will conduct four focus groups, one with each: individuals with lived experience, advocates, day program representatives, and health system policy makers. Conducting separate focus groups for participants with similar backgrounds, experiences, and interests will provide a safe space to express opinions and facilitate rich discussions. Focus groups will take ~ 60–90 min, and they will be co-facilitated by an investigator and a collaborator of the respective participant group. Facilitators will use a semi-structured focus group guide. Questions will be developed with our collaborators, based on our specific findings. We anticipate they may focus on participants’ opinions on how and why we see certain effects or outcome patterns, whether results resonate with their experiences, what gaps in our analyses they see, any questions they have for us, or suggestions for improvement strategies. Focus groups will be recorded via our videoconferencing software, and a team member will take field notes. The team will work to ensure each participant gets an opportunity to share their perspective.

Team members with expertise in qualitative research will conduct semi-structured interviews, which will be recorded via our videoconferencing software. They will introduce the purpose and process and share a data summary (highly visual and accessible to these audiences) to start the conversation. Similar to the focus groups, data collectors will have a semi-structured interview guide with specific questions developed by our team based on our specific findings.

We will use Zoom for focus groups and semi-structured interviews, including Zoom’s feature to record and verbally transcribe these discussions. Research assistants will compare Zoom transcripts to the recordings to ensure accuracy. We will use thematic content analysis [195–197] to deductively code transcripts, focusing on participants’ experiences, explanations, and contextualizations. Using the constant comparative method [198], the analysis team will inductively identify additional themes. For rigour and trustworthiness, each of 2 team members will independently code texts and then reconcile coding until consensus is reached. Data will also be regularly discussed within the larger team to ensure breadth, depth, and consensus among team members of the codes developed. We will present our themes and findings to participants to ensure our interpretations match participants’ intended meaning (member checking).

Integration of quantitative and qualitative data will be done on the design-level, the methods-level, and during interpretation and reporting [199]. On the design-level, this study will follow an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach [109], in which quantitative data will be analyzed, summarized, presented to audiences with relevant expertise and experience, and further contextualized, using focus groups and semi-structured methods. This will be done (methods-level) through connecting (semi-structured interview participants will be selected from the sample of survey participants), building (questions of semi-structured focus group and interview guides will be informed by the quantitative findings), and embedding (connecting qualitative and quantitative data at multiple points) [199]. To facilitate integration during interpretation and reporting, both, quantitative and qualitative results will be regularly shared and discussed with the larger team (including our collaborators). Using a staged approach, we will integrate quantitative and qualitative data through narrative [199]. Narratives will be developed for quantitative findings (transformation), which will then inform the qualitative data collections. Qualitative results will be used to contextualize quantitative data and to answer questions posed by the quantitative data. Whenever possible, we will present qualitative and quantitative data jointly (joint display [199]), e.g., a bar chart showing greater day program use by one group compared to another, placed next to a qualitative narrative/theme discussing that phenomenon and maybe providing explanations.

Persons living with dementia, their caregivers, and health systems urgently need solutions to support living at home with a good quality of life. There are few feasible solutions, but day programs are one of them. Despite knowing that day programs address an immense and costly care gap, we require analyses to drive policy and practice change to make day programs both more available and effective. This study will generate robust Canadian knowledge on the effects of day programs for persons with dementia, their caregivers, and health systems. Based on our day program surveys and qualitative work, we will identify essential elements of day programs, and how they can be improved. Our study will help understand which persons are best served by what types of day programs and to identify gaps in day program services for attendees and caregivers. We will provide critical evidence for health systems to help them leverage the full potential of day programs to provide appropriate care, prevent inequities and mitigate the need for emergency, hospital, and congregate care use. Ultimately, such knowledge is a prerequisite to improving the QoL of persons with dementia and their caregivers, alleviating caregiver burden, and reducing social costs associated with health and wellbeing.

Our proposed study will have some limitations. While based on a robust sample size calculation, our findings will be less generalizable than that of a population-based study. Potential participants may decline participation, and dropouts (e.g., due to death, inability or unwillingness to continue participation) may pose a risk for selection bias and smaller than anticipated sample size. We will collect data on reasons for participant drop out and we will compare characteristics of participants who did vs. did not drop out. Strong support from local day programs, health systems, and advocates gives us confidence in the feasibility of this study. While our sampling approach will exclude individuals in the community whose care needs are either too low or too severe for day program eligibility, our approach will minimize confounding of the variables used to determine eligibility and maximize comparability of groups at baseline [200–202]. We will assess group differences in clinical, functional, and social identity characteristics after each wave of data collection, adjust models for these differences, and stratify models by important sub-groups where feasible (see statistical analyses section for details). Sub-samples of certain equity-seeking groups may be small. In Canada, only 4% of the general population identify as non-heterosexual or gender-minority, and only 7% of this group are 65 + years [203]. Of those aged 65 + years, only 14.5% identify as visible minority [204]. Unfortunately, we have no similar data for these individuals in day programs, but we expect the inclusion of some social identity variables in our models may be limited. If necessary, we will collapse categories, use multiple group analyses that allow for relatively small subgroups of unequal sample sizes, or limit our approach to descriptive analyses [205]. We will purposefully recruit participants from sub-groups for our qualitative analyses, which we expect will uncover critical novel data on inequities and point to important future work.
