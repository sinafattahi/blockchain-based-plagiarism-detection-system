The objective of this work is to describe the trends in antimicrobial resistance profiles of E. coli strains isolated from various clinical specimens at the main hospital in Dakar over a ten-year period.

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study over 10 years 2012–2021] of allE. coliisolated at the HPD laboratory. Data were collected from the INLOG laboratory information system.

The descriptive analysis of the data obtained was done with the software Excel (version 16.78.3, 23102801) and R (4.3.3).

Of 23,311 bacterial species isolated, 7,797E. coli(33.4%) were identified. The median age of patients was 52 (23–69), 1D; 100 years old] with a slight male predominance, sex ratio at 1.1.

The resistance rates ofE. colito antibiotics were generally high: 85% with ampicillin, 46% with amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, 27% with cephalosporins of 3rd generation and 43% with pefloxacin.

Between 2012 and 2021, a significant increase inE. coliresistance was observed (p< 0.005) for most antibiotics, except gentamicin, tobramycin, and cotrimoxazole, which showed a decreasing trend. Resistance rates increased from 28 to 41% for 3rd generation cephalosporins, 38 to 65% for amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and 51 to 56% for quinolones.

Multidrug-resistant bacteria accounted for 28.47% (n= 2220) with a predominance of extended spectrum beta lactamases ESBL 24.34% (n= 1898).

This study highlights a concerning resistance profile ofEscherichia colito commonly used antibiotics, particularly beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. Over time, a marked increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains has also been observed, along with an alarming rise in carbapenem resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen antibiotic stewardship policies, implement regular surveillance of resistance profiles, and reinforce infection prevention and control measures.Keywords:Escherichia coli, bacterial resistance, Dakar.

Escherichia coli(E. coli) is one of the most common pathogens responsible for a wide range of infections, including urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and intra-abdominal infections [1–3]. As a member of the Enterobacteria family,E. coliis also a key indicator organism for monitoring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends [4–6].

Over the past decades, the global rise in antibiotic resistance amongE. colistrains has become a major public health concern, especially in healthcare settings. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and even pan-drug-resistant (PDR) strains, complicating the management of infections and increasing morbidity and mortality rates [7–9].

In low- and middle-income countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa, surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance remain limited. However, available studies have reported alarming resistance rates, particularly to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides—antibiotics frequently used in empirical treatment [10–12].

In this context, understanding the evolution and distribution of resistance patterns is essential for guiding clinical decisions and shaping effective antibiotic stewardship programs. The present study aims to describe the trends in antimicrobial resistance profiles of E. coli strains isolated from various clinical specimens at the main hospital in Dakar over a ten-year period.

We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional and descriptive study with an analytical purpose over a period of ten (10) years from 1 January, 2012 to 31 December, 2021.

It included all reports of the susceptibility tests carried out during the period of our study.

The study included all antibiogram results obtained from isolatedE. colistrains of pathological products received in the laboratory for cytobacteriology.

Duplicates (same bacteria with the same resistance profile isolated in the same patient on the same type of disease product) and other bacterial species isolated were not included in the study.

Data was collected from the laboratory information system (LIS) called Inlog server. The variables taken into account were age, sex, hospital service of patients concerned, year of isolation, nature of the sample and test results for strain sensitivity to tested antibiotics (betalactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, cotrimoxazole…).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar, according to CASFM-EUCAST guidelines [13]. The antibiotic discs and their respective concentrations were as follows: ampicillin (10 µg), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (20/10 µg), cefotaxime (30 µg), ceftazidime (30 µg), cefepime (30 µg), imipenem (10 µg), pefloxacin (5 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), amikacin (30 µg), tobramycin (10 µg), cotrimoxazole (1.25/23.75 µg).

Between 2012 and 2021, a total of 7,797Escherichia colistrains were identified among 23,311 bacterial isolates, corresponding to an isolation frequency of 33.4%. The median age of patients from whomE. coliwas isolated was 52 years (interquartile range: 23–69), with extremes ranging from 1 day to 100 years. The study population showed a slight male predominance, with a sex ratio of 1.1.

Among theE. coliisolates, 34.38% (n= 2,681) originated from outpatients, while 65.62% (n= 5,116) were recovered from hospitalized patients. The hospitalized isolates were distributed across the following departments: medicine (20.41%,n= 1,592), surgery (17.84%,n= 1,391), pediatrics (17.77%,n= 1,386), and emergency-resuscitation (9.6%,n= 747).

Regarding the specimen types,E. coliwas primarily isolated from urine samples (61%,n= 4,755), followed by suppurations (18.3%,n= 1,425), blood cultures (10.2%,n= 797), and gastric samples (8.2%,n= 637) (see Table1).

The resistance rate ofE. colito beta-lactams was 85% (n= 6,603) for both ampicillin and ticarcillin, 46% (n= 3,590) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 42% (n= 3,304) for cephalothin, 27% (n= 2,122) for third-generation cephalosporins (C3G), 24% (n= 1,852) for cefepime, 8% (n= 648) for cefoxitin, and only 1% (n= 49) for imipenem.

With respect to aminoglycosides, resistance rates were 28% (n= 2,170) for gentamicin, 25% (n= 1,928) for tobramycin, and 3% (n= 216) for amikacin.

Regarding quinolones,E. colishowed resistance rates of 57% (n= 4,446) to nalidixic acid and 43% (n= 3,381) to pefloxacin. Additionally, cotrimoxazole was ineffective against 68% of theE. coliisolates.

The full resistance profiles ofE. colito the tested antibiotics are presented in Table2.

This table presents the percentage and absolute number (n) ofE. colistrains resistant to each antibiotic. Antibiotics are grouped by family: beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and others. The highest resistance rates were observed for ampicillin, ticarcillin, and nalidixic acid, while imipenem and amikacin remained the most active agents against the isolates.

Among the resistance phenotypes to beta-lactams, low-level penicillinase producers (PBN) were the most prevalent, accounting for 36.47% (n= 2,844) ofE. coliisolates. These were followed by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers at 24.34% (n= 1,898), high-level penicillinase producers (PHN) at 19.57% (n= 1,526), and wild-type phenotypes (susceptible to all beta-lactams) at 15.17% (n= 1,183). The least frequent phenotypes were depressed cephalosporinase producers (CASED) at 3.69% (n= 288), and probable carbapenemase producers at 0.43% (n= 34).

Figure1presents the distribution of these beta-lactam resistance phenotypes among theE. coliisolates.

Out of allE. coliisolates, 2,220 strains (28.47%) were resistant to at least three different classes of antibiotics, indicating a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR)E. coli. Among these MDR strains, 24.34% (n= 1,898) were ESBL-producingE. coli, 3.69% (n= 288) wereE. coliwith acquired AmpC beta-lactamase (CASED), and 0.44% (n= 34) were carbapenemase-producingE. coli.

Progression of antibiotic resistance inE. coliisolated at HPD from 2012 to 2021.

Table3represents the overall evolution of antibiotic resistance rates in isolatedE. colifrom 2012 to 2021.

Between 2012 and 2021, the resistance ofE. colito beta-lactam antibiotics increased significantly. Resistance rates rose from 85% to 90% for ampicillin (p= 0.006), from 38% to 65% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (p< 0.001), from 28% to 41% for third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime (p< 0.001), from 25% to 36% for cefepime (p< 0.001), and from 0.1% to 3.2% for imipenem (p< 0.001). These trends indicate a significant escalation in beta-lactam resistance over the decade (Figure2).

Similarly, a significant increase inE. coliresistance to quinolones was observed between 2012 and 2021, rising from 56% to 64% for nalidixic acid (p< 0.001) and from 51% to 56% for pefloxacin (p= 0.02). In contrast, the resistance rate to cotrimoxazole showed a slight, non-significant decrease, from 75% in 2012 to 71% in 2021 (p= 0.069) (Figure3).

Regarding aminoglycosides, we observed a statistically significant decrease inE. coliresistance to gentamicin, from 32% in 2012 to 25% in 2021 (p= 0.003), and to tobramycin, from 30% to 25% (p= 0.047). Conversely, resistance to amikacin increased significantly over the same period, from 2.75% to 5.05% (p = 0.031) (Figure4).

Figure5illustrates the evolution of variousE. coliresistance phenotypes between 2012 and 2021. A significant increase was observed in multidrug-resistant phenotypes, including ESBL-producing strains, CASED, carbapenemase-producing strains, and the low-level penicillinase profile (p< 0.001). In contrast, the proportion ofE. colistrains with a wild-type phenotype and low-level penicillinase decreased over the same period.

A total of 7,797E. colistrains were isolated from 23,311 bacterial isolates collected during the study period, representing an isolation frequency of 33.4%.E. colishowed high resistance rates to most of the antibiotics tested, with the exception of imipenem, which remained effective against 95% of the strains. Furthermore, a significant increase inE. coliresistance was observed for nearly all tested antibiotics between 2012 and 2021. The large size of our study population represents a major strength. However, the unavailability of certain antibiotic discs during specific periods limited our ability to assess the evolution ofE. coliresistance to those agents, representing the main limitation of this study.

As a major component of the aerobic commensal flora of the human digestive tract,E. coliis also the most frequent Gram-negative bacillus responsible for both community-acquired and nosocomial infections. This may explain the relatively high isolation frequency observed in our study (33.4%), which is consistent with findings from other studies, such as those by Foka in Cameroon [14] and Fortune in Togo [15], who reported isolation frequencies of 29.5% (n = 444, N = 1,502) and 63.93% (n = 3,778, N = 11,263), respectively.

E. colistrains were predominantly isolated from urine samples (61%). This relatively high frequency has also been reported by several authors, including Oualeguem et al. [16], Longala et al. [17], and Foka et al. [14], who observed urinary isolation rates of 62.4%, 70%, and 57.5%, respectively.

The recurrent isolation ofE. colifrom urine can be attributed to its ability to colonize the urinary tract. This colonization is facilitated by the expression of surface adhesion proteins known as adhesins, particularly fimbriae. Among these, P-fimbriae play a central role in the pathogenesis of uropathogenicE. coli, enabling specific adhesion to uroepithelial cells [18].

Under the selective pressure induced by the irrational use of antibiotics,E. colican acquire plasmids that confer resistance to antibiotics that are normally effective [1]. Accordingly, our study revealed high resistance rates to nearly all antibiotics tested, in line with findings reported in other studies [11,12,19–22].

These elevated resistance levels support the fact that certain molecules—such as aminopenicillins and quinolones—which were once effective againstE. coli, are no longer recommended for empirical treatment, particularly of urinary tract infections [23]. Notably, imipenem has retained its activity against the majority ofE. colistrains isolated in our study. This finding highlights the importance of preserving carbapenems through prudent use, in order to prevent the emergence of resistance mechanisms against this critical class of antibiotics.

With regard to resistance trends, our results revealed a significant increase inE. coliresistance rates to nearly all antibiotics tested over the study period, as demonstrated by the associatedp-values. Exceptions to this trend were gentamicin, tobramycin, and cotrimoxazole, for which resistance rates remained lower or showed a slight decrease. Between 2012 and 2021,E. coliresistance increased from 85% to 90% for ampicillin, 38% to 65% for amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, 28% to 41% for third-generation cephalosporins, 50% to 56% for pefloxacin, and 2.7% to 4.9% for amikacin.

This upward trend is consistent with findings from other regions. In Cameroon, Ebongue et al. [19] reported an increase inE. coliresistance between 2005 and 2012 from 30% to 50% for third-generation cephalosporins, 37% to 49% for aminoglycosides, and 57.1% to 71.2% for quinolones. In Togo, Fortune Djimabi Salah et al. [15] observed similar trends between 2010 and 2017, with resistance rising from 18.6% to 39.26% for third-generation cephalosporins and from 42.3% to 63.23% for quinolones.

In Senegal, a study by Diop-Ndiaye et al. [11] onE. coliisolated from urine also reported a significant increase in resistance to ampicillin, from 71.8% in 2003 to 81.2% in 2013. However, the increase in resistance to third-generation cephalosporins reported in that study (from 8.96% in 2003 to 16.9% in 2013) was lower than the trends observed in our data. In 2014, the Swiss Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance reported thatE. coliresistance to fluoroquinolones had doubled, while resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins had increased fivefold [23].

The rise inE. coliantibiotic resistance rates can largely be attributed to the irrational and widespread use of antibiotics, which exerts selective pressure that promotes the emergence and dissemination of resistant strains.

However, a decrease inE. coliresistance rates was observed for certain antibiotics, such as gentamicin, tobramycin, and cotrimoxazole. This may be attributed to the fact that these antibiotics are less frequently prescribed in the treatment ofE. coliinfections [24]. Over the past decade, several high-risk multidrug-resistant clones, such as ESBL-producingE. coli(ESBL-E. coli), have emerged [3]. In our study, the prevalence of ESBL-producingE. coliwas 24.34%, which is comparable to findings reported in other studies, including those by Akouétévi Gérard Toudji et al. [2] (39.89%) and Kiiru J. et al. [25] (27%). The high prevalence of ESBL-E. coliisolates may be explained by several factors: the irrational use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which promotes the selection of resistant mutants; the commensal nature ofE. coliand its ease of transmission through contact; and, most importantly, the fact that resistance genes—particularly those encoding ESBLs—are often carried on plasmids, which play a central role in the horizontal transfer of resistance among bacterial populations [26].
