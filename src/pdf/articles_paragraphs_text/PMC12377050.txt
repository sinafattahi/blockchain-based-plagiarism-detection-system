This review provides an overview of diverse biosensors, focusing on their principles, components, detection mechanisms, and applications in infectious disease diagnosis. We explore how these biosensors utilize various transduction techniques-such as current modulation, refractive index shifts, and mechanical resonance to convert biorecognition events into measurable signals. The importance of biosensors in detecting infectious diseases such as COVID-19, HIV, Tuberculosis, and Malaria is highlighted, particularly for early detection in resource-limited settings. However, persistent challenges remain in achieving integrated, miniaturized platforms capable of real-time, multianalyte detection. Additionally, the full potential of biosensors is yet to be realized owing to limited clinical translation, scalability issues, and insufficient integration with digital health technologies. This review identifies these critical areas for future innovation and discusses strategies to increase diagnostic accuracy, accessibility, and global health impact.

The ongoing demand for rapid, accurate, accessible diagnostics has significantly increased point-of-care (POC) biosensors.

Considering the growing demand for faster and more accessible diagnostics, this review delves into how recent innovations in POC biosensors are being put into action. Rather than revisiting the technical classifications, we focus on how these tools make a difference from speeding up disease detection to expanding diagnostic reach in resource-limited settings. In addition to their real-world applications, we discuss the practical hurdles these systems still face and where future improvements are headed. The goal is to highlight that biosensors are no longer limited to research labs; they are beginning to have a real impact on real-world healthcare.

An electrochemical biosensor is a device used for detecting specific analytes present in biological samples. They combine a physicochemical transducer and a biological recognition element for detection.5These devices can operate independently without any support from other devices. To measure analytes precisely and sensitively, chemical reactions are converted into electrochemical signals such as current and voltage.6The components of an electrochemical biosensor device include a biological recognition element that acts as a biological receptor/bioreceptor, an electrochemical transducer that acts as a signal transducer/detector element, and a signal processor that acts as a detector circuit/reader device. Biorecognition elements are those elements that act as biological receptors for detecting and binding to specific analytes from a sample. The biorecognition element uses an immobilization technique to attach to the transducer. The performance of a biosensor is highly influenced by the immobilization technique. Common immobilization techniques include physical adsorption, covalent bonding (gold–thiol interactions where thiol-modified aptamers are commonly immobilized on gold electrodes), the immobilization of antibodies covalently on gold surfaces (photochemical immobilization technique), the use of graphene surfaces modified by polymers, the entrapment method, the use of polypyrrole films (electropolymerization),etc.7,8Traditional examples consist of antibodies, enzymes, and whole cells, whereas the latter examples consist of aptamers and peptides, which provide enhanced stability, versatility, and flexibility.3Common examples include glucose oxidase (for glucose), which can be represented by glucose oxidase (GOx): O2+ glucose GOx → H2O2+ gluconic acid; oxidase enzymes (for H2O2), which can be expressed as follows: H2O2+ donor HRP → 2H2O + oxidized donor, lactate oxidase, polyamine oxidase, and urease nanoparticles.4Natural receptors can be unstable, and artificial receptors such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and surface imprinted polymers (SIPs) offer portability and selective binding through covalent, semicovalent and noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions and metal chelation. These novel artificial receptors are synthesized in 3 steps: the assembly of functional monomers and templates, polymerization and template removal.9The electrochemical transducer converts biological interactions into electrical signals.6It works through reference, counter and working electrodes that measure electrochemical changes.1Electrodes are key for electron and bioagent flow,10and modifying their surface improves their sensitivity and selectivity.11Nanomaterials are crucial for sensitivity and specificity. Some examples include gold nanostructures (3D gold nano/microislands (NMIs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)), whose increased active surface area leads to a significant increase in the performance of the biosensor; graphene and carbon nanomaterials (as they have unique physical structures and chemical and electrical properties); carbon nanostructure–polymer composites; carbon nanotubes (used for label-free detection of small molecules); and metal oxide–ZnO nanostructures (used as a surface layer owing to their high isoelectric point and strong binding affinity toward biomolecules).8,12The transducer enables detectionviacurrent, potential or impedance, making the biosensor an affordable, quick POC device.12The signal processor converts raw electrical signals from the transducer into readable data, facilitating analyte quantification and assessing the detection limit and reliability. It can be built within the device rather than as a separate component. The signal is acquired by electrochemical measurement devices such as potentiostatsviaelectrochemical reaction mechanism techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), potentiometry, conductance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).12–15Data processing involves quantificationviacalibration curves, signal normalization, and calculation of key metrics such as the limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, selectivity, repeatability, and stability. The LOD formula is expressed as LOD = 3σ/S(whereσis the standard deviation of the blank signal andSis the sensitivity).13Statistical validation ensures precision and specificity for clinical applications.16Machine learning (ML) enhances data handling, anomaly detection, and sensor performance among interferences for advanced analysis.4Signal amplification techniques support affordable, portable POC devices such as the READ system (rapid electroanalytical device), enabling rapid results outside traditional labs.5,16The three core components—the recognition element, transducer, and processor – work hand-in-hand to capture a biological event, transform it into an electrical signal, and then interpret that signal into meaningful diagnostic information to provide the user (Fig. 1).

Optical biosensors have gained global attention because of their immediate and sensitive detection of biomarkers, resulting in less background interference, especially in healthcare and clinical settings.19,20The performance of these methods is further enhanced by their resistance to electromagnetic interference and low noise levels, which helps ensure accurate results in complex diagnostic environments.21Unlike electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors rely on photonic signal transduction mechanisms, where various interactions between the incident light and the chemically modified sensor surfaces, such as refractive index shifts, absorbance, scattering, and reflectance, are detected directly without the dependence on electronic conductivity.

The fundamental step is surface functionalization of the sensor surfaces. The biorecognition elements, such as antibodies, nucleic acids, or aptamers, are immobilized onto the sensor surfaces by chemically modifying them to ensure the controlled orientation, density, and stability of the biomolecules. For gold-coated surfaces, thiol–gold self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are typically used. These SAMs form through strong Au–S covalent bonds, creating stable and densely packed layers that support the uniform attachment of bioreceptors. Alternatively, glass and silica surfaces usually undergo silanization reactions where alkoxysilanes hydrolyze and condense to form siloxane linkages, allowing covalent functionalization with amine, carboxyl, or epoxy groups. Carbodiimide-mediated 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling is widely used to covalently link carboxylated surfaces to primary amines in proteins or aptamers, resulting in stable amide bond formation.22,23These immobilization strategies critically determine sensor sensitivity and specificity by influencing receptor accessibility and signal transduction efficiency (Fig. 2).

Optical biosensors are able to provide comprehensive information on analyte concentration and binding kinetics. They depend on various optical principles and mechanisms to perform precise quantitative bioassays.23During detection, the incident light interacts with the functionalized surface to produce quantifiable optical changes. For example, in absorption-based optical biosensors, the analyte absorbs specific wavelengths of light, which changes their characteristics. The reduction in transmitted light intensity is measured. It forms the basis of the absorbance-based quantification, described by the Beer–Lambert law. The absorbance (A) was calculatedviathe following formula:whereI0is the intensity of the incident light and whereIis the intensity of the transmitted light. The absorbance correlates with the analyte concentration, and the relationship is given by:A=ε×l×Cwhereεis the molar absorptivity (L mol−1cm−1),lis the optical path length (cm), andCis the analyte concentration (mol L−1).

In more advanced systems such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), analyte binding causes the refractive index to change near a metal surface (typically gold or silver), which in turn shifts the resonance wavelength or angle of propagating surface plasmons. The sensor's sensitivity (S) is defined as:where Δλresis the shift in the resonance wavelength and where Δnis the change in the refractive index caused by analyte binding. This shift is detected as a measurable optical signal without the need for chemical labels.

Optical biosensors stand out for their high sensitivity, specificity, and ability to detect biomarkers in real-time without the use of labels. They have been shown to be flexible and effective in various techniques. However, their cost and technical complexity can be a hurdle, especially for their use outside the laboratory. These systems need to be simpler, straightforward, and user-friendly so that they can significantly increase their value in everyday diagnostic settings.

In the Sauerbrey equation, Δfrepresents the frequency shift in hertz (Hz),f0is the fundamental frequency of the quartz crystal (Hz), Δmdenotes the change in mass on the crystal surface in grams (g), andAis the active surface area of the electrode in square centimeters (cm2). The material properties of the quartz crystal are characterized byμq, the shear modulus of quartz, with a value of approximately 2.947 × 1011g cm−1s−2, andρq, the density of quartz, which is approximately 2.648 g cm−3.41The above equation relies on the detection of frequency changes caused by mass binding on a quartz surface. However, most biosensors function in liquid environments, such as blood, urine, or buffer solutions. In these situations, viscous damping and fluid loading can lead to additional frequency shifts that the Sauerbrey model does not account for. The Kanazawa–Gordon equation addresses this limitation by estimating the frequency shift (Δf) caused by the viscosity and density of the liquid in contact with the crystal.

Piezoelectric biosensors depend on materials that respond to mechanical pressure by generating electrical signals. Scientists obtain these materials from diverse sources, including naturally occurring crystals, engineered polymers, and biologically derived substances. This variety allows them to develop sensors suited to specific healthcare and laboratory diagnostic needs. Piezoelectric biosensors use materials that produce electrical signals when subjected to mechanical stress, a phenomenon referred to as the piezoelectric effect. Typically, quartz crystals are modified with biomolecules that adhere to specific target analytes, changing the surface mass and causing a shift in the crystal's resonant frequency, as outlined by Sauerbrey's equation.41,48In addition to mass detection, these sensors can react to mechanical forces such as bending or pressure. When a piezoelectric material is deformed, it polarizes intrinsic dipoles, creating an electric current and potential. When the force is released, a reverse current takes place. The magnitude of the signal is determined by the applied stress as well as the properties of the material, enabling the high sensitivity of biochemical detection and physiological monitoring (Fig. 4).

However, critical challenges remain, including sensor surface stability in complex biological fluids, difficulties in regenerating crystals, long incubation times, nonspecific adsorption of proteins or other biomolecules, and the loss of surface coatings during washing procedures.49While still a subject of challenge, piezoelectric biosensors allow for rapid, extremely sensitive, and label-free detection and are thus ideally suited for rapid diagnostic applications. However, their susceptibility to physical and environmental stress degradation suggests the necessity of more resilient and reusable sensor configurations. These advancements highlight the effectiveness of piezoelectric biosensors in POC diagnostics, especially for detecting infectious diseases with high sensitivity and specificity. Piezoelectric biosensors are devices that detect interactions between biomolecules by converting changes in mass into frequency or voltage shifts. The core implementations include the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM), Thickness Shear Mode (TSM), and Piezoelectric Quartz Crystal (PQC), which are all based on bulk acoustic wave (BAW) propagation. PQC is frequently used interchangeably with the QCM because of its shared operational principles. In contrast, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors function on the basis of wave propagation along the sensor surface. The various types of piezoelectric biosensors and their key features are summarized inTable 1.

Point-of-care (POC) electrochemical biosensors represent a rapidly developing and promising approach for disease diagnosis, offering the potential for fast, precise, and low-cost testing outside conventional laboratory methods.64In this work, we focus primarily on its applications in diagnosing infectious diseases. Furthermore, their roles in diagnosing different infectious diseases are discussed. InTable 2, we discuss about different subtypes of electrochemical biosensors and there features.

Electrochemical biosensors have shown great efficiency for detecting specific biomarkers in biological samples. These methods can be used for the detection and diagnosis of many diseases. However, more changes and improvements can be made to increase the standard of biosensors and improve their performance with real-life biological samples.

Since traditional diagnostic methods can be slow and occasionally inaccurate, often requiring complex equipment and trained personnel, optical biosensors offer a faster, more sensitive, and user-friendly alternative for detecting infectious diseases, especially in point-of-care settings and for widespread screening during disease outbreaks. InTable 3, we discuss about different subtypes of optical biosensors and there features.

The application of optical biosensors has revealed their ability to detect viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and rapid response. The use of diverse optical techniques allows flexibility. Nonetheless, improving their performance in minimally processed samples is essential for real-world diagnostics.

While optical biosensors are known for their great sensitivity and real-time monitoring ability, piezoelectric biosensors are unique to the table; they can detect mass changes without labels. This makes them a powerful tool for diagnosing infectious diseases. They are fast, accurate, and much more straightforward than traditional methods, which often involve lengthy procedures, complex steps, and high costs. Studies have shown that these biosensors can effectively detect a range of viral and bacterial infections, whether sudden or chronic. InTable 4, we discuss about different subtypes of piezoelectric biosensors and there features.

Piezoelectric biosensors provide a sensitive, rapid, and label-free alternative to RT–PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Devices employing PVDF or 128° YX lithium niobate detect frequency shifts caused by antigen–antibody binding. Kabiret al.(2021) reported a comb-structured cantilever functionalized with spike proteins, enabling real-time signal validation and minimizing false positives.99Another system employing PVDF microcantilevers translated piezoelectric strain into voltage signals, which were analyzed with fast Fourier transform (FFT) and power spectral density (PSD) analysis, achieving high sensitivity in the micro- and nanogram range. Additionally, Kobayashiet al.(2024) developed a mattress-based piezoelectric sensor system that was capable of noninvasive respiratory monitoring in COVID-19 patients.100This system uses a piezoelectric film under the mattress to calculate a 40 minutes frequency distribution of the respiratory rate (M40FD-RR), with a sensitivity of 75% and a negative predictive value of 83%. These advances highlight the versatility of piezoelectric biosensors for both direct virus detection and patient monitoring.

Piezoelectric biosensors have shown effective detection across pathogens, including HBV, TB, and HIV, with rapid, label-free operation. The mass-sensitive mechanisms of these materials are advantageous. However, challenges such as limited durability, regeneration issues, and sensitivity to sample complexity need resolution for broader adoption.

Currently, the procedures used for the diagnosis of any disease or infection are limited. These include slow and tedious methods; expensive treatment, which also requires specialized and automatic instruments; the use of experienced healthcare workers; and extensive preparation for testing samples.105Considerable time and technical support will be required for developing commercial POC biosensors.17For the detection of analytes at low concentrations, achieving high sensitivity is crucial. This requires surface modifications and signal amplification techniques. Similarly, it is very common.12,64While POC devices are designed for rapid output, some current biosensors still have long processing times.64,69Additionally, as the goal of POC biosensors is to provide affordability, some highly sensitive components, such as microfluidic chips, are expensive to produce. For large-scale implementation, affordability and simple production procedures are crucial.2It is challenging to preserve the stability of recognition elements such as aptamers or enzymes, particularly in real-life biological samples or extreme conditions.4,6To advance the commercialization of POC biosensors, overcoming these significant issues with reliable material design and integrative systems is crucial. To assess their practical utility, the main biosensor types were comparedviathe REASSURED criteria.Table 5outlines how electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric platforms meet these standards.

Recent progress in materials science, nanotechnology, and device design has significantly improved point-of-care biosensors, making them more sensitive, faster, and easier to use for detecting infectious diseases. Electrochemical biosensors are central because they are simple, cost-effective, and provide quick results. Nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nanostructures, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) improve sensitivity and reliability.47,105For example, gold/copper oxide nanocubes amplify signals in SARS-CoV-2 immunosensors, achieving low detection limits.65Innovations include enzyme-free sensors with Ni-Co@C nanocages for glucose monitoring,106DNA origami electrochemical interfaces for specific viral detection,107and integration with glucometersviasplit enzyme technology.69There are several issues, even though nanomaterials such as MOFs and nanocages improve the sensitivity of POC biosensors. Although issues such as uniform synthesis and growth continue, flexible Ni-MOF-based electrodes, for example, show stable biosensor performance. MOF or nanocrystal-coated QCM surfaces increase the specificity of piezoelectric sensors, but they also need to be carefully functionalized.43,98Optical biosensors have evolved with smartphone-coupled paper platforms for portable colorimetric analysis,108biomimetic nanopillar sensors for label-free influenza A detection,109and biodegradable lotus root fiber waveguides for fluorescence detection in resource-limited settings.110Topologically integrated photonic circuits provide robust multiplexed biomarker detection.111Compact platforms such as photonic chips and SERS substrates allow multiplexed optical biosensors to detect multiple biomarkers, including proteins, small molecules, and miRNAs, simultaneously offering high sensitivity and real-time analysis, making them appropriate for infectious disease panels in low-resource environments.112Reliable multianalyte detection in dynamic or decentralized environments is made possible by the use of an FFT and AI-based filtering in piezoelectric systems to reduce signal drift under unstable conditions.97All three biosensing platforms have successfully integrated CRISPR/Cas systems. These systems enhance specificity and signal amplification and achieve ultralow (femtomolar) LODs in electrochemical biosensors.101Optical biosensors, which are generally highly sensitive but limited by recent and equipment limitations, use CRISPR/Cas12a combined with quantum dot-linked DNA probes to generate a fluorescence signal upon target recognition.60For accurate and quick HBV detection, piezoelectric biosensors have used CRISPRviapiezoactuated droplet fusion in digital RPA-Cas12a platforms.90Piezoelectric biosensing advances include the use of QCM-D for real-time monitoring of bacterial lysis and assessment of antimicrobial effects without labels.43By increasing signal clarity and recognition accuracy, machine learning (ML) improves biosensor performance; for example, ML aids in optimizing biomolecular interaction patterns for improved selectivity in synthetic polymer-based and molecularly imprinted sensors.64In optical biosensors, dual-core gold-coated PCF-SPR systems use structured fibers and light–plasmon coupling for label-free detection of refractive index changes (1.31–1.40 RI) over 400–900 nm. Machine learning algorithms such as the random forest regressor improve detection clarity, reduce noise, and support real–time analysis. These advances collectively move toward portable, accurate, low-cost diagnostic tools for infectious diseases, especially in resource-limited environments.

Recent breakthroughs in materials science, nanotechnology, and device engineering have greatly advanced POC biosensors, improving sensitivity and user-friendliness and reducing detection time. Electrochemical biosensor advancements include the use of widely used nanomaterials (nanoparticles, nanostructures, and MOFs) to improve signal strength and sensitivity. For targeted detection, enzyme-free sensors and DNA origami-based interfaces are becoming more popular. Commercial glucometer compatibility is made possible by the integration of DNA-binding proteins with split enzyme technology. Optical biosensor advancements include smartphone-coupled paper-based platforms for portable analysis. Label-free detection of viral antigensviareflectance measurements is made possibleviabiomimetic nanopillar-based sensors. Eco-friendly optical waveguides provide biodegradable, affordable options for fluorescence-based pathogen detection. Robust, miniaturized multiplexing platforms are offered by topologically integrated photonic circuits. For high-precision nucleic acid detection, the CRISPR/Cas system is being employed increasingly frequently. Piezoelectric biosensor advancements include the use of QCM-D to assess bacterial lytic activity in real-time, offering a label-free method for evaluating antimicrobial efficacy. The performance, portability, and accessibility of electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric biosensors are all significantly emerging due to technological advancements, especially the use of nanomaterials and their integration with digital devices such as smartphones. POC biosensors show great promise for rapid and affordable infectious disease diagnosis, but challenges remain in enhancing performance, bridging research with clinical applications, and addressing regulatory and design considerations for effective use.
