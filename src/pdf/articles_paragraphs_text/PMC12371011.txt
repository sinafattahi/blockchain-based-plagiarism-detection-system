Evidence on the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping and its association with allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) is lacking, especially in low-resource settings. We addressed these gaps by conducting comprehensive and race/ethnic origin-specific evaluations. We conducted a systematic search from inception to 31 December 2022 using databases (PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv), Google (for Vietnamese articles), and manual searching. We included original studies that investigated the association betweenHLA-B*58:01genotyping and allopurinol-induced SCARs. We excluded studies on: (1) animals; (2) pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics; (3) genetic markers or genetic testing methods; (4) single group; and (5) cost-effectiveness of screening. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. We used random-effects model to report the summary estimates and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in the meta-analysis. We included 13,719 patients from 24 case–control studies. The prevalences ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping (overall 5.8%; 95% CI 2.9% to 11.5%; I2= 98%) varied by races (Asian [7.7%; 95% CI 3.4% to 16.8%; I2= 98%] and White in Eastern/Western Europe [2.3%; 95% CI 1.2% to 4.3%; I2= 86%]) and ethnic origins (East and Central Asia [5.5%; 95% CI 1.5% to 17.8%; I2= 98%] and South and Southeast Asia [12.9%; 95% CI 9.5% to 17.3%; I2= 79%]).HLA-B*58:01genotyping was associated with substantially increasing risk of allopurinol-induced SCARs (odds ratio 117.6; 95% CI 70.3 to 196.8; I2= 45%) regardless of the subgroups. We found a higher prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in some Asian populations compared with the Whites. There is evidence to confirm a strong association between this allele and allopurinol-induced SCARs.

Allopurinol is widely prescribed as a first-line treatment for gout and hyperuricaemia due to its urate-lowering efficacy. However, its use has been associated with the development of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which can pose significant risks of morbidity and mortality1–4. SCARs can present with extensive skin and mucosal involvement (e.g., rash, erythematous or purpuric macules, blistering, epidermal detachment), systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, organ failure), or laboratory abnormalities (e.g., eosinophilia, neutrophilia)5.

TheHLA-B*58:01allele has been identified as a strong genetic risk factor for the development of allopurinol-induced SCARs6. The association between this allele and allopurinol-induced SCARs was reportedly observed in some Western and Asian populations, including Han Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Thai7–16. Mechanistically, allopurinol is metabolised into oxypurinol, its active metabolite. In individuals carrying theHLA-B*58:01allele, oxypurinol can bind non-covalently to the peptide-binding groove of theHLA-B*58:01molecule on antigen-presenting cells. This alters the peptide repertoire or presents a novel complex that is recognised as foreign by CD8+T cells, triggering a cytotoxic T-cell response17,18. These findings have led some countries to recommendHLA-B*58:01screening before initiating allopurinol therapy in populations with a high prevalence of this allele6, which was shown to be cost-effective in some settings19–21.

Despite the growing body of evidence, there remains an inconsistency among findings from different settings and a lack of race/ethnic origin-specific prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping19–23. These issues are likely due to: (1) biases from studies with lower levels of evidence (case–control study-based findings) and (2) new data not being consolidated. This gap could limit theHLA-B*58:01screening and other preventive measures in high-risk populations, especially in low- and middle-income Asian countries.

Given the lack of high-quality evidence in these low-resource settings, we planned to continuously consolidate new data on the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping and its association with allopurinol-induced SCARs. We aimed to provide more precise and race/ethnic origin-specific estimates to better address the genetic variation related to allopurinol-induced SCARs. Our goal was to improve patient safety by identifying other populations at high risk for allopurinol-induced SCARs and providing evidence to implement preventive measures in these groups efficiently.

We used the methods and recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions24, with some adjustments for our exposure of interest. The protocol for this review was registered and stored at the Open Science Framework (OSF) Registries25. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement to report this review26. The PRISMA checklist was presented in eTables 1 and 2 (Supplementary Data).

We included all original studies that investigated the association betweenHLA-B*58:01genotyping and allopurinol-induced SCARs. The following formats were considered for inclusion: full-text publications, preprints, and conference abstracts. We did not set any restrictions for languages of publication, provided that there was an English abstract. We excluded reports that were: (1) studies on animals; (2) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies; (3) studies that investigated genetic markers or genetic testing methods; (4) non-comparative epidemiological studies (e.g., case reports or case series); and (5) cost-effectiveness of screening studies that did not address the association between or prevalences ofHLA-B*58:01and allopurinol-induced SCARs.

We included 2 cohorts: (1) hospital-based adults who were treated with allopurinol and were tested for theHLA-B*58:01genotyping (cohort 1, including SCAR group and tolerant group); and (2) population-based adults who were not treated with allopurinol but were tested for theHLA-B*58:01genotyping (cohort 2, population group). The settings of these cohorts (time and place) were from the individual studies. Where being approved, patients taking oxypurinol—a metabolite of allopurinol that has been made as a medication—were also considered. Unless provided in the demographic information, the races and ethnic origins of the patients were identified based on the study settings. Races and ethnic origins (or ethnicities) were defined using conventional concepts27. We excluded studies that evaluated patients who: (1) received allopurinol for ≤ 2 days; (2) were taking any new medications during the data collection timeframe of the studies; or (3) had a history of SCARs.

We investigated different syndromes of SCARs, including acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens–Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap syndrome (SJS/TEN). Studies reporting severe symptoms of maculopapular eruption/exanthema (MPE) or erythema multiforme major (EMM) were also included. We excluded studies using patient-reported outcomes for SCAR diagnosis or where SCAR diagnosis was not verified by a dermatologist.

Initially, 2 authors (HTP and T-VMH) independently reviewed the results of the systematic searches for inclusion. After screening the abstracts, the 2 reviewing authors classified the studies as “included” or “excluded”. If there was any disagreement after the first round of screening, the 2 reviewing authors re-assessed the full-text version in a discussion. When they could not reach a consensus, 1 other author (M-HT) was consulted for the final decision.

According to our last search, no randomised controlled trials were relevant or eligible for inclusion. Thus, we decided to use the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the risk of bias of the included studies28, which was conducted independently by 2 authors (HTP and MHT). Any discrepancies after the first round of quality assessment were discussed among the 2 initial evaluators and a third author (M-HT) before reaching the final decisions. As all included studies had a case–control design, we assessed the risk of bias based on the following categories: selection (4 items, maximum score of 4), comparability (1 item, maximum score of 2), and exposure (3 items, maximum score of 3). Regarding the NOS, there is currently no established threshold for the total score to distinguish studies with low and high risk of bias28. In this review, using a conventional cut-off29, we proposed that studies with NOS score ≤ 3 implied a high risk of bias. We presented the scores of the NOS for all included studies in eTable 4 (Supplementary Data).

Initially, 2 authors (T-VMH and A-HN) independently conducted data extraction based on the recommendations of Cochrane24. We used a piloted and standardised form to extract the following information, where appropriate: (1) general information (author; title; publication date, format, and language; country); (2) study design (type; setting; date; inclusion/exclusion criteria; comparability of study groups; outcome measurement); (3) patient characteristics (age; sex; race; ethnic origin; number of patients recruited/investigated;HLA-B*58:01genotyping); and (4) outcomes (syndromes of SCARs). Any disagreements, if not being solved in discussions, were determined by a third author (M-HT). If the studies were not reported in English or Vietnamese, we sent the copies to a certified agency for translation. Missing data were obtained either by computing from available information or contacting the primary investigators, where appropriate.

For the measurement of theHLA-B*58:01allele (dichotomous exposure) and SCARs (dichotomous outcomes), we recorded the number of exposed patients, number of events, and total number of patients of the included studies. The pooled prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping was reported with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For the association betweenHLA-B*58:01genotyping and SCARs, we reported the pooled odds ratio (OR) with the 95% CI.

We assessed the heterogeneity among the studies both visually (using forest plots) and statistically (using Chi-squared tests with a significance level of 0.05). The levels of heterogeneity were investigated with the I2statistic, based on the following convention: I2statistic > 75% implying considerable heterogeneity24. We pre-specified subgroup analyses for all measurements to explore the patterns of heterogeneity. In case of high likelihood of heterogeneity, we decided to conduct the meta-analysis, as the pooled results were still more beneficial than individual reports from case–control studies. However, from our perspectives, these findings were considered exploratory only.

We clarified the potential reporting bias visually with the funnel plot and statistically with Egger’s test at a significance level of 0.0530. As assessing the funnel plot was subjective and the low power of Egger’s test cannot reliably rule out reporting bias31, all 5 authors (HTP, T-VMH, M-HT, A-HN, and MHT) independently assessed both of these results to reach a final decision. If the funnel plots revealed asymmetry, we attempted to differentiate reporting bias from other potential sources of asymmetry. In these cases, we used contour-enhanced funnel plots with significance levels of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.132.

We pooled the data in the meta-analysis using random-effects model with the inverse variance approach, as we had expected some degrees of heterogeneity. We conducted all data syntheses and statistical analyses using R software (version 4.2.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We used themetaforpackage for the meta-analysis andforestploterto draw the forest plots of the pooled results33,34.

We estimated the pooled prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in 3 populations: (1) allopurinol-induced SCAR group (from cohort 1); (2) allopurinol-tolerant group (from cohort 1); and (3) population group (from cohort 2). The pooled ORs for the exposure (HLA-B*58:01positive or negative) and outcome of interest (SCARs) were reported for cohort 1. The subgroup analysis was pre-specified after data extraction and was conducted based on the following factors: race (Asian or White) and ethnic origin (Eastern and Western Europe, East and Central Asia, or South and Southeast Asia). For studies reporting multi-racial or multi-ethnic information, we classified them based on the dominant race and ethnic origin. For exploratory purposes, the prevalences ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in 5 Asian ethnicities (Han Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese) were estimated a posteriori. We performed the sensitivity analyses to investigate: (1) the differences between fixed-effect and random-effects models and (2) the pooled results after excluding studies with a high risk of bias (using the conventional cut-off of NOS score ≤ 329).

We searched and identified 528 records from the databases/registers and 44 records from citation searching, websites, and Vietnamese medical journals (Ho Chi Minh City Journal of Medicine [ISSN 1859-1779], Journal of 108-Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy [ISSN 1859-2872], Journal of Clinical Medicine [ISSN 1859-3593], Journal of Medical Research [ISSN 2354-080X], Journal of Medicine and Pharmacy [ISSN 2734-9209], MedPharmRes [eISSN 2615-9139], Vietnam Journal of Preventive Medicine [ISSN 0868-2836], and Vietnam Medical Journal [ISSN 1859-1868]). After screening for eligibility, we included 24 reports (from 24 studies) in this review (Table1). The specific number of records identified, included and excluded, and the reasons for exclusions are presented in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig.1).

AGEP: acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis; DRESS: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms; EMM: erythema multiforme major; IQR: interquartile range; MPE: maculopapular eruption; SCAR: severe cutaneous adverse reaction; SD: standard deviation; SJS: Stevens–Johnson syndrome; SJS/TEN: Stevens–Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap syndrome; and TEN: toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

In the context of SCARs, DRESS can also be referred as drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS), drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), or hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). To ensure consistency, outcomes that were reported as DHS, DIHS, or HSS were classified as DRESS.

All 24 reports were case–control studies. Among these, 5 studies did not have well-defined study bases for population-based control selection10,13,16,35,36, 12 studies inappropriately compared cases with population-based or genomic database controls without prior exposure to allopurinol7,8,10–14,16,25,35–37. No studies used matching to control for potential confounders, while 5 studies used clearly defined multivariable regression modelling to report confounder-adjusted OR9,25,38–40. There were 3 studies on the White population from Europe, 11 studies on Asians from East and Central Asia and 10 studies on Asians from South and Southeast Asia. For Asia-based studies, 6 were conducted in Vietnam, 5 in China/Taiwan, 3 in Japan, 3 in South Korea, and 3 in Thailand. Most studies were conducted at multiple centres.

We included 13,719 observations from 24 studies (937 in SCAR group, 3344 in tolerant group, and 9352 in population group). People in the tolerant group (2 studies with mean/median age of 65 or more) were probably younger than those in the SCAR group (10 studies with mean/median age of 65 or more). Compared with males, females were less likely to experience SCAR or be included as tolerant controls in most studies. The mean/median dose of ≥ 200 mg of allopurinol was reported in most studies (9 out of 14 studies). Demographic information was not adequately reported in the population group.

All studies used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) forHLA-B*58:01genotyping. In particular, there were 3 primary techniques being used to determine theHLA-B*58:01genotype, i.e., sequence-specific primers, sequence-specific oligonucleotide, and sequence-based typing. However, for most studies investigating the population-based control group, genotyping techniques were not clearly reported.

Most studies used RegiSCAR, Roujeau, or Bastuji-Garin criteria to confirm SCAR diagnoses. The most frequently investigated SCAR was SJS/TEN (reported in 18 studies), followed by SJS and DRESS (reported in 15 and 14 studies, respectively). We also recorded 10 studies reporting TEN, 4 studies reporting severe MPE, 2 studies reporting EMM, and 1 study reporting AGEP. Among 937 cases, the prevalences of 5 primary syndromes of SCARs were as follows (in decreasing order): DRESS (36.4%), SJS (29.2%), SJS/TEN (18.4%), TEN (6.9%), and AGEP (0.1%). Besides SJS/TEN, 2 other overlap syndromes were also reported, including AGEP/SJS41and DRESS/SJS/TEN39,41,42.

All 24 studies reported the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in the allopurinol-induced SCAR group7–16,35–48. Among 937 patients with allopurinol-induced SCARs, 837 tested positive forHLA-B*58:01. The pooled prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in this group was 88.5% (95% CI 81.3% to 93.1%; I2= 80%; Fig.2). We also found some discrepancies among different races and ethnic origins. We detected a higher prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in the Asian sub-population (91.1%; 95% CI 85.4% to 94.8%; I2= 73%; Fig.2A) than that in the White from Eastern or Western Europe (60.3%; 95% CI 47.7% to 71.6%; I2= 0%; Fig.2). In Asian settings, 87.7% (95% CI 73.3% to 94.9%; I2= 82%; Fig.2B) of people with allopurinol-induced SCARs in East and Central Asia tested positive forHLA-B*58:01, whereas the estimate for people in South and Southeast Asia was 93.4% (95% CI 90.5% to 95.4%; I2= 0%; Fig.2B). Results of the sensitivity analyses were comparable to that of the primary analysis (eFig. 1–4, Supplementary Data).

Abbreviations: 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; IV, inverse variance; NOS, Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (C, comparability; E, exposure; S, selection; T, total); SCAR, severe cutaneous adverse reaction. The pooled prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01was stratified by race (PanelA) and by ethnic origin (PanelB). We fitted the normal-normal random-effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimator, using logit transformation and inverse logit back-transformation.

We identified 19 studies reporting the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in the allopurinol-tolerant group7–9,11,12,14,15,37–48. Among 3344 allopurinol-tolerant people, 360 tested positive forHLA-B*58:01. The pooled prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in this group was 10.5% (95% CI 8.8% to 12.4%; I2= 53%; Fig.3). There was no significant difference among races and ethnic origins (Fig.3). The sensitivity analyses also showed similar findings (eFig. 5–8, Supplementary Data).

We identified 12 studies reporting the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in the population group7,8,10–14,16,35–37,42. Among 9352 healthy people, 505 tested positive forHLA-B*58:01. The pooled prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in this group was 5.8% (95% CI 2.9% to 11.5%; I2= 98%; Fig.4). There was a high degree of heterogeneity between races (Asian and White; Fig.4A), which could be due to the heterogeneity in East and Central Asia populations (Fig.4B). The prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in South and Southeast Asia (12.9%; 95% CI 9.5% to 17.3%; I2= 79%; Fig.4B) was higher than that in Eastern and Western Europe (2.3%; 95% CI 1.2% to 4.3%; I2= 86%; Fig.4B). We also found similar results in the sensitivity analyses (eFig 10–13, Supplementary Data). For Asian population,HLA-B*58:01genotyping was more frequent in people of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese descent than in the Japanese (eFig. 9, Supplementary Data).

We identified 19 studies investigating the association betweenHLA-B*58:01genotyping and allopurinol-induced SCARs7–9,11,12,14,15,37–48. HavingHLA-B*58:01genotyping was associated with substantially increasing risk of allopurinol-induced SCARs (pooled OR 117.6; 95% CI 70.3 to 196.8; I2= 45%; Fig.5). No subgroup differences were detected (Fig.5). Result of Egger’s test implied asymmetry (p < 0.001), and this was likely due to publication bias (eFig. 18, Supplementary Data). The sensitivity analyses implied similar findings (eFig. 14–17, Supplementary Data).

Abbreviations: 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; IV, inverse variance; NOS, Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (C, comparability; E, exposure; S, selection; T, total); OR: odds ratio. The pooled OR was stratified by race (PanelA) and by ethnic origin (PanelB). We fitted the normal-normal random-effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimator, using logit transformation and inverse logit back-transformation.

We included 24 studies, with a total of 937 individuals with allopurinol-induced SCARs, 3344 allopurinol-tolerant individuals, and 9352 healthy individuals from the populations. The pooled prevalences ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in the allopurinol-induced SCAR group, allopurinol-tolerant group, and population group were 88.5%, 10.5%, and 5.8%, respectively. Compared with the Whites in Eastern and Western Europe, Asian populations had higher prevalences ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping and had a greater risk for allopurinol-induced SCARs. Within the Asian settings,HLA-B*58:01genotyping was more frequently detected in people of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese descent than in the Japanese.

We identified a lack of evidence for the following commonly-reported races and ethnic origins: (1) races: Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic or Latino/a/x, Indigenous, Middle Eastern or North African; (2) ethnic origins: North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia or Middle East, Pacific or Oceania, North America, Central America and Caribbean, and South America. There is also a gap in the prevalence (or risk) of allopurinol-induced SCARs in patients who tested positive forHLA-B*58:01genotyping. Although the results of the EuroSCAR study showed an increasing risk of SCARs in patients receiving ≥ 200 mg of allopurinol per day, our data did not facilitate investigating the association between allopurinol dosage and SCARs1. Our goal is to address these in the updated versions of this review.

Findings from this review can supportHLA-B*58:01screening and other preventive measures in people of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese descent due to the high prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping. However, the decision to implement these policies may highly depend on the feasibility and relevant costs. A lack of alternative pharmacologic options to allopurinol can also mitigate the applicability of evidence from this review, as high-risk populations with hyperuricaemia or gout will either be undertreated or exposed to allopurinol.

We followed a systematic approach to ensure replicability and mitigate biases in the review process24,26. We searched and retrieved the studies from multiple sources with no restrictions on the language of publication. Each study was independently assessed for eligibility and risk of bias by at least 2 authors. Data were extracted using a standardised form. We pre-specified all analyses except for subgroup analysis of ethnicities, as this was not our primary objective. Since we did not have patient-specific data, we had to classify the subgroups using the dominant races and ethnic origins, which may have introduced some levels of bias from studies reporting multi-racial or multi-ethnic data. The threshold for excluding studies with a high risk of bias in the sensitivity analyses was also not widely recognised28. The variability inHLA-B*58:01genotyping techniques might influence the detection of this allele in the original studies. The detection of SCARs can also involve score-based diagnostic criteria with some levels of uncertainty, which might cause misclassification bias.

Although there are published and ongoing reviews ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping and allopurinol-induced SCARs49–51, only a few systematically investigated the epidemiology of this allele worldwide. There has been no meta-analysis to identify the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in different sub-populations. The association betweenHLA-B*58:01genotyping and allopurinol-induced SCARs was consistent with other reviews50,51. However, our findings revealed a stronger magnitude, especially in the Asian populations.

We found a higher prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping in some Asian populations compared with the Whites. There is evidence to confirm a strong association between this allele and allopurinol-induced SCARs. Before initiating allopurinol for hyperuricaemia or gout treatment, people of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese descent should be screened forHLA-B*58:01genotyping. This screening measure should also be applied to other populations with evidence of a high prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping. Further studies should target the under-reported races and ethnic origins to explore the prevalence ofHLA-B*58:01genotyping. The risk of developing allopurinol-induced SCARs in patients who tested positive also needs to be addressed. To facilitate the adoption of screening and other preventive measures, cost-effectiveness analysis should be conducted whenever and wherever possible.
