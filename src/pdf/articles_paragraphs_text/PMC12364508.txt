Cervicalgia is a very prevalent complaint in the general population, and can affect 30 to 50% of the adult population at some point in life.12The main triggers mentioned in the medical literature are repetitive labor, long periods of cervical flexion, increased stress at work, smoking and previous trauma to the neck and shoulders.13In this context, the present research seeks to fill gaps in the current understanding of cervicalgia, promoting the consolidation of scientific knowledge that can guide more effective clinical practices. By analyzing the interconnection between genetic, environmental and behavioral factors, as well as the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches, this research aims to contribute to a more robust arsenal of preventive and interventionist strategies. The social and clinical relevance of this research transcends the academic scope, reinforcing the need for integrative approaches to better understand and treat cervicalgia in contemporary life.

This study comprises a cross-sectional approach, incorporating quantitative and qualitative elements, with the main objective of analyzing the clinical profile of patients with cervicalgia in Pronto Socorro of the Instituto Ortopédico de Goiânia (IOG).

The study covered the period from 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023, which included 435 patients during the analysis. A consultation of the medical records of the patients treated at emergency room of the IOG was conducted.

All patients over the age of 18 years who underwent MRI with CID of cervicalgia in the period from 1 July to 31 December 2023 were selected.

Age, gender, risk factors, in addition to these variables were collected data on personal and family history of neoplasia, time until diagnosis, associated comorbidities such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetesmelittus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary emphysema, tuberculosis, HIV, congestive heart failure, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, atheromatosis, aorta ectasia, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary thromboembolism.

The collection was carried out directly from the hospital system. The evaluation method was through the worksheet in Excel, for qualitative variables were filled 1-yes for present and 2-no for absent, and the numerical variations were adjusted in age in years and time until diagnosis in months. The survey was submitted toPlataforma Brasil, with approval in the ethics committee and with CAAE number - 78434824.4.0000.0035.

As for the biases, the bias of selection was minimized as the patients were all from the same hospital and received the same treatment protocol. The bias of information was also minimized because the collection of information was done in the same way for all individuals, as well as the bias of observation which was mitigated because a protocol was developed for collection through a standardized table and a method pre-established by the team. The bias of memory could not be completely minimized because a large part of the records were listed in anamneses, which patients reported some information.

The inclusion criteria, which include patients over the age of 18 undergoing resonance imaging as a diagnostic method during the determined period, are clearly outlined. In addition, the exclusion criteria detail specific situations, such as patients under the age of 18, incomplete medical records and cases whose frames are out of the scope of the research, so it was possible to find 435 patients eligible for the study out of a total of 1234 medical records in the sector.

It was necessary to treat the chosen variables, so that the variables were grouped for better development and better analysis.

Programs used were Rstudio, Epinfo and Excel. The selection of independent and dependent variables was based on previously established theories and relevant clinical criteria. Statistical tests were performed following the recommended analysis method that was the use of the prevalence ratio with a confidence interval of 95% and a level of significance (p) less than 0.05.

It was used test qui square and from the value ofpselected the statistically significant associations for logistical regression.

For the missing data, the limitations of the study and the non-referenced were noted.

We chose a stratified random sampling, considering the relevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the target population. This approach sought to ensure equitable representation of important subgroups in statistical analysis.

In the study period, 1234 magnetic resonance imaging tests were performed. In relation to the age distribution, the patients were aged between 22 and 84, with average and median in 54 years and fashion in 51 years. Although the mean, median and fashion are with similar values, the amplitude and standard deviation indicate that the data present a slight asymmetry to the right. Based on the Shapiro-Wilk test, p = 0.33 is observed, indicating that the data present a distribution tending to normality.

In the comparative analysis of the average age by sex, it is found that the average age of women (53 years) is slightly lower than the average age of men (55 years). However, the t test shows that this difference is not statistically significant (p value = 0.4879). This means that the observed difference may be due to randomness in the sample, and we cannot conclude with confidence that women have a truly different average age than men in the population that these data represent. Despite these findings, the size of the sample is a limitation to safely state that these differences are not present in the profile of patients with similar characteristics.

In relation to work, it was considered patients who remained sitting more than 6 hours a day without getting up, patients with more than 6 hours standing and patients with exhausting hourly loads. Thus, 78.38% of patients had at least one of these exposures in their history and 21.62% did not have this type of exposure.

Sedentarism was considered a factor of high prevalence, with 94.59% of patients versus 5.41% non-sedentary. As diseases and risk factors were considered diabetes, hypertension, obesity, previous injuries, patients with a history of hernia. After the analysis it was possible to verify that 78.38% of patients had any factor involved and 21.62% did not. The average time to diagnosis of injury was 4.2 months with a standard deviation of 6.1 to more or less.

The need for intervention or clinical support were grouped into need for intervention. 63.96% of patients underwent any of these procedures and 36,04% underwent none.

Medical care was present in the clinical history of 94,59% and 5,41% evolved without the need for medications.

By analyzing all the descriptive variables selected related to the outcome, it was possible to identify that of the 258 patients who presented injury, 39% were female and 61% were male. Analyzing the factors related to the work 93% were presented with exposure and 7% did not undergo any exposure, since when we analyzed the associated factors, the majority, 57%, was exposed. In relation to associated treatment, 46% underwent medication and 18% surgery. According toTable 1, the statistical analysis suggests that physical exposure was significantly associated with the presence of injury (Prevalence Ratio = 3.59; 95% CI: 0.92–14.04; p = 0.03), as well as with prognostic risk factors, which showed a strong association with cases that progressed to injury (Prevalence Ratio = 16.43; 95% CI: 2.32–116.53; p = 0.00001). Such findings reinforce the relevance of occupational assessment and early identification of aggravating factors in the management of cervicalgia.

This study provided a comprehensive and in-depth view of cervicalgia, a prevalent health condition that significantly affects the quality of life of individuals and poses a challenge to health professionals. Through a cross-sectional approach, it was possible to analyze the clinical profile of patients with cervicalgia, considering a variety of variables, including age, gender, risk factors and associated comorbidities.

Cervicalgia is a prevalent and complex health condition, requiring a multidisciplinary approach for its understanding and effective treatment. This research sought to deepen knowledge about the clinical, physiopathological and therapeutic aspects of cervicalgia, highlighting the importance of identifying the risk factors and specific biomarkers associated with this condition. The results revealed a high prevalence rate of factors such as sedentarism and prolonged exposure to work, evidencing the need for preventive and personalized interventions.

However, it is crucial to highlight that the approach of cervicalgia is not limited to pharmacological treatment only, but also includes the promotion of healthy lifestyles, physiotherapeutic interventions and the proper management of related psychological issues. In addition, the research highlights the importance of public education on ergonomics and self-care, aimed at reducing the socioeconomic impact and improving the quality of life of individuals affected by this condition. These findings reinforce the continuing need for integrative studies and approaches to address the challenges associated with cervicalgia and promote more comprehensive and effective cervical health in contemporary life.
