Ocean acidification (OA) is a major threat to the sexual recruitment of reef-building corals. Acclimation mechanisms are critical but poorly understood in reef-building corals to OA during early life stages. Here,Acropora gemmifera, a common Indo-Pacific coral cultured inin situseawater from Luhuitou reef at three levels ofpCO2(pH 8.14, 7.83, 7.54), showed significantly delayed larval metamorphosis and juvenile growth, but adapted to long-term highpCO2. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) emerged as a time- and dose-dependent mode of short-term response (3 days post settlement, d p.s.) and long-term acclimation (40 d p.s.), with more DEGs responding to highpCO2(pH 7.54) than to mediumpCO2(pH 7.83). HighpCO2, a presumed threatening seawater baseline forA. gemmiferajuveniles, activated DNA repair, macroautophagy, microautophagy and mitophagy mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis, recycle cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles, and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and H+, but at the cost of delayed development through cell cycle arrest associated with epigenetic and genetic regulation at 3 d p.s.. However,A.gemmiferajuveniles acclimated to highpCO2by up-regulating cell cycle, transcription, translation, cell proliferation, cell-extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, cell communication, signal transduction, transport, binding, Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis, development and calcification from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s., when energy reallocation and metabolic suppression occurred for high demand but short-term energy limitation in coral cells undergoing flexible symbiosis. All results indicate that acclimation mechanisms of complicated gene expression improve larval and juvenile resilience to OA for coral population recovery and reef restoration.

Coral reefs are among the most productive and diverse marine ecosystems, of which reef-building corals are the foundation species1,2. However, rising partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) has caused ocean acidification (OA), which lowers seawater pH and carbonate saturation levels, severely threatening reef-building corals and reef ecosystems3–5, leading to reef erosion and ecological shifts3,6. The persistence, resilience and recovery of coral populations for reef restoration depends on sexual reproduction and recruitment of reef-building corals7–9. Nevertheless, early life stages of reef-building corals are acutely vulnerable to ongoing and expected OA10,11, which affects larval development and settlement12,13, juvenile growth and survival10,14, resulting in impaired recruitment and population and/or community dynamics5,15.

As early life stages are critical for rebuilding populations, there has been interest in the effects of OA on coral recruitment, coral response and their potential for acclimatization and/or resilience to OA9,16,17. Specifically, the physiological response, cellular processes, and molecular mechanisms by which corals cope with OA will benefit their plasticity18–20. To survive and grow under environmental change, reef-building corals have evolved mechanisms in gene expression20,21, autophagy22,23, epigenetics24,25, metabolism13,14and symbiosis26,27. The effects of OA on early life stages of reef-building corals have been recently documented, but the mechanisms of coral response and/or acclimation to OA involving gene expression are still in their infancy.

Acroporacorals, with simultaneous mass spawning of multicongeneric species and horizontal symbiosis of Symbiodiniaceae, dominate Indo-Pacific reefs28,29. As a common species,A. gemmiferaon Luhuitou reef, northwestern South China Sea, showed tolerance to OA, which negatively affectedA.gemmiferadevelopment, but not survival30and Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis26. Yet mechanisms by whichA.gemmiferacopes with OA are unclear. Therefore, we assume thatA.gemmiferalarvae and juveniles will be affected by acute highpCO2in terms of development and growth, while surviving corals will have the potential to acclimate to long-term highpCO2by regulating gene expression.

To elucidate how reef-building corals respond and/or resist to OA, three levels ofpCO2(350.06 ± 30.67, 818.93 ± 76.09, 1694.92 ± 105.77 μatm) were used to mimic OA in ambient seawater to cultureA.gemmiferalarvae and juveniles. Developmental states and growth were recorded and gene expression were compared between corals in the three treatments at 3 days post-settlement (d p.s.) (short-term) and 40 d p.s. (long-term). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their functional enrichment by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) may reveal regulatory mechanisms of short-term response and long-term acclimation ofA.gemmiferato highpCO2. Cellular and molecular mechanisms that enhance OA tolerance inA.gemmiferaduring early life stages could benefit efforts to recover coral populations for reef restoration through the sexual recruitment of reef-building corals.

Six colonies of gravidA. gemmifera(~ 40 cm diameter) were collected at 3–5 m depth (sampling site interval > 10 m) on Luhuitou reef (18° 12’ N, 109° 28’ E), Sanya Bay, China, and maintained on the reef flat near the Tropical Marine Biological Research Station in Hainan until they spawned naturally on 30 April 2015 (- 2 days around the full moon). The corals were then returned to their original location. Egg-sperm bundles from each of the two colonies were mixed in an aquarium containing 90 L of 0.5 micron filteredin situseawater from ~ 5 m depth on Luhuitou reef for cross-fertilization. Larvae from these aquariums were transferred to the experimentalin situseawater (Fig.1a).

The experimental design.(a) OA treatment of flow-throughin situseawater and experimental system. Ambient seawater at ~ 5 m depth from Luhuitou reef was pumped, sand-filtered and treated with threepCO2levels (350.06, 818.93, 1694.92 μatm) in 2000 L tanks for the culture ofA.gemmiferalarvae and juveniles in every six 90 L aquariums (n = 3 at 3 d p.s. and 40 d p.s.).(b) Morphological characteristics (larva, flattened larvae, new recruits with 12 tentacles and 6 mesenteries, juvenile with synapticular ring 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, juvenile with three corallites), and sampling time ofA. gemmiferaunder highpCO2(pH 7.54) at 2 days of settlement, 3 and 40 d p.s..

The OA experiment was designed and conducted as previously described26,30to mimic currentpCO2levels, levels at the end of this century, and levels twice as high at the end of this century (IPCC 2014). Briefly, sand-filteredin situseawater was equilibrated in three 2000-L tanks with continuous and direct bubbling of pure CO2for three adjusted pH values (8.14 ± 0.03, 7.83 ± 0.04, 7.54 ± 0.03) using high-precision pressure gauges and valves (DC01-01, Dici, China) and a pH controller (pH2010, Weipro, China) (TableS1-1). Seawater from each tank was flowed into 6 aquariums (90 L/aquarium, three replicates at 3 and 40 d p.s., respectively) at a rate of 60 ml per minute for larval rearing (~ 1 larvae per milliliter of seawater) under a light–dark cycle of ~ 250 µmol photons photons per square meter per second, 12 h :12 h (Fig.1a).

Pre-conditioned terracotta tiles grown with biofilm on Luhuitou reef for two weeks were placed in experimental aquariums for four-day-old larvae to settle and then grow for 42 days. To compare the development and growth ofA.gemmiferalarvae and juveniles in three treatment, 50 individuals per aquarium were randomly photographed using a stereomicroscope for 4 weeks when synapticular ring 4 and synapticular ring 5 were observed in all corals under the highpCO2treatment. Morphological characteristics were observed and diameter was measured using ToupView 3.7 software. Coral diameter were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replicate aquariums. To identify the effects ofpCO2and/or time on coral physiology, Tukey’s HSD multiple comparisons in SPSS (v26.0) software were performed as post hoc tests when one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) withp< 0.05 detected significant differences in developmental state and/or diameter.

Additionally, new recruits with 12 tentacles (2 days of settlement) were sampled from the control (pH 8.14) for reference transcriptome sequencing. Corals for 18 gene expression profiles (n = 3 per treatment at pH 8.14, pH 7.83 and pH 7.54, respectively) were collected at 3 d p.s. (corresponding diameter: 1275.66 ± 117.36 μm, 1229.61 ± 125.66 μm, 1166 ± 128.13 μm) and 40 d p.s. (1371.16 ± 72.79 μm, 1311.78 ± 86.64 μm, 1247.13 ± 78.76 μm) (Fig.1b). All primary polyps (~ 80 individuals per sample, three replicates) were removed from the tiles using a sterile scalpel, immediately pooled in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Total RNA was extracted from all samples using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (Implen, CA, USA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) were used to evaluated RNA quantity and quality, respectively. Oligo-dT-attached magnetic beads were used to purify poly-A-containing total mRNA (> 1.00 μg / sample; RNA integrity number, RIN > 4.50), which was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations at elevated temperatures in First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5 ×). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and M-MuL V reverse transcriptase (NEB, USA). The cleaved RNA fragments were used as templates to synthesize double-stranded cDNA, which underwent end repair, a single ‘A’ base addition, and ligation to Illumina adapters. After purification using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA), the products were used together with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, Universal PCR primers, and Index (X) primers (NEB, USA) to amplify the transcriptome cDNA libraries, which were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform (Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen, China).

For the 18 gene expression profiles, the library was prepared using an Illumina Gene Expression Sample Prep Kit and Solexa Sequencing Chip (Illumina, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols, with the primary instrumentation consisting of an Illumina Cluster Station and an Illumina HiSeq 2000 System. After a series of sequencing, image analysis, base calling, raw tag generation and tag counting processes, all raw data in fast format was processed using Trimmomatic (v0.39)31to remove the duplicate, low quality and/or poly-N reads and adapter sequences and to generate the clean reads.

Trinity (v2.8.5)32was used to de novo assemble the clean reads into transcripts, with min_kmer_cov set to 2 by default and all other parameters set to default. Redundant transcripts were identified and removed using TGICL (v2.1) (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tgicl/files/tgicl%20v2.1/). Sequence annotation was then performed using the Blastx33against the NCBI non-redundant (Nr), Swiss-Prot, and Pfam databases (E-value < 1e-5). Transcripts with the best possible match to a known protein were identified as unigenes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/), which mapped toAcroporaspecies34were identified asA.gemmifera. Unigenes were functionally annotated using the Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com/blast2go-pro/download-b2g) and the KEGG database35.

18 gene expression profiles were analyzed based on reported methods36,37. Briefly, clean reads were mapped to the reference transcriptome using SOAP (v2.21) (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/), with mismatches ≤ 1 bp. The read count of each unigene was obtained, corrected and expressed as fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads (FPKM) using bowtie238. To explore the main effects ofpCO2and time, gene expressions (FPKM, false discovery rate < 0.01) ofA.gemmiferalarvae and juveniles regarding organismal and cellular response variables were performed with a general linear model, wherepCO2and days were treated as fixed factors, implemented in the stats of the R package.

DEGs were identified using the DESeq2 (v1.20.0)39with thresholds of absolute log2fold change ≥ 1 andp-value < 0.05. Thep-value was also adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach to control for false discovery rate. DEGs were separately subjected to GO enrichment using the GOseq R package (v1.10.0)40and KEGG enrichment using KOBAS software (v2.0.12)41. Based on down/upregulated DEGs, functional GO or KEGG enrichment was considered statistically significant atp< 0.05.

A.gemmiferalarvae and juveniles gradually progressed through 8 developmental states of flattened larvae, 6 mesenteries, 12 tentacles, synapticular ring 1, synapticular ring 2, synapticular ring 3, synapticular ring 4, synapticular ring 5 until corallites appeared at 40 d p.s. (Fig.1b, TableS1-2). Larvae in the control and mediumpCO2took 2 days to complete settlement and metamorphosis (flattened larvae 4.67% and 6.00% at 1 day, 6 mesenteries 6.67% and 9.33% at 2 days), while those in highpCO2took 3 days (flattened larvae 2.67% at 2 days, 6 mesenteries 8.67% at 3 days). There were 85.33% and 80.00% of new recruits with 12 tentacles in the control and mediumpCO2groups at 2 days, 90.00% in the highpCO2group at 3 days. Juveniles in highpCO2also took longer than those in control and/or mediumpCO2to pass through the developmental states of synapticular ring 1 (2–6 days), synapticular ring 2 (3–13 days) and synapticular ring 3 (4–24 days).A.gemmiferain the control developed to synapticular ring 4 and 5 with stable percentage and diameter at 8 days, while those in medium and highpCO2were at 17 and 26 days (Fig.2a, TablesS1-2, S1-3).

HighpCO2also significantly (p< 0.001) delayed the metamorphosis and polyp growth ofA.gemmifera(Fig.2b and S1, TablesS1-2, S1-3). Although the mean diameter ofA.gemmiferain the highpCO2was significantly lower in the states of flattened larvae (Fig.2b and S1a), 6 mesenteries (Fig.2b and S1b) and 12 tentacles (Fig.2b and S1c) than in the control and/or mediumpCO2, it is similar in synapticular ring 1 (Fig.2b and S1d), after which (synapticular ring 2, 3, 4 and 5) the diameter differed significantly (p< 0.001) in threepCO2levels (Fig.2b). Coral diameter in synapticular ring 2 of each treatment did not increase significantly after 3 days (Fig.S1e). The same was true for synapticular ring 3 at 4, 6, and 8 days in the control, medium and highpCO2groups (Fig.S1f.), synapticular ring 4 at 8, 21 and 21 days , and synapticular ring 5 at 9, 15 and 21 days (Fig.S1g). Combined with percentages of developmental states, the mean diameter at all time points (1–28 days) in the control, medium and highpCO2groups did not significantly increase after 8 (1349.15 ± 78.46 μm), 11 (1287.91 ± 96.57 μm), and 17 (1231.63 ± 97.40 μm) days, respectively (TablesS1-2, S1-3).

The transcriptome with 64,556 assembled transcripts contained 50,097 unigenes (TableS1-4), of which 36,746 unigenes (56.92%) were annotated and assigned to cnidarians (Fig.3a). A total of 19,096 and 8,110 unigenes were annotated in GO terms (TableS1-5) and KEGG pathways (TableS1-6), respectively. The total mapped reads of the 18 gene expression profiles were 42.76%—67.06% of the reference transcriptome (TableS1-7). Gene expression ofA. gemmiferajuveniles in response to OA showed a time-dependent mode, as 10,169 unigenes (20.30%) were significantly related to days, while 67 unigenes (0.13%) were related to OA and days (Fig.3b, TablesS1-8, S1-9).

Compared to the control (pH 8.14), highpCO2(pH 7.54) activated more DEGs (3,293) than mediumpCO2(pH 7.83) (811) at 3 d p.s., whereas the difference decreased at 40 d p.s. (1,716 and 1,074) (Fig.3c, TablesS2-1, S2-2). DEGs of the same treatment were similar in number from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s., with far more DEGs overlapping (1,731) than at 3 d p.s. (36) or 40 d p.s. (28) (Fig.3d, TableS2-2). HighpCO2significantly activated the repair and acclimation mechanisms ofA.gemmiferajuveniles, particularly those related to autophagy, cell cycle, cell proliferation and development, cell adhesion, and epigenetic and genetic regulation. Given the above developmental and growth characteristics, the DEGs, GO and KEGG analyses focused on highpCO2at 3 d p.s., 40 d p.s. and from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (TablesS2-2—S3-2).

For superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) metabolism,A.gemmiferajuveniles up-regulated peroxisomal membrane protein and ROS-scavenging enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and NADH dehydrogenase, at 3 d p.s.. p53 and DNA damage-regulated protein was expressed at 40 d p.s., although ROS-generating enzymes were up-regulated in nitric oxide synthase but down-regulated in D-aspartate oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (Fig.4a, 4e, TableS2-2). Carbonic anhydrase (CA), which catalyzes CO2and H2O to H+and HCO3-for photosynthesis and/or calcification in coral cells, was up-regulated at 3 d p.s. and down-regulated from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (Fig.4a, 4e, TableS2-2), resulting in increased and decreased hydrogen ion transmembrane transport (GO:1,902,600), respectively (TableS3-1). Accordingly, ROS could be produced persistently in Symbiodiniaceae and the nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria of coral cells, where H+would accumulate in the absence of Symbiodiniaceae (Fig.4a).

A.gemmiferajuveniles in response to highpCO2.(a) Dissolved inorganic carbon (CO2, HCO3-, CO32+) uptake, ROS (H2O2, O2∙-) production and/or H+accumulation in coral cells under highpCO2. For calcification (CaCO3), calicoblastic cells concentrate diffused CO2, actively transport (orange hexagon) HCO3-following CO2hydration by carbonic anhydrase (CA), and Ca2+into the extracellular calcifying medium. For photosynthesis, CO2and/or HCO3-is delivered to the coral cell containing the symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae in the oral endoderm. With increasingpCO2in seawater, there is a shift in the carbonate chemical equilibrium, leading to an accumulation of internal H+in the cells in the absence of photosynthesis, ROS production of H2O2and/or O2∙-from mitochondria and/or Symbiodiniaceae in host cells.

(e) Tables from left to right show the up-regulated (red), down-regulated (green), and/or up- and down-regulated (yellow) DEGs (Table S2-2), with expression variation of log2fold change involved in (a), (c) and (d), respectively.

HighpCO2did not induce acidosis and bleaching (Fig.1b) appears to be related to repair and autophagy mechanisms activated inA.gemmiferajuveniles for homeostasis. Coral cells recruited a provisional cell cycle arrest against DNA damage by ROS production and/or H+accumulation in the nucleus, where base-excision repair, mismatch repair, nucleotide-excision repair and double-strand break repair functioned at 3 d p.s. for recovery by up-regulated DNA helicase and repair protein from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (Fig.4b, Tables1, S2-3 and S3-1).

DEGs involved in DNA repair, calcification and coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis ofA.gemmiferajuveniles under highpCO2.

To maintain cellular homeostasis, macroautophagy, mitophagy and microautophagy were activated inA.gemmiferajuveniles to recycle cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles. DEGs associated with autophagy were up-regulated in autophagosome, mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi membrane, and exosome, but down-regulated in endosome, Golgi apparatus, exocytosis and endocytosis at 3 d p.s., and recovered from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s.(TablesS2-3 and S3-1). Notably, autophagosome, fusion, vesicle and mediated transport were up-regulated at 40 d p.s. (Fig.4b, c, TablesS3-1 and S3-2).

Macroautophagy was initiated by inhibition of the target of rapamycin (mTOR) to activate the serine/threonine protein kinase ATG1 and autophagy-related protein 101 (ATG 101) (Fig.4c, e). Up-regulated endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi membrane and associated transport increased pre-autophagosomal structure and autophagosome assembly at 3 d p.s. (TableS3-1). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 4-like (VPS15) was up-regulated from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. to induce nucleation. Cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles were then engulfed by phagophore elongation mediated by the ubiquitin-like-conjugating enzyme ATG10 and the ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme ATG7, which were recruited to the autophagosome membrane for maturation along with the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein LC3/ATG8 (Fig.4c and S2a, TablesS2-2, S2-4 and S3-2). Up-regulated Ras-related protein Rab7 together with LC3/ATG8 facilitated transport and fusion of autophagosome and/or endosome with lysosome and/or vesicle in a SNARE-dependent manner (Fig.S2b, S2c, TablesS2-4 and S3-2) for degradation of cargoes by hydrolase (Fig.4c, TablesS2-3 and S3-1).

Macroautophagy crosstalk with the endosome from endocytosis (Fig.4c, S2e and S2f., TablesS2-4 and S3-2) significantly increased extracellular exosome in exocytosis of either hybrid-vesicle amphisomes by late endosome by Ras-related protein Rab11 down-regulated at 3 d p.s.. Mitophagy, a selective macroautophagy, was recruited to recycle of damaged and depolarized mitochondria via LC3/ATG8 and ATG7 from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (Fig.4c and S2d, TablesS2-2, S3-1 and S3-2).

Microautophagy, the direct uptake of cytosolic material into lysosomes through the lysosomal lumen or vacuole membrane, was inhibited from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. according to the down-regulated lysosome-associated membrane protein 1/2 (LAMP1_2). However, the up-regulated ATG7 mediated piecemeal microautophagy of nucleus at 3 d p.s. (Fig.4c, e, TablesS2-2, S2-3 and S3-1).

Four phases of the cell cycle, Gap 1 (G1), Synthesis (S), Gap 2 (G2) and Mitosis (M), were regulated by specific cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and three major checkpoints (G1/S, G2/M, spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)) inA.gemmiferajuveniles under highpCO2(Fig.4d and S3a, TablesS2-3, S2-4 and S3-1). At 3 d p.s., the interphase G1 was arrested by the down-regulation of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and the up-regulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC), resulting in reduced transcription and a quiescent state during Gap0 (G0). Reduced histone acetylation and increased histone deacetylation delayed cellular contents duplication in Gap1, chromosome duplication (DNA replication factor Cdt1 and cyclin E) in Synthesis, preparation for division (cyclin A) in Gap2 and separation and reorganization (cell division cycle protein 20 (CDC20)) in Mitosis (Fig.4d, e). During the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) was up-regulated at 3 d p.s. but repressed by the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2B from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s., when the down-regulated mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine-protein kinase BUB1 beta activated mitosis and up-regulated cyclin D and DNA replication re-entered the cell cycle from quiescent cells (Fig.4d, TablesS2-3 and S3-1).

At 3 d p.s., transcription, RNA transport (Fig.S3c), protein modification and localization were down-regulated, whereas spliceosome (Fig.S3b), ribosome (Fig.S3d), translation, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.S3e) were significantly up-regulated (TablesS2-3, S2-4, S3-1 and S3-2). GO terms that significantly enriched down-regulated DEGs reflected the reduction of cellular content duplication, including hereditary constitution (nucleoplasm, nucleus, nuclear envelope and speck), cytoskeleton (microtubule, actin, cytoskeleton, cilium, kinesin complex and their binding, organization and assembly), and membrane system (cytoplasm, cytosol, membrane, plasma membrane, cell cortex, vesicle, channel complex, membranes and peroxisome) (TableS3-1). The cell cycle was also arrested by down-regulation of DNA-binding, chromosome, kinetochore, centrosome, centriole, spindle and cell division (midbody and cytokinesis) at 3 d p.s. (Fig.4d) but acclimated at 40 d p.s. (TablesS2-3 and S3-1).

Methyltransferase, demethylase and methylosome protein associated with DNA or histone methylation, methylosome, methyltransferase activity, genetic imprinting, and chromatin silencing, binding, remodeling and organization were activated inA.gemmiferajuveniles at 3 d p.s. by highpCO2but not by mediumpCO2(TablesS2-2,S2-3 and S3-1). Top 10 GO enrichment involved these epigenetic regulations (3 d p.s. pH 7.54 vs 3 d p.s. pH 7.83) (Fig.S4). The cell cycle, in cooperation with epigenetic regulators, orchestrated the cell fate and development as cell differentiation, migration, proliferation, multicellular organismal development, and enzyme activities were significantly down-regulated at 3 d p.s. but up-regulated from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. inA.gemmiferajuveniles (TablesS2-3 and S3-1).

To respond to highpCO2and enhance cell interaction,A.gemmiferajuveniles adopted an up-regulated strategy (significantly down-regulated at 3 d p.s., but up-regulated from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s.) in cell-extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, signal transduction and transport. Cell-extracellular matrix included extracellular region, extracellular space, extracellular matrix, collagen and their binding (TableS3-1). Cell adhesion included cell junction, cell adhesion, focal adhesion, cell–cell adhesion, cell–matrix adhesion, cell-substrate adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules, hemidesmosome and their assembly (TablesS3-1 and S3-2). Signal transduction involved Notch signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathways, small GTPase mediated signal transduction, various receptor signaling pathways and receptor activity (TablesS3-1 and S3-2). Ion homeostasis of calcium, metal, iron, magnesium, zinc and potassium, and ion binding and transport were negatively affected at 3 d p.s., but transport of ions and substances was up-regulated from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s., when coral calcification was delayed by significantly down-regulated skeletal organic matrix protein, secreted acidic protein, acidic skeletal organic matrix protein (Tables1and S3-1).

Phagosome (ko04145) was significantly down-regulated inA.gemmiferajuveniles at 40 d p.s., whereas endocytosis (GO:0006897) and exocytosis (GO:0006887) were up-regulated from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (TablesS3-1 and S3-2). HighpCO2activated DEGs on the cell membrane involved in the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis. Ficolin and pattern recognition receptors such as lectins, toll-like receptor, scavenger receptors, complement were significantly up-regulated at 3 d p.s. or from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (Table1).

Cellular processes and molecular regulation were energy consuming inA.gemmiferajuveniles under highpCO2. ATP was supposed to produce in mitochondria as mitochondrion, mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial matrix, mitochondrial intermembrane space, mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (TableS3-1) and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly up-regulated at 3 d p.s. but down-regulated at 40 d p.s.(FigS3f., TablesS2-4 and S3-2). Metabolism and/or catabolism of carbohydrate, small molecule, lipid, fatty acid, oxidation–reduction, glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid, gluconeogenesis, phospholipid, amino acid and/or protein also used a down-regulated strategy (up-regulated at 3 d p.s. but suppressed from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s.), although the feeding behavior for energy reallocation was opposite (TablesS2-3, S3-1 and S3-2). Metabolic suppression reflected by down-regulated ATP binding, phosphatase binding, phospholipid binding and ATPase activity at 3 d p.s., and metabolic, catabolic, biosynthetic processes and enzyme activities from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. (TableS3-1).

OA negative affectedA.gemmiferalarval metamorphosis, settlement and juvenile growth. This is similar to other reef-building corals10,13. All survivingA.gemmiferacompleted the 8 developmental states, of which flattened larvae with smaller diameter under highpCO2developed to synapticular ring 1, with no significant difference in diameter between the threepCO2treatments. Moreover, there was no significant increase in the diameter of any and/or all developmental states at certain time points. Combined with the similar survivorship30,A. gemmiferaoriginated from Luhuitou reef is resistant and adapted to long-term exposure to highpCO2from larvae to juveniles. Long-living trans-generation coral larvae show the potential for acclimatization and adaptation to OA42.

Reef-building corals are supposed to produce ROS and/or accumulated H+due to OA, leading to cellular and molecular regulation at the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, membrane system, and/or symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae19,43. In addition to repair and autophagy mechanisms to maintain homeostasis,A.gemmiferajuveniles activated peroxisomal membrane protein, scavenging enzymes to remove ROS and/or H+at 3 d p.s.. Given the gradual changes in developmental state from flattened larvae to synapticular ring 4 during 1–5 days exposure to highpCO2, the short-term response of juveniles at 3 d p.s. appears to involve DEGs in both development and activation of cellular mechanisms. Consistently, highpCO2activated far more DEGs than mediumpCO2inA.gemmiferajuveniles with a time-dependent mode, reflecting coral acclimatization to pH fluctuations44and dose dependence45.

Cell cycle control in the face of damage in eukaryotes46,47, including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and autophagy, was significantly regulated inA.gemmiferajuveniles to highpCO2. Cell cycle arrest was regulated by specific genes associated with histone acetylation, which affects transcription48and epigenetics49. In reef-building corals, OA influence DNA and histone methylation and phenotypic plasticity for adaptation9,25.A.gemmiferajuveniles activated epigenetics and DNA repair, driving chromatin remodeling by methyltransferases and maintaining DNA integrity by DNA helicases50,51.

Unlike thermally induced autophagy in reef-building corals22,23,43, macroautophagy, microautophagy and mitophagy were activated under highpCO2but not under control or mediumpCO2inA.gemmiferajuveniles, which differ from adults in inducing apoptosis but not autophagy19. Piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus required the core macroautophagy genes and facilitated nucleus homeostasis in corals. Crosstalk of endosome and/or phagosome with macroautophagy and lysosome contributes to cellular homeostasis52and cargo sorting and release53. This crosstalk inA.gemmiferaat 3 d p.s. appeared to promote the removal of ROS and/or H+according to the up-regulated exosome but down-regulated exocytosis, which combined with the flexible symbiosis for Symbiodiniaceae proliferation26and photosynthesis in juveniles42,54, in contrast to adults with reduced Symbiodiniaceae under OA stress19.

HighpCO2causedA.gemmiferato take longer to complete each developmental state, especially from synapticular ring 2 and 3 up to synapticular ring 4 and 5. Cell cycle arrest delayed cellular content duplication, chromosome, spindle and cell division inA.gemmiferajuveniles under highpCO2at 3 d p.s., as well as cytoskeleton and calcification like other corals19,20. However,A.gemmiferajuveniles acclimated to long-term highpCO2from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. by improving cell-extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, cell communication and signal transduction, the bases for metazoan multicellularity and tissue development55–57, and up-regulating DNA replication, cell cycle, cell development and proliferation, and transport, similar to other corals18–20. The down-regulation of metal ion binding, especially calcium ion imbalance in corals under OA19, skeletal organic matrix protein, acidic skeletal organic matrix protein and galaxin20are dedicated to the delayed calcification ofA.gemmiferajuveniles30.

Besides epigenetic regulation and gene expression, metabolism and energy reallocation also facilitate acclimation to OA stress in corals9,20. At 3 d p.s.,A.gemmiferajuveniles without symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae required massive energy to survive under highpCO2from oxidative phosphorylation in mitocondria, metabolic process of carbohydrate, lipid or fatty acid, amino acid or protein and glycerol ether, and autophagy recycling of cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles. Therefore, metabolic suppression occurred from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s. when additional nutrients could be obtained from symbiotic cyanobacteria and/or Symbiodiniaceae26and/or heterotrophy58,59. High demand but short-term energy limitation also acclimated by the impaired development and calcification30.

In conclusion, different levels ofpCO2activated DEGs inA.gemmiferajuveniles in a time- and dose-dependent manner. HighpCO2appeared to be a threatening seawater baseline forA.gemmiferajuveniles to activate DNA repair and autophagy mechanisms for cellular homeostasis, ROS and H+scavenging, but at the cost of delayed development through cell cycle arrest associated with epigenetic and genetic regulation. However,A.gemmiferajuveniles acclimated to long-term highpCO2by up-regulating cell cycle, transcription, translation, cell proliferation, cell-extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, cell communication, signal transduction, transport, binding, symbiosis, development and calcification from 3 d p.s. to 40 d p.s., when energy reallocation and metabolic suppression occurred for high demand but short-term energy limitation. All results elucidate the complex acclimation mechanisms of reef-building corals that are resilient to highpCO2during early life stages.
