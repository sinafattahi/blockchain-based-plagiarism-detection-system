To evaluate the impact of β-blockers on 28-day and 180-day mortality in ICU patients with malignancies and to assess their effects on tumor-related biomarkers.

This study utilized data from the MIMIC-IV database. A doubly robust estimation approach combining propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was employed to compare mortality outcomes between patients who received β-blockers and those who did not.

β-blocker use was significantly associated with reduced 28-day (adjusted OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48–0.78,p< 0.001) and 180-day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59–0.84,p< 0.001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. Among the tumor-related biomarkers analyzed, no significant changes were observed in CEA, AFP, CA-125, LDH, or WBC levels, while CRP levels showed a significant decrease.

β-blockers are associated with a significant reduction in both short-term and long-term mortality in ICU patients with malignancies. However, they appear to have limited effects on tumor-specific biomarkers, with the exception of a potential anti-inflammatory effect reflected by reduced CRP levels.

With escalating global focus on malignant tumors, the depth of research into their prevention, treatment, and pathophysiological underpinnings has expanded, addressing the complex etiology driven by genetic mutations, environmental exposures, and metabolic dysregulation [1,2]. Malignancies are characterized by diverse pathogenic mechanisms including genetic changes, disruptions in signaling pathways, alterations in the tumor microenvironment, and immune evasion, contributing to their profound biological heterogeneity [1,3]. Concurrent cardiovascular diseases are frequently observed alongside cancer, exacerbated by shared risk factors such as aging, smoking, and obesity, and further complicated by interactions involving sympathetic nervous activation, chronic inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and the toxic impacts of oncological therapies [4,5]. However, an exclusive focus on singular mechanistic pathways does not adequately capture the full spectrum of health challenges faced by patients with coexisting cardiovascular and malignant conditions. Given the high comorbidity rate between cancer and cardiovascular disease, this study aims to investigate the clinical value of beta-blockers in this complex patient population.

An examination of the MIMIC-IV-3.0 database shows that among 18,987 cancer patients, 13,461 suffered from comorbid conditions such as heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and cardiogenic shock, indicating a prevalence of 70.10%. While advances in cancer therapies like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy have extended patient survival, they have also significantly heightened the risk of cardiovascular toxicity, leading to complications including heart failure, arrhythmias, hypertension, and coronary artery disease [6]. This dual burden of disease elevates both short-term and long-term mortality risks, presenting a pivotal challenge in the realm of intensive care and clinical management. Beta-blockers, as essential agents in cardiovascular disease management, alleviate acute cardiovascular stress responses by inhibiting β-adrenergic receptors, thus enhancing myocardial oxygen consumption, heart rate control, and blood pressure stabilization, and providing critical support for cardiovascular protection in critically ill patients [7,8]. Evidence from laboratory and preclinical models also suggests that beta-blockers may modulate tumor progression by reducing sympathetic overactivity, diminishing inflammatory responses, inhibiting angiogenesis, and curbing cancer cell metastasis [9–11]. Yet, most existing studies have been either short-term or narrowly focused on specific mechanisms, with comprehensive investigations of beta-blockers’ systemic effects in clinical settings of concurrent cancer and cardiovascular disease remaining scarce. In the ICU, metoprolol (IV for heart rate control), esmolol (for rapid dose adjustments), and propranolol (for long-term management) are used, with dosing tailored to patient needs [12]. Moreover, the heterogeneity among cancer patients, the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, and the diversity of therapeutic interventions add layers of complexity to research and interpretation of outcomes. This study employs the 28-day endpoint to reflect acute ICU outcomes and the 180-day endpoint to indicate sub-chronic survival status. By utilizing data from the MIMIC-IV-3.0 database, it systematically evaluates the impact of beta-blockers on the short-term (28-day) and long-term (180-day) mortality rates of patients in this specific cohort, thereby eliminating the one-sidedness of results caused by arbitrary time-point selection [13]. It also explores the influence of beta - blockers on oncological biomarkers such as CEA, AFP, and CA − 125. Additionally, it aims to leverage large - scale Intensive Care Unit (ICU) datasets to provide robust data support for an in - depth exploration of the application value of beta - blockers in the treatment of critically ill patients with cancer complicated by cardiovascular diseases [14]. Through an intensive care lens merged with big data analytics, this investigation highlights the pivotal role of beta-blockers in cardiovascular safeguarding for cancer patients and evaluates their potential effects on tumor dynamics through biomarker analysis, thus providing essential perspectives for refining multidisciplinary therapeutic strategies. This research paradigm, blending cardiovascular care with oncological treatment, exemplifies the utility of precision medicine in addressing the needs of complex patient groups, establishing a robust foundation for personalized care in high-risk populations [15,16].

Data Source Data for this investigation were sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV-3.0) database, encompassing comprehensive clinical records of ICU patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center spanning 2008 to 2019. Identifiable information was removed from these records, obviating the need for informed consent. Researcher B.C. was authorized to extract data under the approval granted by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), certificate number 62,134,410.

Data Extraction and Selection This analysis focused on the impact of beta-blockers on the mortality of patients diagnosed with both malignant tumors and cardiac diseases admitted to the ICU. Patients were identified through ICD codes and divided into two cohorts: those treated with beta-blockers (BB group) and those untreated (NonBB group). The MIMIC-IV-3.0 database restricts its inclusion to patients aged 18 years and older, admitted for the first time(Fig.1). Data collected included: (1) demographic and admission details—age, gender, weight, severity at admission assessed by APACHE III, SAPS, LODS, and SOFA scores; (2) interventions such as Diltiazem, Heparin, Norepinephrine, and Amiodarone; (3) comorbidities like HF, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, stroke, renal failure, COPD; (4) initial vital signs including mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and temperature; (6) laboratory findings—pH, PCO2, HCO3, electrolytes (K, Na, Ca, Cl), BUN, BNP, troponin, and CK levels. For analyses related to cancer biomarkers such as CEA, AFP, CA-125, LDH, CRP, and WBC, patients were grouped based on beta-blocker administration.

Primary and Secondary Outcomes The primary endpoints were mortality rates at 28 and 180 days after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes assessed the impact of beta-blocker therapy on biomarkers including CEA, AFP, CA-125, LDH, CRP, and WBC during ICU stay.

Statistical Analysis We employed a doubly robust estimation method to examine the relationships between beta-blocker usage and both primary and secondary outcomes, integrating multiple regression with a propensity score model to estimate exposure-outcome relationships and causality. Propensity scores for beta-blocker exposure were calculated using a gradient boosting model (GBM), which aimed to minimize covariate imbalance between the BB and NonBB groups by incrementally developing base learners based on the negative gradient of a specified loss function, utilizing regression trees involving 35 covariates. Following this, inverse probability weighting (IPTW) was used, applying these scores as weights to form a weighted cohort analyzed through logistic regression to further adjust for any remaining imbalances in the propensity score model. The propensity score model’s effectiveness at balancing covariates was evaluated by comparing standardized mean differences (SMD) across the original and weighted cohorts. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and categorical variables with chi-square tests. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of results and to examine the influence of various inferential models on the outcomes, including propensity score matching, multivariable logistic regression, IPW, and a doubly robust model adjusting all covariates. In the beta-blocker biomarker intervention analysis, propensity score matching (PSM) assessed differences between the BB and NonBB groups, with continuous variables first log-transformed and matched 1:1 using the nearest neighbor method via the MatchIt package. Post-matching, group baseline characteristics were compared using t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous data, and chi-square tests for categorical data. Normality checks were performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, dictating the choice of statistical methods. All analyses were executed in R version 4.4.1, considering p-values < 0.05 as statistically significant.

From an initial review of 94,458 adult inpatient records in the MIMIC-IV-3.0 database, our study identified 18,987 cases of malignant tumors. Within this subset, 13,461 individuals also presented with cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and cardiogenic shock. Our analysis focused on the first ICU admissions, incorporating 8,798 patients. Following propensity score matching, the groups treated with beta-blockers (BB) and those not treated with beta-blockers (NonBB) each included 1,475 patients (Fig.1). The demographic and clinical characteristics of these cohorts are detailed in Table1. Our analysis of mortality revealed that patients receiving beta-blockers initially presented with significantly higher severity scores at admission. Post-matching, the distributions of covariates between the groups were well balanced.

A Doubly Robust Analysis In this analysis, a propensity score model was developed using a gradient boosting model (GBM) that included 35 covariates. The contribution of each covariate to the propensity scores is delineated in Fig.2. Key variables influencing the decision to administer beta-blockers included the use of Diltiazem, Amiodarone, PCO2 levels, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and Heparin. Using the estimated propensity scores, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to mitigate differences between the beta-blocker (BB) group and the non-beta-blocker (NonBB) group. Post-weighting, most covariates achieved a state of equivalence or “balance” across the two groups, as demonstrated in Fig.2. A regression model was subsequently formulated within the doubly robust estimation framework to further adjust for any residual imbalances observed in the weighted cohort. Figure3illustrates the effectiveness of matching and weighting methods in balancing covariates. The changes in SMD indicate that both matching and IPTW methods reduce the differences between groups, allowing subsequent analyses to more accurately reflect the treatment effect without being affected by confounding covariates.

Doubly robust analysis indicated that the group treated with beta-blockers (BB group) experienced a significant reduction in 28-day mortality compared to the group not treated with beta-blockers (NonBB group), with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.62–0.94,p< 0.05). This beneficial effect extended to a significant reduction in 180-day mortality as well. Sensitivity analyses, detailed in Tables2and3, uniformly showed that patients treated with beta-blockers exhibited substantially lower 28-day mortality rates across all five applied estimation models. These consistent findings affirm the efficacy of beta-blockers in reducing short-term mortality in this patient population.

Normality assessments indicated that the biomarkers CEA, AFP, CA-125, LDH, CRP, and WBC did not follow a normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant differences between the beta-blocker (BB) group and the non-beta-blocker (NonBB) group across the entire cohort, nor within subgroups of patients with increasing or decreasing levels of CEA, AFP, CA-125, LDH, and WBC. However, CRP levels were significantly lower in the BB group compared to the NonBB group across the overall population (Table4).

Beta-blockers are crucial for cardiovascular disease management by inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors, which decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, heart rate, and blood pressure, providing critical cardiovascular protection for patients under acute stress [7]. In hypertensive crises, they quickly control blood pressure by reducing cardiac output and renin secretion, especially beneficial for patients with concurrent conditions like angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias [17]. In acute coronary syndrome, they lower heart rate and relieve myocardial ischemia, reducing the likelihood of recurrent myocardial infarction and enhancing both short and long-term outcomes [18]. For severe chronic heart failure patients, beta-blockers can slow or partially reverse ventricular remodeling, improving cardiac function and prognosis [19]. They are also effective in acute arrhythmia management by reducing the pacing rates of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes [20]. The interest in beta-blockers within intensive care settings is growing, particularly for their individualized use in complex cases like aortic dissection and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where they reduce sympathetic load and stabilize hemodynamics. However, their application in critically ill patients—often compounded by hypotension, bradycardia, and other complications—requires careful dose adjustments and close monitoring [21]. Given today’s high cancer incidence, cancer significantly escalates cardiovascular disease risk via chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, metabolic disruptions, and sympathetic overactivity [22,23]. These conditions exacerbate endothelial damage and atherosclerosis; pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 promote adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells, facilitating leukocyte adherence and migration that initiates and perpetuates atherosclerosis [24]. The resulting inflammatory damage induces a hypercoagulable state, with endothelial cells releasing tissue factors that trigger a coagulation cascade, elevating thrombin production and platelet activation, which further degrades cardiovascular function [24,25]. Moreover, cancer and cardiovascular disease are linked through the tumor’s hypoxic environment and systemic stress responses that disrupt vascular homeostasis. These connections provide a scientific basis for developing integrated treatment strategies for cancer and cardiovascular conditions [26]. Cancer therapies—chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiation—can directly or indirectly damage the cardiovascular system through toxicity and treatment reactions [5,27]. For instance, chemotherapy can cause myocardial fibrosis, targeted therapies may induce hypertension by inhibiting angiogenesis, immunotherapies can trigger immune-mediated myocarditis, and radiation can accelerate atherosclerosis [28–30]. In oncology, the administration of chemotherapy agents such as anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin) and fluoropyrimidines can result in irreversible cardiomyopathies, heart failure, and myocardial fibrosis, consequences often linked to cumulative drug dosages. Similarly, targeted therapies, including anti-angiogenesis agents (e.g., bevacizumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib), are associated with left ventricular dysfunction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1) have been implicated in myocarditis and other immune-mediated cardiac toxicities [29–31]. Moreover, thoracic radiation therapy can lead to pericardial diseases, restrictive cardiomyopathies, accelerated coronary artery diseases, and valvular heart disorders [6]. These adverse effects highlight the imperative for cardiac protective strategies and early detection mechanisms to optimally balance the therapeutic benefits against cardiovascular risks and enhance overall patient prognosis. In this milieu, the utilization of beta-blockers in patients who have both malignant tumors and cardiovascular diseases has garnered considerable interest. The intricate interaction of an overactivated sympathetic nervous system, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress, which not only complicates cardiovascular diseases but also impacts tumor progression and overall patient prognosis, underscores the necessity for large-scale, data-driven, critical care investigations into the efficacy of beta-blockers for cancer patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [32]. Our analysis of the MIMIC-IV-3.0 database indicates that 70.10% of cancer patients also contend with heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and cardiogenic shock. Notably, beta-blockers have been shown to significantly reduce mortality rates in these patients, particularly enhancing survival rates at both 28 and 180 days. This discovery provides substantial evidence-based support for the pharmacological management within ICU settings, suggesting effective strategies for addressing this high-risk cohort. The implementation of beta-blockers not only boosts short-term survival rates but also offers innovative approaches to integrating cancer treatment with cardiovascular care, emphasizing their crucial role in multidisciplinary healthcare teams.

Emerging research suggests an intriguing link between beta-blockers and cancer, proposing that these drugs may influence the incidence, progression, and therapeutic response of malignant diseases. Studies indicate that hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system facilitates tumor angiogenesis, systemic inflammation, and metastasis through beta-adrenergic pathways. By blocking these receptors, beta-blockers may thwart tumor growth and diminish metastatic risk [9,33,34]. Moreover, it was found that carvedilol, an adrenergic receptor blocker used for treating hypertension and heart failure, acts as a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, which can enhance the anticancer therapeutic effect of etoposide, thus providing a theoretical basis for the combined use of carvedilol and etoposide in cancer treatment [35]. However, a cohort study indicates that the potential protective effect of beta-blockers on breast cancer prognosis may be confined to certain specific subtypes [36]. A systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use may be associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) in cancer patients, but no significant effects were observed on overall survival (OS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS). These findings are limited by study design and heterogeneity, highlighting the need for high-quality prospective studies. In terms of CSS, beta blockers demonstrated a significant survival benefit for colorectal cancer patients but had an adverse effect on patients with head and neck cancer and renal cancer [37]. Additionally, these agents could potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, mitigate sympathetic-driven resistance, and elevate treatment sensitivities by modulating the cyclic AMP pathway, suppressing tumor cell proliferation, and reducing the influence of stress hormones on tumor activity [38,39]. Our investigation, leveraging the MIMIC-IV-3.0 database, involved a detailed review of medication records for cancer patients, focusing on those without data gaps, and assessed the impact of beta-blockers on six cancer-associated biomarkers: CEA, AFP, CA-125, LDH, CRP, and WBC. The results show that among patients receiving beta-blocker therapy, only CRP levels were significantly reduced. Beta-blockers may reduce the levels of inflammatory markers in patients with congestive heart failure through their antioxidant effects [40]. This observation is particularly pertinent over extended periods, where the short-term mechanisms identified in controlled settings may not translate into sustained health benefits, highlighting the influence of multiple confounding factors such as patient comorbidities, treatment complexity, and dynamic shifts within the tumor microenvironment. Thus, a comprehensive, nuanced approach is necessary to evaluate the potential benefits of beta-blockers in cancer progression [41].

Furthermore, our data analysis demonstrated that beta-blockers substantially decrease mortality in cancer patients with concurrent cardiovascular conditions, significantly enhancing survival at both 28 and 180 days. This robust evidence supports the integration of beta-blockers into pharmacological regimens in intensive care settings, providing a strategic advantage in managing this high-risk patient cohort. Moreover, the application of beta-blockers not only boosts short-term survival rates but also catalyzes the development of innovative approaches to integrate oncological and cardiovascular care, underscoring their essential role in interdisciplinary team efforts. Despite these promising findings, the study faces inherent limitations due to data constraints within the MIMIC database, including a lack of extensive data on specific cancer types and substantial missing details, which could influence the breadth of analysis and generalizability of the results. These issues underscore the necessity for further research, particularly to explore dosage optimization and intervention effects of beta-blockers across different stages of cancer through advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data analysis.

In summary, while beta-blockers are proven to significantly reduce short-term and mid-term mortality among patients with both cancer and cardiovascular diseases, primarily by enhancing cardiovascular stability and managing acute stress responses, they do not markedly improve key oncological biomarkers such as CEA, AFP, and CA-125. However, beta-blockers do result in a significant reduction in CRP levels, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect. This limitation points to the nuanced role of beta-blockers in cancer therapy, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation of their potential benefits. In the treatment of cancer patients in the ICU, it is essential to pay close attention to cardiovascular diseases, ensure the standardized use of cardiovascular medications, continuously monitor hemodynamic indicators such as blood pressure and heart rate, adjust dosages gradually based on individual responses, and guarantee the safety and efficacy of medication administration. Future research would be best conducted through multicenter prospective studies to explore the synergistic effects of beta-blockers across various cancer types and therapeutic modalities. Additionally, machine learning and genetic algorithms can be integrated to evaluate the tumor microenvironment, thereby solidifying the evidence base for comprehensive and integrated treatment strategies [42].

This study demonstrates that beta-blockers significantly improve survival rates in patients with both cancer and cardiovascular diseases, reducing short-term and mid-term mortality. However, their impact on key cancer progression markers such as CEA, AFP, and CA-125 is limited, indicating minimal effects on tumor dynamics. Notably, beta-blockers were associated with a significant reduction in CRP levels, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect. While beta-blockers are beneficial for cardiovascular management during cancer treatment, their integration into oncology protocols requires careful evaluation due to the complex interplay of tumor biology and patient variability. Future research, focusing on multicenter, prospective studies, is essential to explore the potential synergistic effects of beta-blockers across different cancer types and treatments, aiming to optimize patient outcomes and treatment strategies.
