In recent years, there has been a significant increase in academic interest regarding the sleep quality of university students. Physical exercise has been extensively studied for its association with sleep quality in this population. However, the roles of anxiety and subjective well-being in mediating the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality require further investigation. This study examines the interplay between physical exercise (independent variable), sleep quality (dependent variable), and the chain mediating effects of anxiety (mediator 1) and subjective well-being (mediator 2). A sample of 4,142 university students (1,525 males and 2,617 females; mean age = 19.05 ± 1.16 years) participated in this study. Cross-sectional self-report measures were used to assess physical exercise, anxiety levels, subjective well-being, and sleep quality. SPSS software facilitated descriptive statistics and correlation analyses. Subsequently, the SPSS PROCESS macro was employed to test and construct the chain mediation model described in the background and objective. The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between physical exercise and both sleep quality and subjective well-being, whereas a significant negative correlation was observed between physical exercise and anxiety. Furthermore, anxiety exhibited a negative association with sleep quality and subjective well-being. Importantly, anxiety and subjective well-being were found to sequentially mediate the link between physical exercise and sleep quality. By integrating clinical psychological (anxiety) and positive psychological (subjective well-being) factors, this study provides deeper insights into the mechanisms through which physical exercise influences sleep quality in college students. Encourage college students to engage in regular physical exercise, as this is often linked to anxiety, subjective well-being, and sleep quality, thereby leading to a higher quality of life.

Sleep quality is defined as an individual’s satisfaction with their sleep experience, encompassing aspects such as sleep onset, sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and the restorative capacity upon waking1. It is a critical construct for clinicians and researchers due to the high prevalence of sleep disorders and insomnia, as well as its significant correlation with optimal health and functioning. However, despite its widespread use, “sleep quality” remains a term without a precise definition2. Indeed, sleep quality may vary significantly among individuals. For those who struggle with falling asleep, sleep onset latency may be the strongest determinant of sleep quality1. Chinese college students, transitioning from the high-pressure environment of high school to the relatively free and flexible schedule of university life, may indulge in unhealthy sleep patterns3. A recent cross-sectional survey involving 6,284 college students revealed that over 30% of them experience poor sleep quality4. Poor sleep quality has been linked to depression5–7, academic performance8,9, and cardiovascular diseases10,11, as well as other negative impacts12. Therefore, promoting good sleep quality among college students is an important research topic.

A recent review on determinants of sleep quality among college students identified physical exercise as a significant factor13. Physical exercise is generally defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure14. From the perspective of energy restoration, long-term exercise can regulate the exercise of hypothalamic neurons, enhance energy efficiency, and thereby increase the demand for sleep15. A review of 29 studies with 141,035 college students links regular moderate-to-vigorous exercise to better sleep (r= 0.18)16. In a 1,006-person study, exercise predicted better sleep both directly and indirectly—by boosting mindfulness and cutting rumination17. Additionally, meta-analyses have shown that physical exercise increases total sleep time, delays REM sleep onset by 10 min, increases slow-wave sleep (SWS), and reduces REM sleep by 2–5 min18. Another meta-analysis similarly found that physical exercise has potential benefits for sleep quality by reducing stress hormones, regulating neurotransmitters, and controlling body temperature, thereby significantly decreasing sleep latency, improving sleep efficiency, and enhancing subjective sleep quality19. In younger populations, physical exercise has also been found to significantly predict lower sleep disturbances20,21. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that physical exercise is positively correlated with sleep quality among college students (H1).

Physical exercise may improve sleep quality by alleviating anxiety. Anxiety is characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, and physiological changes such as increased blood pressure22. An umbrella review of 25 studies found that the prevalence of anxiety among college students is as high as 32%23. Physiological evidence suggests that physical exercise regulates the homeostasis of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, thereby reducing overall anxiety levels24,25. Additionally, emotion regulation theory posits that physical exercise decreases anxiety through emotion regulation strategies7,26–28, particularly cognitive reappraisal and attention allocation29. Pooling 24 randomized controlled trials with 1,668 students shows exercise cuts college-student anxiety30. A study of 498 Chinese college students found exercise explained nearly 37% of the variance in anxiety31. The negative correlation between physical exercise and anxiety remains stable in adolescent populations32,33. Anxiety is also significantly related to sleep quality. The stress-buffering model suggests that physical exercise, as a form of stress adaptation training, improves sleep by enhancing resilience against anxiety34. Studies have shown that anxiety is negatively correlated with sleep quality35. A survey of 1,137 Chinese students showed that increased time anxiety forecasts worse sleep36. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that anxiety mediates the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students (H2).

Furthermore, physical exercise may enhance sleep quality by improving subjective well-being. In recent years, psychology and sociology have increasingly focused on the impact of subjective well-being on individuals and its potential mechanisms, particularly in shaping health behaviors. Subjective well-being includes personal perceptions and experiences of positive and negative emotional responses, as well as cognitive evaluations of overall and domain-specific life satisfaction37. According to the positive psychology model, physical exercise, as a positive lifestyle behavior, can increase positive emotions and enhance life satisfaction, thereby improving subjective well-being. Individuals with higher positive emotions and life satisfaction are more likely to relax and reduce negative emotions, which in turn can improve sleep quality38. A study about among 770 Chinese college students found that more exercise equals higher well-being (r= 0.43)39. Another study of 1,158 Chinese college students also found a significant positive correlation between physical exercise and subjective well-being, mediated by social support40. Healthy social ties are a key driver of good sleep in college students13. Healthy social relationships are positively correlated with subjective well-being41. Additionally, a study of 3,349 participants found that subjective well-being is positively correlated with sleep quality among college students42. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that subjective well-being mediates the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students (H3).

College students face numerous sources of anxiety, including psychological, academic, financial, and interpersonal factors43. These sources of anxiety can affect their subjective well-being. Studies have found that social anxiety among college students is negatively correlated with subjective well-being44. According to Self-Discrepancy Theory45the discrepancy between the actual self (self-concept) and the ideal self (representations of hopes, wishes, or aspirations for oneself or from significant others) implies a lack of positive outcomes, which is associated with frustration-related emotions such as disappointment, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. In addition, According to the Broaden-and-Build theory46negative affective states like anxiety constrain cognitive and behavioral resources, thereby limiting an individual’s capacity to experience positive well-being. This directional relationship is further supported by the Stress-Buffering model47which posits that psychological distress (e.g., anxiety) fundamentally impairs the development of positive psychological resources. When considering alternative mediation sequences, reversing the order (physical exercise → well-being → anxiety → sleep quality) proved theoretically inconsistent for a key reasons: it contradicts the established principle that affective disorders often undermine positive psychological functioning48. This sequence aligns with clinical observations where symptom alleviation (e.g., reduced anxiety) precedes positive functioning gains in therapeutic contexts49. As college students enter a more diverse environment, they become aware of broader horizons and perceive gaps between their current and ideal selves, leading to anxiety, reduced subjective well-being, and ultimately poorer sleep quality. The studies mentioned, physical exercise is significantly negatively correlated with anxiety32,33,50and significantly positively correlated with subjective well-being39,40. Moreover, studies have found that subjective well-being plays a significant mediating role between anxiety and smartphone addiction among college students51and recent research has also shown a significant correlation between smartphone addiction and sleep disorders in adolescents20,52. Additionally, subjective well-being is significantly positively correlated with sleep quality53. Therefore, we hypothesize that anxiety and subjective well-being play a chain-mediating role in the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students (H4).

This study focuses on the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students and its underlying mechanisms, offering both theoretical and practical significance. On one hand, college students, transitioning from high school to university, often experience disrupted sleep patterns, with sleep quality issues becoming prominent. Sleep quality is closely linked to mental health and academic performance. While existing research has explored the impact of physical exercise on sleep quality, in-depth studies targeting college students remain limited. According to Self-Determination Theory54individuals have three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When individuals actively engage in physical exercise, it helps promote social connection and support, effectively relieve negative emotions, and enhance self-efficacy, thereby promoting better sleep quality. Therefore, By systematically analyzing the relationships among physical exercise, anxiety, subjective well-being, and sleep quality, this study fills this research gap and provides empirical support for refining relevant theories. On the other hand, the findings of this study can inform strategies for promoting healthy sleep habits among college students, helping them better manage their health, improve academic performance, and enhance overall quality of life, thereby supporting their holistic development. Therefore, this study employs a chain mediation model to explore the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students, incorporating psychological and behavioral variables to enrich the understanding of this relationship and provide a theoretical foundation for improving sleep quality in this population. The proposed hypothesis model is illustrated in Fig.1.

This study employed a convenience sampling method to recruit college students from 7 universities in 6 provinces in China in November 2024. Prior to data collection, the study was approved by the ethics committee of the authors’ institution. An online electronic questionnaire was distributed through class groups, with an informed consent form placed on the first page. Participants were required to read the consent form thoroughly and click “Agree” to proceed with the survey. Only data from participants who completed the entire questionnaire were collected. The first page of the questionnaire explained the study’s purpose, data anonymity, confidentiality, and usage. Participants typically completed the questionnaire within 5 min. During data collection, participants were allowed to withdraw from the survey at any time, regardless of whether they had started or were in the middle of it, and regardless of their reasons for wanting to exit, without any consequences. Additionally, our survey administrators were present on-site to promptly answer any questions raised by participants. Data were screened to exclude responses with extreme completion times or obvious patterned responses. The final sample included 4,142 participants (1,525 males and 2,617 females; 1,892 freshmen, 1,951 sophomores, 279 juniors, and 20 seniors; 1,039 only children and 3,103 non-only children), with an average age of 19.05 years (SD = 1.16).

Given participants’ academic pressures and the instability of online surveys, measures with fewer items were selected to minimize disruption to participants or teachers’ schedules. Simplified measurement tools offer several advantages55,56such as reduced cognitive and time costs for participants, lower response bias, higher satisfaction, and reduced data processing costs.

Physical exercise was assessed using a single item: “Over the past 7 days, how many days did you engage in physical exercise or activities lasting at least 20 minutes that caused you to sweat or breathe heavily?” Responses ranged from 0 to 7 days57. This measure has been widely used in previous studies33,58–61.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item Scale (GAD-2) was used as a self-screening tool in this study62. A 4-point Likert scale was employed, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (almost every day), with scores ranging from 2 to 8. Higher scores indicate higher anxiety levels. This tool has been extensively used in prior research63,64. In this study, the Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.862.

A single-item measure was used to assess subjective well-being65. Participants were asked: “If you were to evaluate your current life comprehensively, to what extent would you rate your overall happiness or unhappiness?” Responses were recorded on a 7-point scale (1 = extremely unhappy; 7 = extremely happy), with higher scores indicating greater subjective well-being.

Sleep quality was evaluated using a single-item measure66. Participants were asked: “Reflect on your overall sleep quality over the past seven days, including sleep duration, ease of falling asleep, frequency of nighttime awakenings (excluding bathroom visits), instances of waking up earlier than intended, and overall refreshment upon waking. How would you rate your sleep quality during the past seven days?” Responses were recorded on a 10-point scale, with higher scores indicating better sleep quality. This measure has been widely used in prior research67–70.

Gender, age, grade level, parental education level and only-child status were controlled as covariates in the mediation model.

Before analysis, a common method bias (CMB) test was conducted. Following Podsakoff et al.’s recommendations71, a threshold of 40% was set to determine significant bias. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 to present means and standard deviations (SD) for the four main variables. The mediation model was tested using the PROCESS 4.0 macro in SPSS. Variables were standardized before mediation analysis. Physical exercise was set as the independent variable, sleep quality as the dependent variable, and anxiety and subjective well-being as mediators. Demographic variables were included as covariates in the chain mediation model (Model 6)72. To assess model fit and estimate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 5,000 bootstrap resampling iterations were performed73. The significance level was set at 0.05.

The results of the common method bias test revealed the presence of four factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. The first factor accounted for 22.92% of the total variance, which is below the threshold of 40%. This indicates that there is no significant risk of common method bias in the current study.

As shown in Table1, physical exercise was significantly negatively correlated with anxiety (r= −0.063,p< 0.001) and significantly positively correlated with subjective well-being (r= 0.063,p< 0.001) and sleep quality (r= 0.096,p< 0.001). Anxiety was significantly negatively correlated with subjective well-being (r= −0.414,p< 0.001) and sleep quality (r= −0.371,p< 0.001). Subjective well-being was significantly positively correlated with sleep quality (r= 0.393,p< 0.001).

After controlling for demographic variables, the results in Table2; Fig.2show that physical exercise was significantly positively correlated with sleep quality among college students (β = 0.096, SE = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.065, 0.127,p< 0.001). When the mediating variables were included, physical exercise remained significantly positively correlated with sleep quality (β = 0.061, SE = 0.014, 95% CI = 0.033, 0.089,p< 0.001). Additionally, physical exercise was significantly negatively correlated with anxiety (β= −0.063, SE = 0.016, 95% CI =−0.094,−0.032,p< 0.001) and significantly positively correlated with subjective well-being (β = 0.043, SE = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.014, 0.071,p< 0.01). Anxiety (β= −0.249, SE = 0.015, 95% CI =−0.219,−0.279,p< 0.001) and subjective well-being (β = 0.285, SE = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.255, 0.315,p< 0.001) were also significantly correlated with sleep quality among college students. Finally, anxiety and subjective well-being (β= −0.410, SE = 0.014, 95% CI =−0.438,−0.383,p< 0.001) played a significant chain-mediating role in the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality. The proportion of predictive pathways is presented in Table3.

This study further explored the psychological and behavioral mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students, revealing potential mediating variables. The findings indicate a significant positive correlation between physical exercise and sleep quality, which, although reduced, remained significant after introducing mediating variables. Additionally, physical exercise was significantly negatively correlated with anxiety and significantly positively correlated with subjective well-being. Anxiety was also significantly negatively correlated with sleep quality. Both anxiety and subjective well-being mediated the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality.

The study found that physical exercise was positively correlated with sleep quality among college students, which is consistent with evidence from multiple international studies and supports our initial hypothesis (H1). For example, meta-analyses in Western contexts and national surveys in European countries have consistently shown that physical exercise enhances sleep duration, improves sleep onset latency, and reduces sleep disturbances74,75. Similarly, research in East Asian region has demonstrated that physical exercise is a protective factor for mental health and sleep quality among young adults76–78. These findings reinforce the potential universality of exercise as a beneficial lifestyle factor in diverse cultural settings. And previous research has shown that physical exercise is associated with reduced anxiety and enhanced subjective well-being, which may contribute to better sleep quality79–81. Furthermore, physical exercise increases metabolism, leading to greater fatigue before sleep82, which facilitates easier sleep onset, such as shortening sleep latency and extending deep sleep duration83. Additionally, physical exercise reduces cortisol levels84, promotes melatonin secretion85, and enhances dopamine and serotonin production86, all of which contribute to improved sleep quality. Numerous observational studies have also identified a negative correlation between physical exercise and poor sleep quality among college students17,87. However, more factors influencing this relationship warrant further exploration.

The study also found that anxiety mediates the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality, supporting our second hypothesis (H2). The mediating role of anxiety in the link between physical exercise and sleep quality has been supported by research across various countries. For instance, in the United States, Puterman et al. found that physical exercise buffers the effect of daily stress on anxiety levels88. Likewise, research conducted in Switzerland and Germany showed that physical exercise reduced anxiety symptoms and improved sleep outcomes in both clinical and non-clinical populations89,90. These findings suggest that the emotional regulation function of exercise may be cross-culturally robust, especially regarding its anxiety-alleviating effects. Previous research indicates that physical exercise fosters better peer relationships91,92, increases social support93, and enhances self-efficacy and confidence94, all of which significantly reduce anxiety levels among college students. Moreover, physical exercise regulates the homeostasis of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis25and reduces stress21,95, further alleviating anxiety. Presumably, As anxiety levels decrease, sleep quality improves. Studies have shown that individuals with anxiety are more prone to sleep disorders96–98. Therefore, maintaining regular physical exercise is associated with lower anxiety levels and higher sleep quality among college students. In addition to being associated with negative emotions, positive emotions can also establish a connection between physical exercise and sleep quality.

The study identified subjective well-being as a mediator in the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality, confirming our third hypothesis (H3). When individuals actively engage in physical exercise, particularly group-based activities, it can enhance social connections, promote social support, and alleviate negative emotions, thereby being associated with higher subjective well-being. Research has found that social-emotional competency plays a significant mediating role between physical exercise and subjective well-being99. Another study also found that stress significantly mediates the relationship between physical exercise and subjective well-being among college students100. Research on the relationship between positive affective states (e.g., joy, happiness, vitality, positive emotions) and sleep quality has found a significant positive correlation101. Studies from diverse regions such as the UK, Australia, and Scandinavian countries have reported that physical exercise enhances subjective well-being through mechanisms such as improved mood, greater vitality, and increased social engagement102. A recent large-scale study in Norway confirmed that students who engaged in moderate to vigorous physical exercise reported significantly higher levels of subjective well-being and lower emotional distress103. These results corroborate our finding that subjective well-being mediates the association between physical exercise and sleep quality.

Furthermore, anxiety and subjective well-being exhibited a chain-mediating effect in the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality, supporting our final hypothesis (H4). The chain-mediating effect observed between anxiety, subjective well-being, and sleep quality aligns with recent international literature. For example, some studies have shown that emotional regulation mechanisms such as decreased anxiety and increased positive affect jointly contribute to better sleep outcomes among young adults engaging in regular physical exercise104,105. These findings support the generalizability of our proposed model across cultural contexts. High levels of anxiety and other negative emotions reduce life satisfaction, leading to a decline in subjective well-being over time106. A study of 2,074 Chinese undergraduates (706 men, 1,368 women; mean age = 19.79 ± 1.39 years) revealed that as anxiety rises, subjective well-being declines107. Based on the results of this study and the aforementioned reviews, physical exercise is significantly negatively correlated with anxiety and stress, and significantly positively correlated with subjective well-being and sleep quality. This study, which is based on psychological variables, explores the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students. In line with the Emotion Regulation theory outlined in the earlier part of this study29, physical exercise acts as a “regulator” of mental health, being significantly negatively correlated with negative emotions and significantly positively correlated with positive emotions108–110. Therefore, combining the above evidence, anxiety and subjective well-being play a significant mediating role in the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students.

In addition, the findings of this study offer several practical and theoretical insights. Theoretically, the research extends the psychological pathways that mediate the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality among college students by integrating variables from both clinical and health psychology (albeit with limited scope), thereby enriching the content covered by emotion-regulation and student-well-being frameworks. Practically, universities should encourage students to engage in diverse physical activities such as fun sports meets, “mind–body challenge” games, and step-count “check-in” initiatives. Moreover, every student can be motivated to act as an “activity leader,” which not only promotes physical exercise but also fosters collaboration and communication among peers. Finally, when designing exercise programs, organizers might incorporate sessions for sharing experiences and discussing psychological feelings. It is believed that these multidimensional activities can help college students discharge negative emotions and improve sleep quality. Nevertheless, since the study was conducted primarily with a sample of Chinese undergraduates, these implications must be interpreted with caution; both theory and practice should be expanded in full consideration of the particular cultural and demographic contexts in question.

Despite its strengths, this study has several limitations. First, as a cross-sectional study relying on self-reported data, it cannot establish causal relationships or objective associations between variables. Future research should employ longitudinal designs and objective measurements to strengthen these relationships, such as third-party observational studies and randomized controlled trials. Second, the use of single-item measures, while cost-effective, limits the ability to explore the specific effects of internal dimensions of variables. Future research should conduct validity tests using well-established multidimensional measurement tools or other objective measures when employing single-item measures, or use multidimensional tools to provide more in-depth insights. Finally, although the study included a large sample, convenience sampling may introduce bias. Future research should adopt stricter sampling methods, such as combining stratified random sampling with simple random sampling, and include more culturally diverse samples to enhance the generalizability of findings.

Regarding the observed effect sizes, while statistically significant (e.g.,β = 0.043; 0.061; −0.063 and R²= 0.006; 0.013), the modest magnitude warrants careful interpretation. This relatively small effect may be partially attributed to the large sample size (N= 4,142), which increases statistical power to detect even minor associations. Nevertheless, it aligns with previous human studies consistently demonstrating a positive relationship between physical exercise and sleep outcomes74–77. The constrained effect size may also reflect limitations in our measurement approach. As will be elaborated in the Limitations section, the single-item tools used for key constructs (physical exercise, subjective well-being, and sleep quality) captured global assessments but lacked multidimensional granularity, potentially attenuating observed relationships. Prior work on adolescents has demonstrated that multi-component tools of physical exercise yield markedly stronger correlations with internet addiction than single-item tools32,33,117,118. From an applied perspective, while individual-level effects appear modest, the population-level public health implications could be substantial given the high prevalence of physical inactivity and sleep problems among college students. Future intervention studies should examine whether clinically meaningful improvements emerge when exercise programs integrate targeted anxiety-reduction and well-being-enhancement components.

This study found that physical exercise is significantly negatively correlated with anxiety and significantly positively correlated with subjective well-being and sleep quality among college students. Additionally, anxiety and subjective well-being mediate the relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality. Schools may consider promoting physical exercise, improve exercise facilities and policies, and suggesting regular participation in physical exercise.
