To assess the impact of China’s medical insurance integration policy on urban-rural disparities in medical insurance benefit levels, explore its heterogeneous effects in regions with different economic development levels and provide empirical evidence for promoting health equity.

Retrospective panel data analysis using a quasi-natural experiment. Causal inference was conducted using propensity score matching-staggered difference in differences (PSM-staggered DID) method with time-varying policy variables.

Provincial-level analysis covering 31 provinces in China, using administrative data from 2006 to 2021.

31 Chinese provinces with complete annual data on medical insurance and economic indicators from 2006 to 2021, yielding 496 province-year observations.

Gradual implementation of the policy of integration of medical insurance (2006–2021), with start-up dates varying from province to province.

The primary outcomes are natural logarithm of per capita medical insurance benefits for all residents, urban residents and rural residents. No secondary outcomes were predefined.

Overall, the policy had a weak positive impact on the per capita benefits of rural residents. Subgroup analyses showed no immediate effect in provinces with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of more than 100 000 yuan, but an increase in benefits for rural residents 1 year after implementation; an immediate increase in rural benefits in provinces with a GDP per capita of 60 000–100 000 yuan; and a reduction in overall and rural benefits at the beginning in provinces with a GDP per capita of <60 000 yuan, followed by a restoration of rural benefits after 2 years. Mechanistically, the policy increased medical insurance coverage rates, but higher coverage was associated with short-term reductions in per capita benefits.

Region-specific strategies need to be developed to provide lessons for developing countries pursuing universal health coverage.

Uses administrative data from the China Health Statistics Yearbook, ensuring standardisation and comparability of data.

Adopts a quasi-natural experimental design with propensity score matching-difference in differences to improve causal inference.

Incorporates subgroup and mediation analyses to explore heterogeneity and pathways, increasing methodological depth.

Relies on provincial-level data, potentially overlooking heterogeneity at the municipal or county level.

Unable to fully control for unmeasured confounders from differences in local insurance programme operations.

The WHO has long emphasised universal health coverage as a core strategy for promoting equitable access to healthcare, urging countries to address the fragmentation of insurance systems to reduce disparities in financing and access to healthcare.1 2Globally, developing countries (eg, Thailand, Mexico) and developed countries (eg, Germany, South Korea) have undertaken insurance integration reforms, which have generally expanded insurance coverage and reduced the financial burden on vulnerable groups.3 4These experiences highlight that integrating insurance schemes is an important tool for promoting health equity, but their effectiveness often depends on the local economic and institutional context.

Against this background, this study aims to address two central questions: (1) Does URRMI programmes reduce urban-rural benefit disparities, and does this gap vary by regional economic development? (2) What are the mechanisms driving these effects? We use provincial panel data (2006–2021) from 31 provinces in China, treating the staggered implementation of URRMI as a quasi-natural experiment. Employing a time-varying difference-in-differences model combined with propensity score matching (PSM-DID), we quantify the impact of the policy on urban and rural medical insurance benefits. We further conduct subgroup analyses by per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and mechanism tests to explore economic heterogeneity and underlying pathways.

By focusing on spatial equity and economic gradients, this study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, this study extends the URRMI research by examining long-term impacts over the period 2006–2021. Second, it fills a gap in the analysis of regional heterogeneity by elucidating how economic development moderates policy impacts. Third, it links findings to the “social determinants of health” framework,30 31emphasising that integration success depends on balancing coverage expansion and resource allocation, a concept that is relevant to developing countries pursuing universal health coverage.

This study is a retrospective panel data analysis, based on the medical insurance integration policy of 31 provinces in China from 2006 to 2021 as a natural experiment, and assesses the impact of the policy on the urban-rural medical insurance utilisation gap through the PSM-DID method.

This study uses provincial-level data from 31 provinces in China, spanning the period 2006–2021, with a total of 496 province-year observations. Participants are defined as these 31 provinces, and the observations come from annual data on medical insurance, demographics and socioeconomic conditions.Online supplemental table A1lists all 31 included provinces.

The data are obtained from the China Health Statistical Yearbook, provincial Health Statistical Yearbooks and annual statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics.32 33All variables are measured through statistical calculation based on the original data from these sources. Demographic statistical data are truncated to the range of 1%–99% to mitigate the influence of extreme outliers, which could bias regression estimates.

Outcome variables focus on measuring integrated insurance system utilisation, including: the level of per capita benefit, calculated by dividing overall reimbursement expenditures by overall enrollees and transformed into a natural logarithm (lnpb); the per capita benefit of urban residents, calculated by dividing reimbursement expenditures of urban enrollees by urban enrollees and transformed into a natural logarithm (lnpbu); and the per capita benefit of rural residents, calculated by dividing reimbursement expenditures of rural enrollees by rural enrollees and transformed into a natural logarithm (lnpbr).

The policy dummy variable (policy_implemented) is set to 1 if the policy was implemented in 2016 or earlier and 0 if it was implemented after 2016.

Covariates are included to control for potential confounding factors and are categorised into three groups based on theoretical relevance and prior literature.5 31Healthcare accessibility indicators include density of institutions, calculated as the number of medical institutions per 10 000 people (institution_density); density of beds, calculated as the number of beds per 1000 people (bed_density); density of technicians, calculated as the number of health technicians per 1000 people (tech_density); and urban-rural ratio of health technician density, calculated as the ratio of urban health technician density to rural health technician density (tech_ratio). Demographic indicators include the proportion of people aged 65 and above (elder), sex ratio with female as 100 (female), proportion of people with a college degree or above (educated) and proportion of the urban population (urban). Economic indicator refers to provincial per capita GDP in 2021 (pgdp).

In the statistical analysis, a staggered difference-in-differences (staggered DID) model was used to assess the impact of the policy on the outcome variables, which is applicable to the implementation of multitemporal policies. The parallel trend test verified the key assumptions of the DID model: regression results for the policy lead/lag term showed no significant difference (p>0.1) between the treatment and control groups before policy implementation, confirming the parallel trend assumption (seefigure 1).

The propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to match the treatment and control groups: the treatment group consisted of provinces that had implemented an insurance integration policy before 2016, and the control group consisted of provinces that had not implemented an insurance integration policy. PSM are implemented using Stata 17.0 and the psmatch2 command using nearest-neighbour matching (1:1 ratio) with a calliper of 0.05 to balance covariates between treatment and control groups. After matching, standardised deviations for all covariates were less than 10% and not significantly different, indicating that baseline characteristics were effectively balanced (see Tables A2 and A3).Figure 2demonstrated that practically all covariates were closer to 0 after matching, indicating the validity of PSM application.Figure 3showed propensity score density plots before and after matching on all nine covariates.

In this framework,β1captures the policy’s immediate effect in the implementation year,β2the lag 1 effect (1 year later) andβ2the lag 2 effect (2 years later).

Robustness tests included a placebo test, subgroup analysis and influencing mechanism analysis. The placebo test assessed the stability of the results by randomly sampling the policy dummy variable 500 times; most of the randomised samples showed significant deviations from the baseline model coefficients, suggesting that the estimates were robust (seeonline supplemental figure A1).

Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore heterogeneous effects, since previous studies have shown that fiscal capacity affects the effectiveness of insurance policies.34Provinces were categorised into three subgroups based on GDP per capita: above 100 000 yuan, between 60 000 and 100 000 yuan, and below 60 000 yuan (RMB 1 ≈ US$0.1485 at 2022 exchange rates).

Influencing mechanism analysis explored the internal pathways of policy impact by examining a mediation framework in which the sustainability of the medical insurance system (as measured by medical insurance coverage,insurance_coverage) served as the mediating variable. Specifically, we tested the hypothesised pathway that policy affected healthcare outcomes by influencing medical insurance coverage. To verify the existence of the mediating effect, the Sobel test and Bootstrap test (5000 replications) were used. The results showed that both tests were statistically significant, indicating that policy partially affects healthcare outcomes through the mediating effect of medical insurance coverage.

Patients or the public WERE NOT involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.

All statistical analyses are performed using Stata 17.0.

Notes: All data were obtained from the China Health Statistics Yearbook, provincial health statistics yearbooks and annual statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics. Outcome variables (lnpb, lnpbu, lnpbr) were constructed by the authors by log-transforming the original reimbursement data to address the right skewness problem. Policy variables, covariates and mechanism variables are either extracted from the statistical materials (eg, pgdp, erder) or calculated by the authors based on original data (eg, tech_ratio, insurance_coverage). One yuan equalled approximately US$0.1485 (2022 exchange rate).

The mean value of density ratio of urban and rural health technicians (tech_ratio) is 1.491 (ratio), with an SD of 0.979, a maximum of 3.516 and a minimum of 0.388. The mean value of people aged 65 and above (elderly) is 10.195 (%), with an SD of 2.589, a maximum value of 17.415 and a minimum value of 5.415. The mean value of sex ratio (female=100) (female) is 104.482 (ratio), with an SD of 3.775, a maximum value of 117.270 and a minimum value of 95.760. The proportion of the population with a college education and above (educated) has a mean of 12.116 (%), with an SD of 0.979, a maximum value of 3.516 and a minimum value of 0.388. The proportion of people with college degree or above (educated) has a mean of 12.116 (%) with an SD of 7.342, a maximum of 44.756 and a minimum of 1.719. The proportion of urban population (urban) has a mean of 55.521 (%) with an SD of 14.346, a maximum of 89.300 and a minimum of 23.800. The per capita GDP (pgdp) has a mean of 4.782 (10 000 yuan per person), an SD of 2.948, a maximum value of 18.390 and a minimum value of 0.580.

For the predictor variables, the coverage rate for medical insurance (insurance_coverage) had a mean of 90.477 (%), an SD of 18.180, a maximum value of 177.342 and a minimum value of 30.445.

Table 2shows the effects of medical insurance integration policy on insurance benefit levels using a time-varying DID model (496 province-year observations, 31 provinces). For overall per capita benefits (lnpb, column 1), the policy variable is not statistically significant. There is no significant effect of policy at 1-year lag and 2-year lag.

Notes: This table uses provincial-level data (496 annual provincial observations, 31 provinces). The policy effects on the outcome variables were estimated using equation (1). Outcome variables are the level of per capita benefit, the level of per capita benefit of urban residents and the level of per capita benefit of rural residents (lnpb, lnpbuandlnpbr). Policy variables include an immediate policy dummy (policy_implemented), a 1-year lagged policy dummy (policy_implemented_lag1) and a 2-year lagged policy dummy (policy_implemented_lag2). Covariates include the density of health technicians (tech_density), the density of medical institutions (institution_density), the density of beds (bed_density), the density ratio of urban and rural health technicians (tech_ratio), the proportion of age 65 and above (elder), ratio of sex (female=100) (female), the proportion of college degree or above (educated), the proportion of the urban population (urban) and per capita GDP (pgdp). 95% CIs in parentheses.

For the benefit per urban resident (lnpbu, column 2), the policy variable (policy_implemented) has a significant negative effect (coefficient=−0.194, 95% CI (−0.376, –0.012), **p<0.05). The negative effect of a 2-year policy lag (policy_implemented_lag2) is marginally significant (coefficient=−0.154, 95% CI (−0.329, 0.021), *p<0.10), while the effect of a 1-year lag is insignificant.

For the per capita benefit of rural residents (lnpbr, column 3), the policy variable (policy_implemented) shows a weak significant positive effect (coefficient = 0.164, 95% CI (−0.010, 0.339), *p<0.10). Neither the 1-year lag nor the 2-year lag of the policy is statistically significant.

Table 3presents the policy effects after propensity score matching (96 province-year observations, 29 provinces). The policy variable is not statistically significant for the overall per capita benefit (lnpb, column 1). The policy variable with a 2-year lag (policy_implemented_lag2) shows a marginally significant negative effect (coefficient=−0.256, 95% CI (−0.513, 0.001), *p<0.10), while the policy variable with a 1-year lag is not significant.

Notes: This table uses provincial-level data after propensity score matching (96 province-year observations, 29 provinces). The policy effects on the outcome variables were estimated using equation (1). All models control for covariates (consistent withtable 2), city fixed effects (City FE) and year fixed effects (Year FE). 95% CIs in parentheses.

For urban per capita benefit (lnpbu, column 2), the policy variable (policy_implemented) has a significant negative effect (coefficient=−0.373, 95% CI (−0.710, –0.036), **p<0.05). The negative effect of a 2-year policy lag (policy_implemented_lag2) is marginally significant (coefficient=−0.339, 95% CI (−0.700, 0.023), *p<0.10), while the negative effect of a 1-year lag is insignificant.

For the benefit per rural resident (lnpbr, column 3), the policy variable is statistically insignificant. The policy variable with a 1-year lag (policy_implemented_lag1) shows a marginally significant positive effect (coefficient=0.421, 95% CI (−0.055, 0.896), *p<0.10), while the policy variable with a 2-year lag is not significant.

Tables A5 and 4 present the results of the mechanistic analyses.Online supplemental table A5analyses the effect of policy on medical insurance coverage (insurance_coverage). The policy effect with a 2-year lag (policy_implemented_lag2) has a significant positive impact oninsurance_coverage(coefficient=9.943, 95% CI (2.064, 17.822), **p<0.05), suggesting that medical insurance coverage increases significantly after 2 years of policy implementation.

Table 4further tests whetherinsurance_coveragemediates the effect of the policy on benefit levels (lnpb,lnpbu,lnpbr). For the 1-year lagged policy effect,policy_implemented_lag1significantly increasesinsurance_coverage(coefficient=12.356, 95% CI (6.901, 17.811), ***p<0.01), suggesting that coverage rises 1 year after the policy is implemented.insurance_coveragehas a significant negative effect on all benefit levels: overall per capita benefit (lnpb: coefficient=−0.011, 95% CI (−0.013, –0.009), ***p<0.01), per capita benefit for urban residents (lnpbu: coefficient = −0.009, 95% CI (−0.011, –0.007), ***p<0.01) and per capita benefit for rural residents (lnpbr: coefficient=−0.011, 95% CI (−0.013, –0.009), ***p<0.01). This suggests that a policy with a 1-year lag increases coverage, which in turn reduces the benefit levels.

Notes: This table displays mediation effects analyses that test whether medical insurance coverage (insurance_coverage) mediates the effect of policy on the outcome variables (lnpb,lnpbu,lnpbr). Columns 1 and 5 show the effect of the policy variables (policy_implemented_lag1,policy_implemented_lag2) oninsurance_coverage(the mediating variable); columns 2–4 and 6–8 show the joint effect of the policy variables andinsurance_coverageon the outcome variables. All models control for covariates (consistent withtable 2), city fixed effects (City FE) and year fixed effects (Year FE). DV = Dependent Variable. 95% CIs in parentheses.

For the policy effect with a 2-year lag,policy_implemented_lag2significantly increasesinsurance_coverage(coefficient=13.730, 95% CI (8.177, 19.283), ***p<0.01), suggesting that there is a sustained positive effect on coverage 2 years after the policy was implemented. And for both urban and rural benefit levels,insurance_coverageremained a significant negative mediator (lnpbu: coefficient=−0.010, 95% CI (−0.012, –0.007), ***p<0.01;lnpbr: coefficient=−0.012, 95% CI (−0.014, –0.010), ***p<0.01), although its effect on overall benefit (lnpb) was not statistically significant.

Online supplemental table A6shows the heterogeneous policy effects across provinces grouped by GDP per capita (a total of 496 annual provincial observations covering 31 provinces).

The model incorporates interaction terms for policy variables (policy_implemented,policy_implemented_lag1,policy_implemented_lag2) and per capita GDP (pgdp) to test the moderating role of economic development.

For the immediate policy effect (policy_implemented), the main effect ofpolicy_implementedon urban per capita benefit (lnpbu) is marginally significant and negative (coefficient=−0.335, 95% CI (−0.679, 0.010), *p<0.10) but the interaction term (policy_implemented×pgdp) is not significant. For the benefit per rural resident (lnpbr), the interaction term (policy_implemented×pgdp) is significantly positive (coefficient=0.066, 95% CI (0.015, 0.116), **p<0.05), suggesting that the higher the level of economic development, the weaker is the effect of the policy on rural benefit.

For the policy effect with a 2-year lag (policy_implemented_lag2), the main effect on the per capita benefit of urban residents (lnpbu) is significantly negative (coefficient=−0.425, 95% CI (−0.764, –0.086), **p<0.05), and the interaction term (policy_implemented_lag2×pgdp) is a marginally significant and positive (coefficient=0.041, 95% CI (−0.007, 0.089), *p<0.10), suggesting that an increase in the level of economic development mitigates the lagged negative effect of the policy on the benefits to urban residents.

For provinces with GDP per capita >100 000 yuan (6 provinces, 96 provincial-year observations), the policy effect with a 1-year lag (policy_implemented_lag1) on the per capita benefit to rural residents (lnpbr) is significantly positive (coefficient=0.360, 95% CI (0.010, 0.710), **p<0.05), suggesting a delayed positive impact on rural benefits in high-income provinces.

For provinces with 60 000 ≤per capita GDP ≤100 000 yuan (14 provinces, 224 provincial-year observations), the immediate effect (policy_implemented) of the policy on the per capita benefit of rural residents (lnpbr) is significantly positive (coefficient=0.401, 95% CI (0.175, 0.626), ***p<0.01), suggesting that the policy increased the benefit of rural residents in middle-income provinces.

For provinces with per capita GDP <60 000 yuan (11 provinces, 176 province-year observations), the immediate policy effect (policy_implemented) on overall per capita benefits (lnpb) is significantly negative (coefficient=−0.409, 95% CI (−0.722, –0.096), **p<0.05). The immediate policy effect (policy_implemented) on rural residents’ per capita benefit (lnpbr) is significantly negative (coefficient=−0.457, 95% CI (−0.806, –0.107), **p<0.05), suggesting that the policy reduces overall and rural welfare in low-income provinces. The 2-year lagged policy effect (policy_implemented_lag2) on rural per capita benefit (lnpbr) is significantly positive (coefficient=0.413, 95% CI (0.064, 0.762), **p<0.05), suggesting a delayed recovery of rural welfare in low-income provinces.

This study used the PSM-DID method to assess the impact of China’s medical insurance integration policy on urban-rural benefit disparities across 31 provinces (2006–2021). The main findings are as follows.

Overall, the policy implementation reduced the per capita benefit of urban residents (coefficient=−0.373**). Specifically, the policy had a positive effect on rural welfare with a 1-year lag in provinces with a GDP per capita of more than 100 000 yuan (coefficient=0.360**). In provinces with GDP per capita of 60 000 to 100 000 yuan, the policy immediately increased rural benefits (coefficient=0.401***). And in provinces with GDP per capita less than 60 000 yuan, the policy immediately reduces overall benefits and rural benefits (coefficient=−0.409**, −0.457**), but there was a recovery effect of the rural benefits with a 2-year lag (coefficient=0.413**).

In addition, it should be added that the impact of the policy is partly influenced by medical insurance coverage. The effect of the policy with a 1-year lag significantly increased medical insurance coverage (coefficient=12.356***), but the increase in medical insurance coverage is associated with a decrease in the level of benefits (lnpb: −0.011***,lnpbu: −0.009***,lnpbr: −0.011***), which suggests that there is a trade-off between expanding coverage and benefits in the short term.

This study used provincial panel data (2006–2021) and a quasi-natural experiment to mitigate endogeneity, and used PSM-DID and two-way fixed effects to address sample selection bias. Multiple robustness tests (placebo, subgroup analyses and influencing mechanism analyses) improved the reliability of the results.

The study has limitations. Risk pools for integrated insurance programmes vary across provinces, and there are differences in local policy implementation strategies and resource allocation that may not be fully captured by provincial data. Besides, the mediation analysis used only medical insurance coverage as the mechanism variable and does not incorporate other potential pathways, which may limit the comprehensiveness of the mechanism explanation. Last but not least, data were derived from administrative statistics and may be affected by statistical methods and missing values, which may affect the accuracy of the findings.

However, our study differs from those that argue that integration leads to generalised rural benefits.5 22He (2023) argues that integration reduces healthcare disparities through standardised benefits, but our findings suggest that this is not universal: rural benefits are initially reduced in low-income provinces.5This divergence reflects a Rawlsian conception of the social determinants of health—as Lagomarsinoet alpoint out, insurance reforms in developing countries often struggle to strike a balance between coverage and equity without adequate fiscal support.31Low-income provinces in China, like their counterparts in Brazil or Cuba,8 36face constraints in maintaining benefit levels while expanding coverage, leading to short-term rural losses.

For low-income provinces, short-term fiscal transfers are needed to offset initial reductions in rural benefits. For high-income provinces, policymakers should leverage the lagged effect by optimising post-integration fund management. Local governments should formulate consolidation policies based on economic conditions. For example, middle-income provinces could prioritise immediate rural benefit expansion, while low-income provinces could gradually implement the reform through transitional subsidies. Future studies should use municipal/county-level data to capture local heterogeneity and explore the policy implementation intensity, for instance, how the fund pooling scale affects the distribution of benefits.

China’s medical insurance integration policy has shown different impacts on narrowing urban-rural benefit disparities, with its effectiveness closely related to the level of regional economic development. Mechanistically, the policy has promoted the expansion of medical insurance coverage, but short-term improvement in coverage has been accompanied by a trade-off with per capita benefit levels, which reflects the challenge of balancing the breadth of coverage and the intensity of benefits at the initial stage of integration.

These findings suggest that medical insurance integration is not a one-size-fits-all solution for achieving urban-rural equity. Its success depends on matching policy design with local economic capacity: middle-income regions can leverage integration to directly improve rural benefits; high-income regions need to optimise post-implementation fund management to amplify lagged effects; and low-income regions need targeted fiscal support to mitigate the initial negative impacts on rural residents.

This study highlights that, for developing countries pursuing universal health coverage, insurance integration must be combined with region-specific strategies, especially fiscal transfers and phased implementation in less developed regions, to avoid widening disparities. Ultimately, achieving spatial equity in medical insurance systems requires not only institutional integration but also adaptive support based on local conditions.
