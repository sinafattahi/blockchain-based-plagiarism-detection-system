Suprastomal collapse is an understudied sequela of pediatric tracheostomy that may hinder decannulation. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors of suprastomal collapse following pediatric tracheostomy.

A retrospective cohort study of children who underwent tracheostomy at a tertiary‐care children's hospital between 1/2012 and 12/2022.

A total of 255 children underwent tracheostomy, with 146 (57.3%) developing suprastomal collapse 10.7 ± 12.6 months after the tracheostomy. Patients younger than 6 months at the time of tracheostomy were twice as likely to develop suprastomal collapse (OR = 2.07,p= 0.0059). Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy findings associated with increased odds of collapse included tracheobronchomalacia (OR = 1.72,p= 0.029), subglottic stenosis (OR = 2.96,p= 0.000028), and glottic or subglottic edema (OR = 2.4,p= 0.0012). The presence of peristomal granulation tissue and the surgical removal of this tissue were not significantly associated with the development of suprastomal collapse. On log‐rank analysis, the median time to develop collapse was significantly longer in patients who underwent granulation tissue removal compared to those who did not (8.2 vs. 4.8 months,p= 0.003). Patients with suprastomal collapse were significantly more likely to require upper airway surgery (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.16–3.83,p= 0.0125) or laryngotracheal reconstruction (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.41–9.64,p= 0.006) than those without collapse.

Suprastomal collapse occurred in 60% of our cohort and was associated with the need for airway reconstruction. Contributing factors included age at tracheostomy, tracheobronchomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and glottic and subglottic edema. Despite concerns about weakening tracheal cartilage, granulation tissue removal was not associated with the development of collapse.

Suprastomal collapse occurred in 57% of pediatric tracheostomy patients and was associated with younger age at tracheostomy, airway edema, subglottic stenosis, and tracheobronchomalacia. Collapse increased the likelihood of requiring airway reconstruction. Granulation tissue removal did not increase collapse risk and may delay its onset.

Tracheostomy is an often life‐saving procedure that provides a secure airway for children with upper airway obstruction or prolonged ventilatory needs. However, tracheostomies are associated with medical comorbidities and complications, and decannulation remains the ultimate goal for many pediatric patients. Suprastomal collapse (SSC) is an understudied sequela of pediatric tracheostomy that may hinder decannulation.

SSC refers to a collapse of the tracheal wall just above the stoma (Figure1), which can potentially cause airway obstruction above the level of the tracheostomy [1]. In tracheostomy‐dependent children, SSC may remain asymptomatic because the tracheostomy tube bypasses the area of collapse. It is typically diagnosed through surveillance microdirect laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB). Despite its often silent presentation, SSC can significantly narrow the airway and increase the risk of life‐threatening obstruction in the event of accidental decannulation. Reported incidence rates vary, with some studies suggesting rates as high as 60% [2,3]. Surgical intervention or airway reconstruction may be required prior to safe decannulation in some cases.

There is currently no consensus on the etiology or risk factors contributing to SSC in children. Proposed mechanisms include weakening of the tracheal cartilage secondary to the surgical procedure and the prolonged pressure of the tracheostomy tube, leading to chondritis and structural compromise [4]. Younger age at tracheostomy may increase susceptibility due to more pliable cartilage and potential disruption of normal tracheal growth [5]. Granulation tissue at the suprastomal site, often a response to perichondritis or chronic irritation, is also commonly observed [6]. While this tissue is frequently removed, it remains controversial, as it may further compromise tracheal integrity. Additional factors—such as ventilatory support requirements, tracheostomy tube type, and secondary airway lesions—may alter airflow dynamics, increase pressure over tracheal rings, and contribute to SSC development.

This study aims to investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors of SSC following pediatric tracheostomy. We hypothesize that SSC is associated with age at tracheostomy, ventilatory status, and the removal of suprastomal granulation tissue during MLBs.

A retrospective cohort study of all children who underwent tracheostomy and had at least one surveillance MLB at a single pediatric academic tertiary care center from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (#2023‐5934).

Tracheostomies were performed using a conventional surgical approach, which included creating an opening through the second and third tracheal rings and maturing the stoma site. An age‐appropriate cuffed tracheostomy tube was inserted during the procedure. Postoperatively, patients remained sedated or paralyzed in the intensive care unit until the initial tracheostomy tube change, typically around postoperative day 5.

MLBs were routinely performed as part of ongoing airway surveillance. Each procedure began with an assessment of the stoma and a direct laryngoscopy, followed by the insertion of a 0° telescope to evaluate the larynx, subglottis, and trachea. To enable optimal visualization of the stoma region, the tracheostomy tube was withdrawn. Detailed operative notes were documented by the surgeon following each MLB. According to institutional protocol, the first MLB was generally conducted 1 month after tracheostomy placement, with follow‐up evaluations scheduled approximately every 6 months. Suprastomal granulomas were removed either through a sphenoid punch through the stoma or with endoscopic forceps via rigid bronchoscopy if they were associated with significant narrowing of the suprastomal airway. Operative records from each MLB were reviewed to assess procedural findings, interventions, and timing.

Patient electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed with attention to demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, MLB procedure notes, ventilatory requirements, and surgical interventions. A patient was noted to have suprastomal collapse if an operative note from one of the collected MLBs had the diagnosis. Suprastomal collapse was defined to be an anterior or anterolateral tracheal wall collapse above the level of the stoma that resulted in a reduction in tracheal lumen dimensions. Dependence on mechanical ventilation was defined as requiring either constant or intermittent mechanical ventilation at any point during the follow‐up period until either the end of the study period or the development of suprastomal collapse.

Baseline demographic and medical information were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR) or as count and percentage. The impact of categorical variables on suprastomal collapse was evaluated through Chi‐Square or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Univariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the effect of continuous variables on the development of suprastomal collapse, with the exception of the impact of length of ventilator dependence, which was assessed via a Mann–WhitneyUtest. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the impact of multiple significant variables on suprastomal collapse. A standard log‐rank test was used to evaluate the impact of study predictor variables on times to develop suprastomal collapse. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, it was not possible to isolate the independent effect of SSC on the need for open airway reconstruction, as most patients with moderate to severe SSC also had coexisting grade 2 or 3 subglottic stenosis. All statistical analysis was performed with RStudio, Version 4.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

A total of 255 children underwent tracheostomy at a median age of 0.66 years (IQR 3.27). Table1summarizes the demographic data, comorbidities, and outcomes. Most patients had significant comorbidities such as prematurity (n= 130, 51.0%), a syndromic or genetic disorder (n= 148, 58.0%), hypotonia (n= 195, 76.5%), or a structural cardiac abnormality (n= 101, 39.6%). Following tracheostomy, the patients were followed up for a median of 24.33 months (range 3–114 months).

MLB findings after tracheostomy are found in Table2. One hundred and eighty‐two patients (70.3%) were noted to have granulation tissue on at least one MLB following tracheostomy. Granulation tissue was most commonly found in the suprastomal airway (n= 153, 59.1%). Suprastomal granulation tissue was surgically removed one or more times in 130 (50.2%) patients. The most common secondary airway lesion was glottic or subglottic soft tissue edema, followed by tracheomalacia. During follow‐up, 27 (11%) patients required laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) prior to decannulation. An additional 29 (11%) patients were decannulated without airway reconstruction. Five (9%) patients failed decannulation. Of the 27 patients who underwent LTR, 15 (55%) had at least moderate suprastomal collapse that was addressed surgically during the reconstruction. In 25 of the 27 cases, subglottic stenosis was the primary indication for LTR, consistent with the reviewer's presumption. The majority of procedures involved single‐stage (n= 17) anterior (n= 9) or anterior‐posterior (n= 11) grafting to address high‐grade subglottic stenosis, with concurrent management of SSC when present. An additional 3 patients had cricotracheal resection.

Of the 255 patients, 146 (57.3%) were noted to have SSC on an MLB following tracheostomy. SSC appeared within a median time of 6.53 [IQR = 12.1] months after tracheostomy (Figure2). Out of the 146 patients with suprastomal collapse, 35 (24%) were decannulated, including 23 (15.7%) children who underwent LTR prior to decannulation (Table2). Three (8.6%) of these patients failed decannulation, including one patient who underwent airway reconstruction. Patients with SSC were significantly more likely to require laryngotracheal reconstruction (OR = 3.404, 95% CI 1.41–9.64,p= 0.006) than those without collapse.

Factors associated with SSC on univariable analysis are summarized in Table3. MLB findings associated with increased odds for collapse included tracheobronchomalacia (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.05–2.85,p= 0.029), subglottic stenosis (OR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.77–5.02,p< 0.0001), glottic or subglottic edema (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.41–4.17,p= 0.0012), and age < 6 months at tracheostomy (OR 2.066, CI 1.23–3.57,p= 0.006). Younger gestational age was found to decrease the odds of SSC (OR = 0.908, 95% CI 0.852–0.968,p= 0.003). The presence of suprastomal granulation tissue and the surgical removal of this tissue were not significantly associated with the development of SSC. There were no significant differences in comorbidities, ventilatory status, or type of tracheostomy tube between patients who did and did not develop SSC. While ventilator support was not associated with the development of SSC, patients with SSC spent significantly longer time on mechanical ventilation (22.7 vs. 10.6 months,p= 0.0064). On multivariable analysis (Table4), subglottic stenosis (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.47–4.50,p= 0.001) and glottic edema (OR = 3.44, 95% CI 1.78–6.86,p< 0.001) remained significant.

On log rank analysis, the median time to develop collapse was significantly longer in patients who underwent granulation tissue removal compared to those who did not (8.2 vs. 4.8 months,p= 0.003). Additionally, the time to develop suprastomal collapse was significantly shorter in patients with hypotonia (5 vs. 10 months in patients without hypotonia,p= 0.036) and longer in patients with subglottic stenosis (9 vs. 1.55 months,p= 0.003). There was no observed difference in the time to develop suprastomal collapse associated with other comorbidities and MLB findings.

Suprastomal collapse is a complication of pediatric tracheostomy that may impede successful decannulation. In our study, 57% of the children developed suprastomal collapse on surveillance MLB, within a median of 6.53 [IQR = 12.1] months post‐tracheostomy. Children with collapse were significantly more likely to require surgical intervention prior to decannulation. Factors associated with collapse included younger age at tracheostomy, tracheobronchomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and upper airway edema. Despite a theoretical risk of weakening tracheal cartilage, neither the presence of suprastomal granulation tissue nor its removal was associated with the development of collapse.

While most cohort studies report suprastomal collapse in less than 15% of patients, [3,7,8,9] our much higher incidence—nearly 60%—aligns with the experience of the International Pediatric Otolaryngology Group, in which a panel of 37 pediatric airway experts reported a mean prevalence of 52% [10]. This discrepancy with prior literature may be due to under‐recognition or reporting of suprastomal collapse. Alternatively, it may reflect the skewed population of highly morbid, medically complex children seen at tertiary‐care pediatric institutions [2]. Nevertheless, suprastomal collapse is a challenging complication, which may prolong the time of decannulation, cause decannulation failure, and necessitate surgical intervention [11,12,13]. Indeed, in our cohort, children with suprastomal collapse were 2–3 times more likely to require laryngotracheal reconstruction. Therefore, elucidating the underlying mechanisms and contributing factors of this pathology is important.

Tracheal patency or collapse is a dynamic function of the structural integrity or rigidity of the tracheal wall (i.e., compliance) and the pressure gradient across it (transmural pressure) [14,15]. It is hypothesized that suprastomal collapse results in weakened peristomal cartilage, increasing airway compliance secondary to trauma from the tracheostomy and continuous pressure or friction from the tracheostomy tube [16]. However, the importance of potential contributing factors, such as prematurity, pressure from tubing connecting the tracheostomy tube to the ventilatory machine, or the type of tracheostomy tubes, is still debated [10].

The rigidity of adult cartilage is due to its composition of sparse chondrocytes embedded in an abundant, proteinaceous matrix. In comparison, neonatal cartilage is more pliable due to its hypercellularity and a more aqueous matrix [17]. As infants age, the cartilaginous framework stiffens due to the matrix increasing in quantity and transitioning in quality. The smooth muscles of the airway proportionally increase in size, muscle tone, and contractility [15]. Thus, airway compliance is inversely related to age [18]. Similar to other studies [2], we found that age less than 6 months at the time of tracheostomy was associated with increased odds for suprastomal collapse. Gestational age demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship with collapse on univariable logistic regression. While both of these values lost significance in multivariable analysis, our findings suggest that immature cartilage may be more prone to deformation secondary to mechanical forces.

Conversely, soft tissue edema at the glottic and subglottic regions remained a significant risk factor, associated with increased odds of SSC. Edema may reduce luminal diameter, increase pressure injury from the tracheostomy tube, and promote cartilage softening via inflammatory pathways—especially in younger children with more compliant cartilage. Subglottic stenosis was also independently associated with SSC, reinforcing the role of chronic airway inflammation and remodeling in the pathogenesis of collapse.

Unlike edema, which may arise from chronic inflammation and pressure‐related injury, granulation tissue typically represents a localized healing response to mucosal ulceration [17]. In our study, neither the presence of peristomal granulation tissue nor its surgical removal was significantly associated with the development of suprastomal collapse. These findings are consistent with those of Suresh et al., who also found no association between granuloma formation or removal and the occurrence of collapse [2].

This study has several limitations. First, the study is retrospective in nature without control groups. Second, our cohort is relatively small and has significant comorbidities, which may limit generalizability. Additionally, the absence of widely accepted, standardized grading scales and the potential for observer bias limited our ability to quantify the severity of airway lesions—such as edema or the extent of collapse—across the cohort. While a grading system for suprastomal collapse has recently been validated [19], it has not yet gained widespread clinical acceptance and was not used in our study. As a result, important distinctions—such as between minimal and severe collapse—may not have been adequately captured. In addition, factors like cuff pressure and the endotracheal tube size relative to the tracheal diameter were not collected. Finally, due to the retrospective nature of the study, it was not possible to determine the independent effect of SSC on the need for open airway reconstruction, as most patients with moderate to severe SSC also had concurrent grade 2 or grade 3 subglottic stenosis. However, two patients in our cohort underwent laryngotracheal reconstruction specifically to address SSC.

Nevertheless, our study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the strong associations between SSC and airway edema and subglottic stenosis; offering reassurance regarding the safety of careful granulation tissue removal. These findings help clarify the multifactorial pathophysiology of SSC and may inform clinical decision‐making and surveillance strategies in tracheostomy‐dependent children.

Suprastomal collapse occurred in 60% of our cohort and was associated with the need for surgical intervention. Contributing factors included age at tracheostomy, tracheobronchomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and glottic and subglottic edema. Despite concerns about weakening tracheal cartilage, the removal of granulation tissue and the use of ventilatory support were not associated with the development of collapse.
