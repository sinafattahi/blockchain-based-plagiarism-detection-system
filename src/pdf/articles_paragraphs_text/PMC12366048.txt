Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, where autoreactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) plays a key role in disease pathogenesis. The novel biologic Efgartigimod is a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) antagonist, promotes the lysosomal degradation of IgG, and may offer a targeted approach for managing MG. Despite the growing interest in efgartigimod, there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation of its efficacy and safety in different MG subtypes.

Comprehensive retrieval and screening were conducted on Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library to search studies on efgartigimod treatment. The data on response rates and adverse events were extracted, and the pooled effect size (ES) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by fixed or random effect models. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were employed to test the heterogeneity. Funnel plots and trim-and-fill methods were used to test for publication bias.

Data from 10 studies involving 305 patients were analyzed. The overall treatment response rate was 78% (95% CI: 67%–87%,I2= 73.4%). Subgroup analysis revealed pooled response rates of 79.2% (95% CI: 68.5%–88.4%,I2= 25.08%) in acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive MG (AChR+MG) patients and 76.2% (95% CI: 56.8%–91.5%,I2= 85.95%) in group that did not differentiate auto-antibody types. The pooled incidence of adverse events was 38% (95% CI: 17%–51%,I2= 92.59%), with infections (7%, 95% CI: 2%–14%,I2= 62.5%), headache (7%, 95% CI: 1%–18%,I2= 82.69%) and other (16%, 95% CI: 7%–28%,I2= 71.81%). Among them, grade 3–4 adverse events are 1% (95% CI: 0%–2%,I2= 0%).

Our study demonstrates that efgartigimod is highly effective and well-tolerated in patients with refractory MG. These findings suggest that efgartigimod is a promising drug for the treatment of MG.

MG is an antibody-mediated autoimmune neuromuscular disease with complex mechanisms [1]. Its pathogenesis is mainly due to autoantibodies interfering with the normal excitatory conduction process at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and the clinical manifestations are non-permanent hypo-muscularity of the affected muscles or muscle groups [2,3]. MG patients can be divided into the following autoantibody phenotypes: (1) Acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive MG (AChR+MG), which accounts for 80–90% of cases. It is characterized by elevated levels of circulating IgG1 and IgG3 autoantibody components against AChR [4]. Through complement activation, receptor inhibition, and antigenic modulation, autoantibodies impede NMJ function [5]. (2) Muscle-specific kinase antibody-positive(MuSK+MG) subtype, the main component of which is IgG4 [6,7]. (3) Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) antibody [8,9]. (4) Others like anti-ColQ, anti-Rapsyn, anti-Titin and anti-Cortactin antibodies [10–13].

Regular management of MG includes surgical and conventional pharmacologic treatment. Patients with thymoma-associated MG and those with early-onset (<50 years of age) AChR+MG are recommended to undergo thymectomy since they have a better prognosis [14]. Symptomatic treatment is carried out using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) to increase AChR concentrations within NMJ, thereby relieving the muscle weakness of MG patients [15]. Immunosuppressive agents, particularly corticosteroids, are commonly applied for patients who have an inadequate response to AChEI treatment [1] and exhibit a rapid onset of action and provide symptomatic relief in 80% of patients [16]. Other nonsteroidal immunosuppressants comprising azathioprine, morimoto, and tacrolimus are frequently prescribed in combination with prednisone and have received favorable results in some patients [15,17,18]. Nevertheless, 15% of patients still suffer from refractory MG and are faced with the challenges that their symptoms remain unimproved for a long time after receiving multiple immunosuppressants and that maintaining high drug doses brings about serious adverse reactions [19].

Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that is extensively expressed in endothelial cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [20]. FcRn enhances autoimmunity by delivering IgG and antigen-antibody complexes to the APCs, which initiate T cell and B cell interactions [21,22]. The pathogenic autoantibody IgG leads to overactive humoral immunity consequently triggering autoimmune diseases [1,23]. AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies are both IgG [24,25]; thus, the mechanism by which FcRn antagonists block the IgG cycle can be applied to the treatment of MG. Efgartigimod is a humanized Fc fragment of IgG1 genetically engineered that displays high affinity for FcRn [26]. It is the first FDA-approved FcRn antagonist for the treatment of MG [27,28].

This study aims to investigate whether the efficacy and safety of real-world clinical use of efgartigimod meets expectations following the Phases II and III ADAPT trials [29,30]. It provides evidence-based recommendations on the efgartigimod in treatment of MG to date.

This meta-analysis complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline specifications [31] and was registered with Prospero, International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42024595372). Literature retrieval and screen was performed independently by two investigators in five databases: Pubmed, Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, and Clinicaltrials.gov. The search keywords are “efgartigimod” and “myasthenia gravis”. The literature in English was searched up to September 25, 2024. Duplicate literature was excluded using Zotero software (version 7, Corporation for Digital Scholarship, USA).

Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) Participants: Patients were over 18 years old, diagnosed with MG, and either unresponsive to conventional treatment or considered refractory to MG treatment. (2) Intervention: Patients were initiated on efgartigimod therapy at 10 mg/kg intravenous injection once weekly for at least one cycle (four weeks). (3) Outcomes: The primary outcome is the first cycle MG-ADL score [32] (which assesses the severity of MG by evaluating the impact of the patient’s symptoms on daily life) response rate (reduction in MG-ADL scale score by 2 or more points over 4 weeks) and the rate of adverse events during treatment. Secondary endpoints were subgroup analyses of the literature in which patients were all AChR antibody-positive and in which patients included other subtypes of patients. (4) Study Types: Eligible studies included retrospective and prospective cohort studies, single-arm clinical trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Studies were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (1) sample size of included patients was less than 10 patients. (2) There are no baseline data for comparing outcome indicators, such as the MG-ADL score before treatment.

Two investigators (JJC and ZYD) extracted data independently, and disagreements were resolved by the third (FQW). The following data were included in each eligible literature: first author, year of study, sample size of patients, age and duration of illness, intervention, baseline change in MG-ADL scores before and after the first cycle of treatment, response rate of patients treated in the first cycle of treatment, incidence of adverse events, and type of adverse events. To assess the methodology quality of eligible studies, the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scale [33] for non-randomized studies was used, with a score of 0 for not reported in the literature, 1 for reported but not detailed, and 2 for reported and detailed. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized controlled trials, only the first 8 items of the MINORS scale were assessed. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used for RCTs. The ROBINS-I (“Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions”) scale was employed to assess the risk of bias in non-RCTs [34].

The primary outcome included in this study was the response rate after treatment, which was analyzed using STATA software (version 18, StataCorp LLC. USA) to pooled effect sizes (ES) and corresponding confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity within the studies was assessed usingI2statistics, WhenI2> 50%, it is considered that there is significant heterogeneity and a random effects model is used for analysis, otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used. We conducted the leave-one-out sensitivity test to judge the stability of the results by observing the changes in the pooled results after a single study was removed. The types of studies included were RCTs and non-RCTs and there are multiple different antibody subtypes in MG. Thus, subgroup analysis based on study types and different antibody types were used to analyze the heterogeneity of the results. Funnel plots and Egger’s test were used to evaluate the presence of publication bias. Apvalue<0.05 on Egger’s test was considered indicative of significant publication bias. The contour-enhanced funnel plot combined with the Trim-and-Fill method conducted using R studio (version 4.41 software). If there were unpublished studies that existed in the area of no statistical significance, it would indicate publication bias, and conversely the studies located in the area of statistical significance would indicate no publication bias.

The initial literature screening included a total of 470 articles, of which 102 from Pubmed, 146 from Embase, 148 from Web of Science, 15 from Clinicaltrails.gov, and 74 from Cochrane library are included. After self-checking by Zotero software and merging duplicates manually, 298 articles were maintained for following analysis. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 229 articles that appeared to have no direct connection to the subject were removed. The remaining 69 articles were reviewed in full text and 59 articles were disqualified due to their article category. Eventually 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis [29,30,35–42] (Fig.1).

As shown in Table1, two randomized controlled trials [29,30], 8 prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and single-arm clinical trials of non-randomized controlled trials comprised a total of 10 papers that were included [35–42]. There were 308 patients in total. Using the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool, the outcomes of the two RCTs among the included articles are presented below. Since all biases were low risk, the results were dependable, and the included literature was of excellent quality (Supplemental Fig.1). The ROBINS-I scale shows that the included non-RCTs studies have a moderate to serious risk of bias. However, in single-arm studies, there will be a certain risk of bias due to the lack of a control group. Overall, the risk of bias is acceptable. (Supplemental Fig.2) The MINORS scale was applied to assess the quality of the 8 non-randomized controlled investigations, and the results are shown in the table below. Literature ratings varied from 12 to 15, suggesting that the included literature’s overall quality was generally of a favorable quality (Table2).

Ten literatures involving 305 patients reported the response rate to the first treatment cycle. The random effects model indicated that the pooled response rate is 78% (95% CI: 67%–87%,I2= 73.40%) with significant heterogeneity observed (Fig.2). Sensitivity analyses and funnel plots are commonly applied to explore the sources of significant heterogeneity.

Multiple infections occurred in efgartigimod-treated patients, but the vast majority of the reports were upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, with 30 infections reported in 9 publications, for a pooled incidence of 7% (95% CI: 2%–14%,I2= 62.50%) (Fig.4A). 35 headache events were reported in 9 literatures with a pooled incidence of 7% (95% CI: 1%–18%,I2= 82.69%) (Fig.4B). In addition to infections and headache, a total of 50 cases of mild AEs included diarrhea, nausea, malaise, sore lips, muscle stiffness, and neck rash were reported in 9 literatures, with a pooled incidence of 16% (95% CI: 7%–26%,I2= 71.81%) (Fig.4C). In 9 literatures, two studies reported a total of 5 cases of grade 3–4 serious adverse events [29,36]. Among them were 1 case of myasthenia gravis crisis, 1 case of thrombocytosis, 1 case of rectal adenocarcinoma, 1 case of worsening myasthenia gravis, and 1 case of depression. The pooled incidence was 1% (95% CI: 0%–2%,I2= 0%) (Fig.4D).

Due to the heterogeneity in the results, we carried out subgroup analyses. The results of the subgroup analysis based on study types indicated that the differences between groups were not statistically significant (P= 0.314) and were not the main cause of the heterogeneity (Supplemental Fig.3). Different pathogenic antibodies in MG have diverse pathogenic mechanisms. We therefore conducted the subgroup analysis to estimate the efficiency of Efgartigimod in different types of MG. Subgroup analysis is conducted according to the autoantibodies. In 5 studies on AChR+MG [30,38–40,42], pooled response rate was 79.2% (95% CI: 68.5%–88.4%,I2= 25.080%), withI2<50% and heterogeneity was not remarkable. In the other 5 studies that did not differentiate between auto-antibody types [29,35–37,41], ES was 76.2% (95% CI: 56.8%–91.5%), with significant heterogeneity (I2= 85.949%). It is suggested that the different antibodies in studies might be a source of heterogeneity (Fig.6).

Refractory MG is insensitive to regular therapies, and simply increasing the dosage of immunosuppressive agents can lead to severe adverse events and impair the quality of life of MG patients [43,44]. Efgartigimod has displayed considerable therapeutic potential in the ADAPT trial [29], but real-world efficacy and safety have not yet been demonstrated. Consequently, we gathered data related to the treatment of MG with efgartigimod for systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efgartigimod in the treatment of MG.

The pooled analysis of response rates across all included studies resulted in 78% (95% CI: 67%–87%,I2= 73.40%), indicating a favorable efficacy rate for efgartigimod treatment. Pathogenic autoantibodies IgG-mediated hyperactive humoral immunity leads to autoimmune diseases. Both MuSK (IgG4) and AChR (IgG1 and IgG3) antibodies are IgG components in the antibody typing of MG, and the IgG clearance effect of efgartigimod holds good promise for targeting the etiology of MG [1,45]. The phase III ADAPT trial’s long-term follow-up (>1 year) revealed consistent reductions in MG-ADL, QMG, IgG levels, and autoantibodies to AChR in each treatment cycle for patients with AChR+MG. These findings imply that efgartigimod has a profound long-term benefit in treating AChR+MG patients [29,46]. Despite the distinct pathophysiology of MuSK antibody patients compared to AChR antibody patients [47], the outcomes of multicenter treatment indicated that efgartigimod treatment proved satisfactorily effective for MuSK+MG patients as well. This suggests that efgartigimod has a similar ability to reduce the levels of IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 [29,48]. The inclusion of retrospective, prospective trials and single-arm trials usually caused notable heterogeneity in the results of the analyses; however, both sensitivity analysis and funnel plots revealed that no study influenced the quality of this study.

Heterogeneity in pooled response rates may be caused by variance in efgartigimod’s efficacy when treating patients with different antibody phenotypes. After performing a subgroup analysis, we discovered that heterogeneity was not remarkable in the AChR+MG group, with a pooled response rate of 79.2% (95% CI: 68.5%–88.4%,I2= 25.080%), whereas the pooled response rate in the non- AChR+MG group was 76.2% (95% CI: 56.8%–91.5%,I2= 85.949%) still with significant heterogeneity. The results indicate that the variability in efgartigimod efficacy can be attributed to diversity in antibody phenotypes. In the phase III ADAPT trial [29], 68% of AChR-MG patients responded, similar to the AChR+MG group, meaning that efgartigimod has the potential to treat non- AChR+MG patients. Case reports have documented efficacious application of efgartigimod in the treatment of MuSK+MG patients [49]. The promising therapeutic effects of efgartigimod treatment are evident despite the deficiency of data on patients with MuSK. A single-center retrospective study with 16 patients who tested negative for both AChR and MuSK antibodies concluded that efgartigimod insufficiently improve outcomes, but it did lower corticosteroid dosage and MG-ADL scale scores [50]. We considered that individual differences among patients might result in variations in treatment outcomes. The pathogenesis of MG involves multiple molecules and proteins, such as the Argin-Lrp4-MuSK signaling pathway that regulates NMJ and the complicated cellular pathogenesis of MG [51]. Even when patients are stereotyped as AChR+MG at diagnosis, in one study, it proved that this group of patients has the potential to be categorized into more precise subgroups [52]. Additionally, activation of nonspecific immunity is a possible pathogenic mechanism in MG, especially in viral infections (COVID-19) and thymoma-associated MG [53–55]. The majority of individuals with MG feature a substantial amount of germinal centers (GCs) that formed in the thymus as a result of the interaction between T and B cells [56]. The primary source of autoimmune antibodies against AChR and MuSK is plasmablast, which are differentiated from mature B cells [57]. In addition to T and B cells, a vast array of cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MG, such as IL-21, IL-6, IL-2, CD19, CD40, and B cell activating factor (BAFF), etc [58,59]. FcRn transports not only IgG, but also antigen–antibody complexes to the APC, and the possible mechanism is to promote autoimmunity through the presentation of MHC I and II and hence activation of T cells and cellular immunity [60]. The FcRn antagonist efgartigimod might possess a therapeutic effect on MG patients by inhibiting T cell and B cell interactions through this pathway, thus decreasing autoimmune levels [61].

The pooled incidence of adverse events was 38% (95% CI: 17%–51%,I2= 92.59%). Infections (7%, 95% CI: 2%–14%,I2=62.50%) and headache (7%, 95% CI: 1%–18%,I2=82.69%) served as the primary adverse reactions with efgartigimod and had a low incidence. Besides other AEs (16%, 95% CI: 7%–28%,I2= 71.81%) have symptoms that are generally mild and acceptable and do not lead to treatment interruptions. These results demonstrated that the safety and tolerability of efgartigimod are dependable. In contrast, under regular management, apart from the ineffectiveness of conventional immuno-suppressants in refractory MG, adverse events and severe side effects may accompany the entire period of use, and treatment even be interrupted as a result [62,63]. Another evidence that testifies to the security of efgartigimod is in phase II and III trials, as well as in some real-world efgartigimod trials, it was confirmed that the IgG-scavenging effect of efgartigimod is selective and does not reduce the overall level of immunoglobulins and albumin [29,30]. Although there were 5 cases of grade 3–4 AE in the included literatures, the incidence was not statistically significant (P= 0.15). The probable reason for this is that patients with refractory MG tend to be older, have a higher burden of underlying disease, and may also suffer from other immune system disorders [62,64]. The occurrence of grade 3–4 AEs may not be directly related to efgartigimod treatment.

Our study demonstrated that “Randomized controlled trials provide evidence that a treatment works: Real-world evidence is required to assess if proven treatments are effective in practice” with rigorous methodology and authentic data while our results emphasized the superiority of efgartigimod as a therapeutic agent for MG. This study has a few limitations. First, efgartigimod is a newly approved drug, and current clinical case data on the drug are lacking. Therefore, the sample size extracted from the literature is limited, especially the number of non-AChR+MG patients. Some crucial data, such as QMG (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis) Score, IgG and autoantibody concentrations, and serologic changes before and after dosing, were absent from the tracking. Furthermore, the primary outcome measure in our study, the MG-ADL score, demonstrates superior suitability for assessing therapeutic response and disease status in clinical trials. However, compared to other MG rating scales, such as QMG Score and Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) Score, the MG-ADL exhibits a degree of subjectivity in its assessment. Second, there are deficient follow-up data on efgartigimod maintenance therapy and long-term prognosis. Our subgroup analysis also indicates the existence of subtle differences between the outcomes of RCTs and those from prospective or retrospective studies. Thus, more extensive clinic cohort studies and rigorous multicenter long-term follow-up are required to establish efgartigimod as a mature clinical drug. Lastly, the causes and mechanisms underlying the differing efficacy demonstrated by efgartigimod in treating patients with distinct antibody phenotypes and the occurrence of therapeutic side effects remain to be revealed by further in-depth studies.

Based on its positive efficacy and safety, patients with refractory MG of all antibody subtypes ought to attempt to select efgartigimod therapy. Patients have shown improvements in clinical symptoms and quality of life, along with a reduction in the steroid dosage for maintenance medication. Meanwhile, compared with other immuno-suppressants, the adverse reactions associated with efgartigimod are more tolerable. Furthermore, more cohort studies and RCTs with rigorous research design are needed to determine efgartigimod’s long-term effects and differences in efficacy among different subtypes of MG.
