Cardio-metabolic multi-morbidity (CMM), defined as the co-occurrence of two or more cardio-metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, stroke or ischemic heart disease, is a growing challenge for healthcare systems given its complexity in clinical management and negative impact on patients’ quality of life, disability risk and overall survival [1]. Global ageing trends are closely linked to the rising number of CMM cases and the financial pressure on healthcare systems could become gradually unsustainable [2]. The study by Bai et al. [3] published in Nutrition and Metabolism provides interesting insights into how cardiovascular health, assessed by the American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 (LE8) framework [4], influences the trajectory of cardio-metabolic disease progression from first diagnosis to occurrence of fatal cardiovascular events.

One of the key strengths of the analyses is the sophisticated modelling of transitional health cardio-metabolic states according to the adherence to the LE8 framework. Specifically, multi-state modelling was used to capture the dynamic transitions between health states from baseline health to first diagnosis of a cardiometabolic disease (FCMD), progression to CMM, and ultimately to the occurrence of a fatal event. The resulting findings have provided a deeper understanding of how cardiovascular health may impact each stage of disease progression, which traditional statistical approaches would not be able to discriminate. The robustness of the analysis is further strengthened by the study’s large sample size and rigorous design. More than 260,000 UK Biobank participants were followed for a median of 13.94 years and approximately 33,900 participants developed at least one cardiometabolic disease, 4,282 progressed to CMM, and 4,955 fatal events were recorded.

The results demonstrate the remarkable protective effects of higher LE8 scores across cardio-metabolic disease transitions. Participants with high cardiovascular health (LE8 scores 80–100) showed an 80% risk reduction in developing FCMD and a 47% reduction in progression from FCMD to CMM compared to those with low cardiovascular health. The differences in risk prediction between behavioural and biological subscales were intriguing as, while both contributed to the prevention of disease onset and progression, behavioural factors (diet, physical activity, smoking, sleep, BMI) showed superior protective effects against mortality in later disease stages. The observed dose-response relationships, analysed using restricted cubic splines, further corroborate these findings by demonstrating that improvements in cardio-metabolic health are overall proportional to changes in LE8 scores and even modest improvements of LE8 scores could have important clinical benefits.

These findings may have significant implications for clinical practice and public health policy. The different effects of LE8 components across disease stages suggest that prevention strategies could be tailored to patients’ current health status. For healthy individuals, comprehensive cardiovascular health optimization focusing on all eight components appears most beneficial to prevent initial disease onset. However, for patients with existing cardio-metabolic conditions, the study suggests that behavioural interventions may be more impactful than intensive metabolic control.

This latter finding challenges current clinical paradigms that often emphasise aggressive control of blood pressure, glucose, and lipids in patients with established cardiometabolic disease [5]. The paradoxical association between higher biological scores and increased mortality risk in patients with FCMD or CMM suggests that overly intensive cardio-metabolic control may be counter-productive in certain populations, a finding that aligns with results from trials, such as the ACCORD trial, that questioned intensive glycaemic control in high-risk patients [6].

This study represents a paradigm shift toward understanding health as a dynamic, multi-dimensional construct rather than simply the absence of disease. The LE8 framework’s incorporation of sleep health alongside traditional cardiovascular risk factors reflects also the evolving understanding of health determinants [4]. The study also highlights the critical importance of lifestyle factors throughout the entire disease continuum. The consistent protective effects of behavioural factors, even in advanced disease stages, suggest that it is never too late to benefit from behavioural, dietary and lifestyle modifications. This finding should encourage both health professionals and patients to maintain focus on behavioural, dietary and lifestyle interventions regardless of existing cardio-metabolic comorbidities.

The paper by Bai et al. [3] provides compelling evidence that the LE8 framework offers a practical, evidence-based and personalised approach for the prevention of cardio-metabolic multi-morbidity. As healthcare systems worldwide deal with the rising burden of multimorbidity, the LE8 framework may represent an essential tool to improve adherence and effectiveness of population health preventative strategies and ultimately dampen the rising healthcare costs.
