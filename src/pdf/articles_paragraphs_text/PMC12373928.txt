Cemental tear is a rare and indetectable condition unless obvious clinical signs present with the involvement of surrounding periodontal and periapical tissues. Due to its clinical manifestations similar to common dental issues, such as vertical root fracture, primary endodontic diseases, and periodontal diseases, as well as the low awareness of cemental tear for clinicians, misdiagnosis often occurs. The critical principle for cemental tear treatment is to remove torn fragments, and overlooking fragments leads to futile therapy, which could deteriorate the conditions of the affected teeth. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and subsequent appropriate interventions are vital for managing cemental tear. Novel diagnostic tools, including cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), microscopes, and enamel matrix derivatives, have improved early detection and management, enhancing tooth retention. The implementation of standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols, combined with improved clinical awareness among dental professionals, serves to mitigate risks of diagnostic errors and suboptimal therapeutic interventions. This expert consensus reviewed the epidemiology, pathogenesis, potential predisposing factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cemental tear, aiming to provide a clinical guideline and facilitate clinicians to have a better understanding of cemental tear.

Cemental tear can be an incomplete or complete detachment of the cementum along the cemento-dentinal junction (CDJ) or a partial detachment along the incremental lines within the body of the cementum.1–3It is a specific type of root surface fracture involving cementum; sometimes, the tear also involves dentin, termed cemento-dentinal tear.4There are no specific clinical symptoms at the early stage of cemental tear forming; surrounding tissue is gradually destroyed with progression resulting from the low-grade inflammation induced by mechanical stimulation of torn fragments,5leading to sinus tract, isolated deep periodontal pocket, purulent discharge, occlusal pain, etc. The diagnosis of cemental tear is challenging because of its clinical presentations similar to vertical root fracture (VRF), periodontitis, and apical periodontitis.4,6,7In addition, low awareness of cemental tears can also lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, even for experienced clinicians, posing significant clinical dilemmas.3,8Therefore, a clinical guideline is needed for improving cemental tear management, and this consensus aims to summarize recent progress on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, possible predisposing factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and treatment outcomes of cemental tear and to help clinicians enhance awareness of cemental tear and develop feasible treatment plans.

Acellular afibrillar cementum (AAC):AAC comprises the mineralized matrix without collagen fibers and cementocytes. It is often found as the isolated cementum island or the most cervical part of cementum on the enamel surface coronal to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). AAC does not participate in tooth-periodontal ligament attachment because there is no fiber insertion.

Cellular intrinsic fiber cementum (CIFC):CIFC usually exists with cellular mixed stratified cementum (CMSC), which participates in cementum repair.

In conclusion, cementum is a complex of collagen fibers and calcified substances connecting dentin and periodontal ligament, except AAC. According to the surrounding environment or requirement (adaptation and tooth anchorage), different types of cementum are generated, i.e. AEFC, CMSC, and CIFC.11As an interconnection system, cementum is continuous with periodontal ligament by extrinsic fibers, and it is attached to dentin via a 100–200 µm thick interface (CDJ) within which a 10–50 µm wide hygroscopic proteoglycan (PG)-rich layer exists. Within the CDJ, collagen fibers from cementum that transverse radially to the dentin are tied with PGs, which differ from the interconnection between cementum and periodontal ligament.21,22Although the microstructure of cementum has been extensively studied since it was first described in the 1830s, further research is still needed to deepen our understanding of cementum histology, particularly regarding the microstructure and deposition processes of various cementum types, the mechanisms of fiber connections at the cementum-periodontal ligament interface, and the age-related or mechanically-induced changes at the CDJ. A comprehensive exploration of these aspects is essential for advancing our knowledge of cemental pathologies and facilitating the development of effective strategies for cementum regeneration.

The etiology of cemental tear is unclear, and two mechanisms have been proposed for the formation and progression of cemental tear based on previous studies, namely internal and external factors.2,3Internal factors are mainly innate and related to the inherent structural weakness of cementum. On the one hand, the connective tissue at CDJ contains many glycoproteins, especially bone sialoprotein and osteopontin,23which contributes to the weaker fibrillar interconnection between cementum and dentin than the connection between cementum and periodontal ligament, as these glycoproteins may disrupt the continuity of fibers connecting different tissues.23On the other hand, the structural weakness of the secondary cementum, consisting of cementocytes in the lacunae and intrinsic collagen fibers, also predisposes it to be detached.2,21External factors are mainly related to repeated stress from occlusal trauma or sudden stress from dental trauma.6,24–27Moreover, several possible predisposing factors will be discussed later.

While the pathogenesis of cemental tear remains incompletely understood, current evidence indicates several possible predisposing factors, which have been summarized in TableS1to enhance awareness of this disease, including age, gender, systemic condition, tooth type, occlusal trauma, history of periodontitis, and history of dental trauma. Although these factors are theoretically plausible, it must be emphasized that current evidence derives primarily from case reports or retrospective series (Oxford CEBM Level 4 evidence). Their clinical correlations still require validation through clinical studies with strong evidence.

Gender is one of the potential predisposing factors for cemental tear. A higher proportion of teeth with cemental tear in males (77.5%) compared with females (22.5%) was reported in Lin’s study, which is a multicenter retrospective study including 71 teeth with cemental tear conducted in Taiwan,7possibly due to greater occlusal forces or differences in cementum structure between genders.3,4,7Lee et al. reviewed 41 cases in the published case reports and revealed a larger percentage (63%) of male patients.3However, there was no significant correlation between gender and occurrence of cemental tear in Keskin’s study or Özkan’s study,9,10which might be due to only a small number of samples detected with cemental tear relative to the total sample size, and more cases need to be collected for further analysis.

A special case report of one individual with 14 affected teeth revealed that certain systemic conditions could be potential predisposing factors for cemental tear.2The patient in the above case report did not have a history of traumatic injury or sign of occlusal trauma, thus the possible causative factor was supposed to be that the cementum of this patient was unable to tolerate repeated normal occlusal loading. In addition, the cracks in this patient occurred along the lamellar structure in the thickened cellular cementum, which is the secondary cementum. It was considered the outcome of malnutrition caused by aplastic anemia impairing the function of cementoblasts to secrete intrinsic fibers, thus developing cementum with structural weakness during the active phase of the disease. Therefore, systemic conditions such as malnutrition and aplastic anemia have been speculated to be associated with cemental tear, especially for cases with multiple affected teeth.

Although dental trauma has been revealed not to be a significant risk factor for cemental tear in Lin’s study,7excessive forces induced by trauma are sufficient to separate the cementum from the root surface.39It has been reported that 9.5%–10% of cemetal tear cases have a history of dental trauma.3,7Regarding dental trauma, it is worthwhile to clarify a possible modality, which is the direct damage to the periodontal tissues when overloaded forces are placed on teeth as an anchorage or fulcrum in the process of adjacent teeth extraction.3,39In addition, a case of typical cemental tear occurring in an autotransplanted tooth has also been reported, suggesting a possible association with previous extraction procedures.40Traumatic injury might be a possible predisposing factor for cemental tear, which should be avoided in clinical practice, especially accidental damage to neighboring teeth.

Histopathological examination of the suspected fragments removed during the scaling and root planing or surgical procedure is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of cemental tear (Fig.S2f, j, m). Histologically, cemental fragments contain cellular and/or acellular cementum, characterized by the presence or absence of cementocytes in lacunae. Torn fragments were often detached at CDJ (77.6%) or within the cementum (22.4%).1Occasionally, torn fragments may include portions of dentin, termed cemento-dentinal tear,49causing more severe dental tissue damage and resulting in non-retainable teeth if too much dentin involvement.47,55Some detached cemental fragments demonstrate obvious periodontal ligament attachment (Fig.S2m). Torn fragments are often partially or completely surrounded by soft tissues, of which 92.3% was granulation tissue, and only 7.7% was cystic.1Many cases involve bone destruction, which is focal destruction of the lamina dura and surrounding medullary bone. The medullary spaces are mostly filled with granulation tissue and/or relatively loose fibrous tissue with lots of chronic inflammatory cells.5The exploration of cemental tear fragments from the destructive periodontal tissues and the histopathological examination are important for the definitive diagnosis.

Cemental tear lacks specific clinical signs and symptoms, making diagnosis particularly challenging. In the early stages, patients are often asymptomatic, and the condition may go unnoticed. As the disease progresses, clinical manifestations such as localized periodontal destruction and symptoms resembling pulpitis or apical periodontitis may develop, leading to potential misdiagnosis as periodontal or endodontic disease. Accurate identification requires a thorough diagnostic approach (TableS2), including detailed medical and dental history collection, comprehensive clinical examination—especially probing for hard, step-like projections on the root surface—and radiographic assessment. CBCT is considered particularly valuable in the detection of detached cemental fragments. Ultimately, histopathological examination of the retrieved fragments remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.

Comprehensive medical and dental history collection is a critical first step in the evaluation of a suspected cemental tear. Clinicians should begin by assessing the patient’s general systemic health and chief dental complaints. If a cemental tear is suspected, further detailed inquiry should be conducted regarding potential predisposing factors. These include the presence of parafunctional habits such as bruxism or clenching, frequent consumption of hard foods, pain during mastication, bleeding during tooth brushing, and any history of periodontal or root canal treatment. Special attention should also be given to any history of dental trauma or prosthetic procedures. Such information is essential for identifying risk factors associated with cemental tear and provides valuable clues for its differential diagnosis from other clinically similar conditions.

Determination of traumatic occlusion through occlusal analysis, including visual inspection, palpation technique, and use of articulating paper. Referral to specialists should be considered without hesitation whenever appropriate.

Visual examination:The first step for an occlusal assessment, including tooth positioning and alignment (occlusal relationship), wear patterns on teeth, etc., provides preliminary insights into the occlusal landscape of the patient, followed by further examination.

Palpation technique:Determination of fremitus, vibration, or micromovement of a tooth through lightly pressing the finger on the labial (buccal) surface of the maxillary teeth while patients tap their teeth simultaneously or mimic clenching and attempt to move the mandible in excursions. Teeth with greater vibration or mobility may have premature contact.

Use of articulating paper:The occlusal contacts can be identified by placing ultra-thin articulating papers between the upper and lower teeth and instructing the patient to bite in centric occlusion, excursion laterally, and protrusion forward. Red and blue articulating papers indicate the occlusal contacts of static and dynamic occlusion, respectively. The location and range of occlusal contacts can be known by revealing the red and blue markings on the tooth surface. Based on these examination results, premature contacts and occlusal interference areas will be adjusted. In complicated scenarios, further examination by a specialist may be required.

Oral hygiene status, location of the gingival margin, and gingival condition through visual inspection; root surface irregularities, bleeding or suppuration on probing, probing depth (PD), and periodontal attachment loss; tooth mobility by applying pressure in a facial-lingual direction as well as in a vertical direction. Detection of root surface irregularities is important for the suspected diagnosis of cemental tear, as the torn fragments may feel rough, jagged, or uneven when explored using a sharp-ended dental explorer along the root surface. In addition, periodontal endoscopy is preferred to disclose the partially or completely detached fragments.

Disclosure of sinus tract, tooth wear, caries, defects, restorations, and tooth crack through visual inspection; evaluation of pulp status by cold, heat, and electric pulp tests; determination of periapical abnormalities through vertical percussion. For the tooth with a sinus tract, clinicians should suspect the presence of a cemental tear if no endodontic diseases or failed endodontic treatment are present, especially for teeth with vital pulp.

Detection of a “prickle-like” or “flake-like” radiopaque mass near the root surface of the affected tooth is usually the critical evidence for the diagnosis of cemental tear. The differential diagnosis of the “prickle-like” radiopacity includes lamina dura and residual alveolar bone. In cemental tear, however, these radiopaque fragments typically appear attached to the root surface or separate from it and are located within a radiolucent lesion.2CBCT is preferred over traditional X-rays for better detecting cemental tear, especially on labial (buccal) or lingual (palatal) surfaces, and for detailed evaluation of associated radiolucent osseous lesions.

Histopathological examination remains the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of cemental tear.3,55In clinical practice, detached cemental fragments may be obtained during scaling, root planing, periodontal or periapical surgery for histopathological analysis. However, in certain cases, exploratory surgery is required to retrieve these fragments, which may pose a risk of postoperative complications. Therefore, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of exploratory procedures as part of the diagnostic strategy. In cases where the affected tooth has a hopeless prognosis, unnecessary surgical intervention should be avoided to minimize patient burden and psychological distress.3It is recommended that all removed fragments be examined histopathologically to confirm the diagnosis and guide subsequent treatment.

Most clinical features associated with cemental tear are also common in other pathological conditions involving periodontal and periapical lesions, such as VRF, primary endodontic diseases, and primary periodontal diseases8,39(TableS3). Since the clinical management and prognosis of different diseases vary, careful differential diagnosis is pivotal for clinicians to provide appropriate treatment plans in cases with periodontal and endodontic lesions. In this section, we briefly introduce the differential diagnosis of cemental tear. Radiographic and histopathological examinations remain essential tools for preliminary and definitive diagnosis, respectively.

Deep periodontal pocket, periodontal suppuration, and bleeding on probing are common clinical features of both cemental tear and periodontal diseases. Overlooking of cemental tear would hinder the healing of periodontal tissues.60,62,63Therefore, careful inspection of radiographic images is necessary to clarify the primary cause of periodontal lesions (Fig.S2). In addition, periodontal diseases usually involve multiple teeth and induce generalized bone loss instead of localized lesions associated with specific root surfaces. Although periodontal disease can also present in the form of localized abscesses occasionally, the detection of ledge-like projections on the root surface could facilitate distinguishing cemental tear from periodontal abscess. The typical radiographic and histological manifestations of cemental tear are always critical features for differential diagnosis.

The principal objectives of cemental tear treatment are to thoroughly remove torn fragments and infected tissues and reconstruct the structure and function of the affected tissues. Current treatment modalities for cemental tear mainly include periodic medical follow-ups, occlusal adjustment, scaling and root planning, RCT, surgical treatment, and tooth extraction (TableS4). The treatment strategy for cemental tear is primarily based on the location of the torn fragment, the severity of associated periodontal and periapical lesions, and the patient’s preference.3,4Thus, we proposed a treatment decision tree mainly based on the condition of periodontal and periapical lesions and accessibility of torn fragments to guide clinicians in selecting appropriate interventions (Fig.2). For cemental tear in the cervical third of the root, complete removal of torn fragments and infected tissues can sometimes be achieved through scaling and root planning alone. If there are residual fragments and infectious tissues, surgical treatments are required, usually including periodontal surgery, apical surgery, regenerative therapy, intentional replantation, hemisection, and root amputation. Lee et al. proposed a classification of cemental tear and corresponding treatment strategies recently3; however, large-scale studies and evidence on the treatment of cemental tear are currently limited. Further clinical research is needed to provide more comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Surgical intervention is required when a cemental tear occurs in the middle third and apical third of the root, or the deep periodontal pocket (PD > 5 mm) persists after non-surgical periodontal treatment.42,45Through surgical treatment, 57.7% of cases healed, including the repair of surrounding bone defects.70To thoroughly remove cemental fragments and reduce postoperative consequences, microscopes and microsurgical instruments can be employed.59,76Debridement is necessary. In addition, the involved root surface can be smoothed using diamond-coated burs.77Cemental tear is often accompanied by intrabony defects (vertical bone defects). Thus, regenerative surgery should be considered based on the systemic condition of patients, intrabony defects evaluation (e.g., vertical depth, defect angle or width, number of bony walls, and esthetic factor), and patient’s desire.78If the affected tooth is suitable for surgery, the choice of a regenerative approach is generally based on the analysis of intrabony defect features.78Firstly, the decision to regenerate depends on the vertical depth of the intrabony defects. Bone regeneration is difficult for early or shallow intrabony defects (<3 mm depth), while osseous resective surgery is suitable. For deep intrabony defects (≥3 mm depth), regenerative surgery using enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or guided tissue regeneration (GTR) shows significant periodontal improvement compared with open flap surgery.79–81Then, the decision to use regenerative materials depends on the width of intrabony defects and the number of bony walls. For narrow 3-wall intrabony defects (<2 mm width), bone grafts, GTR, or biological factors can be applied in regenerative procedures separately. For wide 3-wall intrabony defects (≥3 mm width) and two-wall intrabony defects, bone grafts should be combined with GTR or biological factors (such as EMD). For 1-wall intrabony defects, the combination of bone grafts, biological factors, and GTR should be utilized.78Among intrabony defects with different walls, narrow two-wall or three-wall intrabony defects show the most significant potential for regeneration.78,82It should be noted that esthetic risk assessment should be conducted for cemental tear occurring in anterior teeth.

The cemental tear is illustrated by a partial or complete detachment of the cementum from the CDJ or along the incremental line within the body of the cementum and, in some cases, with adjacent bone resorption around the affected root (Fig.3). The potential mechanism of cemental tear formation can be divided into internal factors and external factors. The former includes the weakness of CDJ and cementum, and the latter involves stress applied to the cementum, like occlusal trauma. Age, gender, tooth type, occlusal trauma, history of periodontitis and periodontal treatment, and history of dental trauma compose possible predisposing factors (TableS1). The preliminary diagnosis of cemental tear mainly relies on radiographic examination, and CBCT is the preferred choice (TableS2, Fig.4). For the treatment of cemental tear, complete removal of torn fragments is essential for tissue healing (Fig.4), and regenerative therapy is favorable for suitable cases (TableS4). In conclusion, the successful treatment of cemental tears is feasible if correctly diagnosed, and referral to endodontists and/or periodontal specialists is highly recommended if necessary.
