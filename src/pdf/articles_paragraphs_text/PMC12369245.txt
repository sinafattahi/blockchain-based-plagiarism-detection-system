Endothelial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress are pivotal drivers of atherosclerosis (AS) progression. It was revealed that spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1) levels were remarkably decreased in the atherosclerotic plaque vessels of advanced lesions. This study aimed to elucidate the roles of SPTBN1 in endothelial dysfunction during AS progression.

SPTBN1 levels in the plasma samples of AS patients and aortic tissues of AS mouse model were tested. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to mimic atherosclerotic conditions. After transfection of SPTBN1 overexpression plasmids, cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress marker including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and inflammatory molecules including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were examined. Then, the interaction of SPTBN1 and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) was examined using co-immunoprecipitation assay. The m6A methylation level of tripartite motif-containing 37 (TRIM37) was determined using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR (MeRIP-qPCR). Additionally, the effects of SPTBN1 overexpression on atherosclerotic plaque formation were assessed in a high-fat diet-induced AS mouse model.

SPTBN1 was downregulated in plasma samples of AS patients andaortic tissues of AS mouse model. SPTBN1 overexpression suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Mechanistically, SPTBN1 inhibited TRIM37 expression by promoting METTL14-mediated TRIM37 m6A methylation. TRIM37 overexpression abolished the protective effects of SPTBN1 on ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. TRIM37 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and activated the NF-κB pathway in HUVECs. Furthermore, SPTBN1 overexpression alleviated atherosclerotic plaque formation, arterial lesions and inflammation in AS mice.

SPTBN1 overexpression suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs by regulating the TRIM37/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway, thereby inhibiting AS development in mice. Our findings advance understanding of the molecular basis of endothelial homeostasis and identify a potential therapeutic target for AS.

Atherosclerosis (AS), a chronic inflammatory vascular disease, represents the leading cause of cardiovascular disorders. AS is characterized by progressive lipid accumulation, immune cell infiltration, and fibrous deposition within the arterial wall, leading to plaque formation that obstructs blood flow and predisposes individuals to myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease [1]. The pathogenesis of AS involves multifactorial mechanisms including lipid metabolism dysregulation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and fibrous plaque formation within arterial walls [2–4]. Endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and various immune cells (e.g., macrophages andT-lymphocytes) collectively contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions [5]. Vascular endothelial dysfunction in AS lesions presents with endothelial cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, upregulation of adhesion molecules, and diminished capacity for vasodilation [6,7]. Critically, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is recognized as a key initiator of atherosclerotic plaques by triggering inflammatory response and promoting monocyte recruitment to the arterial intima. These monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which then engulf the ox-LDL, leading to the formation of foam cells, a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions [8,9]. Current Despite advances, current clinical treatments for AS remain suboptimal. Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction and identifying novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed to combat disease progression.

Spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1), a critical cytoskeletal component in various cell types, mediates diverse biological processes including cell migration, cell apoptosis, cell adhesion, and cell cycle regulation [10]. Dysregulated SPTBN1 expression is implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases [11–13]. For instance, the downregulated SPTBN1 in breast cancer promoted cancer cell growth and metastasis by increasing miR-21 expression [14]. SPTBN1 depletion accelerated tumor growth and increased malignant transformation by suppressing autophagy in hepatic stem cells [15]. SPTBN1 protected against cerebral ischemia injury by regulating neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory response, and cytoskeleton signaling [16]. Notably, a recent study revealed that SPTBN1 levels in the atherosclerotic plaque vessels of advanced stable and unstable lesions were remarkably decreased compared with early lesions [17], and SPTBN1 knockdown reduced microvascular endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. Despite these advances, the exact roles of SPTBN1 in AS progression have not been fully elucidated.

Tripartite motif-containing 37 (TRIM37), an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for ubiquitination-mediated protein stability, has garnered significant attention for its regulatory roles in cell apoptosis, inflammation, and immune responses [18]. Notably, TRIM37 promoted the inflammatory reaction by activating the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in alveolar epithelial cells [19]. TRIM37 aggravated hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting IKK-induced inflammation [20]. Critically, TRIM37 knockdown facilitated cholesterol efflux and inhibited inflammatory responses in foam cells, indicating its potential role in AS development [21]. Mechanistically, TRIM37 regulated the ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [22,23], which is a crucial process in TNF-α-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. Given that NF-κB activation is extensively acknowledged as a key driver in the pathogenesis of lipid metabolism disorders and AS [24], TRIM37 emerges as a key modulator of vascular inflammation and may be involved in AS development.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has emerged as a critical regulator in the pathophysiological progression of AS. Growing evidence indicates that m6A-related regulatory factors contribute to AS development by regulating endothelial inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress [25]. Among these, methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14), a key m6A-modifying enzyme, has been shown to regulate macrophage inflammation in AS through the NF-κB signaling pathway [26]. Furthermore, METTL14-mediated m6A modification promotes endothelial inflammation and lipid peroxidative damage to aggravate AS by regulating the stability of target genes [27,28], highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in AS. While both SPTBN1 and TRIM37 have been potentially implicated in AS progression, to our knowledge, no direct functional correlation or interaction between SPTBN1 and TRIM37 has been reported in any disease context, including AS. The potential interplay between these two molecules in vascular endothelial dysfunction and AS progression remains unexplored, presenting a novel avenue for research. This study investigated the novel molecular mechanism between SPTBN1 and METTL14-mediated m6A modification of TRIM37 in endothelial cells and elucidated their roles in AS progression.

In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of SPTBN1 on the apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the TRIM37/TRAF2/NF-κB axis as a key downstream mechanism. Furthermore, we explored the effects of SPTBN1 on atherosclerotic plaque development in an AS mouse model, providing mechanistic insights into its protective effects. We aimed to advance understanding of the molecular basis of endothelial homeostasis and identify a potential therapeutic target for AS.

Fasting blood samples (3 mL) were harvested from each participant using tubes that contained ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to prevent coagulation. These samples were subsequently subjected to centrifugation at 1200 g for 20 min to separate plasma samples for further analysis. SPTBN1 protein levels in plasma samples were measured using the human SPTBN1 ELISA kit (#MBS7608139, MyBioSource, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. This study received approval from the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of the Quzhou People’s Hospital (Approval number: 2023-129), and was conducted in accordance to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

HUVECs were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; #11965092, Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; #10099141, Gibco, USA) and penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HUVECs were exposed to ox-LDL for 24 h to mimic the AS model in vitro. All overexpression plasmids and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were obtained from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China), and they were transfected into HUVECs using Lipofectamine 3000 (#L3000015, Invitrogen, USA).

Proteins in aortic tissues and HUVECs were extracted using radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (#P0013B, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Total proteins were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Thereafter, the membranes were blocked in non-fat milk for 2 h, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibody at 37 °C for 2 h. The protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence regent (#P0018S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and gray intensity evaluation was conducted using ImageJ software. The primary antibodies (Abcam, USA) are listed below: SPTBN1 (1:2000, ab72239), TRIM37 (1:2000, ab264190), TRAF2 (1:1000, ab126758), METTL14 (1:1000, ab309060), Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (1:1000, ab109361), Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VACM-1) (1:1000, ab134047), IκB (1:1000, ab32518), p-IκB (1:10000, ab133462), IκB kinase (IKK) (1:1000, ab32041), p-IKK (1:1000, ab38515), and GAPDH (1:2500, ab9485).

Paraffin-embedded tissue Sects. (4 µm thick) were meticulously crafted, and soaked in xylene, followed by a rehydration step. Subsequently, the sections were immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate solution (#S4641, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and subjected to microwave treatment. Following this, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Abcam, USA) specific to SPTBN1 (1:100, ab72239), TRIM37 (1:100, ab238156), and TRAF2 (1:100, ab126758) at 4 °C overnight. Sections were further incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at a warm 37 °C. The staining process was concluded by developing the sections using a DAB kit (#P0203S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The stained sections were then examined under a light microscope (CX43, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using ImageJ software.

HUVECs were seed into 96-well plates (6 × 103cells/well), and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before adding 10 µL of CCK-8 reagent (#96992, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) into each well. The cells were then subjected to a further incubation period of 2 h to facilitate the reaction between the CCK-8 reagent and the cellular components. The resulting absorbance was examined at 450 nm using a microplate reader (iMark, Bio-Rad, USA).

Cell apoptosis was assessed using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (#C1062S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Briefly, HUVECs (1 × 106cells/mL) were treated with 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and an equal volume of propidium iodide for 15 min in a dark environment at ambient temperature. Following the staining, the cells were analyzed for signs of apoptosis using a flow cytometer (FACSCanto™II, BD bioscience, NJ, USA).

ROS level was evaluated using a ROS Assay Kit (#S0033S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). To begin with, the treated HUVECs were plated in a 24-well plate configuration and exposed to a solution of DCFH-DA solution at 37 °C for 20 min. ROS fluorescence were examined under a fluorescence microscope. The resulting fluorescence, indicative of ROS content, was quantified through ImageJ software.

MDA and SOD levels were examined using ELISA kits including MDA Assay Kit (#BC0025, Solarbio, Beijing, China) and Total SOD Assay Kit (#S0101S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China).

Proteins within HUVECs were extracted using RIPA solution, and subsequently exposed to primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Next, the mixture was incubated with protein A/G beads (#PR40025, Proteintech, USA) at 4 °C for 4 h. Finally, beads were processed to isolate the immunoprecipitated complexes, and which were assessed using Western blot analysis.

A biotinylated probe for TRIM37 was sourced from Genechem (Shanghai, China) and mixed with Streptavidin magnetic beads (#88817, Invitrogen, USA) for 2 h. Thereafter, the mixture was incubated with total proteins in HUVECs overnight at 4 °C. The bound proteins were then eluted and identified using Western blot analysis.

Total RNAs within HUVECs were extracted using TRIzol reagent and converted into cDNA using the PrimeScript™RT Master Mix (#RR036A, Takara, Dalian, China). PCR was conducted with SYBR-green Premix Ex-Tag II (#RR820Q, Takara, Dalian, China). TRIM37 mRNA levels were standardized against GAPDH and quantified using the 2−ΔΔCTmethod.

Total RNAs within HUVECs were extracted utilizing TRIzol reagent (#15596026CN, Invitrogen, USA), followed by fragmentation into nucleotide fragments (− 100 nt) using RNA fragmentation reagent. Next, the RNA fragments were immunoprecipitated with m6A antibody/IgG control at 4 °C overnight, prior to incubation with Magna Protein A + G Magnetic Beads (#16-663, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The immunoprecipitated RNAs were finally released and proceeded to RT-qPCR.

Cells were transfected with pcDNA-TRIM37 or sh-TRIM37, and treated with 10 nM TNF-α. Myc-TRAF2 plasmid and HA-Ub K63 plasmid were co-transfected into HUVECs. After transfection, HUVECs were exposed to 20 μM proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 h. Intracellular proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF2 antibody, followed by assessment using Western blot analysis.

Male ApoE−/−C57BL/6 J mice and wild-type C57BL/6 J mice aged 8 weeks (22–25 g) were obtained from Animal Experiment Center of Quzhou People’s Hospital. All animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions (22–25 °C temperature, 55–60% humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, AS, and AS + Lv-SPTBN1 (n = 8 per group). To establish AS mouse model, ApoE−/−C57BL/6 J mice were fed with high fat diet containing 40% kcal fat and 1.25% cholesterol (#D12108C, Research Diets Inc., USA) for 12 weeks. Wild-type C57BL/6 J mice fed with normal diet containing 10% kcal fat (#D12450B, Research Diets Inc., USA) were set as the control group. Mice in AS + Lv-SPTBN1 group were injected with lentivirus containing SPTBN1 plasmids (Lv-SPTBN1; RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) via tail vein once weekly at a dose of 2 × 107TU, beginning at the 4th week. Body weights were measured every two weeks. All mice were euthanized after 12 weeks for subsequent use. Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Quzhou People’s Hospital (Approval number: 2023-135). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. This study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.

Aortic tissues were immersed in a fixative solution containing 10% formalin and 1% CaCl2for 15 min, and sectioned to 7 μm. After being rinsed with 60% isopropanol, the tissue sections were then subjected to staining with oil red O solution (#S0101S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 10 min. The presence of lipids appeared as red deposits were subsequently examined using a microscope.

Aortic tissues underwent fixation in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and sectioned to 7 μm. The sections were then stained with HE solution (#C0105S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and observed using a microscope.

Data analysis was performed with SPSS version 22.0. Data from triplicate experiments were shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The normal distribution of data was confirmed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Pair-wise comparisons were analyzed using the Student's t-test, while comparisons among multiple groups were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. For data not conforming to a normal distribution, the corresponding non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test) were employed.P< 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

SPTBN1 levels in clinical plasma samples of AS patients and healthy controls were examined using an ELISA kit. The results showed that SPTBN1 levels were downregulated in AS patients compared to healthy controls (Fig.1A). Furthermore, Western blot suggested that SPTBN1 protein levels were decreased in aortic tissues of AS mice compared to control mice (Fig.1B, C). Likewise, immunohistochemistry showed the consistent results (Fig.1D). These results implied that SPTBN1 may be a potential regulator in AS development.

HUVECs were exposed to ox-LDL for 24 h to mimic the AS model in vitro. We observed dose-dependent reductions in HUVEC viability following ox-LDL treatment (Fig.2A). HUVECs were exposed to 100 μg/mL ox-LDL in subsequent experiments, as this concentration consistently reduced cell viability by − 55%. We next explored the precise roles of SPTBN1 in ox-LDL-stimulated HUVECs. The results in Fig.2B and C implicated that 100 μg/mL ox-LDL stimulation decreased SPTBN1 expression in HUVECs, while pcDNA-SPTBN1 transfection increased SPTBN1 expression. Then, the viability of HUVECs was impaired by ox-LDL, which was then relieved by SPTBN1 overexpression (Fig.2D). Moreover, SPTBN1 overexpression substantially ameliorated ox-LDL-induced apoptosis (Fig.2E, F). ROS (Fig.2G, H) and MDA (Fig.2I) levels were increased and SOD level (Fig.2J) was decreased after ox-LDL treatment, while thee changes were neutralized by SPTBN1 overexpression. Additionally, ox-LDL treatment facilitated the expression of adhesion molecules including VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HUVECs, whereas SPTBN1 overexpression abrogated their expression (Fig.2A, J–L).

We then explored SPTBN1-associated mechanisms in AS development. The BioGRID database (https://thebiogrid.org/) indicates that METTL14 is a potential binding protein of SPTBN1. Subsequent Co-IP assay demonstrated that SPTBN1 interacted with METTL14 in HUVECs (Fig.3A, B). The co-localization fluorescence staining of these two proteins in HUVECs were shown in Fig.3C. SPTBN1 was overexpressed or knocked down in HUVECs through transfecting pcDNA-SPTBN1 and sh-SPTBN1 (Fig.3D, E). The m6A methylation sites of TRIM37 were predicted through the SRAMP database (Fig.3F), indicating that TRIM37 expression was regulated by m6A methylation. Then, RNA pull down results revealed that SPTBN1 overexpression increased the enrichment of METTL14 in TRIM37 mRNA (Fig.3G, H). MeRIP-qPCR results implicated that SPTBN1 overexpression facilitated TRIM37 m6A methylation, while SPTBN1 knockdown showed the opposite results (Fig.3I). Furthermore, TRIM37 expression were upregulated by SPTBN1 overexpression, and downregulated by SPTBN1 knockdown (Fig.3J–L). Collectively, SPTBN1 inhibited TRIM37 expression by enhancing METTL14-mediated TRIM37 m6A methylation.

Rescue experiments were used to elucidate the roles of the SPTBN1/TRIM37 axis in HUVECs. TRIM37 was upregulated by ox-LDL treatment, and reduced by SPTBN1 overexpression, while pcDNA-TRIM37 transfection increased TRIM37 level in HUVECs (Fig.4A, B). SPTBN1 overexpression prominently alleviated ox-LDL-induced viability suppression (Fig.4C) and apoptosis enhancement (Fig.4D, E), whereas these effects were almost abolished by TRIM37 overexpression. Moreover, SPTBN1 overexpression decreased ROS (Fig.4F, G) and MDA (Fig.4H) levels and elevated SOD level (Fig.4I), while TRIM37 overexpression neutralized thee effects. Besides, SPTBN1 overexpression inhibited ox-LDL-induced upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HUVECs, which were then ameliorated by TRIM37 overexpression (Fig.4J–L).

Previous studies have revealed that the TRIM37 regulated TRAF2 ubiquitination [22,23], which is a crucial process in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. The GeneMANIA database (https://genemania.org/) (Figs.5A) and our co-IP results illustrated that TRIM37 interacted with TRAF2 in HUVECs (Figs.5B, C). TRIM37 was overexpressed or knocked down in HUVECs through transfecting pcDNA-TRIM37 and sh-TRIM37 (Fig.5D). Then, ubiquitination assay revealed that TRIM37 overexpression increased K63-linked polyubiquitination levels of TRAF2, while TRIM37 knockdown decreased TRAF2 ubiquitination (Fig.5E). Furthermore, TRIM37 overexpression facilitated TRAF2 and phosphorylated IKK and IκB expression (Fig.5F–I). Therefore, our results revealed that TRIM37 promoted TRAF2 ubiquitination and activated the NF-κB pathway in HUVECs.

We finally explored the roles of SPTBN1 in an AS mouse model. ApoE−/−mice administrated with high-fat diet for 12 weeks were injected with Lv-SPTBN1 for treatment. First, body weights of AS mouse model were gradually increased within 12 weeks compared with control group, while Lv-SPTBN1 inhibited body weight growth in AS mice (Fig.6A). Oil red staining suggested that the aortic atherosclerotic plaque area was remarkably higher in AS mice than control group (Fig.6B, C), while SPTBN1 overexpression reduced atherosclerotic plaque in AS mice. HE staining showed that AS mice had enlarged intimal plaques, thicker intima, necrotic cores, and more inflammation infiltration, which were alleviated by SPTBN1 overexpression (Fig.6D). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed significant downregulation of SPTBN1 and upregulation of TRIM37 and TRAF2 protein in aortic tissues of AS mice compared to controls (Fig.6E, F). Importantly, Lv-SPTBN1 injection effectively restored their expression to control levels. These findings were further corroborated by Western blot analysis (Fig.6G, H). Moreover, levels of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were significantly elevated in the aortas of AS mice and were substantially reduced by SPTBN1 overexpression (Figs.6I, J). We collectively revealed that SPTBN1 overexpression reduced atherosclerotic plaque in high-fat diet mice.

Vascular endothelial dysfunction is central to the initiation and progression of AS, playing a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Endothelial cell dysfunction manifests as reduced vasodilation, increased oxidative stress, and heightened expression of adhesion molecules, facilitating immune cell recruitment and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposition within the arterial intima [4]. Endothelial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress are pivotal drivers of atherosclerotic lesions. In arterial wall, oxidative alteration of LDL leads to ox-LDL formation, a potent inducer of endothelial dysfunction and a key initiator of atherosclerotic plaque formation [29]. Understanding the interplay between endothelial cell apoptosis and oxidative stress is essential for developing therapeutic strategies. Targeting these pathways may offer novel approaches to prevent or treat cardiovascular diseases by preserving endothelial integrity and function.

SPTBN1 is a crucial regulator in a multitude of inflammatory diseases. Previous studies have documented that SPTBN1 plays a role in the progression of inflammatory conditions. SPTBN1 knockdown promoted inflammatory cytokine production and hepatocellular carcinoma development by stabilizing p65 and activating the NF-κB pathway [30]. SPTBN1 could suppress the proliferation and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis synovial cells [31]. Notably, recent histopathological studies revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of SPTBN1 was downregulated in the ruptured human atherosclerotic plaque vessels, particularly within plaque microvascular regions [17]. This tissue-level downregulation of SPTBN1 demonstrates a significant negative correlation with the degree of intraplaque hemorrhage, suggesting that SPTBN1 deficiency primarily exacerbates plaque instability by increasing microvascular permeability rather than promoting angiogenesis. Our findings corroborate these observations, revealing consistent SPTBN1 downregulation in plasma samples from AS patients and aortic tissues from experimental models. The diminished plasma SPTBN1 levels likely result from combined pathological mechanisms, including reduced direct release due to decreased SPTBN1 expression in vascular walls, and passive release of intracellular SPTBN1 from damaged vascular endothelial cells into the circulation. This parallel reduction in both circulatory and tissue SPTBN1 underscores its potential utility as a clinically accessible biomarker for assessing plaque stability. Critically, our functional experiments revealed that SPTBN1 overexpression suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Additionally, SPTBN1 overexpression reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in AS mice. Mechanistically, SPTBN1 inhibited TRIM37 expression by promoting METTL14-mediated TRIM37 m6A methylation.

Previous studies indicated that TRIM37 was substantially upregulated in foam cells, and TRIM37 knockdown facilitated cholesterol efflux and inhibited inflammatory response in foam cells, emphasizing its potential role in AS development [21]. Consistent with its pathological function, we showed that TRIM37 was upregulated in AS mice. SPTBN1 inhibited TRIM37 expression by regulating TRIM37 m6A methylation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TRIM37 overexpression abolished SPTBN1-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. These results revealed that SPTBN1 suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs by inhibiting TRIM37 expression. TRIM37 is known to regulate the protein ubiquitination of TRAF family, contributing to NF-κB activation [20,32]. Specifically, TRIM37 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF2 and eventually activated the NF-κB pathway, thus enhancing non-small-cell lung cancer progression [22]. Moreover, metformin blocked the NF-κB pathway by decreasing TRIM37 and inhibiting TRIM37-induced TRAF2 ubiquitination, thus the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer cells [23]. Likewise, Gui et al. indicated that the modified Yuejuwan alleviated ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation by inhibiting the TRIM37/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway, serving as a potential therapeutic agent for AS [21]. In our study, we suggested that TRIM37 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF2 and activated the NF-κB pathway in HUVECs. Given that NF-κB activation is a well-established driver of lipid metabolism disorders through promoting the synthesis of cytokines, chemokines, and other genes that intensify and propagate the inflammatory processes linked to AS [24]. Therefore, we suggested that SPTBN1 alleviated AS progression by inhibiting the TRIM37/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway in HUVECs.

While our study establishes a novel regulatory axis of SPTBN1/TRIM37/TRAF2/NF-κB in AS, several limitations need to be addressed. First, the current research primarily focuses on HUVECs and ApoE⁻/⁻mice, which may not fully recapitulate the complexity of human AS. Future studies should validate our findings in arterial-derived endothelial cells and clinically relevant animal models to strengthen the translational relevance of our findings. Second, the limited clinical sample size in our study was may affect the generalizability of our results. Future research should expand on the clinical cohorts to validate our findings. Third, our clinical analysis focused solely on plasma SPTBN1 levels, lacking investigation into their correlation with intracellular SPTBN1 levels in aortic tissues, blood lipid parameters (e.g., triglyceride and LDL), AS severity, plaque stability, or AS outcomes. Future studies should expand well-characterized clinical cohorts with detailed lipid profiling to explore whether circulating SPTBN1 levels serve as the abovementioned biomarkers, potentially enabling non-invasive monitoring of disease activity.

In conclusion, our results suggested that SPTBN1 was downregulated in the plasma samples of AS patients. SPTBN1 overexpression suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Additionally, SPTBN1 overexpression reduced atherosclerotic plaque in AS mice. Mechanistically, SPTBN1 by inhibiting the TRIM37/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway. Our findings may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and alleviate AS progression.
