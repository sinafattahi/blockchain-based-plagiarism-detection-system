Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and antibody-conjugated nanoparticles (ACNPs) are targeted therapies achieved by combining monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with cytotoxic payloads or nanocarriers. ADCs consist of mAbs conjugated to the cytotoxic payloads via a linker, thus enabling tumor-specific delivery and reducing systemic toxicity. ACNPs add to this targeted therapeutic window by using nanoparticles. This conjugation promotes controlled drug release, higher drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR), and reduced off-target effects. ADCs exhibit precision in cell killing but face limitations such as antigen heterogeneity and Fc-mediated sequestration, whereas ACNPs enhance payload capacity and tumor penetration through their tunable physicochemical properties. ACNPs also facilitate multivalent binding by functionalizing multiple antibody molecules on their surface, improving target cell recognition and binding strength. Recent advancements include 14 FDA-approved ADCs and ACNPs in Phase I/II trials. A critical analysis of synthesis methods reveals that site-specific conjugation techniques enhance batch consistency, while characterization technologies, such as SEC-HPLC, LC-MS/MS, and SPR, address challenges related to DAR quantification and aggregation. Linker chemistry innovations, such as PEGylated maleimides balancing hydrophilicity and stability, are highlighted alongside emerging payloads. Despite progress, both platforms face translational hurdles: ADCs contend with manufacturing complexity and resistance mechanisms, while ACNPs require standardized in vitro models to predict in vivo behavior. This review emphasizes the significance of comparative efficacy studies and strategies for optimizing antibody density and orientation on nanoparticles. Together, these insights connect the gaps between synthesis, characterization, and therapeutic outcomes, steering the future development of targeted bioconjugates.

A method to develop monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was developed in 1975, opening the door to cancer cell-specific therapy [1]. Now, mAb-mediated therapies are widely accepted, with almost 119 mAbs classified as drugs, and more are getting approval [2]. Treatments for many disorders, including transplantation, cancer, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and infectious diseases, now frequently include the therapeutic use of mAbs due to their elevated therapeutic efficacy and insignificant side effects [3]. Technological advancement has made it possible to synthesize antibodies (Abs) with altered molecular properties, such as molecular size, affinity, and specificity. By substituting the murine sequences for their human equivalent, the antigenicity restriction of murine mAb was removed, enabling the synthesis of chimeric and humanized therapeutic mAbs [4]. However, due to their less potent lethality, mAbs are frequently insufficient to treat a particular disease independently [5,6], and hence, to boost their therapeutic effects, researchers are conjugating them with cytotoxic medicines and nanoparticles (NPs), most commonly named ADC; Antibody-drug conjugates and ACNPs; Antibody conjugated nanoparticles) as a new concept.

ADC comprises a mAb that has been explicitly conjugated to therapeutic agents using a linker molecule [7]. When a monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors in a particular cell type, the associated medication enters, kills the target cells, and leaves the remaining cells unaffected, which may reduce dose-limiting toxicities while enhancing therapeutic effects [8,9]. Despite their sophisticated designs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) face several challenges, such as limited penetration into solid tumors, toxicity, and the development of resistance mechanisms [10]. Also, sequestration at off-target locations may be attributed to ADC binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is present in a range of non-tumor organs [10]. Though they struggle with solid tumor penetration and resistance mechanisms, ADCs can still bind to normal tissues. This occurs because the Fc domain interacts with the neonatal Fc receptor, leading to sequestration in non-tumor areas, potential off-target effects, and heightened immunogenicity. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, the development of ADCs, including new antibody forms, cytotoxic compounds, antigenic targets, and novel site-specific bioconjugation techniques, has been studied by many researchers [11].

Recently, ACNPs have been successfully assessed in clinical trials, following the footsteps of ADCs [12]. Nanomedicine has received significant attention as an inventive formulation-based strategy to enhance the biological availability of medicinal compounds. The characteristics of the NPs, including their excellent surface-to-volume ratio enabling magnificent drug loading capacity and the mAb’s ability to recognize antigens precisely and selectively, are combined during the conjugation process, which may have the dual benefits of improved cellular absorption and significant intracellular stability [13]. Although several ADCs have received FDA approval for treating several diseases, FDA-approved ACNPs are still missing [14]. Before they may be more widely used, several obstacles need to be cleared. This review discusses mAbs, ADCs, ACNPs, various conjugation strategies, characterization techniques, and current status and bottlenecks for both concepts.

Therapeutic mAbs have evolved from research tools to effective human therapeutics over the past three decades. They first accessed the clinic over 25 years ago and brought a therapeutic revolution because of their ability to show affinity to specific molecular components [15]. Many mAbs have been approved for long-term diseases, autoimmune disorders, and other areas such as oncology. For introducing hybridoma technology and enabling the applications of numerous mAbs targeted against particular targets, researchers Cesar Milstein and George Kohler received the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1984 [16,17]. The mAbs are proteins secreted by hybridoma cells, which are fusions of B cells and myeloma cells, as illustrated in Fig.1. These hybridomas can be stored indefinitely because they can be frozen and thawed, which implies the availability of an endless supply of homogeneous and specific mAbs [13]. Initially, this method was primarily used to create murine mAbs (derived solely from mice), such as tositumomab [18]. As these murine mAbs induced significant immunological responses in humans, particularly after periodic injection, more mAb types were developed using additional engineering and recombinant technologies, for example, chimeric mAbs, including rituximab and cetuximab which are synthesized by combining VLand VHfrom murine origins with CH1, CH2,and CH3from human origins. The humanized mAbs trastuzumab and alemtuzumab were synthesized by substituting the complementarity-determining portion of the murine origin with the human origin, further reducing the murine parts [4,19]. When deciding which mAbs to use, factors such as their method of manufacture, effector function, and transport to their target tissue should be considered. Concerns about mAbs’ commercial viability and the high administration expense may be partly to blame for their lack of overall economic success and first infusion-related reactions such as fever. For instance, alemtuzumab costs about £37,000 for a year’s treatment for leukaemia [20]. Therefore, to make mAbs more commercially viable, difficulties related to administrative costs, the requirement for enhanced efficacy, and minimizing side effects can be addressed. Long-term mAbs commercialization will also be influenced by other variables such as patient compliance, quality control, pharmaceutical industry competition, and financial incentives for developing mAbs. Therefore, research revealed the potential of conjugating mAbs with effector molecules such as cytotoxic medicines, NPs, enzymes, bacterial toxins, etc., to open up new possibilities for utilizing their specific binding property for enhanced drug delivery.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are designed by conjugating humanized/human mAbs with cytotoxic agents by chemical linkers to selectively target and kill cancer cells and minimize the effect on healthy cells [21–23]. Their development has led to overcoming the limitations of conventional chemotherapy by improving specificity, reducing systemic toxicity, and increasing efficacy [21]. The main benefit of ADCs compared to chemotherapy is their capacity to specifically target cancer cells without affecting normal ones [22]. This minimizes collateral damage, improves patient tolerance, and enables highly effective cytotoxic drugs that would typically be too toxic. Additionally, the efficient drug delivery feature of ADCs has led to potential healthcare cost reduction by reducing hospital stays, requiring comparatively lesser doses, supportive treatments, etc [23]. The concept of selective targeting was first proposed by Paul Ehrlich in 1913, in which he used the term magic bullet to target either pathogenic microbial or cancerous cells selectively. However, the first successful ADC was reported in 1983, which showed promising outcomes. The development of ADC was a result of the development of successful chemotherapy in the 1940s and mAbs in the 1970s. The first ADC, Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), was introduced in 2000 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but was later withdrawn due to safety concerns [24]. It was reapproved in 2017 with adjusted dosing. Since then, ADCs like Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) for lymphoma and Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) for HER2-positive breast cancer have gained approval, reflecting progress in ADC technology [25,26].

ADCs consist of mAbs covalently linked to cytotoxic agents via chemical linkers, ensuring targeted cancer therapy. For this, either humanized mAbs or of human origin are preferred for their specificity, higher half-life, and low immunogenicity. ADCs, after binding to the cancer cell antigens, are internalized via endocytosis and then released the drug inside the lysosome. These drugs disrupt DNA, microtubules, or enzymatic processes, leading to cancer cell death. Most ADCs use microtubule inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents. The release mechanism varies as per the property of the linker used; while some are enzymatically cleaved, others are disrupted by the altered pH.

Unique markers present in the tumor cells but not in normal cells are considered suitable therapeutic targets. Common targets include CD33 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) [37], CD30 (brentuximab vedotin) [37], HER2 (trastuzumab) [38,39], and Trop-2 (sacituzumab govitecan) [40]. The antigen must also be internalized after antibody binding to ensure proper delivery of the cytotoxic payload. The density of antigen expression influences ADC potency, increases drug uptake, improving treatment response [22].

The antigen must also remain stable, with minimal shedding into the bloodstream. If an antigen is highly shed, it can bind to ADCs before they reach their target, reducing therapeutic effectiveness. Careful selection of an antigen ensures effective tumor targeting with minimal side effects [21].

Because of their affinity for specific targets, mAbs show the potential to reduce the limitations of existing treatment regimes, including ineffectiveness, side effects, poor pharmacokinetics, off-target toxicity, etc. As mAbs readily conjugate to drugs and nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, they are being studied for directing drugs or delivery systems to targeted sites for better selectivity and enhanced drug delivery. For instance, an ADC called besponsa utilizes the targeting ability of a humanized mAb specific to CD22 protein expressed by leukemia cells to deliver a drug called ozogamicin, which showed better treatment efficacy than using only the drug. More such examples have been discussed in Table1.

The monoclonal antibody moiety provides specificity for tumor targeting. Humanized or fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reduce immunogenic response and increase circulation time [41]. Using a high-affinity, stable antibody is critical as this will ensure a long half-life and thus allow sufficient time for tumor targeting and internalization [42]. To achieve maximum therapeutic effects, Fc receptor modifications may be incorporated to influence immune-mediated effects such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

Recent developments in recombinant antibody manufacturing have been instrumental in upgrading manufacturing methods and producing high-quality and effective therapeutic antibodies [43]. For example, the identification of bispecific antibodies—more particularly, those aiming to target simultaneously interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13)—has revealed the potential hidden in dual-targeting strategies for modulating the immune system [44]. These improvements underscore the role of judicious antibody selection, as in trastuzumab and brentuximab vedotin, increasing the effectiveness of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) by offering both specificity and good interaction with tumor cells [45].

mAbs play a dual role as targeting moieties as well as carriers in ADCs. They bind to the tumor-associated antigens like HER2 or CD30 with great specificity, thus promoting selective delivery of cytotoxic payloads to only cancer cells [41,45]. This minimizes off-target effects and improves the therapeutic window. Additionally, mAbs offer excellent stability for conjugation with cytotoxic drugs and act as an efficient carrier for site-specific transport of cytotoxic payloads [7,21].

Linkers control drug release and contribute to ADC stability [46]. They must remain intact in circulation but allow drug release once inside the target cell. Linkers fall into two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable [46,47]. Linker configuration (cleavable or non-cleavable) impacts ADC stability and payload release. Hydrophilic linkers, such as PEGylated linkers, balance payload hydrophobicity, allowing higher drug loading while maintaining stability [47]. Cleavable linkers (e.g., in brentuximab vedotin) respond to pH or enzymatic triggers, while non-cleavable linkers (e.g., in trastuzumab emtansine) enhance circulation stability [46,47].

Cleavable linkers in brentuximab vedotin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin respond to pH changes, enzymatic activity, or redox conditions to release the drug in the tumor cell [48]. Non-cleavable linkers, such as those in trastuzumab emtansine, require degradation of the entire antibody to release the payload. Cleavable linkers provide faster drug release but may have stability issues, leading to off-target toxicity [49]. Non-cleavable linkers improve circulation stability but require more processing inside the cell for drug activation. The choice of linker affects ADC performance, influencing both safety and therapeutic efficiency [50]. Furthermore, the linker structure also plays an important role in controlling the hydrophobic properties of the attached drug, thereby influencing the overall stability and efficacy of ADCs. The linker also affects drug loading capacity because a well-designed linker with balanced hydrophilic properties supports higher drug loading without affecting the physiological activity of the conjugate.

The cytotoxic payload is the active drug that kills tumor cells [51,52]. Common payloads include microtubule inhibitors (monomethyl auristatin E in brentuximab vedotin, maytansinoids in trastuzumab emtansine) and DNA-damaging agents (calicheamicins in gemtuzumab ozogamicin, topoisomerase inhibitors in sacituzumab govitecan) [23,53]. These drugs are too toxic for systemic use but become effective when delivered selectively through an ADC. The potency of the payload must be carefully balanced. It must be strong enough to eliminate tumor cells but not so aggressive that it causes unintended toxicity. Researchers are now exploring new classes of payloads, such as immune-modulating agents and metabolic inhibitors, to improve ADC function and reduce resistance. Advancements in conjugation technology ensure precise drug-to-antibody ratios, enhancing therapeutic effects while maintaining safety. Beyond traditional payloads like microtubule inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents, emerging ADC designs include bispecific ADCs targeting multiple antigens, probody–drug conjugates for tumor-specific activation, protein-degrader ADCs for targeted protein degradation, and dual-drug ADCs for synergistic effects. These innovations aim to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance [54].

In contrast, conjugation with ADC leaves the cytotoxic drug invisible in the bloodstream, permitting direct delivery to the target cells and minimizing the toxicity of these very potent medications. Currently, many cytotoxic medicines with a new mechanism of action are used in ADC designs. For instance, small-molecule immunomodulators (SMIMs), also known as immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs), have recently been used to develop innovative ADC medicines [54]. In ISACs, the effectiveness of the small molecule-based regulation of the non-specific and specific immune system is combined with the accuracy of Ab-navigated targeting [55]. Further, the drug antibody ratio (DAR) assessment is also essential for assessing the efficacy of ADCs as less drug loading can reduce the strength, and high drug loading can impact the toxicity and pharmacokinetics [56]. Other ADC variables, such as the binding site and whether conjugation is on light or heavy chains, significantly affect DAR as low drug loading reduces drug strength and high DAR value increases drug potency.

ADCs can destroy target cells precisely as they play the specified target function and effectual killing effect, thus improving the pharmaceutical window and minimizing off-target toxicity [57,58]. The ADC is endocytosed by cells (via clathrin or caveolae-mediated endocytosis) and forms an early endosome, which matures into late endosomes and then merges with lysosomes once the mAb of the ADC has been attached to the target antigens mainly expressed on the target cells [59,60]. Cell apoptosis or death is eventually caused by the release of the cytotoxic payloads in the lysosomes via chemical or enzyme-mediated mechanisms that target DNA or microtubules. When a transmembrane or permeable payload is released, the bystander effect (killing of adjacent antigen-negative cells or the ability of the released cytotoxic drug to spread from the target cell and destroy nearby tumor cells that are not the target particularly helpful when treating cancers with variable antigen expression) may also be induced, increasing the effectiveness of ADC [61,62]. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment may change due to these medications’ bystander effect, which could ultimately strengthen the killing power of ADCs. For instance, in Mylotarg®, calicheamicin (cytotoxic payload) was conjugated to gemtuzumab (IgG4) via a chemical linker containing a hydrazone bond; calicheamicin can be released after the hydrazone bond has been internalized and hydrolyzed in the acidic endosomal environment, it is subsequently reduced by glutathione to the active form which binds to the minor grooves of DNA and undergoes Bergman cyclization, creating a highly reactive diradical that results in double-strand breaks specific to a sequence [63]. Adcentris is another example, which bioconjugates dolastatin to the cysteine residue of anti-CD30 Ig1. The FDA granted Adcentris a license to treat anaplastic large-cell lymphoma in 2011. The interchain disulfide bridges were only minimally and partially reduced prior to the anti-CD30 mAb being bio-conjugated to a cleavable heterobifunctional maleimide linker [24]. Following the dissolution of cleavable linkers and internalization of ADC, MMAE is released, which kills the target cell and diffuses across the plasma membrane to reach and destroy neighboring cells. This phenomenon is referred to as the “bystander effect” [64] (Fig.2).

The DAR and dispersity are the major emphases of the analytical techniques currently being utilized to analyze ADCs [8,65]. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to quantify changes in high-order structure, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measures aggregation, MALDI (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) determines DAR, and immunoassays look for disturbed Fc region binding, among other approaches, in the routine evaluation of ADC characteristics [66]. Various characterization tools for antibody-drug conjugates are summarized in Fig.3. The merits and demerits of each of the characterization techniques are presented in Table2.

UV-visible spectroscopy is often used to calculate DAR [67,68]. By comparing the absorbance of mAbs to that cytotoxic payload at 280 nm, Beer-Lambert’s law can be used to determine this molar ratio. This technique has been used to assess ADCs carrying a range of payloads, including DM1, methotrexate, and auristatin [69]. It is essential to consider all potential sources of 280 nm absorbance as well as the variations in extinction coefficients brought on by various buffers.

Based on properties unique to conjugation, linker, and payload, various chromatography methods can be utilized to resolve the ADCs. Native ADCs can be best resolved via HIC (Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography) and CE (Capillary Electrophoresis) [70]. SEC (Size Exclusion Chromatography) can be utilized to describe the variation in the ADC samples, especially when aggregation is expected [71]. However, the non-specific synergy between the payload and the stationary phase of columns could occur due to the payload’s hydrophobicity. The hydrodynamic radius shift provided by modest drug conjugation may not be sufficient for SEC resolution. Charge-based separations like CE help characterize ADCs since drug conjugation can significantly affect the electrostatic properties of mAbs [72]. Such changes in the ADC’s isoelectric point can be studied using isoelectric focusing and ion exchange chromatography [73]. These techniques cannot be used on heterogeneous samples with minimal isoelectric point variations. Conventional RP-HPLC (Reverse-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography), specifically with the C18 column, can be used to characterize synthetic amino acid-linked conjugates and different site-specifically linked ones [74]. Specifically, HIC is suitable for characterizing intact ADCs due to the use of pH-neutral and non-denaturing salt gradients for separation [75]. Combining separation with additional tests like UV-visible and mass spectrometry significantly improves the information on ADC composition obtained by chromatography.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is now more helpful in analyzing more significant macromolecules, such as antibodies, because of advancements in ionization techniques like MALDI and ESI [76]. Mass spectra can be acquired relatively quickly, but it’s crucial to eliminate salts or other excipients that might prevent protein ionization. It is common practice to use LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography coupled with MS) to boost resolution. The major shift between the only mAb and ADC can be found using MALDI-TOF MS [77]. Even if MALDI-TOF is inadequate for the mass accuracy required to distinguish various species with different amounts of conjugated drugs, the analysis of the resulting peak spectra can validate conjugation and calculate the average DAR. “Charge envelopes” of multiple-charged, ionized molecules are determined using ESI-MS. This improves a variety of DAR variations’ accuracy, reliability, and resolution. Additionally, combining multiple analytical techniques, referred to as novel hyphenated methods, helps to the particulars of the ADC structure.

A combination of cutting-edge technologies with maximum resolving power, contemporary analytical techniques, and analysis of ADC is necessary because of its tremendous complexity. The utilization of complementary separation modes in 2D-LC, which gives excellent selectivity and resolving power, makes it an intriguing method. Additionally, since RPLC is compatible with MS and is frequently one of the chosen chromatographic modes, it is preferred to use it in the second dimension [78]. For example, an SEC-RPLC-UV/MS technique was described to evaluate the non-conjugated cytotoxic payload and impurities in ADC products. SEC in the first dimension can segregate proteins, and some percentage of low molecular weight compounds are transferred to the second dimension where numerous small molecule species can be separated using the RPLC column, including linker, non-conjugated drug, linker-drug, and contaminants.

The rise in popularity of CE-MS for characterizing biological products such as ADCs can be ascribed to the development of CE-MS apparatus as it ameliorates the compatibilities between the two techniques. The exceptional sensitivity offered by the finest MS equipment combines with the excellent selectivity of electrophoretic separation to develop CE-MS technology [79]. For instance, the PBD dimer in an ADC coupled with a cysteine intermediate was characterized using the CZE-MS method. After being subjected to proteolytic processing, the peptide combination was examined by CZE-MS using a background electrolyte containing a small quantity of the organic solvent to improve separation selectivity. The thorough sequence coverage of the obtained results was highlighted by systematically identifying various peptides concerning their chemical makeup using the extremely hydrophobic peptides containing PBD medicine. The most common glycopeptides may also be detected. The equivalent ADC peptide combination was compared with RPLC-MS analysis to demonstrate the orthogonality of the two instrumental approaches [80].

When materials are in bulk form, where their physical qualities are constant over a range of sizes, they do not exhibit the particular physicochemical characteristics that NPs do, including a high surface-to-volume ratio, owing to which there is an increase in the catalytic activity of the catalyst, increased solubility, stability, etc [81]. One of these formulations’ key clinical advantages is the ability to lessen the toxicity profiles of the cargo chemotherapeutical, hence increasing the pharmaceutical window for that drug [12]. NPs are functional in many biomedical applications because of these characteristics. The conjugation of various moieties to NPs expands their range of applications, giving them new or improved features such as the conjugation of peptides, low molecular weight ligands, DNA, plasmids, siRNA, and other bio components [82]. However, some key drawbacks include the peptides’ vulnerability to protease, high manufacturing cost, and susceptibility to enzymatic destruction of synthetic DNA or RNA, also known as aptamers. ACNPs are a recent avenue that depends on the effectiveness and potential of both ADCs and nanoscience. This new formulation makes it possible to conjugate targeted Abs to nanoparticle surfaces covalently and precisely, which is highly desired, especially for those who do not use expensive and time-consuming Ab manufacturing approaches. Two main biomedical uses for ACNPs are therapy, including tissue healing and development of tailored medication delivery, and diagnostics, including sensing, cell sorting, immunoassays, gene delivery, bioseparation, and other techniques. Targeted drug and gene delivery is the principal potential therapeutic application [83]. With this overview of potential, we further describe the components, conjugation methods, and characterization methods involved in the development of ACNPs.

The cytotoxic payloads for antibody-conjugated nanoparticles are nanoparticles with therapeutic capabilities, but the target antigen, target-specific mAb, and linker molecules stay the same as discussed for ADCs. The numerous possible uses of nanotechnology in the field of medicine may hold nanotechnology’s most significant promise. The National Institutes of Health have recognized nanoscale medical technologies as “nanomedicines” because they are promising to alter the strategies to treat and prevent diseases [48]. The development of nanotechnology has made it possible to create cell-type-specified delivery systems that can more efficiently distribute biological materials and pharmaceuticals. Many different nanomaterials can be used to synthesize nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems, including polymeric NPs, lipid liposomes, emulsions, nanotubes, and self-assembled micelles, which serve as a platform for simultaneously linking other biomolecules, preserving their original biological features with little to no change [84].

Potential nanomaterial-mediated efficacy is dependent specifically on the selection of a chemical linker as it promotes the attachment and release of the cytotoxic payload at the specific subcellular area or tissue. Other essential elements include encapsulating or linking a medication or mAb to a nanomaterial. Many of the linkers and conjugation methods utilized to develop such systems have been modified versions of those used to build immunoconjugates and Ab drug conjugates. However, three typical linker types are most frequently used, and each type can be divided into groups based on how they cleave. An acidic pH can cause disulfide linkers to cleave, a reducing environment can cause hydrazone linkers to cleave, and proteases can cause peptide linkers to cleave [85].

There are various ways to immobilize mAbs on NPs. However, they can be segregated into two sections: non-covalent and covalent immobilizations [86]. The mAb is directly adsorbed onto NPs in a non-covalent attachment. The mAbs and NPs interact electrostatically and hydrophobically in this type of binding. Due to the attachment requiring a particular pH of the solution for each mAb, direct adsorption has limits. The antibody’s isoelectric point (pI) must be somewhat higher than the pH of the solution for optimal binding. Nonspecific adsorption and randomly oriented mAb adsorption on the nanoparticle surface are additional drawbacks of direct adsorption [87]. Numerous techniques for covalently attaching mAbs to the surface of NPs have been developed to circumvent the drawbacks of direct adsorption. Carbodiimide chemistry is the most used technique based on crosslinking carboxylic acids to primary amines by utilizing a carbodiimide chemical, such as EDC [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide] and DCC [N, N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]. Antibodies amine groups can be numerous and highly reactive without additional chemical alterations. Because they can boost the efficiency of the EDC-mediated coupling, N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) and N-hydroxy sulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) are frequently utilized during the process [88]. The possibility of the Ab being crosslinked between and inside molecules is decreased when NHS or sulfo-NHS is present because it produces a more stable intermediate, and carbodiimide chemistry has the potential to affect the biological effect and targeting potential of Abs by causing them to randomly immobilize on the nanoparticle surface since the majority of NH2groups present in the Fab region may be reactive. Another method of conjugation, known as maleimide chemistry, involves attaching to the -SH (sulfhydryl groups), present on the adjacent chains of the cysteine amino acids present in mAbs. Using an oxidative process, disulphide (-S-S-) bonds are exploited to couple pairs of cysteine sulfhydryl groups. IgG Abs often have disulphide connections on the hinge region of their structures. The mAb can split into monovalent halves when disulphide links are reduced, but the antigen-binding effectiveness of the 3D structure is unaffected. Since only free sulfhydryl groups are allowed to be utilized in maleimide chemistry, disulphide bonds must be reduced by sulfhydryl-addition or reducing reagents [89]. The 2-iminothiolane and N-succinimidyl Sacetylthioacetate sulfhydryl addition agents can change the amine group of lysine residues into a thiol group, but the ability of an antibody to attach with its target may be hampered if the quantity of thiol groups increases because site specified selectivity may be reduced. The most accepted crosslinking agents utilized in maleimide chemistry Sulfo-SMCC are only SMCC along with their PEGylated equivalents [90,91]. Additionally, click chemistry, which was also suggested for antibody-drug conjugates, is a set of straightforward chemical reactions that are both highly effective and stereospecific [92]. It offers a great platform for biological applications because of its selectivity, orthogonal features to the majority of known reactions, and generation of very few by-products.

ACNPs structurally share homology with ADCs, which include a therapeutic payload, a nanoparticle carrier, a targeting ligand, often an antibody or its fragment, and an optional linker. The choice and inclusion of these components are crucial to determine the physicochemical stability, biodistribution, and therapeutic potency of ACNPs.

Nanoparticle core material: ACNPs use a wide variety of nanocarriers including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., PLGA, PEG-PLA), metallic nanoparticles (e.g., gold, silver, iron oxide), silica-based carriers, and dendrimers [93]. Each nanoparticle type has certain physicochemical and pharmacological properties. Polymeric nanoparticles are defined by their biodegradability and ability for effective encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs, whereas liposomes enable encapsulation of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs based on their bilayer structure [94]. Metallic nanoparticles offer improved optical and magnetic properties, enabling dual functionalities in diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [95].

Therapeutic cargo: The ACNPs offer much more flexibility in payload design than do ADCs, which usually incorporate extremely potent small-molecule drugs such as auristatins and maytansinoids [96]. They can be made to carry traditional chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., paclitaxel, doxorubicin), genetic material (e.g., siRNA, mRNA, CRISPR), proteins, enzymes, or imaging agents [97]. Depending on the nanoparticle composition, environment, and availability of cleavable linkers, drug release may be controlled. This way, the drug’s site and time of action are strictly regulated.

Linkers: Linkers in ACNPs play dual roles: facilitating antibody attachment to the nanoparticle and enabling drug release in response to physiological cues [46]. Covalent conjugation strategies include EDC/NHS-mediated amide bond formation, maleimide-thiol coupling, and bio-orthogonal click chemistry. For responsive release, pH-sensitive linkers such as hydrazones, redox-sensitive disulfide bonds, and enzyme-cleavable peptides (e.g., cathepsin B substrates) are frequently used [98]. The choice of linker is dictated by the intended mechanism of release and the physicochemical compatibility with the nanoparticle system.

Targeting moiety: The full-size monoclonal antibodies are largely favored for their specificity and established status in clinical practice. Shorter antibody fragments like Fab, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), diabodies, and nanobodies (VHH) are finding importance more and more. The smaller fragments have the distinct advantage of being capable of permeating tumors more effectively, yielding a lower intensity immune response, and having more control over their orientation [99]. They can be engineered to bind to peptide or protein-based nanoparticles, which allows them to target multiple targets at one time. Targeting moiety selection depends on numerous factors like the availability of antigen, the rate at which the receptors get internalized by cells, and the desired behavior of the drug.

The correct orientation of antibodies on the nanoparticle surface is crucial if binding capacity of the antigen-recognition regions (Fab) is to be preserved [100]. The typical approach is to attach the antibodies via the Fc region, thereby making the Fab arms free to carry out recognition of the targets. There are a variety of non-covalent interactions such as those involving Protein A or Protein G; or covalent linkages that can be formed if cysteine sites or glycosylation sites are engineered onto the Fc domain [101]. The covalent routes include maleimide-thiol chemistry for thiol groups introduced either onto the antibody or the nanoparticle surface, EDC/NHS coupling to create a stable amide bond between carboxyl and amine groups, or click chemistry (for example azide-alkyne cycloaddition) which confers a very high level of specificity and efficiency in mild conditions. The surface density of the antibody is also a factor that influences target efficiency and biodistribution. High densities cause extreme steric hindrance and aggregation, while low densities diminish the targeting [102]. Optimization of the ratio of antibody-to-nanoparticles is always done either by empirical studies or by surface quantification assays like ELISA, BCA, or flow cytometry [103]. An important consideration is to maintain a conjugation method that is consistent and reproducible such that the ACNPs are reproducible from batch to batch and consistent in function. With this modular design, ACNPs can be made suitable for anything from cancer therapy to gene delivery and diagnostic imaging.

The linker, utilized to conjugate the antibody to the polymers or lipids, does not affect how quickly the drug is released from ACNPs. Drug release occurs in these formulations due to drug diffusion and particle disintegration. Although it is practically difficult to restrict a little bit of leaching of the drug from NPs except when covalently bonded, using lower potency chemotherapies may make it possible to endure a tolerable premature release of the medication. Drug retention in polymeric NPs till uptake has been examined using the technique of ion pairing. This technique restricts early drug release by keeping the medicines within the nanoparticle for a more extended period through electrostatic interactions. It lengthens the therapeutic window once the drug reaches the disease site [12].

Characterization of the synthesized NPs and characterization of MAbs conjugated NPs are the two categories into which methodologies for characterization of antibody conjugated NPs fall [93,95,96]. Nanoparticle characterization methods include UV-visible spectroscopy, Zeta potential, SEM, XRD, FTIR, DSC, and NMR, as shown in Fig.4. Techniques like SDS-PAGE to separate, characterize, and identify proteins and protein mixtures, as well as to keep track of mAbs size fragmentation overall, SEC to determine equal proportions of high molecular mass and monomeric (intact mAb) species in samples of mAb and mAb-like drug substances and drug products, MS to validate conjugation and calculate the average DAR, NTA (Nanoparticle Tracking analysis) to check the size distribution of nanoparticles and antibody-modified nanoparticles, XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) to confirm binding of the antibody to the NPs by assessing elemental composition and chemical and other techniques mentioned in Fig.5are utilized to characterize antibody-conjugated NPs.

Electron microscopy (SEM/TEM): SEM images surface morphology, showing antibody-induced roughness, whereas TEM identifies the core-shell structure. TEM in antibody-conjugated nanoparticles reveals conformational changes or layering resulting from antibody binding. Its primary strength lies in its unmatched resolution, which assists in identifying the structural integrity and conjugation. TEM, however, requires advanced sample preparation and can cause beam-related damage. SEM is effective in identifying surface modifications, such as coatings or functionalization. Its primary strength lies in the unambiguous visualization of the surface. It only gives surface information and usually requires sample coating with conductive materials, which may distort biological surfaces [93,96].

Dynamic light scattering (DLS): DLS quantifies hydrodynamic size variation on conjugation of antibodies, and it detects aggregation and verifies successful functionalization by an increase in particle diameter. The main advantages of DLS are its ease of use, speed, and applicability to aqueous systems. It is, however, aggregate and dust sensitive, and it fails in highly polydisperse systems. It is also unable to differentiate between loose clusters and monomers [66,95,96].

Zeta potentialis utilized to determine the electrostatic potential at the nanoparticle surface and is functionally connected with colloidal stability. Conjugation with antibodies normally changes surface charge. The method is utilized in the prediction of aggregation propensity and tracking the reproducibility of conjugation batches. The measurement, however, is ionic strength and pH of the medium, which are sensitive and also affect the interpretation of complicated protein-rich biological buffers [95,96].

X-ray diffraction (XRD)is used to investigate the crystalline or amorphous nature of nanoparticles. XRD is used to verify whether conjugation has any effect on the core crystallinity in the case of antibody-conjugated systems. XRD is helpful in determining structural phases and confirming synthesis protocols. XRD is less informative for amorphous materials or ultra-small nanoparticles and does not give any information about the bioconjugated surface directly [96].

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)is a good method for the identification of chemical functional groups and the assessment of conjugation by specific bond formation. In the case of antibody-nanoparticle conjugates, FTIR will identify characteristic amide bonds (I and II), indicating successful conjugation. FTIR is quick and involves little sample preparation. Peak overlap, particularly in complex conjugates can, however, prevent unequivocal assignment. FTIR is also more qualitative than quantitative, which restricts estimation of surface density of antibodies [96].

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)detects heat flow by way of thermal transitions, which could reflect nanoparticle stability and antibody denaturation. DSC is most important in establishing the influence of storage conditions, processing, or formulation on conjugate stability. DSC can detect very slight transitions and generate thermodynamic information on the system. Its limitation is that it needs pure and homogeneous samples, and the information is typically related to other procedures for structural interpretation [96].

Recent patents exhibit advancements in ACNP design for therapy and diagnostics. Patent US10583156 includes nanoparticles with antigens and antibodies for immunotherapy to target B cell receptors to improve immune response. Patent US20210380676 includes anti-AMHRII antibody-conjugated nanoparticles to induce sterilization by targeting gonad cells and exhibits non-cancer application. WO2022001234 also includes PEGylated liposomes with conjugation of anti-CD20 antibodies for lymphoma treatment, enhancing drug stability and delivery.

ACNP clinical trials are still limited to ADCs, with the majority in the initial stages. A Phase I trial (NCT02646319) assesses trastuzumab-conjugated gold nanoparticles for HER2-positive breast cancer with enhanced tumor targeting but minimal efficacy data due to small sample size. Another trial (NCT03585777) explores anti-EGFR antibody-conjugated nanoparticles for head and neck cancer with imaging and drug delivery emphasis, with initial results showing enhanced tumor specificity. No FDA approval has been given to any ACNPs yet, reflecting issues in scalability.

Antibody-conjugated nanoparticles (ACNPs) have demonstrated significant promise in biomedical applications, particularly in targeted cancer therapy, imaging, neurodegenerative disease treatment, and antimicrobial strategies. In cancer models, ACNPs enhance drug accumulation at tumor sites while reducing systemic toxicity. For instance, trastuzumab-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel exhibited superior tumor growth inhibition (~ 75% reduction over 21 days) in HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft mice, compared to free drug (~ 40%) with minimal adverse effects [103]. In vivo imaging also benefits from ACNPs; anti-EGFR antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles markedly improved CT contrast in colorectal tumor-bearing mice, achieving a 3.5-fold increase in signal intensity at the tumor site within 24 h post-injection [104]. Beyond oncology, ACNPs facilitate targeted delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Lipid nanoparticles conjugated with anti-transferrin receptor antibodies effectively delivered siRNA in a Huntington’s disease mouse model, resulting in ~ 50% gene knockdown in the brain and observable functional recovery [105]. Furthermore, ACNPs enhance the precision of photothermal and photodynamic therapies. In HER2-positive tumors, anti-HER2 gold nanorods enabled focused ablation under near-infrared light, leading to over 90% tumor shrinkage within five days with minimal off-target damage. In infectious disease models, antibody-conjugated silver nanoparticles targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms significantly reduced bacterial loads in a mouse lung infection model, achieving a 2-log reduction in CFUs and improving survival rates to 80% [106]. These in vivo results underscore the versatility and translational potential of ACNPs in precision medicine.

A matrix of different mAbs, linkers, and cytotoxic payloads are routinely and systematically evaluated in-vitro as part of current methodologies for preclinical lead selection. The competition binding assay, which can be used to test if the conjugation procedure or the presence of the drug hindered the antigen binding and to evaluate an ADC’s capacity to outbid alternative ligands for binding to the target antigens is one of the in-vitro assays that have been compiled here for the in-vitro characterization of ADCs. The ADCs and ACNP’s in vitro cytotoxic properties can be assessed by cell viability assays such as the MTT assay, which is a colorimetric test that determines how many viable cells are present in a sample of living cells by cleaving its tetrazolium ring in active mitochondria of living cells on a particular cell line related to target disease such as A549 cell line for lung tumour, SK-BR-3 for breast cancer, NCI-H460 for lung cancer, etc [103]. These studies may be carried out in 2D or 3D cell culture systems, and they might also include extracellular matrix elements, stromal cells, or immune cells to better mimic the tumor microenvironment.

Other assays like evaluation of antioxidant activity by ABTS or DPPH assay, morphological characteristics of the nucleus by DAPI stain, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis studies, affinity assays, and various other studies can be performed based upon the application related to selected mAbs, therapeutic agents, and NPs as illustrated in Table3[104].

ADCs and ACNPs have emerged as two of the most promising targeted drug delivery methods for the treatment of cancer over the last two decades. While ADCs use cytotoxic drugs chemically linked to mAb via linker molecules, ACNPs represent encapsulated therapeutic agents conjugated to mAb, where drug release depends on pH-sensitive or enzyme-responsive systems. One of the most prominent limitations of the ADCs is the drug release even before reaching the target site, leading to systemic toxicity. In contrast, ACNPs provide controlled release of the drug and reduced off-site targets and systemic side effects.

Some of the ADCs, such as brentuximab vedotin and trastuzumab emtansine, are approved by the FDA and commonly used for cancer therapy. ACNPs have demonstrated excellent performance in tests but are not yet approved since they are still under clinical trials. The advantages of ADCs include known accuracy and experience with the regulatory agency, while ACNPs possess higher capacity for carrying drugs, stability, and flexibility in surface modification. ADCs have the disadvantages of limited tumor-penetrating capability and long-term resistance, while ACNPs possess disadvantages in complex production, potential toxic effects from nanoparticles, and regulation (Table4).

The design of therapeutic mAbs has generally improved, and the synthesis of conjugates has specifically enhanced, resulting in better homogeneity, both of which have benefitted the creation of ADCs. As connecting techniques and warheads have become more varied, new options have arisen to enhance medication delivery to cancer cells while lowering the payload’s exposure to healthy cells. The most difficult hurdles for the therapeutic applications of ADCs are the lethal effects, making it crucial to understand the factors that influence ADC toxicity, whether used alone or in conjunction with other treatments. Improvements must be made to the cytotoxic payload’s potency to decrease the MED (minimum effective dose) or to the tumor specificity to raise the maximum tolerated dose to increase the pharmaceutical index of ADCs. The antibody’s specificity presents another difficulty. According to the reasoning, target antigens must express heavily in tumors while barely expressing in healthy tissues to be considered tumor-specific. However, most antigens expressed in cancerous cells are also expressed in normal tissues, making them tumor-associated instead of tumor-specific. ADCs are hybrid compounds; thus, it is necessary to consider both the mAb (biological compound) and the drug and drug-linker combination product quality attributes. Because of this, early-developability evaluation calls for cutting-edge structural and analytical techniques, such as CE coupled to MS, ion mobility mass spectrometry, and two-dimensional liquid chromatography. These new techniques enable a thorough understanding of significant structural elements connected to the ADC function. Furthermore, the emergence of recent ADCs has rekindled the importance of natural cytotoxic compounds, which are frequently powerful cytotoxic drugs but often have intolerable toxicities. Finally, the action of ADCs in actual patients cannot be predicted using current preclinical models. Even though many ADCs exhibit therapeutic advantages in rat tumor models, many are ineffective in human clinical settings. The distinction between human and rodent antigens is one of the causes. It is crucial to thoroughly define the human antigen and choose the matched antibody to overcome this hurdle. When it comes to ACNPs, a notable concern is the possible short-term and long-term harmful consequences that a non-biodegradable NP may have. The intricacy is further raised by the unique physical and chemical characteristics of each mAb-targeted NPs and each nanoparticle design, which must be critically evaluated before being employed in therapeutic applications. Furthermore, the possible impacts of drug pharmacokinetic parameters, including half-life, clearance, and characteristics on the nanoparticle’s size, shape, and surface, are essential. Small molecules (nm) are thought to enter the bloodstream, extravasate into tissues, and interact with their target cells by internalizing them. However, most studies have also found that toxic NPs are often smaller. To develop the best formulations of ACNPs, extensive testing of NPs and nanoparticle-conjugated mAbs in both in-vitro and in-vivo systems is required to elucidate how NPs might interact with body cells and tissues.
