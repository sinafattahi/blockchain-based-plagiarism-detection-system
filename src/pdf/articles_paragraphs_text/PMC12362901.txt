To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of radiomic analysis of the periapical region on periapical radiographs for classifying the subtypes of dental trauma in pediatric patients.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 111 pediatric patients who presented with dental trauma and underwent periapical radiography. Patients were categorized into tooth concussion (n= 23) and tooth fracture (n= 88) groups on the basis of the type of injury. Patients were randomly stratified into training (n= 78; concussion: 16, fracture: 62) and testing (n= 33; concussion: 7, fracture: 26) cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. Regions of interest were manually delineated around the apical foramen, and radiomic features were subsequently extracted. Feature selection was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and one-way ANOVA. A support vector machine classifier was constructed based on the selected features. The performance of the radiomic model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.

A total of 21 radiomic features were selected to construct the final model. In the training cohort, the model achieved an AUC of 0.766 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.605–0.927), with a sensitivity of 1.000 and a specificity of 0.500 in differentiating the subtypes of dental trauma. In the testing cohort, the model yielded an AUC of 0.758 (95% CI: 0.538–0.979), with a sensitivity of 0.808 and a specificity of 0.714.

Radiomic analysis of periapical radiographs shows promise in distinguishing between tooth concussion and fracture in pediatric patients. Further validation is needed to confirm its clinical utility and broader applicability.

Dental trauma is a common occurrence in children and adolescents and often results from falls, sports injuries, or accidents [1]. Among these, traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) to the anterior teeth can have profound functional, developmental, and psychological impacts [2]. Accurate assessment of injury severity and timely management are crucial for preserving dental vitality and ensuring proper craniofacial development [3]. However, the clinical manifestations of TDIs may not always reflect the true extent of internal damage, such as pulp exposure or early signs of root resorption.

Predicting the prognosis of traumatized teeth in pediatric patients is challenging due to the dynamic and ongoing developmental status of their dentition [4]. Traditional assessment methods rely heavily on subjective clinical examination and radiographic interpretation, which are often limited in detecting subtle or early-stage pathological changes [5]. When TDIs occur during the period in which the apical foramen remains open, root development may be arrested, resulting in long-term failure of apical closure. This outcome is commonly associated with damage to Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath or disruption of the pulp’s microcirculation, both of which interfere with the normal deposition of dentin and cementum [6]. Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing digital methods that can assist clinicians in stratifying risk and improving long-term outcomes [7].

Detecting apical damage resulting from TDIs in the early stages is particularly challenging, especially when standard clinical examinations and two-dimensional imaging modalities are used. Conventional periapical radiographs exhibit limited sensitivity for identifying subtle apical pathologies [8]. Early-stage lesions, root fractures, inflammatory resorption, and subluxations, particularly in regions with overlapping anatomical structures, are frequently overlooked when two-dimensional imaging techniques are used [9]. Radiomics, a method involving the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images, has shown promise in capturing subvisual patterns associated with disease processes [10–13]. When integrated with artificial intelligence techniques, radiomics may enable the identification of imaging biomarkers predictive of treatment outcomes or complications [14–17]. Therefore, developing a radiomics-based prognostic model for pediatric TDIs holds clinical relevance. It may facilitate more personalized and data-driven treatment planning, reduce overtreatment or undertreatment, and ultimately contribute to better oral health outcomes in the pediatric population.

Applying radiomics to periapical radiographs in the context of pediatric TDIs could improve prognostic accuracy, particularly in cases where visual interpretation is hindered by complex anatomy or subtle radiographic changes. We hypothesized that radiomic features extracted from periapical radiographs can differentiate between subtypes of pediatric dental trauma. Therefore, this preliminary study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of radiomic analysis of the periapical region on periapical radiographs for classifying the subtypes of dental trauma in pediatric patients.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Deyang Stomatological Hospital. The requirement for written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. We retrospectively collected cases of dental trauma in pediatric patients who presented for their initial visit to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at our institution between July 2020 and February 2025. All included cases underwent periapical radiographic examination. Figure1shows the research pipeline of this study.

The cases were classified into two groups according to the type of injury: tooth concussion and tooth fracture. The classification was determined through a combination of clinical and radiographic evaluations. Specifically, diagnoses were jointly established by two experienced board-certified pediatric dental specialists based on visual inspection, assessment of tooth mobility, and interpretation of periapical radiographs. In cases where their initial assessments were discordant, the two evaluators discussed the case to reach a consensus. Tooth concussion was defined as a nondisplaced injury in which the affected tooth remained in its original position but demonstrated tenderness to percussion due to damage to the periodontal ligament. In contrast, tooth fracture was characterized by structural disruption of the tooth [18]. Patients were randomly stratified into training and testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. We also reported the Radiomics Quality Score [19] and the METRICS score [20], indicating a “Good” quality category (METRICS score: 74.1%) (Supplementary Table1).

All periapical radiographs in this study were acquired using the Carestream Dental X-ray System CS 2100 (manufactured in August 2018). Imaging was performed with a fixed tube voltage of 60 kV and a tube current of 7 mA. Other exposure parameters were automatically adjusted by the system’s default settings. All periapical radiographs were acquired using the bisecting angle technique, which is commonly employed in pediatric dental settings due to its practicality in uncooperative patients and limited anatomical space. Patients were seated upright with their upper body perpendicular to the ground, and radiographic acquisition was performed by experienced clinicians. Although no radiographic positioners were used, careful attention was given to maintain consistent projection geometry across cases to minimize variability.

Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were manually delineated around the apical foramen on periapical radiographs using the “Segment Editor” module in open-source 3D Slicer software (version 5.6.2) by a pediatric dentist with seven years of clinical experience. All image preprocessing was conducted on a workstation equipped with a 13th Gen Intel®Core™ i5-13500 H processor (2.6 GHz, 12 cores, 16 threads). The diameter of the ROIs was set to 5%. Fracture lines were excluded from the segmented regions to avoid introducing structural bias in the radiomic analysis (Fig.2). A circular ROI was selected because it closely approximates the anatomical shape of the apical foramen and adjacent periapical tissues, thereby minimizing the inclusion of unrelated anatomical structures. To account for interindividual anatomical variation among pediatric patients, the software’s interactive zooming function—activated via right mouse button control—was utilized to adjust the ROI scale relative to the original image resolution. This allowed for consistent coverage of the apical foramen across cases despite differences in tooth size. All the ROIs were independently reviewed and confirmed by a pediatric radiologist with six years of experience to ensure accuracy and consistency. Before the extraction of radiomic features, image resampling was performed, where all periapical radiographs were resampled to a uniform pixel spacing of 0.20 mm × 0.20 mm.

A total of 93 original radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics (version 3.1.0), including 18 first-order features, 24 Gy-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) features, 14 Gy-level dependence matrix (GLDM) features, 16 Gy-level run-length matrix (GLRLM) features, 16 Gy-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) features, and 5 neighboring gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) features (Table1). These radiomic features were consistent with those of the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative [21]. All radiomic features were standardized usingZscore normalization prior to feature selection to eliminate differences in feature scales. To improve the reproducibility of the radiomic features, 20 cases were randomly selected, and the ROIs were redelineated using the same method after a two-week interval. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated based on features extracted from the two sets of segmentations, and only features with ICC values greater than 0.75 were retained. To reduce multicollinearity among the radiomic features, Pearson correlation analysis was performed, and features with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) greater than 0.99 were removed. The remaining features with a PCC less than 0.99 were then subjected to one-way ANOVA to determine the optimal subset of features for model construction.

The entire dataset was stratified and randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) cohorts. Model development was performed on the training cohort, while internal validation was conducted on the internal testing cohort. A radiomics-based classification model was developed using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm trained on the selected features within the training cohort and subsequently evaluated in the testing cohort. To optimize model performance, five-fold cross-validation was conducted within the training set using a grid search approach to identify the optimal hyperparameters. The final SVM model was implemented with a linear kernel, a regularization parameter (C) of 1.0, and an L2 penalty. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model in both the training and testing cohorts was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. In addition, we computed the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score of the model in both cohorts. Furthermore, calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and clinical utility of the radiomic model.

Given the class imbalance in this study, we additionally applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to train the model and evaluate its performance on both the training and testing cohorts. SMOTE is an oversampling method designed to address class imbalance by generating synthetic samples for the minority class [22]. Instead of duplicating existing samples, SMOTE creates new data points by interpolating between a minority class sample and its nearest neighbors in the feature space. This helps to enrich the diversity of the minority class and reduce model bias toward the majority class during training.

Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio (version 4.4.2) and FAE (version 0.5.2). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies. For continuous variables with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance, the data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. For nonnormally distributed data or those with unequal variances, the data were presented as median and interquartile range. The Delong test was used to compare the performance of the radiomic models trained with and without SMOTE. A two-sidedPvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 111 pediatric patients were included in this study, comprising 82 males and 29 females, with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years (mean ± standard deviation: 9 ± 2 years). Among them, 88 cases were diagnosed with tooth fracture, and 23 were diagnosed with tooth concussion. The training cohort consisted of 78 patients (57 males and 21 females) aged 6 to 16 years (mean ± standard deviation: 9 ± 2 years). Among these patients, 62 were diagnosed with tooth fracture, and 16 were diagnosed with tooth concussion. The testing cohort included 33 patients (25 males and 8 females), aged 6 to 13 years (mean ± standard deviation: 9 ± 2 years), with 26 cases of tooth fracture and 7 cases of tooth concussion.

A total of 93 radiomic features were initially extracted. The mean and standard deviation of the ICC values for features extracted from the two sets of segmentations were 0.87 and 0.12, respectively. Among them, 82 features had ICC values greater than 0.75 (Fig.3). PCC analysis revealed that 25 features had PCC values exceeding 0.99; therefore, 57 features with PCC values below 0.99 were retained. One-way ANOVA further identified 21 features as the most important for classification (Fig.4). Intergroup comparisons of the top five most important features are presented in Fig.5.

In the training cohort, the model without SMOTE achieved an AUC of 0.766 (95% CI: 0.605–0.927) and an accuracy of 0.897 (95% CI: 0.895–0.900) in differentiating the subtypes of dental trauma. In the testing cohort, the model yielded an AUC of 0.758 (95% CI: 0.538–0.979) and an accuracy of 0.788 (95% CI: 0.778–0.798) (Fig.6A). The calibration curve indicated that the predicted probabilities of the radiomic model were relatively consistent with the actual probabilities (Fig.7A). DCA also revealed that the radiomic model had certain clinical benefits (Fig.7B). Figure8presents a case of tooth concussion that was incorrectly classified as a tooth fracture by the model in the testing cohort, suggesting that apical inflammation may interfere with the model’s predictive accuracy.

In contrast, the model trained with SMOTE achieved an AUC of 0.829 (95% CI: 0.696–0.961) in the training cohort, which was not significantly different from the performance of the model trained without SMOTE (P= 0.066). However, in the testing cohort, the SMOTE-based model demonstrated a significantly lower AUC of 0.544 (95% CI: 0.281–0.807), which was significantly worse than that of the model without SMOTE (P= 0.018) (Fig.6B). Table2shows the detailed metrics for radiomic models with and without SMOTE in the training and testing cohorts.

This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential clinical utility of radiomics-based analysis of periapical radiographs for classifying the subtypes of dental trauma in pediatric patients. The SVM model, developed using 21 selected radiomic features, achieved promising diagnostic performance, with AUC values of 0.766 in the training cohort and 0.758 in the testing cohort. These findings suggest that radiomics can quantitatively capture subvisual characteristics from routine dental radiographs and aid in distinguishing between tooth concussion and fracture.

In this study, we adopted a binary classification scheme as a practical proxy for trauma severity, mainly due to sample size constraints and the preliminary nature of the investigation. Clinically, distinguishing between concussion and fracture is essential, as they represent different pathophysiological processes and demand distinct management and follow-up protocols [23]. While tooth concussion often requires only observation and pulp vitality monitoring, fractures may necessitate restorative or endodontic intervention.

The traditional assessment of TDIs in children relies heavily on clinical examination and conventional radiographic interpretation. However, these methods are often limited by subjective variability and may not detect early or subtle pathological changes, such as the initial stages of root resorption or pulp necrosis. Previous studies have highlighted the challenges faced by clinicians in accurately diagnosing TDIs using standard imaging modalities, emphasizing the need for enhanced diagnostic tools and training [9,24].

Radiomics offers a promising avenue by enabling the extraction of high-dimensional quantitative features from medical images, potentially uncovering patterns that are not discernible to the human eye [25,26]. Compared with previous radiomic studies in dentistry, which have focused primarily on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and tasks such as maxillofacial tumor detection or periodontal bone loss assessment [27–29], our study is one of the first to apply radiomics to periapical radiographs in the context of pediatric TDIs. This is particularly relevant in clinical settings where CBCT is unavailable or impractical due to radiation concerns in children. Unlike prior studies emphasizing disease detection, our work focuses on trauma classification, highlighting the ability of radiomics to detect subtle differences in image intensity and texture that are reflective of underlying structural injury.

In parallel, deep learning-based automatic segmentation systems have recently shown promising results in analyzing dental radiographs [30–32]. The integration of radiomics with such automated segmentation techniques may facilitate the development of computer-aided diagnostic systems, ultimately enabling a more intelligent, efficient, and standardized approach to the diagnosis and management of TDIs. Notably, first-order features emerged as the most discriminative feature in our model. These features, such as the 10Percentile, 90Percentile, Mean, Minimum, and Maximum, describe the distribution of voxel intensities within the region of interest and are not dependent on spatial relationships [33]. In the context of dental trauma, such intensity-based differences may correspond to variations in tissue density, mineralization, or early signs of pulp or periodontal changes. For example, lower percentile values may reflect hypodense regions associated with microfractures or resorption, while higher maximum values could suggest denser reparative changes. These findings offer biological interpretability and support the potential role of radiomics in complementing clinical decision-making.

While this study employed traditional machine learning techniques, particularly SVM, to construct a radiomics-based classification model, we acknowledge the absence of direct comparisons with deep learning approaches. The choice of SVM was based on preliminary experiments demonstrating its relative stability in our small and imbalanced dataset. Moreover, since radiomic features are structured and handcrafted descriptors, traditional machine learning methods remain appropriate for such tabular data. However, recent advances in convolutional neural networks, including lightweight architectures designed for limited data settings, offer promising alternatives that can automatically learn imaging features without manual segmentation or predefined feature extraction [34,35]. Although not explored in this study, integrating radiomics with deep learning, either as hybrid models or through transfer learning, could enhance the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models for pediatric dental trauma. Future studies with larger datasets may benefit from comparing traditional radiomics-based approaches with end-to-end deep learning frameworks.

Despite the promising results, the overall radiomic model performance without SMOTE application yielded a mean AUC below 0.8, which may be attributed to multiple factors. The relatively small sample size and class imbalance between tooth concussion and fracture likely reduced the model’s ability to generalize. Additionally, the inherent heterogeneity within dental trauma presentations, such as variations in root development, trauma severity, and image acquisition angle, may have introduced noise into the extracted radiomic features. Given the class imbalance between tooth concussion and fracture, we applied SMOTE to mitigate potential overfitting. While SMOTE marginally improved training performance, it significantly reduced testing performance, likely due to overfitting on synthetic samples that failed to reflect the true variability of the minority class [36,37]. These observations highlight the challenges of applying machine learning to small and imbalanced clinical datasets. Future studies should consider collecting larger, multi-institutional datasets and exploring alternative strategies such as cost-sensitive learning, ensemble methods, or targeted data collection to increase the representation of undersampled classes and improve model robustness.

However, like many radiomic studies, our model has limitations. First, this retrospective study was conducted with data from a single institution and relied solely on internal validation, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. To enhance external validity, future studies should incorporate multicenter datasets and external validation cohorts. Second, the present study focused exclusively on two categories of dental trauma, while other types of injury, such as luxation and avulsion, were not included. These additional trauma types may also benefit from radiomics-based assessment and should be considered in future research to broaden the clinical applicability of the model. Third, all periapical radiographs were acquired using the bisecting angle technique without the aid of radiographic positioners, which may introduce geometric distortion. This variability in image projection could affect the stability and reproducibility of radiomic features and should be addressed in future studies through the use of standardized acquisition methods such as the paralleling technique. Additionally, trauma classification was jointly performed by two experienced pediatric dentists who resolved any initial disagreements through discussion; however, formal interrater reliability statistics were not calculated, which represents a limitation that may affect diagnostic consistency and model robustness. Finally, only voxel resampling was performed during preprocessing; other steps, such as intensity normalization and filtering, were not applied and warrant further investigation.

In conclusion, this preliminary study highlights the potential of radiomic analysis of periapical radiographs as a supplementary method for distinguishing between tooth concussion and fracture in pediatric patients. By using routinely acquired imaging data and advanced analytical techniques, radiomics holds promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in pediatric dental trauma care. However, our current study is a preliminary investigation, and larger and multicenter datasets are still necessary to further validate and generalize the findings.
