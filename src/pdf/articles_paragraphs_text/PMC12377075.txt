Gaillardia pulchella, an annual Asteraceae herb native to tropical America, is widely cultivated in China for its vibrant blooms and long flowering period. The species exhibited notable biological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We presented the first complete chloroplast genome ofG. pulchella, spanning 151,778 bp with an overall GC content of 37.7%, and containing 128 genes (85 protein-coding genes, 35 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes). Phylogenetic analysis revealed its close relationship withGalinsoga parviflora,Tagetes erecta, andFlaveria bidentis. This study provided valuable genomic insights for evolutionary studies, and potential pharmaceutical applications ofG. pulchella.

Gaillardia pulchellais an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, which is native to tropical America and is widely cultivated in China as an ornamental species. In addition to their horticultural value,G. pulchellahas been reported to contain bioactive compounds, including sesquiterpene derivatives (Kupchan et al.1966; Yu et al.1988) and phenolic compounds such as flavones (Moharram et al.2017). These compounds exhibit various pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects (Inayama et al.1984; Harimaya and Inayama1990).

Despite its medicinal potential, comprehensive genomic investigations ofG. pulchellaremain scarce. Although several nuclear and chloroplast genome markers (e.g.ndhF andtrnL-trnF) are accessible in GenBank, a complete chloroplast genome has not been documented to date. Chloroplast genomes are instrumental in phylogenetic reconstruction, species identification, and evolutionary analysis owing to their conserved structure and maternal mode of inheritance. Accordingly, the present study aims to sequence and annotate the complete chloroplast genome ofG. pulchella, thereby supporting future research on its genetic diversity, evolutionary affiliations, and prospective applications in medicine and agriculture.

The fresh leaves used for sequencing were obtained from Peony District, Heze City, Shandong Province, China (35°18’55.37′’N, 115°30’38.77′’E) (Figure 1), and a sample was deposited in the Heze University Herbarium (contact person: Hongqin Li,463056627@qq.com) under specimen number HZ20220809.

Leaves alternate, variable in shape (oblong, lanceolate, or spatulate); leaf margins entire or pinnately lobed at base; terminal capitulum with long peduncles; ligulate flowers yellow with brownish-purple bases; flower apices with 2–3 teeth; achenes hairy at base. Panel A: whole plant panorama, panel B: top-down view of the capitulum.

Whole genomic DNA was extracted using the Plant Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was fragmented into about 300 bp short-insert fragments to construct sequencing libraries, which were subsequently sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at Wuhan Benagen Technology Company Limited, Wuhan, China. Trimmomatic (v0.35) (Bolger et al.2014) with default settings was employed to filter raw reads by removing adapters and low-quality bases. Following quality control, about 24 GB of clean reads were assembled using GetOrganelle (v1.7.1) (Jin et al.2020). The complete chloroplast genome was annotated using the online tool CPGAVAS2 (Shi et al.2019) and manually refined using Apollo (Pontius2018). The annotated chloroplast genome was subsequently submitted to GenBank under the accession numberOR124734. The CPGview tool was applied to visualize the circular genome map of the newly assembled chloroplast genome (Liu et al.2023).

To investigate the phylogenetic position ofG. pulchella, the chloroplast genomes of 18 species of the Asteraceae were downloaded from the GenBank database. In addition, the outgroup wasNymphaea tetragona. The entire chloroplast genome sequence was aligned using MAFFT software with default parameters (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) (Katoh and Standley2016). A maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was subsequently constructed using IQ-TREE (v2.0) (Nguyen et al.2015) with the best-fit model of TVM+G4, along with 1000 bootstrap replicates.

TheG. pulchellachloroplast genome sequence spans 151,778 bp and displays a typical quadripartite structure. Compared to the chloroplast genome ofArabidopsis thaliana, a structural rearrangement has occurred in this species’chloroplast genome (Figure S1). The genome comprises two IR regions of 25,002 bp each, separated by a large LSC region of 83,527 bp and a small SSC region of 18,247 bp (Figure 2). The chloroplast genome exhibits variable GC content, with an overall GC content of 37.7%. The assembled complete chloroplast genome shows an average sequencing depth of 915.55×, with a minimum of 182× and a maximum of 1375× (Figure S2). The IR regions have the highest GC content at 43.1%, followed by the LSC and SSC regions at 35.8% and 31.2%, respectively. TheG. pulchellachloroplast genome is predicted to encode 128 genes, including 85 protein-coding genes (PCGs), eight rRNA genes, and 35 tRNA genes. Within the IR regions, six unique PCGs (rps12,rps7,rpl2,rpl23,ndhB, andycf2), seven uniquetrnA genes (trnM,trnL,trnV,trnE,trnA,trnR, andtrnN), and four unique rRNA genes (rrn16S,rrn23S,rrn4.5S,rrn5S) were identified. Across the chloroplast genome, ten PCGs (rps16,rpoC1,atpF,petB,petD,rpoA,rpl16,rpl2,ndhB, andndhA) each contain one intron, while two PCGs (ycf3,clpP) contain two introns. In addition, five tRNA genes (trnH-GUG,trnK-UUU,trnQ-UUG,trnS-GCU, andtrnC-GCA,trnD-GUC, andtrnY-GUA) contain one intron. Therps12 gene was subjected to trans-splicing. The structures of the cis-splicing and trans-splicing PCG genes are shown inFigure S3andFigure S4, respectively. The lengths of the protein-coding genes, tRNA genes, and rRNA genes in the chloroplast genome are 2,8456 bp, 3,831 bp, and 9,273 bp, accounting for 18.7%, 2.5%, and 6.1% of the total genome length, respectively.

The complete chloroplast genome ofGaillardia pulchella. The map contains six tracks. From the center outward, the first track displays the dispersed repeats. The second track shows long tandem repeats as short blue bars. The third track shows short tandem repeats or microsatellite sequences as short bars with different colors. The small single-copy (SSC), inverted repeat (IRA and IRB), and large single-copy (LSC) regions are shown on the fourth track. The GC content along the genome is plotted on the fifth track. The genes are shown on the sixth track. Genes belonging to different functional groups are color-coded. Genes on the inside and outside of the map are transcribed in clockwise and counterclockwise directions, respectively.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed thatG. pulchellaclustered into a monophyletic group withGalinsoga parviflora,Tagetes erecta, andFlaveria bidentis(Figure 3). This clade received maximum bootstrap support (100%), confirming its close evolutionary relationship.

This study provides the first detailed characterization of the genome ofG. pulchella, revealing a typical annular tetrad structure measuring 151,778 bp and comprising 128 predicted genes. A structural rearrangement event was identified within the chloroplast genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated thatG. pulchella,Galinsoga parviflora,Tagetes erecta, andFlaveria bidentisform a robustly supported monophyletic clade within the Asteraceae. This clustering is consistent with recent molecular phylogenetic investigations based on chloroplast DNA markers (e.g.ndhF andtrnL-trnF) and nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences, which consistently place these genera within the Heliantheae alliance—a lineage defined by radiate capitula and conserved mechanisms regulating floral symmetry (Chen et al.2018). The chloroplast genome analysis ofG. pulchellafurther reinforces its taxonomic placement within the Asteraceae. Accordingly, the phylogenetic results offer a reliable depiction of the evolutionary position ofG. pulchella.
