Undocumented immigrant women often face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, which can adversely affect their health outcomes. This scoping review aims to identify the main challenges and enabling factors to undocumented immigrant women’s health service utilization and evaluate the methodological quality of existing qualitative studies on this topic.

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and ProQuest were searched until the end of April 2024. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Checklist. The eligible studies must explore perspectives of undocumented immigrant women themselves, healthcare providers or both, as long as findings relate to women’s access challenges and enabling factors. Thematic analysis was employed to synthesize the collected data.

In total, 3,339 records retrieved, 1,537 screened, and 35 studies included. Common barriers identified include fear of deportation, language barriers, economic constraints, and discriminatory practices by healthcare providers. Facilitators include strong social networks, community support, free or low-cost clinics, outreach programs, and policies ensuring confidentiality and non-discrimination. Most of the included studies achieving high scores (8–10) based on the CASP checklist.

Undocumented immigrant women face considerable challenges in accessing healthcare services due to personal and institutional barriers. However, accessible community services and inclusive healthcare policies can significantly enhance their access to healthcare. These findings highlight an urgent need for policy reform and the effective implementation of culturally sensitive healthcare services to address these barriers.

Undocumented immigrants are people who reside in a country without a valid residence permit [1]. While some undocumented immigrants may stay in the host country briefly, many stay for decades [2]. Globally, they generally hold an uncertain legal status with few entitlements in their host countries [3]. Undocumented immigrants face various challenges such as the high cost of healthcare, a lack of health literacy, transportation problems, restricted medical rights, fear of police, inadequate language skills, and a lack of connections with locals, all of which hinder their access to care. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in healthcare utilization and a decline in their self-reported health [4,5].

Research revealed that undocumented immigrants frequently underutilize various healthcare services, and when they do receive care, it frequently falls short or is insufficient [6]. Immigration experience and legal status are central to creating the described web of interlocking needs, reliable access to healthcare, protection from deportation, living wages, freedom from domestic violence, and access to stable housing and transportation, which affected people’s ability to seek and receive medical care in different ways [7]. They typically come from low-income countries [8], have high levels of poverty and low incomes [9], and their legal healthcare access is even more restricted.

Immigration- and enforcement-related laws have had a significant and detrimental impact on the health and well-being of undocumented immigrants [10]. They are particularly susceptible to certain infectious diseases, occupational health hazards, injuries, poor mental health, and issues with the health of mothers and children due to migration patterns, demographic profiles, experiences during migration, high-risk behaviors, socioeconomic conditions, and limited access to health services [11,12]. They may have a relatively higher burden of preexisting diseases and wait longer before seeking medical care [13,14].

Undocumented immigrants typically avoided hospital care unless they were unconscious or critically ill, leading to poor outcomes and avoidable deaths [15]. Access to emergency care, medical supplies, treatment for chronic and mental health conditions, and maternity and infant care is uneven for undocumented immigrants [16]. These immigrants may not have the financial means to pay for health services, may not possess the language and cultural competency to navigate healthcare systems, or may face discrimination [17].

Undocumented immigrants, especially pregnant women, are a particularly vulnerable group of immigrants. Undocumented women experience poorer health outcomes and underutilize critical maternity and child health services [18]. Undocumented women have complained about high abortion rates, low use of contraceptives, scannable sexually transmitted infections, and inadequate access to gynecological and sexual health care [19]. Undocumented women accessed antenatal care less frequently and later, resulting in fewer control visits and fewer auxiliary tests [20]. Undocumented pregnant women were five weeks later than the control group to have their first clinical consultation and were more likely to give birth at home than documented ethnic minority mothers [21]. Undocumented status may increase the likelihood of unfavorable pregnancy outcomes for immigrant and refugee women as well as reduce their access to prenatal care [22].

Although the empirical literature specifically addressing undocumented immigrant women’s access to healthcare is limited, varied across countries, healthcare systems, and sociopolitical environments. Despite this growing body of research, no prior review has brought these findings together. In the past decade, a number of systematic reviews have examined healthcare access among immigrant populations, including undocumented immigrant [6,11,17,23]. Two studies have addressed access more broadly across immigrant groups [13,19], while others have explored barriers in specific contexts such as Europe [18,24] or focused on service types like maternal health [25] or emergency care [26]. However, a key limitation of these reviews is that undocumented immigrants are often subsumed within larger, less specific immigrant populations and do not focus on the health of undocumented women specifically. To our knowledge, there have been no reviews that qualitatively synthesized peer-reviewed literature that uniquely focused on undocumented immigrant women’s experiences to access healthcare. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review is to systematically map and synthesize qualitative evidence on the challenges and enabling factors influencing undocumented immigrant women’s access to healthcare services, in order to inform the design of targeted, gender-sensitive, and context-specific interventions.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was considered in developing and writing the scoping review [27].

We chose to conduct a scoping review following Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) foundational framework [28], later refined by Levac et al. (2010) [29] and the JBI methodology (Peters et al., 2015) [30], as our aim was to comprehensively map the existing qualitative evidence on healthcare access among undocumented immigrant women. Given the heterogeneity of the literature and the lack of previous syntheses on this specific population, a scoping review was deemed the most appropriate approach (Tricco et al., 2018) [27]. Arksey and O’Malley’s approach includes five main steps, which are: (1) identifying the research questions; (2) finding the relevant studies; (3) selecting the final studies; (4) charting the extracted data; and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the findings. The institutional review board (IRB) of Shiraz University of Medical Science reviewed the protocol of this study before it began and approved it after making the necessary corrections (No. 26627).

We considered two components of the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, and Research Type) framework, including the phenomena of interest (undocumented immigrants) and the research type (qualitative research), when developing search strings. Scientific evidence has demonstrated the greater reliability of this search framework for locating qualitative evidence [31]. To identify comprehensive search keywords, we used a combination of MeSH and Emtree thesauri, consulted relevant experts, and reviewed terms frequently used in prior qualitative studies. To sum up, a number of terms were adapted, including “undocumented immigrant,” “irregular immigrant,” “unofficial immigrant,” “illegal immigrant,” “undocumented alien,” “unauthorized immigrants,” women, women, girls, “qualitative research,” “qualitative study,” and “qualitative evidence.” Supplementary Table1indicates the developed search strings for different electronic databases. We first created search strings for the PubMed database and then adapted them for other databases.

All the search results of electronic databases and other sources were entered into the Endnote X9 software (Clarivate, London, United Kingdom), and after removing duplicates, the remaining items were screened by two authors (S.SH. and M.E.) independently based on the title and abstract. The same two authors evaluated the full texts of potentially relevant studies in the next step, using the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select the final studies. Any disagreement among the authors was resolved through discussion and the participation of other members of the research team (M.H. and K.B.L.).

The eligible studies must explore perspectives of undocumented immigrant women themselves, healthcare providers or both, as long as findings relate to women’s access barriers and facilitators. The inclusion criteria were: (1) studies with a qualitative design; (2) in English; (3) published in peer-reviewed journals; (4) explored the perspectives of different groups regarding the use of health services by undocumented immigrant women; and (5) availability of full text. Selecting qualitative studies allows for deep exploration of nuanced, lived experiences and sociocultural barriers/facilitators that quantitative or mixed-methods studies may overlook. Also, the global inclusion was intentional to allow a comparative understanding of structural and cultural determinants. On the other hand, we included the exclusion criteria. The exclusion criteria include: (1) non-qualitative studies; (2) conference papers and protocol studies; (3) qualitative studies that did not focus on the barriers and facilitators of utilizing health services by undocumented immigrant women; (4) non-English papers; and (5) the absence of full text availability. Studies with mixed-gender samples were included only if the findings were disaggregated for women or if the analysis specifically addressed gendered barriers or facilitators.

Two authors (S.SH and M.H.) independently carried out the data extraction process. All members of the research team participated in preparing a form for data extraction. The items of this form were: (1) author name; (2) publication year; (3) participants; (4) sampling strategy; (5) country of origin; (6) data collection method; (7) interview format; (8) analysis approach; (9) summary of findings; and (10) funding source. Similar to previous stages, the research team resolved any disagreement among the authors through discussion and the participation of other authors.

We applied the Qualitative Checklist of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies [32]. This tool consists of three main sections (Section A: Are the results valid?, Section B: What are the results?, and Section C: Will the results help locally?) and ten questions. Three authors (S.SH, M.E., and M.H.) independently evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. If the desired item was fully considered in the study, the answer was “yes.” However, in cases where adherence to the item in the study was incomplete or nonexistent, the answer was “unclear/can’t tell” and “no,” respectively. At this stage, the expert author (K.B.L.) participated in discussions to resolve disagreements.

We employed a thematic analysis approach to analyze the qualitative findings [33]. Two authors independently extracted text summaries, including barriers and facilitators of utilizing health services, from the included studies. We then repeatedly reviewed these findings, categorizing them into a series of sub-themes by examining their differences and similarities. The emerged sub-themes, including barriers and facilitators, were assigned to each component of the analytical framework for immigrant health service utilization established by Yang & Hwang (2016) (Fig.1). We chose this theoretical framework because it offers the necessary opportunity to fully understand the process of immigrants benefiting from health services.

3339 documents were found in the initial search of relevant databases. 1537 studies were reviewed based on the title and abstract after duplicates were eliminated. Following a comprehensive text evaluation of 90 studies, 35 qualitative studies [26,34–67] were ultimately included in the analysis. The majority of relevant studies were published in the last two decades. The PRISMA flow chart showing the search results and research selection procedure is shown in Fig.2. A summary of the excluded studies and the rationale behind their exclusion can be found in Supplementary Table2. As shown, many excluded studies either lacked gender specificity, qualitative design, or did not report barriers/facilitators. This illustrates the paucity of focused research on the vulnerable population.

This scoping review included 35 qualitative studies conducted in 10 countries. High-income countries accounted for the majority of the studies (88.6%). United States (51.4%,n= 18) [26,35–37,41,44–46,49,50,52,54,58,59,63,64,66,67], Sweden (2.9%,n= 1) [65], Denmark (5.7%,n= 2) [47,58], Spain (14.3%,n= 5) [42,43,48,51,56], Canada (2.9%,n= 1) [53], Netherlands (8.6%,n= 3) [38–40], and Taiwan (2.9%,n= 1) [34]. Middle-income countries such as Iran (5.7%,n= 2) [60,62], Colombia (2.9%,n= 1) [55], Costa Rica (2.9%,n= 1) [61] conducted a smaller portion of studies (11.4%). Table1provides a detailed summary of the characteristics of the included studies.

Table2displays the results of the methodological evaluation of the included studies. All studies met more than 90% of the CASP criteria, indicating a high-quality status. The lowest adherence was to ethical considerations (Question 7), with 82.8% compliance. Most studies scored highly on CASP criteria, demonstrating strong methodological rigor (Fig.3). For example, several studies met 9.5–10 criteria, including Armenta & Sarabia (2020), Fabi & Taylor (2019), and Vesely et al. (2021), indicating high credibility of the extracted data.

Table3presents the identified barriers to the utilization of health services by undocumented immigrant women, as outlined in the theoretical framework for immigrant health service utilization. We identified four categories of determinants: (A1) macro-structural or contextual factors, representing general socio-structural factors in the larger society beyond individual control; (A2) predisposing factors, signifying propensity for health service utilization in terms of demographic, socioeconomic, and genetic factors, and health beliefs; (A3) resources, representing ability to receive and/or access health services; and (A4) need for health care, indicating motivations for health services.

Table4demonstrates the suggested facilitators to utilizing health services by undocumented immigrant women under the theoretical framework for immigrant health service utilization. Several social-level interventions were identified as key facilitators. Firstly, informing health providers about the socio-legal status of immigrants through formal training helped reduce discriminatory behavior and improve provider-patient communication. Secondly, social support programs from government and NGOs—such as housing aid, language classes, or employment assistance—contributed to improved access by reducing social isolation. Finally, peer-to-peer communication within immigrant communities acted as an effective tool for disseminating accurate health information, especially in low-literacy groups. These strategies collectively strengthen immigrants’ sense of belonging and trust in health systems.

The synthesis of the included studies revealed significant regional and temporal variations in the reported barriers and facilitators.

High-income countries (e.g., Germany, Canada, UK, USA) reported barriers predominantly related to legal status, language, and institutional discrimination. In these settings, restrictive immigration policies and complex insurance systems were major impediments to accessing healthcare. In contrast, studies from middle-income countries such as Iran, Turkey, and Mexico highlighted different challenges including lack of transportation, limited service infrastructure, and high out-of-pocket expenses. Interestingly, in some Middle Eastern countries, cultural proximity between host and immigrant communities occasionally facilitated access (e.g., shared language or religion), which was rarely the case in Western settings.

Studies conducted prior to 2010 mainly focused on structural barriers such as insurance exclusion and language difficulties. However, research conducted after 2015—particularly post-COVID-19—showed an increasing focus on psychological barriers, such as fear of deportation, mistrust in healthcare systems, and digital exclusion due to a lack of internet access or digital literacy. The emergence of mobile health initiatives and culturally tailored outreach programs was more evident in recent studies, reflecting global shifts toward equity-oriented health interventions.

We categorised the main barriers and facilitators to health services utilisation among the undocumented immigrant women as contextual conditions, predisposing factors, resources, and need for health care. Common barriers identified in this study include fear of deportation, language barriers, economic constraints, and discriminatory practices by healthcare providers. Strong social networks, community support, free or low-cost clinics, outreach programmes, and policies ensuring confidentiality and non-discrimination were the main facilitators to access health services among this group.

Osuide and colleagues have indicated that when trying to receive this care, pregnant undocumented immigrants face numerous challenges, such as fear of deportation, lack of legal rights to healthcare, uneasiness when visiting public healthcare facilities, difficulty communicating in languages other than their native tongue, and severe financial hardship [23]. Undocumented women may not be able to access social or health services due to fear and discrimination, as well as harsh living and working conditions [68]. These obstacles cause people to put off getting medical attention, turn to other methods of finding health care, and ignore small illnesses, all of which can result in more significant issues [69].

In the current study, fear of deportation has been identified as a pervasive barrier that prevents many women from seeking necessary medical care. The fear of deportation also can affect their social roles by preventing them from working, which increased their level of economic instability. Avoiding authority has an impact on the obstacles these women encounter when trying to obtain services and engage freely in their duties as mothers and carers [70,71]. Because of the ongoing danger of deportation and its association with feelings of living in the shadows, imprisonment, seclusion, confinement, entrapment, and limitation, it can be characterized as an anticipatory stressor that may turn into a chronic stressor [72]. Women face obstacles when they live in fear of deportation, which keeps them from calling the police when they are the victims of abuse or crime or from getting access to services, including those for their children [72,73]. The fear of losing access to health care in the event of a positive test is a common reason why uninsured and undocumented immigrant hesitate to undergo HIV testing [74].

Challenges in communication further hinder access to healthcare. The main obstacles to undocumented immigrant women’s access to health services were poor health literacy and communication difficulties. The language barrier in their new country makes it difficult for immigrant women to communicate with healthcare providers, obtain information on how to navigate the health care system, and understanding invitations to screening programs [75].

Lack of financial resources and health insurance severely limit undocumented immigrant’ ability to afford healthcare services. Fourteen studies found financial constraints to be one of the most critical barriers to access to health services among undocumented immigrant women. Undocumented immigrants’ healthcare costs, transportation problems and a lack of health literacy all have an effect on access to care [76]. According to a survey conducted in France among State Medical Aid claimants, 21% of undocumented women stop receiving care due to financial constraints [24].

Even when people are entitled to healthcare, there are still obstacles that can be systemically discriminatory and hinder timely health seeking, including unstable legal status and marginalization, false information, unfriendly healthcare facilities, and social surroundings [77]. Complex healthcare policies and procedures create additional obstacles to accessing health services. Martinez identified bureaucratic requirements as a barrier to receiving care among undocumented immigrants [78].

The most common women’s needs in our findings were the need for psychological or mental health services [41,46,51]. To effectively address mental health disparities among undocumented people, behavioral health interventions should take into account causes of stress from discriminatory events, expectations of rejection, and the use of concealment as a defense mechanism [79]. Immigration rules exert control over the bodies of undocumented women by limiting their freedom of movement and their ability to obtain healthcare, which has an impact on their general well-being. If all undocumented immigrants, regardless of gender, are affected by a lack of public healthcare coverage, then economic hardship places extra hurdles on women [80].

Our findings revealed that strong social networks, community support, free or low-cost clinics, outreach programs, and policies ensuring confidentiality and non-discrimination are facilitators of health service utilization for undocumented women. Non-governmental organizations’ efforts to provide healthcare and education are crucial facilitators. We should offer community outreach and legal services to undocumented families who may be facing exploitation or coercion. Healthcare settings particularly require community resources and culturally appropriate services. Undocumented people often prefer healthcare delivered through community-based organizations, particularly those that offer services regardless of identification [81].

Moreover, hospitals should, in addition to formal rules, use hospital signage, community outreach, and collaborations with reliable civil society organizations and local, community-based organizations to express their acceptance and support for undocumented immigrants [73]. Moreover, to address the fear that undocumented immigrants may not seek health care if it requires driving to distant locations and risks deportation, providers can choose to send trailers outfitted with diagnostic and preventive tests, like cancer screenings, to places where they feel secure, like their own neighborhoods [82].

In addition to lowering the cost of accessing essential medical goods and health services, subsidies may encourage immigrants who might otherwise be reluctant to pay out of their pockets [25]. To meet the requirements of undocumented immigrants, the current safety net must be expanded. This involved building more public and free medical facilities, especially for obstetrics and preventive care for mothers and children [83], in the countries without such facilities and improving the capacities in the context that do. In addition, it is important for a public health approach to mental health to consider whether undocumented immigrants are aware of the resources available to them. Hospitals and primary healthcare and emergency departments should present informational leaflets in many languages with relevant offers [84].

Policies that protect the privacy and confidentiality of undocumented women encourage them to seek care. Therefore, Because undocumented immigrants face deportation, it is important to remind health authorities and professionals of their commitment of confidentiality [84,85]. In order to eradicate discrimination in healthcare environments, healthcare practitioners and providers should create and execute more inclusive policies [78]. Professional associations and individuals ought to champion the cause of expanding equitable and comprehensive access to healthcare in accordance with human rights commitments and goals [86]. Establishing healthcare services that are linguistically and culturally appropriate for undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers is crucial. Offering language translation services and educating healthcare professionals in cultural competency should be part of this endeavor [87].

Strong support systems help women navigate the healthcare system and access needed services. Support groups conducted by licensed mental health professionals or peer-led healing circles are examples of group mental health settings that may be advantageous to the mental health of undocumented individuals and may help reduce some of the psychological barriers that prevent them from accessing official services [88]. Our study identifies health education, prevention, and medical advice as crucial facilitators for undocumented immigrant women to access health services. We recommend explicitly granting undocumented immigrants access to preventive and curative health care services in primary care [69]. The “trap of illegality” must be broken to promote the health of immigrant women. The impact of being viewed as “illegal” should also be taken into account as a social determinant of health, even in situations where it is legal to receive services [56].

To address the barriers to health services for undocumented immigrant women we need to take a context specific approach that addresses the barriers across the context, predisposing factors, resources and health needs. Key barriers identified are fear of deportation, economic constraints, language barriers and discriminatory practice. Ensuring confidentiality and the absence of immigration enforcement in healthcare settings is essential and should be clearly communicated to build trust.

Culturally and linguistically appropriate care through interpreters and culturally competent providers is key to making health services accessible to this group. Free or low-cost clinics and mobile programs must be supported especially for women in underserved areas. Community-based organizations and social networks play a crucial role in building trust and providing support.

Most of the results from this study come from high income countries with more developed healthcare systems and different immigration policies so the barriers and facilitators may be specific to those countries. Interventions developed from high income countries cannot be directly applied to middle income settings. We need to consider local cultural context, legal entitlements, service availability and community resources. This means context specific strategies co-designed with local stakeholders to ensure interventions work in different settings.

This review advances existing knowledge by offering a novel, systematic, and structured synthesis into the barriers and facilitators to health service use among undocumented immigrant women globally. It provides a more cohesive and comprehensive framework than the piecemeal, anecdotal or illustrative stories found throughout the literature. It points to the gendered nature of undocumented legal status, the vulnerability of undocumented women to care access (caregiving responsibilities, reproductive health care needs, and discrimination) and introduces a comparative perspective by bringing in studies from high- and middle-income countries to demonstrate the varied ways access to health services is shaped by legal and policy contexts.

This review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, it is based exclusively on qualitative studies, which, while offering rich insights into lived experiences, may not fully capture the breadth and prevalence of challenges faced by undocumented immigrant women. The inclusion of quantitative studies could have enhanced the generalizability of the findings. Second, the studies span diverse geographical and cultural contexts, each with unique healthcare systems and immigration policies, which may limit the applicability of the results across all settings. Third, the review includes only published, peer-reviewed literature, potentially introducing publication bias and excluding valuable insights from grey or unpublished sources. Fourth, studies published in languages other than English were excluded, which may have resulted in the omission of relevant research from non-English-speaking regions. Fifth, methodological variations among the included studies—such as differences in qualitative approaches, data collection techniques, and analytical frameworks—may have influenced the consistency and comparability of the findings. Lastly, the studies encompass a broad publication timeline, and evolving healthcare policies and societal attitudes toward undocumented immigrants over time may affect the current relevance of earlier findings. Recognizing these limitations highlights the need for future research that integrates diverse methodologies, broader language inclusion, and temporal and regional analyses to provide a more comprehensive understanding of healthcare access for undocumented immigrant women.

This scoping review contributes novel insight by being the first to qualitatively synthesize challenges and enabling factors specific to undocumented immigrant women. Through a gendered lens and a global scope, the study identifies the layered vulnerability of this group and the complex interplay of legal, structural, financial, and social challenges. The findings provide a framework for future research and inform policies that prioritize gender-sensitive, culturally competent, and legally inclusive health interventions.
