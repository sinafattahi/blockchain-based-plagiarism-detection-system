Pre‐invasive cervical lesion typically progresses for a considerable amount of time before developing into cervical cancer (CC). Consequently, early detection and treatment of cervical cancer at the pre‐invasive stage may be advantageous to the patients and lessen the burden of morbidity and mortality from the disease. Our country has limited studies on Precancerous Cervical Lesions (PCCL).

To assess the prevalence and associated factors of precancerous cervical lesions among HIV‐positive and negative women in Debre Birhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.

An institutional‐based comparative cross‐sectional study was conducted from July/2021 to June/2023 among 522 women attending cervical cancer screening at Debre Birhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. All records during the study period were collected using a structured data extraction checklist. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with pre‐cancerous cervical lesions.

The overall prevalence of pre‐cancerous cervical lesions was 8% (95% CI: 5.6–10.5. The prevalence of pre‐cancerous cervical lesions in HIV‐positive was 5.4% (95% CI: 2.8–.1) and in HIV‐negative women 10.7% (95% CI: 5.6–8.1). Women with lifetime sexual partner ≥ 2 (AOR = 3.84, 95% CI: 1.06–3.97), who have a history of STI (AOR = 5.66, 95% CI: 1.50–21.41) and women with age ≥ 45 years (AOR = 4.22, 95% CI: 1.21–14.76) were contributing factors of a PCCL for HIV‐positive women. In addition, women with a history of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) (AOR = 6.51, 95% CI: 2.11–0.09) and who have a lifetime sexual partner ≥ 2 (AOR = 8.4, 95% CI: 2.85–4.79) were statistically significant association with pre‐cancerous cervical lesion for HIV‐negative women.

The overall prevalence of pre‐cancerous cervical lesions was found to be low in this study relative to the national prevalence. However, strengthening routine screening of women for pre‐cancerous cervical lesions and behavioural change communication on risk factors is very important.

Cervical cancer (CC) typically develops after a prolonged phase of pre‐invasive lesions in the cervix, where abnormal cervical cells start to grow uncontrollably, eventually forming a tumour [1]. Sexually transmitted HPV types fall into two groups: low‐risk and high‐risk. High‐risk HPVs can cause several types of cancer. Low‐risk HPV types rarely cause cancer, although a few low‐risk HPV types can cause warts on or around the genitals, anus, mouth, or throat. In the transformation zone of the cervix, long‐term HPV infection leads to significant changes in the epithelial cells, causing them to develop abnormally [2]. It could take 10 years or longer for precancerous conditions of the cervix to progress to cervical cancer if treatment is not received [3]. Early detection and treatment of cervical cancer at the pre‐invasive stage can significantly benefit patients, reducing both the burden of morbidity and the risk of mortality associated with the disease [4].

Cervical invasive malignancies are often preceded by a prolonged pre‐invasive phase that can be detected early through various screening methods, including cervical cytology, visual inspection, and HPV testing. In low‐ and middle‐income countries, the “screen‐and‐treat” approach is a common alternative due to limited resources, a shortage of skilled personnel, long waiting times for cytology results, and the need for referrals to distant health facilities for diagnostic and treatment services [5]. In immunocompromised patients, precancerous cervical lesions (PCCL) and cervical cancer are believed to progress more rapidly. Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer‐related deaths among women in sub‐Saharan Africa, where it coexists with the ongoing HIV epidemic [6].

Cervical cancer is a leading HPV‐associated disease, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality among women in sub‐Saharan Africa, where it remains the primary cause of cancer‐related deaths. Over the next 20 years, cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the region are expected to increase due to limited access to adequate preventive services and the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic [7].

Despite the severity of cervical cancer and PCCL in both HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative women, limited research has been conducted comparing their conditions based on HIV status. This study aims to provide essential data that can inform efforts to prevent cervical cancer through screening and early detection of PCCL, enabling timely treatment and reducing risk factors that predispose women to these lesions, regardless of their HIV status. The findings will offer valuable insights to enhance prevention strategies, helping women avoid risk factors that lead to PCCL. Policymakers can use this information to mitigate the risks of developing these lesions, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality from advanced cervical cancer.

This study was conducted at Debre Birhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Ethiopia, which serves over 3 million people with a staff of 744 and 171 beds. The hospital began providing cervical cancer screening services in 2016 and currently has four trained staff members assigned to this service.

An institution‐based comparative cross‐sectional study was conducted among HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative women attending cervical cancer screening. The study took place from July 2021 to June 2023, with a review of participant medical records dating back 2 years.

All women screened for PCCL used as the source population and selected using a random sampling technique who visited Debre Birhan Comprehensive Specialized Hospital for Cervical Cancer Screening Service used as the study population. Out of the hospital′s 2‐year cervical cancer screening data (totalling 1967), identified 629 HIV‐positive women and 1338 HIV‐negative women. A sample of 261 women was then selected from both groups using a simple random sampling technique for comparison (Figure1).

A standardized data extraction sheet, aligned with medical records and registers, was prepared in English. Data were manually extracted from the medical records of women screened for cervical cancer over 1 week. The extraction sheet included socio‐demographic details, reproductive and sexual health information, as well as behavioural and clinical data.

The collected data were coded and entered into EPI‐data version 4.6.0.5, then exported and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 27.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence and determinants of PCCL Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PCCL. Its primary rationale is the ability to handle nonlinear relationships and to obtain the odds ratio in the presence of multiple explanatory variables. Variables with a p‐value of ≤ 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression. In the final model, ap‐value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The model′s goodness‐of‐fit was assessed using the Hosmer‐Lemeshow test, yielding ap‐value of 0.888, indicating a good fit. Multicollinearity assumptions were also checked, with a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of 2.445, confirming the model met the assumptions.

The Ethical Review Committee of Asrat Woledeyes Health Science Campus approved the study, Rer. No: IRB 01/48/2016 and protocol number IRB‐239. Data was kept anonymously by coding and the data recorded on mobile was locked with a password to maintain confidentiality. Information about specific personal identifiers like the patient′s name was not collected, so it didn′t harm the patients. All the research processes were performed and secured by the relevant guidelines and regulations. The study′s objectives were explained to the participants and their oral informed consent was obtained from all the study participants before soliciting information.

Out of the 522 women included in the study, 261 were HIV‐positive and 261 were HIV‐negative. A total of 291 participants (55.7%) resided in urban areas, and 307 women (58.8%). The mean age of the participants was 37.15 ± 9.284 years. Regarding educational status, 228 women (43.7%) were illiterate, and 330 women (63.2%) were married (Table1).

The average age at first sexual intercourse was 18.28 years (SD ± 2.728). A total of 273 participants (52.3%) had their first sexual experience before the age of 18. Among the participants, 419 (80.3%) had given birth at least once, with 355 (68%) having one to four children, and 64 (12.3%) having five or more. Meanwhile, 103 participants (19.7%) had never given birth. Regarding contraceptive use, 104 participants (19.9%) had used contraceptives, with 56 (53.8%) using pills, 38 (36.5%) using implants or injectables, and 10 (9.6%) using Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCDs) (Table2).

Of the participants screened, 457 women (87.5%) were screened for the first time, while 65 women (12.5%) had been screened before. Among these, 52 women (10%) were undergoing rescreening following a previous negative result, and 13 women (2.5%) were undergoing posttreatment screening after a last positive result for Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA). Among the 261 HIV‐positive women screened with VIA, 14 (5.4%) tested positive, while out of 261 HIV‐negative women, 28 (10.7%) tested positive for VIA. Additionally, 438 women (84%) reported no history of STIs, whereas 84 women (16%) had a history of STIs. Fifty‐three women (10%) had a partner with a history of STIs, and 65 women (12.5%) reported having two or more lifetime sexual partners, while 457 women (87.5%) had fewer than two lifetime sexual partners. No participants reported a history of smoking, alcohol intake, or chronic corticosteroid use. All HIV‐positive women screened were on Anti Retro Viral Treatment (ART).

The overall prevalence of PCCL was 8% (95% CI: 5.6–10.5). Among 261 HIV‐positive women screened for PCCL, 5.4% (95% CI: 2.8–8.1) tested positive for VIA. In contrast, among 261 HIV‐negative women, 10.7% (95% CI: 6.9–14.8) tested positive for VIA.

Residence, educational status, parity, history of STIs, partner's history of STIs, and lifetime number of sexual partners were selected from the bivariable analysis for multivariable analysis. Among these factors, a history of STIs and having two or more lifetime sexual partners were found to be associated with the occurrence of PCCL in HIV‐negative women. Women with a history of STIs were 6.5 times more likely (AOR = 6.51; 95% CI: 2.11–20.09) to develop PCCL compared to those without a history of STIs. Additionally, women with two or more lifetime sexual partners were 8.4 times more likely (AOR = 8.41; 95% CI: 2.85–24.79) to develop PCCL compared to those with fewer than two‐lifetime sexual partners (Table3). An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) in logistic regression is a measure of the association between a predictor variable and a binary outcome, controlling for the effects of other variables in the model.

Age, educational status, history of STIs, partner′s history of STIs, lifetime number of sexual partners, and age at first sexual initiation were selected from the bivariable analysis for multivariable analysis. Among these factors, age, history of STIs, and lifetime number of sexual partners were found to be associated with the occurrence of PCCL in HIV‐positive women. Women with two or more lifetime sexual partners were 3.8 times more likely (AOR = 3.84, 95% CI: 1.06–13.91) to develop PCCL compared to those with fewer than two lifetime sexual partners. Those with a history of STIs were 5.6 times more likely (AOR = 5.66, 95% CI: 1.49–21.41) to develop PCCL compared to women without a history of STIs. Additionally, women aged 45 years or older were 4 times more likely (AOR = 4.22, 95% CI: 1.21–14.76) to develop PCCL compared to women younger than 45 years (Table4).

Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis for Prevalence of Pre‐Cancerous Cervical Lesion among HIV‐positive Women at DBCSH from July 2021 to June 2023, North‐ East Ethiopia (n= 261).

In this study, the overall prevalence of PCCL among both HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative women was found to be 8% (95% CI: 5.6–10.5%), which is comparable to findings from previous studies, including Cameroon (12.2%), a tertiary hospital in Bangalore (11.2%), India (6.7%), Southwest Uganda (12%), Woldia and Dessie, Referral Hospitals in Ethiopia (9.9%), Adwa Almeda Textile Factory, Ethiopia (6.7%), Jimma Model Clinic, Ethiopia (12.9%), Tigray, Northern Ethiopia (8.9%), and Debre Tabor Hospital, Ethiopia (8.6%) [11,12,13,14,15,16,17].

In this study, HIV‐negative women had a higher prevalence of PCCL (10.7%) compared to HIV‐positive women (5.4%). This finding contrasts with a hospital‐based study from Debre Tabor, Ethiopia, where the prevalence of PCCL was 9.3% in HIV‐positive women and 8.6% in HIV‐negative women, showing a slightly higher prevalence in HIV‐positive women [13]. The discrepancy in prevalence may be attributed to differences in the demographic characteristics of the study participants, adherence to ART, and engagement in risky sexual behaviours.

A history of STIs was positively associated with PCCL among both HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative women, consistent with studies conducted in Tigray, Addis Ababa, Marie Stopes Ethiopia in Adama town, West Wellega hospitals, Southern Ethiopia, East Gojam, Almeda Textile Factory in Adwa town, Adama Hospital Medical College, and Woldia Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northeast Ethiopia. However, this contrasts with studies conducted at Mezam Polyclinic in Bamenda, Cameroon, Jimma, Saint Paul′s Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), and Woldia and Dessie Referral Hospitals, where factors such as having multiple sexual partners, high parity (more than three children), early pregnancy, early marriage, early sexual initiation, and being a commercial sex worker were associated with PCCL [10,11,17,18,19,20,21].

Having two or more lifetime sexual partners was associated with PCCL among both HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative women, consistent with findings from studies conducted at Mezam Polyclinic in Bamenda, a systematic review and meta‐analysis in Sub‐Saharan Africa, Addis Ababa, Marie Stopes Ethiopia in Adama town, Woldia and Dessie Referral Hospitals, Woldia Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, East Gojam, and Southern Ethiopia. However, this contrasts with studies from Tigray in Northern Ethiopia, Jimma, Saint Paul′s Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), and West Wellega Hospital, where factors such as a history of STIs, irregular menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, early sexual initiation, bleeding after coitus, and high parity (having more than three children) were associated with PCCL [10,13,21,22,23,24,25].

This study also found that women aged 45 years or older were more likely to be associated with PCCL. This finding aligns with studies conducted in Cameroon, Koumpentoum, Senegal, Southwest Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, East Gojam, and Sude District in the Arsi Zone of Oromia Region at Adama Hospital Medical College. However, it contrasts with studies from Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, and Debre Tabor, where older age was not associated with PCCL [10,11,13,15,21,23,25,26]. The discrepancy may be due to differences in study settings, cultural and other sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants.

The prevalence of PCCL in this study was 8%, which is lower than the findings from many other studies and the national prevalence. Women in the study developed PCCL regardless of their HIV status. Key factors associated with PCCL included having multiple lifetime sexual partners, a history of STIs, and being 45 years or older. Most women who developed PCCL typically had one or more identifiable risk factors contributing to the condition. Therefore, it is crucial to strengthen routine and thorough screening for PCCL in women, regardless of their HIV status. Screening efforts should be prioritized for women with preventable risk factors, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) while promoting behavioural change communication across the general community.
