Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) have become popular as immunotherapies
triggering an immune response achieved via their activation of the
cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING)
pathway. Many analogs of 2′3′-cGAMP, c-di-GMP, and c-di-AMP
have been developed and shown as effective cancer vaccines and immuno-stimulators
for the induction of both the adaptive and innate immune systems.
Unfortunately, these CDNs have been dosed via intratumor route, which
is not convenient, especially for tumors that are difficult to reach.
We recently introduced endo-S-CDNs as potent STING agonists but in
our prior report we did not evaluate the in vivo efficacies of these
novel STING agonists. Herein, we conduct a more extensive structure
activity relationship study as well as in vivo evaluation of our best
endo-S-CDNs. We demonstrate that endo-S-CDNs can be dosed via subcutaneous
route to provide robust protection against MC38 and B16–F10
tumor models.

Immunotherapies are promising agents for
tackling cancer and they
can be used as standalone treatment, antitumor vaccines and vaccine
adjuvants.,Although immune-checkpoint blockade inhibitors
have revolutionized cancer treatment and boosted patient survival
across broad range of cancers, only a minority of patients respond
to these therapies.−Also, both primary and secondary resistance of these
blockade inhibitors pose a major clinical challenge.−For this reason, recent immunotherapy strategies have aimed at utilizing
pathways that can alter T-cell suppressed tumor microenvironments
(TME) into T-cell-infiltrated tumors, which are more susceptible to
checkpoint blockades. The cyclic GMP-AMP
synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has
emerged as an exciting target for anticancer immunity; this pathway,
when activated, could turn ‘cold tumors’ into ‘hot
tumors’ by activating the tumor’s immunogenicity.

The cGAS-STING pathway plays an important role in sensing pathogen-associated
and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively).−Following double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) detection in the cytoplasm,
cGAS synthesizes a cyclic dinucleotide known as 2′3′-cGAMP
(structure shown inFigure) using ATP and GTP as substrates. 2′3′-cGAMP
has a unique 2′-5′ phosphodiester linkage mixed with
a conventional 3′–5′ phosphodiester linkage.,Binding of 2′3′-cGAMP to STING in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) leads to a conformational change, where the C-terminal
CDN binding domain (CTD) revolves relative to the N-terminal transmembrane
domain (NTD) subsequently engulfing 2′3′-cGAMP. This conformational change triggers STING’s
polymerization and eventual translocation from the ER to the Golgi
apparatus where it recruits other downstream effectors via the tank
binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase
(IKK). This leads to the production of
type I interferons (IFNs) as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines
via activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB).

Type I IFNs are well established for promoting
robust antitumor,
antibacterial, and antiviral immunity. There is enormous evidence
that suggest innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) produce
type I IFNs and play a pivotal role in cancer immunosurveillance.
Also, type I IFN-controlled antitumor immunity is dependent on an
intact STING signaling pathway within the DC population. Therefore, STING agonism provides a platform
in developing immunotherapies, which could elicit robust and durable
antitumor immunity. In collaboration with Gravekamp’s group,
we were among the first to demonstrate that c-di-GMP, the bacterial-derived
CDN, activated STING in vivo to reduce 4T1 proliferation as well as
improving vaccination against a model of metastatic breast cancer.

Indeed, CDN administered on its own or
in combination with other
therapies, such as checkpoint blockade, chimera antigen receptor T
cells (CAR-T cells) and radiation, has shown efficacious and synergistic
antitumor immunity.−However, poor cell permeability and rapid hydrolysis by plasma phosphodiesterases
(PDEs) drastically hinders 2′3′-cGAMP’s in vivo
utility. Hence, many synthetic 2′3′-cGAMP
analogs, which harbor PDE-resistant linkages, have been developed
with improved ADME properties.,−Although these analogs have shown in vivo efficacy, majority of
them are administered by intratumor injection, where these STING agonists
are delivered directly to the tumor site.,−Drawbacks of intratumor administration include: (i) its limitation
to patient population, (ii) excessive
leakage of CDNs from tumors into systemic circulation demonstrating
off-target hyperinflammation, and (iii)
the risk of overdosing a particular area where it was administered,
leading to an ablative effect in immune cells. In order to address these challenges we became interested
in developing CDN-based STING agonists that could be systemically
administered. This could alleviate the burden of cost, technical expertise
needed, and risk of infection during administration. We previously
reported endo-S-cGAFMP (3) and endo-S-cGALMP (4) as potent STING agonists, which are stable to
clinically relevant phosphodiesterases like ectonucleotide phosphodiesterase
I (ENPP1) and poxvirus immune nucleases (poxin). Herein, we explore
a more thorough structural activity relationship (SAR) of the first-generation
endo-S-CDNs, focusing on both 2′3′-CDNs and 3′3′-CDNs,
and evaluate the best analogs activity and in vivo efficacy in MC-38
and B16–F10 tumor models.

Interestingly, most CDN-based
STING agonists in clinical development
as immuno-oncology agents (for example ADU-S100, E7766, MK-1454, and
BI 7446 shown inFigure) contain an exophosphorothioate modification, where a nonbridging
oxygen is replaced with sulfur. Notwithstanding
their effectiveness, this strategy produces a new P-chiral center
that is difficult to set and hence pose significant challenges in
purifying the synthesized diastereomers, leading to low synthetic
yields. Also, desulfurization of exophosphorothioate oligonucleotides
is prevalent during the cleavage and deprotection step using either
solid phase or solution phase synthesis (under aqueous ammonia in
the presence of trace amounts of Fe2+, Ni2+,
or Cr3+), and occurs readily in aqueous solution.,Hence, novel CDNs that are easier to synthesize with better synthetic
yields and retaining potency are highly desirable. Our group has previously
explored the synthesis of endo-S-CDN analogs where a 5′-bridging
oxygen of a phosphodiester is replaced with sulfur.,,,The phosphorus
on these endo-S-CDNs lacks chirality, hence alleviate the purification
and yield concerns posed by exophosphorothiate CDNs. We have shown
that such atomic editing confers cleavage resistance to phosphodiesterases
that degrade phosphodiester-containing cyclic dinucleotides.,We previously reported compound3as a STING agonist,
with in vitro activities against THP1 monocyte that were comparable
to ADU-S100 (a CDN that was evaluated in the clinic). In our earlier study, we did not evaluate the in vivo efficacy
of compound3. Here, we synthesized and tested various
analogs of compound3and we now show that compound3and another analog4show excellent efficacy
in MC38 and B16–F10 mouse tumor model when administered via
subcutaneous route.

In order to profile the
potency of our synthesized endo-S-CDNs, both biochemical and cellular
assays were used. To evaluate the binding affinity of hSTING (human
STING), we used the differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay,
which measures the thermal shift (ΔTm shift)
upon binding of CDNs to hSTING. This assay assumes that the thermal
stability of CDN-hSTING complex corresponds with its binding affinity.
We confirmed the preliminary thermal shift binding results with a
hSTING fluorescence polarization (STING FP) assay previously reported
by us. This assay uses fluorescein labeled
c-di-GMP, which in the presence of strong STING binders is readily
displaced and exhibits low anisotropy but with poor binders it leads
to increased anisotropy. The effectiveness of CDNs to activate IRF
induction in THP1 monocytes and RAW macrophages was determined using
the QUANTI-Luc luminescence assay.

For our SAR correlation we compared
the activities of all analogs synthesized (5–33) to 2′3′-cGAMP, ADU-S100,3and4. To account for the variation in activity that may arise
as a result of the increased ring size from changing a bridging oxygen
to a bridging sulfur, we decided to focus on both endo-S-2′3′-CDNs
and endo-S-3′3′-CDNs. A change of 3′–OH
in3to a hydrogen in5leads to a loss
in potency as evident from the STING binding and EC50determination
assays (seeTable). Also, stemming from the effectiveness of3, we opted
to change the adenine moiety to cytidine, uridine and inosine as is
shown inTablefor6,7, and8respectively. The DSF
result show that this change leads to a loss in binding affinity for
the pyrimidines as evident for6and7but
inosine retains binding potency as shown by8(endo-S-cGIFMP) having similar ΔTm value to ADU-S100
and3(seeTable).8also exhibited better STING FP (IC50= 7.37 μM) than3(IC50= 13.97 μM)
and ADU-S100 (IC50= 12.8 μM) as well as approximately
4-fold lower EC50in the THP1 wildtype (WT) cellular assay
compared to 2′3′-cGAMP.8maintains potency
in THP1 KI STING R232 and RAW dual WT cells unlike 2′3′-cGAMP,
with comparable results to3and ADU-S100. A change of
the fluorine in8to hydrogen in9leads
to approximately 8-fold loss of EC50in THP1 monocytes.
In addition, modifying the adenine nucleobase in3to
an ethenoadenine base for10, results in reduced binding
and IRF induction in THP1 cells. Interestingly, altering the adenine
of3to a guanine in12, maintains potency
as well as STING binding. This shows all 2′-fluoro modified
endo-S-CDN analogs with natural purines as in3(adenosine),8(inosine), and12(guanosine) are all potent
STING agonists. This may be due to the ability of the purines to form
key hydrogen bonds as well as pi–pi interactions, which are
not accessible to pyrimidines. We attempted to improve cellular penetration
of our endo-S-CDNs by making an analog,13, where a charged
oxygen is replaced with a neutral methyl group. While this modification
leads to chirality at phosphorus, we could only isolate one isomer
out of the potential two diastereomers. In addition to the poor yield
of13(4%), initial evaluation of13indicated
it did not bind to STING and no THP1 activity was observed, thus there
was little impetus to continue spending resources to figuring out
which isomer (R or S at phosphorus) was obtained in13.

Next, we investigated changing the nucleobase of3from guanine to adenine and uridine while altering the right-hand
nucleobase (seeTable). Though14is a close analog to ADU-S100, there is
a complete drop in efficacy as evident from thermal shift assay, STING
FP and cellular assays. Unfortunately, changing the adenine in14to guanine (15) and 2’–OH to
fluorine as in16only leads to a partial rescue of binding
as seen inTable.
We then explored changing the guanine in3to a uridine
moiety as in17and this substitution leads to loss in
activity. Interestingly, flipping the two bases of3as
in18rescues or retains some activity as shown by both
the STING binding assays and EC50determination (seeTable). This shows that
the nature of the purine relative to 2′ and 3′ linkage
positions is pivotal for STING binding and activation. Next, we investigated
if substituting a charged oxygen for a methyl group can impact activity.
Just like13, this modification adds chirality at phosphorus,
and we could only isolate one of the isomers,19, in
a poor yield (3%). Unfortunately, this isomer was inactive, like results
for13, and hence no efforts were put into determining
the absolute chirality at phosphorus in19.

We have shown in a previous publication that locked
nucleic acid
(LNA) endo-S compound4is a potent STING agonist. Replacing the 3′–OH of4to hydrogen is detrimental to STING binding as shown for20(Table). Substituting
the guanine group in4to adenine, as in21, leads to a loss in STING binding and IRF activation in THP1. Also,
replacing the guanine in4to uridine, as in22, leads to a loss in activity, which suggests that for LNA endo-S-CDN,
the guanine moiety on the ribose unit bearing the noncanonical 2′-phosphorothioate
linkage might be essential for activity.

Next, we wanted to synthesize various sugar conformers
of3(changing the ribose group to either xylose or arabinose)
and probe activity with respect to STING binding and cellular activity.
Replacing the adenosine ribose group of3to a xylose
group in23completely alters and kills its potency as
shown inTable. Altering
the guanosine ribose of3to an arabinose sugar as in24improves the cellular profiles as evident from its performance
in THP1 and RAW cells (seeTable). This result differs to what was observed in arabinose
and xylose modified 2′3′-cGAMP containing natural phosphodiester
linkages, where the xylose derivative still retains some of its binding
and cellular potency and arabinose 2′3′-cGAMP shows
a slightly better IRF activation compared to 2′3′-cGAMP. In our case the arabinose endo-S analog (24) shows STING binding and excellent cellular potency but
xylose modified endo-S analog (23) is a poor STING binder
and inactive in the THP1 IRF induction assay (Table). It appears that the properties of CDNs
containing the natural phosphodiester linkages cannot be readily extrapolated
to the endo-S CDNs, albeit the conservative change from 5′-phosphodiester
to a 5-phosphorothioester.

Motivated by the activity of previously reported fluorinated
3′3′-CDNs,,,we sought to synthesize a library
of endo-S-3′3′CDNs and evaluate their activity in both
biochemical and cellular assays. Stemming from the activities of3,4,8, and12we
decided to focus on 3′–5′ phosphodiester CDNs
only having purines, 2′-fluorinated and 2′,4′-LNAs.
It is noteworthy that26, a 2′2′-difluorinated
endo-S-CDN bearing both guanine and adenine, had comparable STING
binding and low EC50as demonstrated by3,4, and8, with about 4-fold improvement over
2′3′-cGAMP in THP1 cells (seeTable). Interestingly, flipping the position of
the nucleobases in26, as in27, leads to
a 2.5-fold reduction in THP1 WT activity although both compounds have
similar EC50values in RAW dual WT cells. 3′3′-cAIMPF2, shown inFigure, is an ultrapotent STING agonist, which was previously developed
by Lioux et al. (invivogen). We made
the endo-S-CDN analogs of 3′3′-cAIMPF2(29and31) and evaluated their in vitro activity.
Unexpectedly,29and31completely lost
activity in both STING binding and THP1 assays (seeTable), one more showing that the
replacement of a 5′-O bridging phosphodiester with a sulfur,
though a minimal change, is significant enough to completely abrogate
activity. Also, the endo-S-3′3′-CDN analogs of8(28and30) were inactive compounds.
Compound32, an endo-S difluorinated c-di-GMP show modest
binding as seen from its DSF and STING FP data (seeTable).32also show
modest IRF induction in THP1 and RAW cells. In addition,33bearing two guanine bases with a fluoro group and locked nucleic
ribose could stabilize STING (ΔTm = 8°)
but did not show binding to the CDN site in STING (inferred from inability
to displace FAM-labeled c-di-GMP from STING,Table). In agreement with the STING FP assay,33had no activity in the THP IRF induction assay. We note
that while DSF is a good proxy for binding affinity, a positive thermal
shift does not always mean tighter binding and that a secondary confirmatory
assay (in this case the STING FP assay) is needed to confirm binding.
In summary,26showed the best STING binding and cellular
activity of all the endo-S-3′3′-CDNs we synthesized
and analyzed. Although fluorinated canonical 3′3′-CDNs
especially 3′3′-cAIMPF2(shown inFigure) have good binding
and cellular activities their corresponding endo-S analogs lose that
potency as displayed inTable.

Encouraged by the improvement in binding (determined
by the FP assay) and cellular activity exhibited by arabinose-substituted
(24) over xylose-analog (23) and ribose-epimer
(3), we conducted a docking study to deduce if interactions
in the binding pocket of STING could explain this experimental trend.
Interestingly, our docking predicts the preferred binding pose of23(xylose derivative) is an open conformation as shown inFigureB, while24and3adopts preferentially a closed conformation in
the binding pocket of STING (seeFigure) similar to the pose exhibited by MK-1454
bound to hSTING (PDB:7MHC). This conformation facilitates
binding to key amino acid residues with fewer steric clashes in STING’s
binding pocket. Also, noteworthy is that the best binding pose for23is flipped compared to that for3and24with its adenine portion binding in the pocket where the
guanine binds for both3and24(seeFigureD). Docking shows
these analogs all form key interactions with Tyr167, Arg238, Ser162,
and Thr263 (seeFigure), while Only3and24forms hydrogen bonding
with Thr269. Also, the 3′–OH of24is predicted
to form an additional hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Leu159.
Docking was done with flare using PDB:7MHC. It is important to note that the activities
of3,23, and24may not be
solely based on binding to STING but also interaction with CDN-based
importers,−which traffic CDNs into mammalian cells.

STING activation results in downstream signaling
leading to the
transcription and expression of type I interferons and proinflammatory
cytokines like CXCL10, TNFα, and IFNβ.,−CXCL10 is highly inducted by interferons and NF-κB, and is
the major chemokine that recruits CD8+ T lymphocytes to clear and
regress expanding tumors.,Hence, we sought to
evaluate these three tumor-associated cytokines in THP1 cells. Real-time
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis after treatment with CDNs shows
that3(approximately 100-fold upregulation as compared
to nontreated control) and8(roughly showing 400-fold
induction vs nontreated control) induce the mRNA expression of CXCL10
at 10 μM (seeFigureA) while marginally upregulating the transcription of both
TNFα and IFNβ (seeFigureB,C). However, it still performed better than 2′3′-cGAMP
in upregulating TNFα and IFNβ as shown inFigureB,C. Also,3and8after treatment in PBMCs at 40 μM induce the expression
of TNFα compared to 2′3′-cGAMP (seeFigureD).

STING activation can lead to direct cancer cell
death,,so we tested these endo-S-CDNs in vitro
against both MC38 and B16–F10
cells to determine if the in vivo efficacy data was partly due to
their ability to induce cell death in these cancer cells. Compounds3,4, and8do not kill MC38 and
B16–F10 cells in vitro (seeFigure S1). This suggests that the tumor shrinking ability of the compounds
in vivo is likely via extrinsic mechanism, i.e. the endo-S-CDN compounds
likely activate STING to recruit the immune machinery of the mice
to suppress the tumor growth. Future work, beyond the scope of the
current study, would aim to elucidate the mechanism by which these
endo-S-CDNs provide robust protection against tumors when dosed via
SubQ as this may provide insight into how the efficacy of STING agonists
may depend on route of administration. We note that most CDN-based
STING agonists trialed in the clinic were dosed via IT or IV; our
data suggest that the mode of compound administration in these trials
should be revisited.

Conventionally,
most CDNs are prepared via H-phosphonate chemistry, which involves
one-pot synthesis developed by Jones and co-workers. This method entails the cyclization of 5′-O deprotected
dinucleotide containing an H-phosphonate moiety using 2-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-1′3′2-dioxaposphorinane-2-oxide
(DMOCP). This cyclization step is not efficient and leads to overall
poor yields of CDNs. To make endo-S-CDNs we use an underutilized approach
initially developed by Kool and co-workers on solid phase, and later adapted by us for the preparation
of endo-S-c-di-GMP and analogs via solution phase and solid phase,
respectively.,This approach is a multistep
synthesis where the penultimate step is a reaction with ammonium hydroxide
which is both a global deprotection and macrocyclization step. This
synthesis strategy has better yield than CDNs made via the Jones’
method. To synthesize the xylose (23) and arabinose (24) modified endo-S-CDNs, we use an approach disclosed by
Xie et al., where the hydroxy group of
the protected nucleoside34aand35a, respectively,
is converted to a good leaving group via triflation using triflic
anhydride and DMAP, subsequently followed by nucleophilic attack with
sodium trifluoroacetate (NaOTFA) to invert the configuration of the
2′- (arabinose) and 3′- (xylose) hydroxy group. This
is illustrated inSchemesand , showing the synthesis of23(xylose modification) and24(arabinose modification),
respectively.Schemedescribes the synthesis of methyl phosphonate linked endo-S-CDNs.
The synthesis of the other endo-S-CDNs is described in theSupporting Information.

To conclude, though numerous CDN-based STING
agonist have been
developed with impressive in vivo activity in mouse models, their
preferred mode of administration has been via intratumoral route.
Most clinical studies of these agonist are via intratumor (IT) injection
and as combo therapy with immune checkpoint blockades. This mode of
administration is limited for a localized population and might have
ablative effect on T cells at high concentration, hence more systemic
dosing options is needed in developing STING agonists for cancer immunotherapy.
We have identified endo-S-CDNs STING agonist, which are efficacious
when dosed via subcutaneous route. These compounds do not lead to
weight loss or abnormal animal behavior, when dosed subcutaneously
and they are efficacious as a standalone therapeutic in mouse models.
In some instances, same compound dosed subcutaneously had better efficacy
in suppressing tumor growth than when they were administered intratumorally.
These CDN analogs hold promise for cancer immunotherapy and further
preclinical studies are needed to evaluate their utility in the clinic
and if they could synergize with other modalities, such as CAR T cell,
anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 therapies.

For all biological
assays and in vivo experiments, CDNs were dissolved in water. Sodium
salts of the respective endo-S-CDNs were used for all in vivo studies.

STING plasmid was
received from Prof Pingwei Li’s lab. After plasmid transformation
into BL21 (DE3), the
BL21 cells where cultured in LB media (10 mL) with 50 μg/mL
of selection antibiotics (kanamycin and chloramphenicol). After overnight
culturing, the 10 mL culture was inoculated into a 1L TB culture and
supplemented with 50 μg/mL of both chloramphenicol and kanamycin.
After attaining an OD of 0.6, 1 mM IPTG was added to induce STING
expression and then the culture was incubated at 16 °C for 16
h. After incubation, the culture was collected via centrifugation
at 5000 rpm for 30 min. Lysis buffer (50 mM Na3PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (βME),
10% glycerol, pH = 7.4, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was
added to the collected pellets. Lysis was achieved by sonication,
and STING mixture was collected (supernatant) via centrifugation at
22,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. STING was purified using a nickel
His-trap column with a gradient of imidazole in the wash and elution
buffers. The purified protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C
and its concentration was estimated via UV–vis spectrometry
at 280 nm wavelength (ε for STING = 47955 M–1cm–1).

To a solution of 150 μM CDNs in water was added to 20 μM
of STING in a buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl)
and 1:500 (v/v) SYPRO orange. Denaturation was done using a real time
PCR (RT-PCR) cycler with a temperature gradient from 15 to 80 °C
(increasing 1 °C per every 15 s).

ΔTm values were
reported by subtracting the average denaturing temperature (Tx) determined for the untreated
STING from the temperature (Ty) determined for treatment with CDNs.

The fluorescence
assay was adapted form Karanja et al. and as previously used by Yeboah et al.

THP1 dual WT and THP1 KI STING
R232 cells (from invivogen) were grown in RPMI media supplemented
1× penicillin/streptomycin (1× pen/strep) and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) in a 37 °C incubator (5% CO2) while RAW dual
WT was cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 1x pen/strep and 10%
FBS. After passaging and allowing to grow to confluence, all cell
lines were seeded at a concentration 5 × 105 cells per ml in
96 well plates. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C cells were treated
with CDNs ranging from concentration of 50 nM to 100 μM in triplicates
to determine EC50values. After incubating for 24 h, IRF
induction was deduced using QUANTI-Luc reagent (using manufacturer
protocol), and the results were analyzed via Graph Pad Prism using
the dose–response 4-point model.

The mRNA levels
of some cytokines were quantified using RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). THP1 WT
cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.5 × 106cells
per ml in 6 well plates and after 24 h, CDNs were treated at either
5 μM of3and 10 μM of all CDNs including3, with 2′3′-cGAMP used as a positive control.
After 24 h incubation, cells were collected via centrifugation and
total RNA was isolated using the trizol reagent method. After total
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript first
strand synthesis system (per manufacturer protocol). Next, the synthesized
cDNA was used for RT-PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit performed
on a CFX96 real-time system, with both forward and reverse primers
of respective cytokines. RT-PCR primers used are listed in the supplementary.
The mRNA expression levels were estimated according to the formula
(2–ΔΔCq) using GAPDH as an internal
reference gene and normalized to the water-treated cells. Technical
replicates were in triplicates and biological replicates were in duplicates.p< 0.05 was statistically significant usingt-test. RT-qPCR primers of target cytokine genes and internal
control gene are listed below.

PMBCs were purchased
from ATCC (catalog number: PCS-800-011) . After successful passaging
cells were incubated in RPMI media supplemented with 1× pen/strep
and 10% FBS. PMBC Cells were seeded at 5 × 105cells
in 96 well plates for 24 h in previously described incubation conditions.
CDNs were treated at 40 μM, after 24 h cells were applied on
human TNF alpha ELISA research reagent kit Picokine (from Boster Bio)
per manufacturer’s instruction. Experiments were done in triplicates
and data was analyzed via GraphPad prism. CDNs were treated in triplicates
and 2′3′-cGAMP as well as ADU-S100 was used as a positive
control while water was used as negative control.

MC38 and B16–F10 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After
24 h incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, CDNs were treated
varying concentration from 50 nM to 40 μM. At 72 h incubation,
10 μL of CellTiter-Blue cell viability reagent (Promega) was
added and later incubated for 3 h. MC38 and B16–F10 cells where
only treated at 10 μM, 20 μM and 40 μM of the compounds.
Fluorescence (λex/λem= 560/590
nm) was read using Biotek Cytation 5 multimode reader. Experiments
were done in triplicates and the cell viability were normalized to
the water treated cells for respective cell lines.

All the procedures related to animal
handling, care and the treatment in this study were performed according
to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of BioDuro (MC38 tumor model) and Purdue University
(B16–F10 tumor model) following the guidance of the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).

The sodium
salts of the respective endo-S-CDNs were used for this study. MC38
cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS, 1× pen/strep at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 5 × 105MC38 cells were suspended in 100
μL unsupplemented DMEM medium with 50% matrix gel and inoculated
subcutaneously into the right flank of C57BL/6 female mice. When the
tumor volume reached a size of approximately 72 mm3, mice
were randomly subgrouped according to body weight and tumor volume
and administered vehicle (PBS) and respective endo-S-CDN either intratumorally
or subcutaneously. Each subgroup had six tumor-bearing mice. The tumor
volume was measured twice a week with caliper and volume was reported
in mm3using the formula: V = 0.5axb2, where a and b are the long and short diameters
of the tumor, respectively. Animals with tumor size larger than 2000
mm3were euthanized.

The sodium salts of the endo-S-CDNs were used for this study. B16–F10
cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1×
pen/strep at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 5 ×
105cells were suspended in 100 μL unsupplemented
DMEM medium and inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of
C57BL/6 female mice. When the tumor volume reached a size of approximately
100 mm3, mice were randomly grouped according to body weight
and tumor volume and administered vehicle (PBS) and respective endo-S-CDN
either intratumorally or subcutaneously. Each group had six tumor-bearing
mice for a total of 36 mice. The tumor volume was measured with caliper
and volume was expressed in units of mm3using the formula:
V = 0.52a×b× c. Animals
were euthanized on day 15 postinoculation. A two-way ANOVA was performed
to compare the tumor volume was analyzed using GraphPad prism.p< 0.05 was statistically significant.

Unless otherwise stated,
all reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers
and used as received without purification. The1H,31P and13C NMR spectra were obtained in methanol-d4or D2O as solvent using either
a 500 or 800 MHz spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal
standard. Flash or column chromatography using silica gel (230–400
mesh) for purification of intermediates. All final compounds were
purified via RP-HPLC. The cyclic dinucleotide synthesized were either
isolated as a triethylammonium salt or proton salt. Coupling constants
(Jvalues) reported in Hz. All final compounds were
characterized by1H,31P and13C
NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data. All intermediates
were also characterized via ESI–MS using Advion Mass Spectrometer.
HRMS was done for all final compounds (ESI).

To 2
g of 5′-DMT-2′-fluoro-N6-benzoyladenosine (34a, 2.56 mmol) was added DMAP (7.69
mmol, 3 equiv) and then DCM was used to dissolve the solid mixture
(30 mL). This solution was cooled on ice before triflic anhydride
(3.84 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was slowly added and the reaction mix was left
to stir for 45 min 70 mL of diethyl ether and 30 mL of 2% acetic acid
was added and separated after extraction. Another 30 mL of 2% acetic
acid was added again to wash the organic layer. 5% NaHCO3(30 mL) and water was used to back extract the diethyl ether layer.
The organic layer was concentrated via reduced pressure and subsequently
reconcentrated with acetonitrile (10 mL, 3×). Thirty ml of DMF
was used to dissolve the crude product and then sodium trifluoroacetate
(12.8 mmol, 5 equiv) was added. After 18 h, the mixture was heated
to 55–60 °C for 3 h to ensure complete inversion to the
xylose epimer,34b. After the reaction was complete,
the mixture was slowly added to a solution of 5% NaHCO3(50 mL) and water (50 mL) to precipitate the solids and then later
filtered to isolate the product. The crude product was then purified
via column chromatography to give34b(1.3 g). ESI–MS:m/z= 678.8 [M + H]+.1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3δ) 8.86–8.62 (m, 2H),

Cyanolethanol (0.40 mL, 5.5 mmol) was added to guanosine (n-ibu) 3′-tBDSilyl CED phosphoramidite orI(from Chemgenes, 1.06 g, 1.09 mmol) in anhydrous MeCN (15 mL) under
argon. After stirring for 10 min at room temperature, dicyanoimidazole
(0.472 g, 4.0 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred
for 16 h under argon at RT. Beaucage reagent was added to the reaction
mixture and left to stir for an hour. The reaction was quenched with

Anhydrous MeCN was used to dissolve
phosphorothioateII(0.27 g, 0.42 mmol) and phorsphoramidite34c(0.63 mmol, 1.5 equiv) and left to stir under argon for
15 min. DCI (2 mmol, 4.76 equiv) was added and left to stir at RT
for 6 h.tBuOOH (70% aq solution, 0.5
mL, 3.9 mmol) was used to oxidize the coupled product and the reaction
was left for 10 min, then the mixture was quenched with 30 mL of Na2S2O3(1 M) and extracted 3x with 30
mL DCM. Then the extracted product is concentrated under reduced pressure.
After concentrating, the oil is dissolved in 20 mL DCM and then 0.5
mL of DCA is added dropwise and left to stir for 12 min. Saturated
NaHCO3(30 mL) was added to quench the reaction and extracted
3× with 30 mL DCM. The organic layer is then concentrated, and
the crude product was immediately purified via flash chromatography
(2–5% methanol in ethyl acetate). To the purified product (0.3
mmol) is then added methyltriphenoxyphosphonium iodide (3 mmol, 10
equiv) and 2,6-lutidine (10.2 mmol, 34 equiv) in anhydrous DMF (1.5
mL) in inert atmosphere. After an hour, the reaction was quenched
with 20 mL of Na2S2O3(1 M) and then
30 mL DCM was added to extract the aqueous layer (3x). The organic
layer was concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude product
was purified via flash chromatography (4–10% methanol in ethyl
acetate). The isolated product (0.116 g) was collected as a pale yellow
solid. ESI–MS:m/z= 1268.9

For the synthesis
of3,4,6–9,12–19, and21–24: Ammonium hydroxide (5 mL, 30% ammonia in water) was added
to representative iodide intermediate (31d–40e, 0.038 mmol) and the reaction was left to stir at RT for
24 h. The cyclized product was then dried under reduced pressure and
then pyridine (1 mL) and Et3N·3HF (125 μL, 0.798
mmol) was added and left to stir at 55–60 °C for 6 h.
Ten milliliters of acetone was then added to precipitate the respective
products, and this was collected via centrifugation as an off-white
solid. The isolated product was washed 3x with 1 mL acetone before
being left to dry overnight. The product was then dissolved in 5 mL
of water and then purified via reverse phase (RP)-HPLC using either
COSMOSIL C18-PAQ or Xterra RP18 5.0 μm or Hypersil Gold PFP
packed columns with gradient comprising of 0–16 min: 99%–87%
0.1 M triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), 1–13% acetonitrile,
16–23 min: 87–10% 0.1 M TEAA, 13–90% acetonitrile
23–25 min: 10–99% 0.1 M TEAA, 90–1% acetonitrile
or 0–16 min: 99%–87% of 0.1% formic acid, 1–13%
acetonitrile, 16–23 min: 87–10% of 0.1% formic acid,
13–90% acetonitrile 23–25 min: 10–99% of 0.1%
formic acid, 90–1% acetonitrile to afford either the triethylammonium
or proton salt, respectively. Dowex 50W X8 was used for the salt exchange
to convert the triethylammonium salt to the sodium salt for3,4, and8which was used for the
in vivo studies.

For the synthesis of5,20,25–33: 5 mL of ammonium hydroxide
solution (30% ammonia in water) was added to dinucleotide iodide intermediate
(38l,40c, and41a–42b, 0.038 mmol) and stirred for 24 h at RT. The macrocyclized
product was then dried under reduced pressure. Five ml of water was
added to dissolve about 20 mg of crude product and this solution was
purified via RP-HPLC using same procedure as described for the synthesis
of3,4,6–9,12–19, and21–24.
