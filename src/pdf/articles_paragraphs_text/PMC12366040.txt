Non-traditional lipid parameters are crucial biomarkers associated with outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We aim to explore the relationship between non-traditional lipid parameters and futile recanalization (FR) following mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute large artery occlusion (LAO).

A retrospective study was conducted in our stroke center. The definition of FR is modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≥ 3 at 90-day follow-up. The non-traditional lipid parameters include atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), apolipoprotein (Apo) B/A1 ratio, Castelli’s risk index (CRI), lipoprotein combine index (LCI), residual lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors of FR between these parameters, as continuous variables. Then, AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II, all of which met the significance, were categorized into tertiles to further investigate their relationship with FR through multivariate regression analysis and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves. Then, linear regression analysis was employed to explore the association between non-traditional lipid parameters and the final infarct volume.

A total of 338 patients were enrolled into this study, and 196 (56.5%) patients experienced FR. AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II were categorized into tertiles based on value. Compared with patients in the lowest tertile, those in the highest tertile had significantly increased risk of FR (AIP: odds ration [OR] 2.64, 95% CI 1.27–5.51,P= 0.009; Apo B/A1 ratio: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.12–4.40,P= 0.023; CRI-I: OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.60–7.31,P= 0.002; CRI-II: OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.58–7.21,P= 0.002). RCS curves demonstrated a linear relationship between those four parameters and FR (allPnon-linear> 0.05). Linear regression analysis confirmed that AIP and CRI-II were positively correlated with the final infarct volume (AIP: β 2.61, 95% CI 0.20–5.03,P= 0.034; CRI-II: β 8.93, 95% CI 1.12–16.74,P= 0.025).

This study provides evidence that AIP, Apo B/A1, CRI-I, and CRI-II are independent risk factors of FR following MT for acute LAO, and can be novel biomarkers of prognosis in patients treated with MT.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is characterized by high mortality and disability, imposing a huge burden on society, especially when a large artery is occluded [1]. Blood flow reconstruction and preventing continued neuronal damage are essential for AIS treatment. As an effective procedure of revascularization for acute large artery occlusion (LAO), multiple randomized clinical trials have shown superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) over medical management [2–5]. However, a substantial proportion of patients still cannot experience functional improvement, despite timely and successful recanalization of the occluded artery, called “futile recanalization” [6]. Futile recanalization (FR) is defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥ 3 at 90-day follow-up, and is an important factor influencing the effectiveness of MT [6–8]. Therefore, identifying factors associated with poor outcomes after MT may inform the optimization of treatment strategies.

A recent meta-analysis with 2138 patients put forward that female, history of hypertension and diabetes, higher systolic pressure and serum glucose at admission, internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, non-bridging therapy, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage post-procedure were predictors of FR [9]. While, with further study, some non-traditional parameters were also reported to be associated with FR, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, systemic inflammatory response index, and systemic immune-inflammation index [6,8,10].

Lipids are essential components of the human body. Previous studies have shown that traditional lipids (triglyceride [TG] and total cholesterol [TC]) and lipoprotein (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) were associated with the occurrence and progress of AIS [11,12]. With the development of lipid research, some non-traditional lipid parameters have been gradually used to explore their correlation with diseases. For example, lipoprotein (a) is recommended in 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines to aid risk stratification of early onset coronary heart disease and in people with a family history of medium stroke risk according to the Framingham Risk Score [13]. Zhao et al. also reported that residual lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C), non-HDL-C/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, Castelli’s risk index-I (CRI-I) and CRI-II were independent risk factors for carotid plaque vulnerability in AIS patients [14]. However, studies of the relationship between non-traditional parameters and outcomes in patients with AIS undergoing MT have rarely been reported [15]. Therefore, in the present study, we aim to investigate the association between various non-traditional lipid parameters, which have been reported in previous studies [14,16,17], including atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), apolipoprotein B/A1 (Apo B/A1) ratio, CRI-I, lipoprotein combine index (LCI), RLP-C, CRI-II, and non-HDL-C, and futile recanalization after MT for AIS.

This study has been approved by our institutional ethics committee (KYLLKS20250046). Data of patients treated with MT at Suining Central Hospital from January 2021 to August 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosis of AIS with acute anterior circulation LAO involving terminal ICA or middle cerebral artery (MCA, M1 or M2 segment); (2) over 18 years old; (3) time from onset to puncture ≤ 24 h; (4) patients with successful recanalization after MT (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [mTICI] ≥ 2b) [18]. The exclusion criteria were presented as: (1) acute LAO in the posterior circulation; (2) insufficient data on lipid parameters at admission or clinical outcomes at follow-up; (3) patients with progressive or decompensated comorbidities before AIS onset; and (4) patients with obvious dysfunction before AIS onset (mRS score > 1). Data points, including demographics, medical history, intravenous thrombolysis, neurological dysfunction, imaging findings, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes, were reviewed.

All stroke patients admitted to our hospital were scheduled to achieve non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) to rule out intracerebral hemorrhage, and CT angiography was applied to determine the existence and location of artery occlusion, simultaneously. Neurological dysfunction was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Blood samples for hematologic tests, including peripheral blood cells, hsCRP, hepatorenal and coagulation indicators, electrolytes, glucose, and lipid parameters, were collected within 30 min from admission. In addition, blood samples for fasting blood glucose (FBG) were also collected from patients with at least 8 h of fasting or cessation of sugar-containing liquid infusion within 24 h from admission. Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase as bridging therapy was administered for patients within 4.5 h after AIS onset after exclusion of contraindications. Direct MT was employed for patients in the time window of 6–24 h presenting obvious mismatch of ischemic and infarct area in CT perfusion imaging (penumbra volume ≥ 15 mL; mismatch ratio ≥ 1.8) [19]. All MT procedures were performed under general anesthesia using modern stent retriever and/or direct aspiration techniques. For stenosis or dissection, stent implantation was performed at the surgeon’s discretion. All the surgeries were carried out by the same team of neurosurgeons. Collateral circulation score was assessed based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at the initial stage of MT, classified as follows: grade 0 (collaterals less than one-third of the occluded region), grade 1 (filling less than two-third of the occluded territory), and grade 2 (collateralization fills more than two-thirds of the occluded region) [20]. The time from onset to recanalization was defined as the time from symptom occurrence or last known normal to reperfusion. In addition, DSA images obtained during the final phase of the MT procedure were evaluated to quantitatively assess stenotic lesions in the whole craniocervical arteries. Atherosclerotic stenosis (AS) was defined as a craniocervical artery with ≥ 50% stenosis caused by atherosclerosis [21].

The information of medical history was obtained from reports of patients or their family members, medical records, or relative drug use. Smoker was defined as smoking at least one cigarette per day for one year [22]. Drinking at least 80 g of liquor per day was classified as alcoholism [23]. Characteristics of preoperative non-contrast CT were independently evaluated by two neuroradiologists blind to clinical data, including baseline stroke burden based on Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) [24,25]. The etiology of stroke was determined using the Trail of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, categorized as large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolic, and undetermined or other thrombi in our study [26].

The enrolled non-traditional lipid parameters were selected based on previous studies[14,16,17] and our laboratory data, and they were calculated as follows: AIP = log10(TG/HDL-C), Apo B/A1 ratio = Apo B/Apo A1, CRI-I = TC/HDL-C; LCI = TC × TG × LDL-C/HDL-C; RLP-C = TC – (HDL-C + LDL-C); CRI-II = LDL-C/HDL-C; Non-HDL-C = TC – HDL-C. The FR was evaluated by qualified personnel or physicians through in-person interviews at the clinic or telephone based on mRS score ≥ 3 [6–8]. The data of CT or MRI performed at least 30 days after MT were also reviewed to calculate the final infarct volume using the Pullicino formula [27,28].

The variables in the univariate analysis were selected based on our experience and previous studies [14,29,30]. Patients were classified into futile recanalization and non-futile recanalization groups based on mRS score (≥ 3, and ≤ 2) at 90-day follow-up. For variables (except for non-traditional lipid parameters) with more than 10% missing values, we performed complete deletion from this study; otherwise, we applied random forest imputation to handle the missing data. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to verify the normal distribution of continuous variables. The continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and compared using one-way analysis of variance or Student’s t-test if normality of distribution was confirmed; otherwise, continuous variables were presented as median (inter-quartile range, IQR) and analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis H-test or Mann–Whitney U-test. Pairwise comparisons were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. The categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage) and compared using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. The Spearman correlation test was employed to explore the correlations between non-traditional lipid parameters and 90-day mRS scores. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to investigate the discrimination ability of non-traditional lipid parameters for FR. Variables with significant differences in univariate analysis were enrolled into multivariate logistic models. While, variables involved in the calculation of non-traditional lipid parameters were not included in the multivariate model, even if significance was met. Three models were established as follows: model 1, adjusted for sex and age; model 2, adjusted for variables in model 1 plus the clinical characteristics and imaging findings (history of hypertension, initial NIHSS score, baseline ASPECTS, occluded vessel region, collateral score, and time from onset to recanalization); model 3, adjusted for variables in model 2 plus the laboratory data (total calcium, hsCRP, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, and serum glucose at admission). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between non-traditional lipid parameters for FR, yielding adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). As independent risk factors for FR, AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II were stratified into tertiles based on values (T1-T3). Then, we further analyzed the relationship between FR and these four non-traditional lipid parameters as an ordinal metric, utilizing the initial tertile as the reference. The median value of each tertile was also treated as a continuous variable for the linear trend test. The restricted cubic splines (RCS) were utilized to pinpoint any nonlinear associations between AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, CRI-II, and FR after adjusting for model 3. Subgroup analyses were conducted with stratification of gender, age (≥ 75, or < 75 years old), intravenous thrombolysis, history of hypertension, occluded vessel (ICA or MCA), time from onset to recanalization (> 350, or ≤ 350 min), and final mTICI (2b, or 3). Likelihood ratio tests were employed to probe for interactions between AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, CRI-II, and the above stratified variables. ORs in subgroups were the same as adjustment in model 3. Considering that lipid-lowering therapy (only statins in our cohort) may affect the measurements, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding patients on statin therapy before admission to evaluate the robustness of the associations between non-traditional lipid parameters and FR. The associations between non-traditional lipid parameters and final infarct volume were analyzed with univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses, using model 3 as the multivariate model. In addition, univariate linear regression analysis was also employed to investigate the variables associated with serum glucose at admission, and bootstrapping approach was used to explore the plausible mediating role of glucose in linking non-traditional lipid parameters to FR. The presence of multicollinearity was assessed using weighted linear regression, defined as variance inflation factor (VIF) ≥ 5. Finally, patients were stratified into three groups based on craniocervical AS burden: no AS, single AS (one craniocervical artery with AS), and multiple AS (≥ 2 craniocervical arteries with AS). Inter-group differences in non-traditional lipid parameters were subsequently assessed. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 25.0 and R program (version 4.4.1), andp< 0.05 was statistically significant.

Five hundred and thirty-nine patients were treated with MT from January 2021 to August 2024 in our stroke center, and 338 patients were finally enrolled in this study (Fig.1). The age of the patients was 73 (IQR 63–79) years, and females constituted 44.7% (151) of the study population. The initial NIHSS score was 15 (IQR 11–19), and baseline ASPECTS was 8 (IQR 8–9). The values of AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, LCI, RLP-C, CRI-II, and non-HDL-C were 0.02 ± 0.30, 0.71 ± 0.27, 3.45 (IQR 2.77–4.32), 12.43 (IQR 5.63–22.53), 0.34 (IQR 0.15–0.67), 2.09 (IQR 1.55–2.79), and 3.17 ± 1.01, respectively. Spearman correlation with 90-day mRS score (Table1) showed significant correlations for AIP (rs= 0.18,P= 0.001), Apo B/A1 ratio (rs= 0.12,P= 0.032), CRI-I (rs= 0.20,P< 0.001), LCI (rs= 0.19,P< 0.001), and CRI-II (rs= 0.21,P< 0.001).

A total of 191 (56.5%) patients were included in the FR group, and 147 (43.5%) patients in the non-futile recanalization group. Table2lists the characteristics of these two groups. Compared with patients in the non-futile group, those in the FR group were older and more likely to be female. These patients had a higher rate of hypertension and ICA occlusion, higher initial NIHSS score, lower baseline ASPECTS, longer time from onset to recanalization, and higher levels of total calcium, hsCRP, neutrophil, platelet, and serum glucose at admission. Furthermore, higher values of AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, LCI, and CRI-II were also found (allP< 0.05). The ROC curves of non-traditional parameters and FR are shown in Fig.2. The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of non-traditional lipid parameters for the discrimination of FR are described in detail in Table3. Multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated significant associations between FR and AIP (per 0.1 unit, OR 4.28, 95% CI 1.53–11.98,P= 0.006), Apo B/A1 ratio (OR 4.88, 95% CI 1.58–15.10,P= 0.006), CRI-I (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.24–2.23,P= 0.001), and CRI-II (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29–2.57,P= 0.001), as shown in Table4.

AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II have been identified as independent risk factors for FR when regarded as continuous variables. Therefore, these four parameters were included for further analyses. Patients were separately allocated into three tertiles depending upon values of AIP (T1: ≤ −0.13; T2: − 0.13 to 0.13; T3 > 0.13), Apo B/A1 ratio (T1: ≤ 0.57; T2: 0.57–0.77; T3: > 0.77), CRI-I (T1: ≤ 2.98; T2: 2.98–3.89; T3: > 3.89), and CRI-II (T1: ≤ 1.75; T2:1.75–2.52; T3: > 2.52). The associations between these four non-traditional lipid parameters and FR after adjusting covariables are detailed in Table5. When categorized as ordinal variables, patients in the highest tertiles had significantly increased risk of FR than those in the lowest tertiles after fully adjusting model 3 in these four non-traditional parameters (AIP: OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.27–5.51,P= 0.009; Apo B/A1 ratio: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.12–4.40,P= 0.023; CRI-I: OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.60–7.31,P= 0.002; CRI-II: OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.58–7.21,P= 0.002). These relationships were also mirrored in multivariate analysis after adjusting model 1 and model 2. No obvious multicollinearity was found among these variables. The RCS curves with application of model 3 demonstrated that the risk of FR increased linearly with ascending AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II (Pnon-linear= 0.178,Pnon-linear= 0.790,Pnon-linear= 0.630, andPnon-linear= 0.930, respectively) (Fig.3).

Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship across various patient subgroups, including sex, age, intravenous thrombolysis, history of hypertension, occluded vessel, time from onset to recanalization, and final mTICI. No significant correlations were found between parameters and above stratified variables (all p for interaction > 0.05). The associations in various subgroups are illustrated in Fig.4. However, no significant association was found between AIP and FR in these subgroups (allP> 0.05, Fig.4a).

Of the patients enrolled in our study, 19 were receiving statin therapy before admission. Exclusion of these patients in sensitivity analysis revealed that, as continuous variables, AIP (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06–1.31, p = 0.003), Apo B/A1 ratio (OR 4.79, 95% CI 1.51–15.17,p= 0.008), CRI-I (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.24–2.29,p= 0.001), and CRI-II (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.28–2.65,p= 0.001) persisted as independent risk factors for FR after adjusting covariables in model 3 (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, when categorized these parameters into ordinal variables, using the lowest tertile as the reference, the highest tertiles continued to exhibit significant associations with elevated risk of FR (AIP: OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.35–6.14,p= 0.006; Apo B/A1 ratio: OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.14–4.80,p= 0.021; CRI-I: OR 3.47, 95% CI 1.56–7.71, p = 0.002; CRI-II: OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.38–6.60,p= 0.006) (Supplementary Table S2).

The final infarct volume has been calculated for 233 patients whose data of CT or MRI test after 30 days of AIS onset were available. The patients in the FR group (112.75, IQR 70.18–169.88 ml) exhibited significantly larger infarct volume than those in the non-FR group (67.02, IQR 38.78–101.53 ml) (p< 0.001). After adjusting covariables in model 3, the final infarct volume remained an independent risk factor for FR (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03,p< 0.001). Table6lists the linear relationship between non-traditional lipid parameters and the final infarct volume. AIP and CRI-II were independently associated with larger final infarct volume (AIP: per 0.1 unit, β 2.61, 95% CI 0.20–5.03,P= 0.034; CRI-II: β 8.93, 95% CI 1.12–16.74,P= 0.025).

Serum glucose at admission was univariately associated with intravenous thrombolysis, history of diabetes mellitus, ICA occlusion, baseline ASPECTS, total calcium, potassium, chloride, hemoglobin, and present HMCAS, and it was also an independent predictor for FR after adjusting the model 3 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07–1.34,P= 0.002). Then, further mediation analysis was performed to explore whether serum glucose was a mediator linking non-traditional lipid parameters to FR. As shown in Fig.5, serum glucose at admission played a significant mediating role in the associations of CRI-I and CRI-II with FR, with a mediated proportion of 9.17% (P= 0.012) and 7.93% (P= 0.020), respectively.

The data of FBG were available in 290 patients. The mean FBG was 6.9 (IQR 5.3–9.5) mmol/L. Patients with FR had significantly higher levels of FBG than those with successful recanalization (7.6 [IQR 5.8–11.2] vs. 6.0 [IQR 5.0–8.6] mmol/L,P< 0.001). Multivariate analysis also identified that FBG was also associated with FR after adjusting the model 3 (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.23,P= 0.003). However, the mediation analysis revealed no significant mediating effect of FBG on the association between nontraditional lipid parameters and FR (allP> 0.05).

There were 171 (50.6%) patients without AS, 97 (28.7%) with single AS, and 70 (20.7%) with multiple AS in our cohort. Notably, compared to patients without AS, those with any AS (single or multiple) exhibited significantly elevated levels of AIP, CRI-I, LCI, and CRI-II (allp-overall < 0.05) (Supplementary Table S3). However, no significant differences in these parameters were observed between single AS and multiple AS groups (allp> 0.05).

Herein, we selected 7 non-traditional lipid parameters to investigate their relationship with FR, finding that AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II were independent risk factors for FR even after adjusting for confounding risk factors. Further analyses demonstrated that the elevated values of these 4 parameters were linked to a higher risk of FR. No significant effect modification in this relationship was found in interaction tests. In addition, we also observed that AIP and CRI-II were positively associated with the final infarct volume. Finally, our results suggested that serum glucose at admission may be a mediator and partly responsible for the FR in patients with elevated non-traditional lipid parameters.

Previous studies have identified the influence of traditional lipid or lipoprotein indicators on the occurrence, development, and therapeutic outcomes of cerebrovascular diseases [11,12]. In the recent decade, with the progressive concept of diseases, non-traditional lipid parameters are gradually utilized to evaluate the prognosis. Zhao et al. found that in patients with AIS, RLP-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, CRI-I, and CRI-II were independent risk factors for carotid plaque vulnerability. Moreover, RLP-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, CRI-I, CRI-II, and AIP were positively correlated with the severity of carotid plaque stenosis [14]. Deng et al. identified that a lower value of TG/HDL-C was strongly associated with death and worse outcomes at 3 months in patients with AIS [30]. However, to our knowledge, no previous study has explored the relationship between non-traditional lipid parameters and FR in acute LAO, the most severe subtype of AIS, after MT. This study may firstly confirm this relationship and contribute to guiding effective treatment modalities and providing novel targets for neuroprotection in patients with acute LAO.

AIP is a biomarker of plasma atherosclerosis and reflects the circulating levels of TG and HDL-C [31]. Increased levels of AIP may indicate that adipocytes store excess TG as fat, which promotes the accumulation of cholesterol crystals in the inner layer of the arteries, leading to the development of atherosclerosis [31]. Furthermore, AIP can indirectly reflect sdLDL particle size and is negatively correlated with the diameter of LDL-C [32]. Elevated AIP indicates decreased LDL particle size and increased proportion of sdLDL that accelerates the generation of atherosclerotic plaque [31]. Clinically, AIP is also considered a reliable mark for predicting various diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, advanced subclinical coronary artery disease, AIS, metabolic syndrome, and obesity [33–36]. Ma et al. have reported that AIP showed the strongest correlation with the risk of AIS in maintenance hemodialysis patients, compared with non-HDL-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, and LCI [17]. Recently, Wu et al. observed that a higher AIP value was associated with early neurological deterioration in patients treated with MT for emergent large vessel occlusion [15]. Consistent with the above studies, we also identified that AIP was an adverse marker in patients with AIS and put forward that elevated AIP was associated with FR after MT for LAO. However, this relationship failed to be confirmed in subgroups. We speculate that this discrepancy may be attributed to the limited sample size in each subgroup, and a large-scale clinical investigation is needed to verify our findings. Patients with obvious craniocervical AS had significantly higher levels of AIP compared to those without AS. We suggest that a higher level of AIP may also indicate aggravated microcirculation atherosclerosis; additionally, increased atherosclerotic plaque burden may lead to the detachment of micro-plaques during the thrombectomy procedure, both of which can impair microcirculation blood flow, resulting in reperfusion failure and tissue injury. In our study, AIP was positively associated with the final infarct volume, which may partially explain the relationship between AIP and the FR after MT.

ApoB is the main component of pro-atherosclerotic lipoprotein, including very low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, and lipoprotein (a) [37]. While Apo A1 is the main apolipoprotein in HDL [37]. The Apo B/A1 ratio reflects the balance between proatherogenic and antiatherogenic lipoprotein particles and is considered an indicator of poor cardiovascular outcomes, such as cardiac death and myocardial infarction [16,38,39]. Jung et al. found that the Apo B/A1 ratio showed higher predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes compared with lipoprotein (a) and TC/HDL-C ratio, and a low decreased Apo B/A1 ratio may be a potential marker of major cardiovascular adverse events in patients with LDL-C below 70 mg/dl after percutaneous coronary intervention [37]. For AIS, Kostapanos et al. found that the Apo B/A1 ratio was positively associated with ischemic stroke in men and women over 70 years old [16]. While no study has investigated the relationship between the Apo B/A1 ratio and outcomes of MT for acute LAO. In this study, we firstly identified that the elevated Apo B/A1 ratio indicated a higher risk of FR after MT. Furthermore, we also found that this relationship was obviously significant in female patients. We considered that in this study, the enrolled female patients were aged (median 75, IQR 68-80 years), indicating their postmenopausal estrogen deficiency may contribute to reduced antiatherogenic defenses [40]. As the Apo B/A1 ratio captures the pro-/anti-atherogenic equilibrium, it could be more effectively associated with FR after MT in postmenopausal female patients.

CRI-I (TC/HDL-C) and CRI-II (LDL-C/HDL-C) are also biomarkers representing the relationship between the atherogenic and antiatherogenic lipoproteins [14]. Previous studies have reported that TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C are better predictors of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases than single lipid parameters, such as TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C [41,42]. Zhang et al. found the positive association of TC/HDL-C ratio with total and ischemic stroke risks in both men and women [42]. Sujatha et al. reported that CRI-I was significantly higher in stroke patients compared to controls [43]. In 2023, Liu et al. performed a meta-analysis with 676,678 participants and 18,057 stroke cases, and revealed that both TC/HDL-C ratio and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were positively associated with the risk of stroke [44]. For patients with ischemic stroke, a higher LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was also found to be an independent risk factor for worse functional performance [45]. However, the role of CRI-I and CRI-II in the outcome of patients treated with acute LAO has not been elucidated. In this study, we first put forward that both CRI-I and CRI-II were independently associated with FR following MT. In addition, CRI-II was also positively correlated with the final infarct volume. These results may indicate that these two non-traditional lipid parameters could serve as potential biomarkers for FR after MT.

Hyperglycemia is common in patients with AIS and often owed to underlying diabetes mellitus or stress-related release of norepinephrine and cortisol [46]. Previous studies have confirmed that hyperglycemia is associated with a low rate of recanalization and poor functional outcomes in AIS patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [47,48]. In 2022, Carlos et al. performed a meta-analysis of 8 studies with 5861 patients reporting that patients treated with MT in the hyperglycemia group were less likely to have a favorable functional outcome (mRS < 3) and suffered from an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality [46]. Under ischemic conditions, high glucose levels may aggravate intracellular acidosis, stimulate free radical formation, alter the blood–brain barrier, and promote the thromboinflammatory cascade, all of which may accelerate the progression of ischemic penumbra to infarct tissue [46,49,50]. In our study, we found that serum glucose at admission is a mediator linking non-traditional parameters to FR. Elevated lipid levels may provide the substrate for stress-induced hyperglycemia at the early stage of AIS onset. While, with the recanalization artery and the relief of stress, the requirement for lipid conversion to glucose is reduced, which may explain the result that FBG failed to mediate the association between non-traditional lipid parameters and FR. Nevertheless, fundamental experiments are required to verify our hypothesis.

In our study, we have identified four non-traditional lipid parameters associated with FR after MT for acute LAO. However, these correlations were obtained based on statistical inference, and the underlying mechanisms are not clear, which makes utilization of these results in real-time clinical decision-making remain limited at this stage. In addition, this study also has some limitations. First, the retrospective design in a single center with a limited sample size may hamper the generalization of our study. Next, we will attempt to conduct a multi-center study to verify the results. Second, only parameters at admission were measured to explore their relationship with FR, possibly ignoring the impact of dynamic changes of these parameters on outcomes. Third, the results of this study merely revealed the statistical correlation rather than a causal relationship, and whether reducing the risk parameters can promote the outcome after MT requires further studies. In addition, the modest AUC value of these parameters may indicate insufficient standalone discrimination ability or reflect more intricate mechanisms in FR. Finally, some potential confounding variables were not thoroughly dissected in our study, which may affect the accuracy of the results.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence that AIP, Apo B/A1 ratio, CRI-I, and CRI-II are independent risk factors for FR following MT for acute LAO. AIP and CRI-II are positively correlated with the final infarct volume. These indicators are easily available in medical practice to identify the high risk of worse outcome and may provide a novel target for potentially improving outcomes in patients treated with MT.

We appreciate all the medical staff in our stroke center.
