Synaptic spine loss is an early pathophysiologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) that precedes overt loss of dendritic architecture and frank neurodegeneration. While spine loss signifies a decreased engagement of postsynaptic neurons by presynaptic targets, the degree to which loss of spines and their passive components impacts the excitability of postsynaptic neurons and responses to surviving synaptic inputs is unclear. Using passive multicompartmental models of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), implicated in early AD, we find that spine loss alone drives a boosting of remaining inputs to their proximal and distal dendrites, targeted by CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC), respectively. This boosting effect is higher in distal versus proximal dendrites and can be mediated by spine loss restricted to the distal compartment, enough to impact synaptic input integration, somatodendritic backpropagation, and plateau potential generation. This has particular relevance to very early stages of AD in which pathophysiology extends from EC to CA1.

Information processing by neurons relies on robust integration of synaptic input which ultimately leads to action potential initiation, the principal currency of information flow through neural circuits. Disruption of this process in disease states may underlie cognitive and behavior symptoms. For example, synaptic degeneration is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) (Terry et al.1991; Sze et al.1997; Scheff et al.2007), thought to be driven by amyloid and tau pathology and which may precede frank neurodegeneration (Tzioras et al.2023). Specifically, area CA1 of hippocampus is implicated in early stages with respect to AD pathology and significant synaptic loss, which may contribute to amnestic deficits in pre‐dementia stages (Braak and Braak1991; Scheff et al.2007). According to this pathophysiologic model, CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) at this stage may show decreased action potential output due to reduced synaptic drive.

An alternative impact of spine loss is suggested by a study that linked compromised dendritic architecture of CA1 PNs in an AD transgenic model to increased neuronal excitability (Siskova et al.2014). The authors demonstrated that loss of dendritic membrane, and subsequently of dendritic leak currents, results in an increase of overall input resistance and consequently an aberrant amplification of remaining synaptic inputs. This may contribute to the hyperexcitability mechanisms thought to impact cognitive symptoms and AD pathophysiology (Palop et al.2007; Cirrito et al.2005; de Calignon et al.2012; Liu et al.2012).

This leads to critical questions that pertain to even earlier stages of structural compromise in which spine loss occurs in the absence of dendritic degeneration (Hsieh et al.2006; Bittner et al.2010). Does spine loss alone, with intact dendrites, lead to increased excitability in CA1 PNs? Additionally, the CA1 apical dendrite is compartmentalized, with the proximal dendrite receiving CA3 input and the distal dendrite receiving input from the entorhinal cortex, which is implicated in very early stages of AD (Braak and Braak1991,1997; Lace et al.2009). Thus, can spine loss limited to the much smaller distal apical dendrite alone have an impact on excitability? Given the heterogeneity of CA1 PNs according to somatic depth (Masurkar2018), are superficial (sPN) versus deep PNs (dPN) differentially impacted by these changes? And lastly, does spine loss have other impacts on information processing by CA1 PNs? Here, we leverage passive, multicompartmental computational models of CA1 PNs to simulate spine loss and assess its effects to answer these questions.

Dendrites were designated as distal or proximal dendrites based on the original morphology as visualized within the brain slice of origin. Spines in these dendritic compartments were subsequently modeled by a reduction in local resistanceRindriven by increasedgpas(computed asRin/SpineScale) and an increase in local capacitanceCm(computed asCm*SpineScale). Consequently, a decrease in spines was modeled as an increase ofRin(driven by decreasedgpas) and a decrease inCm. No other active conductances were added to the model.

To model plateau potential generation in the distal dendrite, active conductances were added to the distal dendrite and soma.R‐type calcium channelgR,L‐type calcium channelgL, and calcium‐sensitive potassium channelgKCawere modified from a prior published CA1 PN model (Poirazi et al.2003; Turi et al.2019). Fast sodium channelgNaand delayed rectifier potassium channelgKwere added at the soma.

Simulations were performed with a dt = 0.025. The AlphaSynapse point process (tau = 1 ms,gmax= 0.003 μS,erev= 0 mV) was used to simulate glutamatergic input at random locations in the proximal or distal apical dendritic tuft, with a recording electrode at the soma to record the EPSP in current clamp. Input resistance at the soma was measured using a 1500 ms negative square pulse of current injection (Iinput= −10 pA) and measuring ΔVm/Iinput. The Impedance function was used to plot dendrosomatic or somatodendritic attenuation as a function of frequency by choosing a representative dendritic location and the soma for recording or stimulation, as relevant. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 9. Means were compared using at‐test, while graphs were compared using a 2‐way ANOVA.

The code used to generate the findings is available at:https://github.com/MasurkarLEADS/Spine‐loss‐mediated‐EPSP‐boosting.

We first asked if synaptic responses in the distal dendrite were differentially affected by overall spine loss compared to synaptic responses in the proximal dendrite. To answer this and subsequent questions in this study, we generated passive multicompartment models of 4 CA1 sPNs and 4 CA1 dPNs (Figure1A, upper left), derived from Neurolucida tracing of morphologies visualized via biocytin staining (seeMethods). The models incorporated contributions from experimentally derived spine densities to dendritic resistance and capacitance (Figure1A, lower left and see Methods). Recordings of the somatic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) were simulated in response to the stimulation of multiple (n= 20) synaptic locations in the distal dendrite or proximal dendrite, the sites of entorhinal cortex and CA3 inputs, respectively, with spine density in each compartment equivalently reduced by 20%–80% (Figure1A, right).

For all,n= 8 (4sPNs, 4dPNs), *p< 0.05, **p< 0.001.

With increasing spine loss, somatically recorded EPSPs increased in amplitude (Figure1B). When plotted as a function of total apical spine loss, this “boost” of the EPSP (compared to no spine loss) was surprisingly higher for distal compared to proximal EPSPs (Figure1C). During these simulations, we also measured somatic input resistance (Rinput) via a small negative current injection (see Methods). With a reduction in total spine density, somaticRinputincreased to the same degree as the boost of the proximal EPSP but was less than the boost of the distal EPSP (Figure1D, 80% spine loss). Thus, the boost of the distal EPSP appeared to be additionally driven by local effects on dendritic excitability. We next examined if the EPSP boost from spine loss was differentially evident in superficial versus deep PNs (sPNs, dPNs). When dividing data by neuronal subpopulation, we found that there was no difference in EPSP boosting of distal inputs, but there was more boosting of the proximal dendrite EPSP in sPNs (Figure1E). Given that the boost of the proximal EPSP is closely aligned with increases inRinput, we surmised that this relationship may be stronger in sPNs, which have a shorter distance between their somata and the full extent of their proximal dendrite. Indeed, sPNs showed a statistically significant linear correlation between the increases inRinputand the boost of their proximal dendrite EPSP at 80% spine loss, whereas this relationship was not statistically significant in dPNs (Figure1F).

We then asked if the architecture of the dendritic arbor influences the degree to which spine loss leads to EPSP boosting. We focused on two features: branching complexity, given its influence on electrotonic properties (Rall1959), and dendritic length. We first assessed branching complexity (Figure2A) via the Branching Index (Garcia‐Segura and Perez‐Marquez2014), derived from Sholl analysis (Sholl1953). For both proximal and distal EPSPs, there was no correlation between Branching Index and EPSP boosting (Figure2b,c). We next assessed if the relative length of the proximal dendrite (and its branches) influenced EPSP boosting (Figure2D). In this case, the proximal EPSP boosting was significantly correlated with the percent of the apical dendrite comprised by the proximal compartment (Figure2E), whereas the distal EPSP showed no such correlation (Figure2F). The distal EPSP also did not show correlation with percent of dendrite comprised by the distal dendrite (not shown). This suggests that the boosting effect of the proximal EPSP is largely driven by spine loss in the proximal dendrite. Distal EPSP boosting may have more complex relationships to neuron morphology.

(F) Plot of proximal EPSP boosting versus proximal/total apical length (R2= 0.1827,p= 0.2908). For all,n= 8 (4 sPNs, 4 dPNs).

In the above simulations, the number of synapses stimulated was left unchanged. Yet with spine loss, there may be fewer synapses available to be stimulated. As such, we next asked how the EPSP boosting was affected if the number of stimulated synapses was scaled in accordance with the amount of spine loss (Figure3A). Repeating our simulations with this condition in place, as expected, the EPSP amplitudes were reduced with increasing spine loss (Figure3B). However, when plotted against the expected degree of amplitude reduction (ex. 20% of control amplitude with 80% spine loss), the distal and proximal EPSPs both showed a more tempered reduction (Figure3C). Moreover, the distal EPSPs showed less reduction compared to the proximal EPSPs. We subsequently divided the measured EPSP reduction by the expected reduction to reveal that the EPSP boost in this context increased with spine reduction, and more so for the distal EPSPs (Figure3D). When we examined sPNs and dPNs separately, we again did not find any differences with distal EPSP boosting. However, contrary to when the number of synapses was left unchanged, with the number of stimulated synapses scaled to the amount of spine loss, there was no longer a statistically significant difference in the amount of boosting of the proximal EPSP between the two cell types (Figure3E,F).

We next asked to what extent spine loss‐induced EPSP boosting could occur only in the presence of distal dendrite spine loss. We were motivated to study a scenario that would be more relevant to very early stage AD in which pathologic change begins to transition from EC to CA1 with concomitant changes in the distal dendrite (Braak and Braak1991,1997). We first reduced distal dendrite spines by 20%–80% and stimulated a constant number of synapses (n= 20) in the distal and proximal dendrite (Figure4A). While the EPSP boost was notably less than when total spines were reduced, the distal EPSP still experienced a nearly 30% boost with 80% spine loss (Figure4B). In contrast, the proximal EPSP showed very minimal change. As in AD, spine loss can be localized; we examined how EPSP boosting was impacted if only one or a few branches were impacted. In the example shown (Figure4C,D), a mild degree of distal dendrite EPSP boosting was evident with spine loss restricted to a single distal dendrite branch but appeared to scale upward as additional branches were implicated. We then performed these simulations with the number of stimulated synapses scaled to the degree of spine loss (Figure4E). In this case, the distal synaptic response still slightly outperformed the expected decline (Figure4F) and experienced greater than 40% boosting over the expected decline with 80% spine loss in the distal dendrite (Figure4G). Similar to when total spines were reduced, there was no difference in this effect between sPNs and dPNs (not shown). While this comparative boosting appeared modest, during high frequency input bursts—those that can support long term potentiation—additive effects may amplify its impact. For example (Figure4H), under these conditions a 100 Hz burst of 10 pulses (a component of theta burst stimulation) results in a compound synaptic potential approximately twice as large when the same number of synapses are activated with 80% spine loss compared to control conditions.

Since distal spine loss alone had an impact on distal EPSP amplitude boosting, we next asked if the loss of these spines impacted attenuation of such dendrosomatic propagation at different input frequencies. In this simulation (Figure5A), voltage was injected at a distal dendritic site at various frequencies, and voltage response was measured at the soma. The degree of attenuation,Vsoma/Vdendrite, was compared with intact distal dendrite spines versus with 80% loss of these spines (Figure5B). In this context, while there was a mild improvement of attenuation across frequency with distal spines loss, it was not statistically significant, which may be in line with very local effects of distal spine loss. However, when we compared the degree of attenuation boosting by dividing the two curves across sPNs and dPNs, we noted that dPNs showed a greater degree of attenuation boosting that was most notable at high frequencies (Figure4C). We next simulated somatodendritic attenuation, which is relevant for action potential backpropagation and plasticity (Linden1999; Golding et al.2001), in a similar fashion (Figure5D). In this context, there was less attenuation across all frequencies with distal spine loss (Figure5E). In contrast to dendrosomatic attenuation boosting, there was no difference between sPNs and dPNs (Figure5F).

(I) Plot of distal dendrite peak membrane voltage as a function of somatic current injection.

Lastly, we examined how EPSP boosting and somatodendritic propagation from spine loss could in turn impact plateau potential generation. Distal dendrite plateau potentials have been shown to be critical to the formation of place cells (Bittner et al.2017) and one mechanism can be through the interaction of backpropagating action potentials with local synaptic input (Park et al.2025). To model this, we added active conductances to one of the dPN multicompartmental models (Figure5G; SeeMethods). By coinciding multiple action potentials, generated by a range of somatic current injections, with high frequency distal dendrite synaptic input (10 pulses at 100 Hz across 4 synapses), we found that plateau potentials were more readily generated and were larger in the setting of 80% distal dendrite spine loss compared to no spine loss (Figure5H,I).

In this study, our simulations suggest that spine loss alone in CA1 PNs can mediate a boosting of the remaining inputs to their proximal and distal dendrites, targeted by CA3 and entorhinal cortex, respectively. Moreover, we show that this boosting effect is higher in distal versus proximal dendrites. Though the distal dendrite is a smaller compartment, this effect can also be mediated by loss in the distal dendrite alone to impact synaptic input integration, somatodendritic backpropagation, and plateau potential generation.

In the context of AD, what may be the impact of such EPSP boosting? In early, preclinical stages, this phenomenon may have a positive consequence by maintaining synaptic drive of CA1 PNs and formation of plateau potentials. This may be especially relevant in the context of distal dendrite spine loss, as AD tauopathy begins in preclinical stages in the entorhinal cortex and appears in CA1 in more prodromal stages (Braak and Braak1991; Bennett et al.2005; Lace et al.2009). As such, subtle dysfunction of this efferent area, as well as loss of related synapses in CA1, could be to some degree tolerated via this increased excitability. This boosting, in addition to decreased somatodendritic attenuation to better permit action potential backpropagation, can maintain plateau potential generation, long‐term potentiation, and optimal spatial coding that likely underlie memory‐guided behavior (Linden1999; Hardie and Spruston2009; Bittner et al.2015,2017; Park et al.2025). This is in line with other changes to spines that may have a similar positive role in early stages (Walker and Herskowitz2021). Alternatively, these changes may promote hyperexcitability, which appears to be an important early‐stage pathophysiologic mechanism that may even enhance the spread of AD pathology (Palop et al.2007; Cirrito et al.2005; de Calignon et al.2012; Liu et al.2012). Given that hyperexcitability has been shown to arise in the entorhinal cortex (Xu et al.2015; Rodriguez et al.2020), spine loss‐mediated EPSP boosting may have a negative impact by better facilitating the propagation of this cortical hyperexcitability to CA1. It may have a multiplicative effect in turn via the enhanced intrinsic synaptic integration and capacity for action potential backpropagation, contributing to aberrant plasticity.

These effects are in line with other structural and physiologic changes in AD related to synaptic response and integration. Changes in spine morphology correlating with resilience have been noted (Boros et al.2017,2019) that may enhance synaptic current amplitude or flow through single spines and thus increase EPSP amplitude (Yuste2013). Voltage‐gated ion channels particularly enriched in the distal dendrite, including theA‐type potassium channel (Chen2005), HCN channel (Russo et al.2021), and the GIRK channel (Martin‐Belmonte et al.2022), have all been noted to be decreased in AD models, which would potentiate our findings as well. What remains unclear is whether altered glutamate receptor expression within spines (Sze et al.2001; Hsieh et al.2006; Carter et al.2004; Yeung et al.2021) promotes or tempers these effects. Moreover, amyloid may increase AMPAR desensitization (Shemer et al.2006) or lower the probability of transmitter release due to amyloid (He et al.2019). The impacts of these in this context remain to be explored as well. Additionally, apart from changes in excitation, AD features a reduction in GABAergic interneuron function as well (Hernandez‐Frausto et al.2023). Beyond the loss of a pure subtractive effect on the net excitatory response, reduced inhibitory tone in the dendrite can lead to enhanced somatodendritic spike backpropagation (Tsubokawa and Ross1996) and dendrosomatic coupling of excitatory input to spike generation (Mitchell and Silver2003). Further work is needed to explore the impact of these changes along with spine‐loss mediated synaptic response boosting.

With increasing evidence that CA1 PNs are heterogeneous, including across its radial axis, we also examined if sPNs and dPNs were differentially susceptible to the impacts of spine loss. To this end, we found that sPNs show more boosting of the unitary proximal dendrite EPSP (when proximal spines are also reduced), whereas dPNs show a greater enhancement of dendrosomatic propagation of distal input responses at high frequencies (when only distal spines are reduced). This may derive from baseline differences in morphology, with sPNs having a shorter distance between the soma and proximal dendrite. Furthermore, we selected sPNs and dPNs from a CA1 subregion in which sPNs, compared to dPNs, have a higher spine density in their distal dendrites with a concomitant impact on distal EPSP kinetics (Masurkar et al.2017,2020). Thus, even with spine loss, the additional baseline capacitance from the extra spine density in sPNs may limit attenuation improvement at high frequencies compared to dPNs. Given that distal inputs are likely to be compromised prior to proximal input, as the entorhinal cortex is implicated in AD prior to CA3 (Braak and Braak1991; Lace et al.2009), this would suggest that the dendrosomatic propagation changes (favorable to dPNs) would occur at an earlier stage than the enhancement of the proximal dendrite EPSP (favorable to sPNs). Given the distinct functional roles of sPNs/dPNs and distal/proximal inputs (Masurkar2018; Basu and Siegelbaum2015), how the evolution of these changes during AD impacts memory‐guided behavior is an area of future work.
