Cyberbullying has become a significant concern among adolescents, with various factors contributing to its prevalence. Previous research suggests that social-emotional competence can influence bullying behaviors and cyberbullying, but the mediating roles of bullying, school conflict, and media literacy remain underexplored.

This study aims to investigate how social-emotional competence relates to cyberbullying, specifically examining the mediating roles of bullying behaviors, school fighting, and media literacy among Iranian adolescents.

A descriptive correlational design was employed with a sample of 564 high school students from three cities in China and one city in Tehran, selected through random cluster sampling. Data were collected using four instruments: the Social-Emotional Competence Questionnaire, the Media Literacy Questionnaire, the Illinois Bully Scale and the Cyberbullying Victimization Experience Questionnaire. Path analysis techniques were used for data analysis.

The findings indicated that bullying behaviors, school conflicts, and media literacy significantly mediate the relationship between social-emotional competence and cyberbullying. Specifically, higher social-emotional competence was associated with reduced bullying behaviors and conflict, which in turn contributed to lower levels of cyberbullying.

The study highlights the importance of enhancing social-emotional competence in reducing bullying and cyberbullying. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on promoting social-emotional skills while also addressing bullying and school conflicts. Furthermore, integrating ethical education into media literacy programs is recommended to mitigate cyberbullying among adolescents.

The increasing engagement of students in online environments has profoundly affected their social and emotional development, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged and often unsupervised use of digital platforms has been associated with various adverse outcomes, including increased exposure to cyberbullying. Recent studies show that over 34% of social media users across 29 European countries are categorized as heavy users, with problematic patterns of use strongly linked to diminished psychological well-being [1]. Cyberbullying—defined as intentional, repeated harm inflicted through digital platforms against individuals who find it difficult to defend themselves—has emerged as a significant psychosocial threat to adolescents [2]. Research from both Western and non-Western contexts has documented its far-reaching effects on emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes [3,4].

Although the prevalence and psychological consequences of cyberbullying have been well established, the present study addresses a critical gap by examining how social-emotional competence (SEC) and media literacy jointly act as mediators in cyberbullying prevention. While these constructs have each been studied independently in past research, there is limited empirical work that integrates them within a unified framework or explores their simultaneous influence on adolescents’ online behaviors [5–7]. Moreover, few studies adopt a systems-level perspective that considers both behavioral competencies and cognitive digital skills in tandem. This study advances the field by combining these elements within a cross-cultural path model and testing their collective impact on cyberbullying. In doing so, it contributes a more nuanced understanding of the protective mechanisms that promote ethical and prosocial digital conduct.

SEC refers to an individual’s ability to manage emotions, build supportive relationships, and make responsible decisions [8,9]. Historically, educational institutions have prioritized academic achievement, often at the expense of fostering these competencies [10,11]. The recent global shift toward implementing social-emotional learning (SEL) frameworks in schools reflects a growing awareness of the importance of well-being and social adjustment in educational success [12]. These frameworks aim to develop both intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, including emotional regulation, empathy, and conflict resolution [13,14].

A growing body of research supports the effectiveness of SEC-based interventions in reducing aggression, enhancing peer relationships, and preventing both offline and online forms of bullying [15–18]. By empowering students with tools for emotional awareness and ethical decision-making, SEC programs build resilience and encourage responsible participation in social and digital environments.

In parallel, media literacy—the ability to critically evaluate, interpret, and engage with digital content—has emerged as another essential protective factor against cyber risks. However, traditional media literacy programs often focus on technical and analytical skills while overlooking ethical, affective, or relational dimensions [19–21]. Scholars increasingly argue that media literacy education should be combined with social-emotional competence (SEC) to ensure that students not only understand media content but also consider its impact on themselves and others [22–24]. For instance, research in Indonesian schools has demonstrated that media literacy programs that embed SEL principles significantly reduce cyberbullying behaviors [25].

The severity of this issue is further underscored by findings that nearly 37% of U.S. adolescents have reported being victims of cyberbullying, with similar patterns observed globally [26,27]. In many cases, cyberbullying overlaps with traditional bullying and other aggressive behaviors, such as school fighting, reinforcing the need for a multi-layered approach to prevention [28]. To capture the complexity of these interactions, this study is grounded in Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, which conceptualizes youth behavior as a function of interactions between individual skills, immediate social contexts, and broader sociocultural forces [8,29].

Accordingly, this study develops a conceptual path model to examine how SEC and media literacy jointly and indirectly affect cyberbullying through the mediating variables of bullying and school violence. Prior research has shown that both SEC and media literacy play critical roles in shaping adolescent identity, social responsibility, and digital citizenship [30–32]. Interventions that target both domains are more likely to produce sustained improvements in behavior and online well-being [33–35].

Given the long-term mental health consequences and social costs associated with cyberbullying [3,36], this study offers timely and practical insights. By positioning SEC and media literacy as complementary strengths within an ecological framework and by testing their combined pathways using cross-national data, this research provides educators, policymakers, and researchers with a richer foundation for developing integrated interventions. The conceptual framework for the study is presented in Fig.1, depicting the interrelated structures of influence derived from both theory and empirical evidence.

Higher levels of social-emotional competence are negatively associated with cyberbullying.

Bullying behaviors and fighting mediate the relationship between social-emotional competence and cyberbullying.

Media literacy mediates the relationship between social-emotional competence and cyberbullying, with higher media literacy leading to lower levels of cyberbullying.

This study is classified as applied research and employs a non-experimental design, along with correlational analysis through path modeling, for data collection and analysis. It is framed within a cross-sectional framework to explore associations among variables rather than infer causal relationships. The target population for this research comprises all female high school students in three cities in China (Beijing, Chengdu, and Xi’an) and one city in Iran (Shiraz) during the 2023–2024 academic year. These locations were selected to reflect both cultural diversity and regional differences in digital engagement, as well as the prevalence of cyberbullying. China and Iran represent two distinct socio-cultural contexts where internet access, educational policy, and adolescent digital behavior may vary, thereby enhancing the cross-cultural relevance of the findings.

A total of 564 students were selected using a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. The initial stage involved randomly selecting schools within each city, followed by class-level sampling. Inclusion criteria required participants to be currently enrolled in high school, aged between 14 and 17, and active users of social media. Students with diagnosed cognitive impairments or those who had not used digital platforms in the previous six months were excluded from the study to maintain the validity of responses in media-related measures.

Demographic characteristics of the sample revealed that all participants were female, with an average age of 15.8 years (SD = 0.9). The socio-economic status (SES) of participants was assessed through a brief survey capturing parental education and household income. Approximately 42% of the sample came from middle-income households, 38% from low-income households, and 20% from high-income families. While the sample size is sufficient for structural equation modeling, the use of an all-female sample limits the generalizability of findings to male or mixed-gender populations. Given that gender differences in cyberbullying behavior are well-documented [e.g., 26], the results may reflect gender-specific trends in cyber victimization and emotional regulation. Future studies should replicate this research with more diverse gender compositions to explore potential moderation effects.

Social-Emotional Competence Questionnaire (SECQ): Developed by Zhou and Ee [37], this questionnaire comprises 25 items that assess five dimensions of social-emotional competence (SEC) on a five-point Likert scale: self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management, and responsible decision-making. The validity of this instrument has been established through factor analysis in prior studies conducted by its creators. Furthermore, the current research calculated its reliability at 0.88 using Cronbach’s alpha.

This scale, developed by Espelage and Holt [36], consists of 18 items designed to evaluate behaviors related to bullying, fighting, and victimization, using a five-point Likert scale. The overall reliability coefficient for the scale was determined to be 0.87, with subscale reliabilities of 0.71 for victimization, 0.77 for bullying behaviors, and 0.76 for fighting behaviors. Validity was confirmed through factor analysis as well. In this study, the reliability coefficients for the bullying and fighting components were found to be 0.69 and 0.72, respectively, as determined by Cronbach’s alpha. While the bullying subscale fell slightly below the conventional threshold of 0.70, it was retained based on prior validation and theoretical relevance. This limitation is acknowledged as a minor compromise in measurement consistency that does not significantly undermine overall interpretability.

This instrument, developed and standardized by Simons et al. [29], includes 12 items that assess media literacy among adolescents. It encompasses three components: media engagement, media use, and media perception. In the original research conducted by its authors, reliabilities were reported at 0.63, 0.70, and 0.78, respectively. They also indicated satisfactory validity for this instrument. In the present study, the reliability of this questionnaire was determined to be 0.88 based on Cronbach’s alpha. The notable improvement in reliability may reflect cultural adaptation or consistent interpretation among the target population, although item redundancy could be a potential factor to monitor in future applications.

Designed by Patchin and Hinduja [38], this questionnaire aims to assess experiences related to cyberbullying or cyber victimization among adolescents. Scoring is based on a five-point Likert scale format. It features two factors: (1) cyber victimization and (2) cyberbullying; each consists of nine questions. Research conducted by the developers demonstrated that this instrument possesses adequate validity. Additionally, in this study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for both factors exceeded 0.89, indicating strong reliability overall. For the current research context, the reliability coefficient for the cyberbullying factor was determined to be 0.93 using Cronbach’s alpha. While this value suggests excellent internal consistency, it may also indicate item redundancy, warranting further analysis through item-total correlations or exploratory factor analysis in future research.

The data collection procedure involved administering four established questionnaires to the participants. These surveys were administered in a controlled classroom environment to ensure uniformity and consistency in their presentation. The participants completed the questionnaires under the supervision of trained research assistants who were available to answer any questions or clarify instructions during the process. To minimize bias and ensure the reliability of the responses, the students were assured of confidentiality and anonymity regarding their answers. The entire data collection process spanned two weeks, with all instruments administered simultaneously to allow for the measurement of the relevant constructs at once.

for this study was obtained from both the university’s research ethics committee and the local education authorities in each participating region. Informed consent was obtained from school administrators, parents, and participants themselves. Participants were explicitly informed about the voluntary nature of the study, their right to withdraw at any time, and the confidentiality of their responses. Data were anonymized before analysis to protect participants’ identities and ensure compliance with ethical research standards in cross-cultural studies involving minors.

Once the data collection was completed, the responses were compiled, and the initial dataset underwent data cleaning. Incomplete or inconsistent responses were excluded to maintain the integrity of the data. The final sample retained only those responses with at least 95% completion across all survey items.

The data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through path analysis, a method well-suited for examining the direct and indirect relationships between multiple variables simultaneously. This method allowed for testing the hypothesized relationships between social-emotional competence, bullying behaviors, fighting, media literacy, and cyberbullying victimization. Before conducting the SEM analysis, the data were checked for normality, multicollinearity, and outliers to ensure the validity of the statistical techniques applied.

Descriptive statistics were first calculated for each variable, including means, standard deviations, and reliability coefficients, to summarize the data and assess internal consistency. Cronbach’s alpha was used to evaluate the reliability of the instruments used in the study, and all variables exhibited acceptable internal consistency, with coefficients above 0.69. Next, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to validate the measurement model of the study, ensuring that each instrument accurately measured its intended construct. Once the measurement model was validated, the hypothesized structural model was tested, and path coefficients were estimated.

Bootstrapping procedures were used to assess the significance of indirect effects, allowing for the evaluation of mediation pathways between social-emotional competence and cyberbullying through bullying behaviors, fighting, and media literacy. The model fit was assessed using multiple indices, including the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). These indices provided a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s goodness of fit, ensuring the robustness of the results.

All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS and AMOS software. The significance level for all tests was set atp< 0.05, and the results were interpreted in the context of existing literature to conclude the relationships between the variables under investigation. Findings are discussed in light of the limitations posed by sample homogeneity and regional representation, with caution applied in extending conclusions to broader adolescent populations.

Table1displays the descriptive statistics for the examined sample, including the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, along with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the relevant variables. The data analysis was performed using SPSS-16 and Lisrel-10 software.

As indicated in Table1, the values of skewness and kurtosis (falling between + 2 and − 2) for all research variables suggest that their distribution is normal. Consequently, path analysis can be utilized for data analysis. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was computed to assess the interrelationships among the variables. The findings are displayed as a correlation matrix in Table2.

The matrix indicates that at a significance level ofP< 0.01, social-emotional competence was significantly correlated with cyberbullying (r= -0.249). At the same time, bullying showed a significant relationship with cyberbullying (r= 0.492) and fighting (r= 0.444). Furthermore, atP< 0.01, social-emotional competence was significantly associated with bullying (r= -0.460) and media literacy (r= 0.336). Additionally, bullying was correlated considerably with fighting atP< 0.01 (r= 0.698).

This research developed a conceptual model to elucidate the structural relationships among variables grounded in existing theoretical and empirical literature. It was posited that cognitive abilities and perfectionism serve as mediators in the relationship between perceived parenting styles and obsessive beliefs. Path analysis employing the maximum likelihood method was utilized to evaluate the fit of the proposed models with the collected data and to estimate effect coefficients for each model. Descriptive statistics indicated that the distribution of all variables closely approximated normality; thus, the assumption regarding the normal distribution of data was satisfied. The adequacy of sample size was recognized as a crucial element in modelling. Bentler and Chou (1988), as referenced by Hooman (2009), assert that if the distribution of variables is normal and there are no outliers or missing values, the sample size can be reduced to five observations for each estimated parameter. Consequently, a sample size of 169 participants was deemed sufficient for this study. The bivariate correlation matrix for all variables exhibited an elliptical shape, suggesting the existence of linear relationships among them.

Table3presents the fit indices for the proposed model in relation to the observed data. As noted by Thompson (as cited in Meyers et al., 2012), a selection of overall fit indices—specifically the Chi-Square/df ratio, Normed Fit Index (NFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)—are among the most widely accepted indicators of structural model adequacy. In addition, the Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) was reported to provide further confirmation of model performance. Consequently, these indices were computed for the current study (see Table3; Fig.2). The Chi-Square/df value of 0.016, along with the RMSEA value of 0.0644, falls within the acceptable range for a good model fit. Moreover, the high values for NFI (0.967), CFI (0.986), and GFI (0.984) exceed the commonly recommended threshold of 0.90, indicating strong model fit. Overall, the combination of these indices suggests that the proposed research model provides a favorable and statistically acceptable representation of the data structure.

Table4illustrates the direct and indirect effects in the final model, highlighting the complex relationships between social-emotional competence (SEC), bullying, school fighting, media literacy, and cyberbullying among Iranian adolescents. Among the direct effects, fighting demonstrated a significant positive association with cyberbullying (β = 0.21, SE = 0.06,t= 2.44,R²= 0.20), while bullying exhibited an even stronger positive influence (β = 0.38, SE = 0.08,t= 4.32). Additionally, media literacy had a modest but significant positive impact on cyberbullying (β = 0.14, SE = 0.05,t= 2.17).

Similarly, bullying had a significant influence on fighting, with a strong positive effect (β = 0.65, SE = 0.07,t= 10.91,R²= 0.42), indicating that bullying behaviors are closely linked to physical altercations in school settings. In contrast, SEC had a negative direct effect on bullying (β = -0.37, SE = 0.05,t= -5.04,R²= 0.13), suggesting that higher levels of SEC reduce the likelihood of bullying behaviors. Moreover, SEC positively influenced media literacy (β = 0.38, SE = 0.07,t= 5.18,R²= 0.14), indicating that adolescents with stronger social-emotional skills are more likely to develop media literacy.

For the indirect effects, SEC indirectly reduced fighting (β = -0.24, SE = 0.05,t= -4.59), mediated by its impact on bullying. Furthermore, SEC indirectly reduced cyberbullying (β = -0.13, SE = 0.04,t= -2.65) through pathways involving bullying and fighting. Finally, bullying indirectly increased cyberbullying (β = 0.51, SE = 0.05,t= 2.38), emphasizing its central role as a mediator in the model. These findings underscore the interplay between SEC, bullying, and media literacy in shaping adolescents’ behaviors related to fighting and cyberbullying.

The findings of this study provide evidence that social-emotional competence (SEC) significantly influences cyberbullying among adolescents through the mediating variables of bullying, school fighting, and media literacy. These results reinforce prior research that has emphasized the protective role of SEC in reducing aggressive and harmful behaviors, as highlighted by Llorente et al., Schoeps et al., and Marín-López et al. [16–19]. The current study adds depth to this literature by modeling indirect effects and demonstrating the layered mechanisms by which SEC operates, offering both theoretical and practical extensions to existing knowledge.

In line with studies by Espelage et al. and Nickerson et al. [15,20,28], the current findings indicate that higher levels of SEC are associated with lower instances of bullying and physical aggression. Improvements in self-regulation, empathy, and relationship management mitigate both traditional and cyber forms of aggression. This suggests that SEC functions as a foundational skillset that can buffer adolescents from escalating harmful behaviors, reinforcing the need to embed social-emotional learning (SEL) in school programs and curricula.

Moreover, the finding that bullying and fighting predict cyberbullying supports the notion of behavioral continuity between online and offline contexts, as suggested by Subrahmanyam et al. [31]. The developmental trajectory of aggression from physical to digital forms may reflect both the transferability of behavioral tendencies and the adaptive use of new technologies for opposing ends. Early interventions to interrupt this trajectory are essential.

Notably, the observed relationship between SEC and media literacy corroborates prior work by Tsortanidou et al. [24]. Still, the positive correlation between media literacy and cyberbullying (β = 0.14,p< 0.05) contradicts several studies, including those by Kurniasih et al. [25], which reported a negative association. This divergence may stem from differences in how media literacy is conceptualized. In this study, the scale emphasized media engagement and access rather than ethical or prosocial behavior on social media. As a result, adolescents with higher media literacy may also possess the technical and strategic knowledge to engage in sophisticated forms of cyber-aggression. This finding suggests that media literacy education, in the absence of a strong ethical component, may be insufficient—or even counterproductive—when used in isolation. Future studies should employ revised instruments that assess not only media proficiency but also moral judgment and digital empathy.

Additionally, the absence of subgroup analysis between Iranian and Chinese participants limits the interpretability of culturally influenced variables. Norms surrounding emotional expression, aggression, and media use are likely to differ between these contexts, which may differentially mediate the pathways found in the model. The current findings should thus be interpreted cautiously, and future studies should conduct multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess whether cultural background moderates the effects observed here.

The model’s structure, while statistically supported, was not compared with alternative configurations. Testing reversed, or competing mediation models would enhance confidence in the directional assumptions of the relationships. Future research should adopt such comparisons, particularly in cross-sectional designs where causal inference remains tentative.

Furthermore, several contextual variables known to influence adolescent aggression—such as parental monitoring, school climate, peer norms, and digital supervision—were not examined. Incorporating these into future models could significantly strengthen their explanatory power, as shown in ecological frameworks proposed by Espelage et al. [20] and Bronfenbrenner [8].

In terms of practical implications, the results suggest that schools and policymakers adopt a two-pronged approach that integrates SEC development with ethically focused media literacy. Standalone digital literacy courses may not be enough. Instead, educational programs should actively promote emotional awareness, responsible communication, and reflective use of technology. Teachers, counselors, and school leaders should be trained not only in SEL delivery but also in recognizing how digital behavior intersects with emotional and relational competencies. Tailored interventions can be adapted to meet the specific needs of individuals based on their gender, culture, and age.

Ultimately, while this study provides valuable insights, it also highlights areas that require deeper investigation. Future research should (1) employ longitudinal or experimental designs to confirm causal pathways, (2) validate or improve measurement instruments, especially those assessing media literacy, (3) expand demographic diversity, and (4) include contextual moderators such as family and school environments.

In summary, this study contributes to the cyberbullying literature by presenting a multi-pathway model in which social-emotional competence influences both traditional and digital aggression through behavioral and cognitive mediators. The nuanced relationship between media literacy and cyberbullying highlights the potential unintended consequences of skills-based digital education, underscoring the importance of incorporating moral guidance into online learning. Together, these findings point toward the need for integrated, culturally sensitive, and ethically grounded interventions to address the evolving challenges of adolescent aggression.

The implications of this study are significant for educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals working with adolescents. First, the findings suggest that incorporating social-emotional learning (SEL) programs into school curricula could be an effective strategy for reducing bullying, including cyberbullying. By fostering skills such as emotional regulation, empathy, and responsible decision-making, SEL programs can help students navigate social conflicts and mitigate aggressive behaviors, both in-person and online. Furthermore, while media literacy education is essential, it should be integrated with specific strategies aimed at preventing cyberbullying to enhance its effectiveness. Schools may consider developing tailored interventions that combine social-emotional learning (SEL) and media literacy to fully address the complexities of digital aggression. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of school policies that prioritize emotional and social competencies as part of bullying prevention programs. Lastly, this research underscores the importance of expanding the focus of future studies to encompass diverse populations, examining additional influencing factors such as peer relationships and parental involvement, and employing longitudinal designs better to comprehend the long-term effects of SEL interventions on cyberbullying.

Despite its contributions, this study is subject to several limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, the data were derived from self-reports, which may be susceptible to social desirability bias or inaccurate recall, particularly in sensitive domains such as bullying and cyber-aggression. Future studies could incorporate peer reports, teacher assessments, or behavioral observations to validate findings.

Second, the use of a cross-sectional design precludes any definitive claims about causality or the temporal ordering of variables. Longitudinal studies would provide clearer insight into the causal mechanisms linking SEC, bullying behaviors, media literacy, and cyberbullying over time.

Third, the sample was drawn exclusively from female adolescents in three Chinese cities and one Iranian city. While this homogeneous sample allowed for focused analysis, it limits the generalizability of the findings to other populations, particularly male or non-binary adolescents. Gender differences in cyberbullying behavior are well-documented (e.g., 26), and future research should examine whether the current model holds across diverse gender identities.

Fourth, combining participants from China and Iran without subgroup analysis may mask cultural variability. Cultural norms around aggression, discipline, and media use can differentially impact the constructs under study. Multi-group analysis is recommended to test for invariance and gain a better understanding of the cultural moderators.

Fifth, although the instruments demonstrated good internal consistency, some subscales (e.g., bullying α = 0.69) were slightly below ideal thresholds. Moreover, the media literacy scale did not assess ethical or emotional dimensions of media use, which may limit its predictive validity. Revising and validating this instrument for ethical relevance and cultural sensitivity would enhance the validity of future research.

Lastly, several potentially influential contextual factors—such as school climate, peer group norms, and parental involvement—were not included in the model despite evidence that these variables have a strong influence on bullying behaviors (Espelage et al., 2014). Future studies should integrate these factors to build a more comprehensive ecological model of adolescent aggression.
