We read the interesting work of Romero‑Garcia and colleagues on the association between partial pressure of O2in arterial blood (PaO2) and neurological outcomes in a context of acute brain injury (ABI) [1]. This is a particularly relevant topic as the brain is highly vulnerable to excessive oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to its huge dioxygen (O2) consumption and its high polyunsaturated fatty acid and iron content. The authors showed that high PaO2(hyperoxemia) was associated with poor neurological outcomes and mortality and conclude that it is important to adjust oxygenation strategies in this population [1]. It gives us the opportunity to explore the physiological effect of O2, hyperoxemia and hyperoxia on cerebral blood flow and metabolism beyond the sole results of the present meta-analysis.

Oxidative stress via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the suggested mechanisms to explain the worsened outcomes associated with hyperoxemia [1,2]. To properly understand how O2affects the generation of ROS, it seems important to recall some fundamental of physiology. ROS are a normal product of aerobic metabolism and are generated inside the cells, mainly in the mitochondria [2,3]. Their excessive production is observed in various conditions, but mostly when the O2concentration reaching the cells abruptly changes as it happens during ischemia-reperfusion phenomenon (i.e., generation of superoxyde anion by the degradation of the accumulated hypoxanthine during ischemic phase by the xanthine oxidase following reestablishment of O2supply) [4,5].

However, to hypothesize that hyperoxemia leads to increase ROS is an oversimplified statement [6]. Hyperoxemia refers by definition to a supranormal quantity of O2in the blood (assuming that a normal quantity is observed in a healthy person breathing air at sea level). It usually refers to either the partial pressure of dissolved O2(the PaO2in clinical practice) or the arterial content in O2(pooling both the dissolved O2and the O2carried by hemoglobin). Hyperoxia refers to a supranormal concentration of O2reaching the intracellular compartment. In normobaric (and normothermic) conditions, the absolute quantity of O2transported in its dissolved form is very low due to the low solubility coefficient of O2in blood (Fig.1). This is why a carrier system (the hemoglobin) is needed to supply the global demand in O2[7]. However, only dissolved O2molecules can diffuse through the tissue to reach their effect site [7].

O2journey: from the airways to the mitochondria. Figure 1 represents a schematic representation of the concentration of free O2molecules during their journey from the atmosphere to the cells in a healthy subject. Airway’s cells are directly exposed to O2molecules whose partial pressure varies linearly with the fraction of inspired O2. Then O2molecules diffuse into the capillaries blood where they are loaded by hemoglobin. In standard condition of pressure and temperature, the solubility of O2in blood is very low limiting the concentration of free O2in whole blood. Then in tissue’s capillaries, O2diffuse into the cells depending on their metabolic activities and O2consumption’s rate. Thus, the concentration of O2in blood decreases, allowing the release of O2by hemoglobin according to the metabolic demand and local factors (such as pH through the Bohr’s effect). All the purpose of the blood carrier system is to ensure sufficient O2supply, while limiting its toxicity. One can easily see that except from the airways, other parts of the body, especially the cells are not exposed to high O2concentration and that hyperoxemia is not a surrogate for hyperoxia. In hyperbaric condition, the dissolved O2in blood is dramatically increased so it will diffuse to the cells and increased cellular O2concentration beyond their needs although arteriolar vasoconstriction tends to limit it until a threshold. ATM=atmosphere; PaO2= Arterial blood O2partial pressure; PAO2= Alveolar O2partial pressure; O2= Dioxygen; CaO2=arterial content in O2(where SaO2is the arterial blood O2saturation).

At tissue level, the hemoglobin unloads O2molecules as the surrounding PaO2decreases, in accordance to local consumption rate, phenomenon enhanced by local factors such as Bohr effect [7]. Consequently, in standard conditions of pressure and temperature, the quantity by time unit of supplemental O2administered to the patient (i.e., fraction of inspired O2(FIO2)) and time spent above a specific threshold (the equivalent of oxygen toxicity unit used by the divers) are the paramount variables. Indeed, the cells constitutive of the airways are directly exposed to O2molecules and their potential toxicity, whereas other tissues are protected by the low O2solubility, the O2carrier system and the microcirculation response to excessive arterial dissolved O2concentrations [8]. Previous studies demonstrated that the venoarterial difference in O2which represents the actual quantity of O2delivered to the tissue/cells was not increased -it even slightly decreased- during normobaric and hyperbaric exposure to 100% O2compared to room air [9,10]. More recently a study investigating the O2consumption during deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass during pulmonary endarterectomy surgery provides interesting insights. The authors showed that despite the increase in PaO2(above 500 mmHg) during cooling (from 37 to 18 °C), the venoarterial difference in O2and O2extraction decreased (reflecting the metabolism slowdown related to hypothermia). It demonstrated that the cells used only the O2that they need. It is a well illustration that hyperoxemia does not mean hyperoxia [11].Also, a pilot study compared the level of ROS, according to two level of FIO2(40% and 70%) in mechanically ventilated patients in a context of traumatic brain injury. The blood level of ROS was similar between the two groups, suggesting that the relationship between hyperoxemia and excessive oxidative stress is not that obvious [12].

The effect of hyperoxemia on cerebral blood flow has been extensively studied in animals and humans. In normobaric conditions, to breathe pure oxygen leads to a small non-significant decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) at constant level of arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) [2,13,14]. Furthermore, studying the own effect of O2on CBF cannot be properly done focusing on PaO2alone but should consider other conditions affecting the CBF (i.e., PaCO2, pH, preserved or altered cerebral autoregulation, spontaneous breathing or mechanical ventilation).

The response to change in O2or CO2partial pressures can be blunted or exacerbated following brain injury and evolves dynamically overtime according to clinical evolution [15]. Hyperoxemic vasoconstriction is a protective mechanism whose main purpose is to limit the quantity of O2reaching the tissue and potentially the cells [16,17]. This vasoconstriction is a local, microcirculatory response to the increased periarteriolar O2concentration [17]. Although, the mechanism is incompletely understood, the role of prostaglandins on the hyperoxemic vasoconstriction pathway seems unlikely because of the lack of effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on hyperoxemic vasoconstriction [17,18]. The role of direct vasoconstrictive substances such as leukotrienes seems more convincing to explain those findings [19].

PaO2impact on CBF and metabolism is the cornerstone of the physiologic rationale justifying the use of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO2) following traumatic brain injury, stroke or anoxic encephalopathy [18]. HBO2have been associated with less reperfusion injuries (when applied early) possibly due to decreased endothelial neutrophils adhesion, decreased vascular permeability and vasogenic edema, decreased of intracranial pressure and the redistribution of flow from non-ischemic to ischemic area [20]. Conversely, the paradoxal hypoxia caused by the hyperoxemia-induced vasoconstriction has not been clinically demonstrated [16].

Excessive oxidative stress may occur when flow and O2supply are restored after a transitory ischemia/oligemia or in case of impaired O2diffusion to the tissue (i.e., in case of cerebral edema). So, the timeline between the occurrence of brain injury and the quantity of O2administered as well as the cause of the injury is essential to correctly identify if exposure to high level of O2may be beneficial or harmful [20,21]. From a physiological point of view, dramatically increasing PaO2(above 225–300 mmHg) in normobaric (and normothermic) condition could be potentially harmful because of the low solubility of O2in blood [21,22].

However, in specific cases HBO2could be an interesting therapeutic option. HBO2increases O2delivery even when flow is compromised and has been evaluated in various context of ABI [23]. Pre-clinical investigation showed that HBO2administered within 6 h following different model of ABI was associated with reduced apoptosis, size and severity of the lesions by the maintenance of O2delivery despite ischemia, as well as direct anti-inflammatory effect [20]. Neuroprotective effects through decreased blood brain barrier permeability and its dysfunction were also suggested [20].

Beyond lab models, HBO2has also been evaluated in human patients. In a randomized trial, treatment by HBO2(60 min each 8 h at 1.5 atmosphere for two weeks) implemented in the early phase of traumatic brain injury reduced mortality, particularly in the subgroup of patients with an intracranial pressure over 20 mmHg [23,24]. Conversely, results were contrasted with HBO2in the acute phase of stroke, as resumed by a Cochrane Review from 2014 which conclude that evidence is insufficient to recommend its routinely use [25].

In summary, the effects of supraphysiologic exposure to O2on CBF and intracellular oxidative metabolism are complex and depend on the clinical context, the timing and duration of the exposure following brain injury. In our opinion, the question whether hyperoxemia is beneficial or deleterious will never find a definitive response, since it is not the right way to address it. We believed that the effect of supraphysiologic exposure to O2cannot be addressed in a binary way, where it is safe below a specific threshold and harmful above. Individualizing the effect of O2alone necessitate to closely monitor other covariables such as the cause of ABI, the timing of exposure to high O2concentration, the PaCO2among others.

We believe that the conclusion that hyperoxemia is associated with worse outcomes and higher mortality should be tempered and contextualized. We agreed that in normobaric condition, blindly increasing PaO2could be harmful as it exposes the patient to O2toxicity (particularly the lung) without increasing enough the dissolved O2to have significant advantages. Evidences deriving from HBO2studies and supported by physiological evidence suggest that hyperoxemia could be beneficial in several clinical context. The use of HBO2in context of ABI is still to be evaluated by larger prospective studies as strong clinical evidence are lacking despite encouraging physiological rationale. Result from an ongoing Phase II randomized trial (NCT02407028) evaluating the optimal modality of HBO2to treat acute traumatic brain injury should soon give us valuable insight.
