Osteoporosis is a prevalent condition among postmenopausal women, significantly increasing the risk of fragility fractures. Despite the availability of clinical guidelines, their implementation in primary care, remains highly variable, particularly regarding fracture prevention and shared decision-making (SDM).

We conducted a qualitative study to explore the attitudes and practices of Spanish family physicians in preventing fractures among postmenopausal women. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with physicians from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and levels of clinical experience. Data were analysed using an iterative, theory-driven approach to identify key themes and barriers.

Physicians showed substantial variability in fracture risk assessment approaches, frequently combining tools such as FRAX with clinical judgment. Most were cautious about prescribing bisphosphonates for primary prevention, citing concerns about the strength of the evidence and potential adverse effects. While non-pharmacological strategies, such as lifestyle modifications and fall prevention, were emphasized, their implementation was often constrained by workload pressures. Patient involvement in decision-making was hindered by widespread misconceptions about osteoporosis and its treatment, as well as the lack of appropriate decision-support tools. Participants highlighted the need for clearer guidelines, enhanced educational resources, and accessible decision aids to facilitate patient engagement in care.

This study highlights the complex challenges family physicians face in fracture prevention among postmenopausal women, including heterogeneity of recommendations in guidelines, limited SDM implementation, and systemic barriers within primary care. Addressing these issues will require multifaceted interventions targeting both healthcare system constraints and patient education. Future efforts should focus on developing and implementing strategies that support evidence-based, patient-centred decision-making while accounting for the realities of primary care practice.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a prevalent chronic condition that predominantly affects women over 50, leading to increased bone fragility and a higher risk of fragility fractures (FF) [1]. In Spain, an estimated 2.4 million individuals over 50 are affected by OP, with women accounting for nearly 80% of cases [2]. OP contributes to a substantial burden on the healthcare system, with approximately 204,000 new fractures annually and associated costs reaching €2.84 billion, representing 2.8% of Spain’s healthcare expenditure [3]. As the population ages and life expectancy rises, the prevalence of OP and related fractures is expected to increase [4]. Projections for Europe suggest a 40% increase in fracture incidence and a 30% rise in costs by 2030, highlighting the need for continued focus on prevention and management strategies [5].

A study across several regions in Spain found that among individuals aged ≥ 70 visiting primary healthcare centres (PHC), the prevalence of FFs was 18%, highlighting a significant public health issue [6]. Effective screening and preventive treatment strategies are crucial, yet research indicates that many elderly individuals with FFs remain undiagnosed with OP, leading to suboptimal treatment. Furthermore, many FFs are not directly attributed to bone fragility, and osteoporosis often remains asymptomatic—only one-third of vertebral fractures cause noticeable symptoms—resulting in an underestimation of its true prevalence. In a prospective multicentre study of 487 participants (mean age 83.1 years), 22% had a previous non-hip low-trauma fracture, yet only 16% received osteoporosis treatment, and just 3% underwent bone densitometry [7].

In 1994, the World Health Organization (WHO) established diagnostic criteria for OP based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, BMD has limited predictive value for FFs, particularly in low-risk populations, and its low sensitivity (40%) makes it unsuitable as a standalone screening tool [8–10]. Current screening recommendations emphasize absolute fracture risk, yet clinical guidelines (CG) provide varying thresholds. For example, some Spanish CG recommend BMD assessment when a patient’s 10-year fracture risk exceeds 10% [9]. Risk estimation is based on a combination of clinical risk factors, and tools such as FRAX [10,11]. However, there is no clear consensus on what constitutes high risk of fracture contributing to variability in clinical decision-making [8–10].

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most widely used pharmacological agents for the prevention of FFs in OP [11–13]. In the context of primary prevention, it is important to distinguish between women from the general population without a prior fracture or diagnosed osteoporosis, and women with known osteoporosis (low BMD, T-score ≤ −2.5) but no prior fracture. Although BPs are generally not recommended for primary prevention in low-risk women from the general population, evidence shows they can effectively reduce fracture risk in women with low BMD [1,2]. A network metanalysis showed that for primary prevention, only zoledronate (administrated every 18 months) significantly reduced both vertebral (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28–0.74) and nonvertebral (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51–0.85) fractures [12]. However, a Spanish cohort study of women aged ≥ 60 years found no significant differences in total fracture rates between those receiving calcium and vitamin D (CalVitD) alone versus those prescribed BPs (HR = 0.934, 95% CI 0.67–1.31) [14]. Furthermore, long-term BPs use has been associated with side effects including atypical fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw [13].

This study aims to qualitatively explore current practices in FFs prevention within the Spanish PHC context, as well as the state of patient involvement and SDM in fracture prevention. Hence our objectives are threefold: to assess Spanish FPs’ attitudes and practices regarding fracture prevention in postmenopausal women; to explore women’s involvement in decision-making from the FPs perspective; and, to explore FPs views on SDM and their perceptions regarding the implementation of decision aids in FFs prevention.

We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to explore the perspectives of FPs on their attitudes and practices regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of primary fractures in postmenopausal women [22,23]. Additionally, we examined their perceptions of patient involvement in SDM.

This study is part of the Decision Analysis in Shared Decision-Making for Osteoporosis (DASH-Osteo) project, which aims to inform the development of a SDM support tool incorporating a decision-analysis model. The tool is designed to facilitate collaborative decision-making between women and their FPs considering pharmacological prophylaxis for FFs prevention.

The DASH-Osteo project is co-funded by theInstituto de Salud Carlos III(ID: PI20/00681) and the European Regional Development Fund (“A way to make Europe”).

Recruitment took place between February to October 2021. We included FPs practicing in PHC located in three Spanish regions: Canary Islands, Catalonia and Madrid. We excluded FPs with additional specific training in rheumatology or gynaecology given their potentially distinct approaches to OP treatment. We also excluded FPs working in non-standard PHC settings (i.e., PHC for hospitalized patients), although this criterion was established post-recruitment during data analysis.

FPs were approached via purposeful sampling through email. Recruitment followed a two-phased process: Initial recruitment involved contacting colleagues of FPs affiliated with the DASH-Osteo project. Secondly, we used a snowball sampling technique, with participating FPs asked to recommend colleagues practicing in neighbourhoods not yet represented.

FPs agreeing to participate received written study information from the research centre, detailing study objectives, interview procedures, and confidential measures. Participation was confirmed only after written informed consent was obtained via email. Recruitment ceased when data saturation was reached, defined as successive interviews yielding no new information [22,23]. A minimum of 15 interviews was planned to ensure data sufficiency.

The study adhered to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and the ethics committee of the UniversityHospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain, waived the need for ethics approval for this study (Ref: IIBSP-TDC-2021-22). All participants gave written informed consent to participate.

Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted by two researchers (ML-G, and YA) using an online format due to COVID-19-related restrictions at the time of data collection. Each interview lasted approximately one hour, was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Additionally, researchers took observational notes to capture both explicit and subtle reactions of participants [22,23].

Participants completed a questionnaire on their gender, age, years of experience in PHC. Socioeconomic level of the neighbourhood (SE) where their centre was located was extracted fromThe National Institute of Statistics(INE). We also asked open-ended questions on their role as FPs, the proportion of patients over 50 years old that consult on their regular practice, and their satisfaction with working as FPs in public PHC (rated from 1 [not satisfied] to 10 [very satisfied]) with justification for the score.

The second part of the interview contained open-ended questions on three domains (Table1). Questions were designed to ensure comprehensive coverage of predefined themes, while allowing for emergent topics. The interview guide was pilot-tested with two participants from different regions to assess clarity and relevance.

▪ Describe typical profile of women at risk of primary fracture.

▪ Describe usual care practices and instruments for screening and establishment of fracture risk.

▪ Describe criteria for preventive BPs or other strategies in primary fracture.

▪ Describe criteria for treatment with BPs or non-pharmacological in primary fracture.

▪ Describe facilitators and difficulties you meet.

▪ Women’s involvement in this decision-making process.

▪ What is the level of knowledge on osteoporotic fracture and the sources of information women use to inform this decision.

▪ What is FPs understanding of shared decision making.

▪ Which ways or strategies do they follow to inform decisions.

▪ What is their knowledge of decisions aid for this context and/other health decisions.

The interview guide (Appendix 1) was developed based on a conceptual framework (Fig.1) and Merle et al. study, that assessed FPs osteoporosis prevention practice, in France [21]. It was adapted to the Spanish PHC setting with input from the research group.

The analysed dataset included audio recordings and field notes from the interviews. All interviews were fully transcribed, and all data was handled confidentially. The recordings and transcripts were securely stored within the Epidemiology Department of Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau. The interviews and transcriptions were conducted in Spanish; for this publication, selected quotes were translated into English and reviewed by a native English scientific writer to ensure linguistic accuracy and consistency.

Data preparation: One researcher uploaded the transcripts into a qualitative data analysis software (Nvivo version12).

Open coding: Two researchers (M.L-G, EC) independently reviewed a subset of transcripts (n= 10) and developed an initial list of potential codes. Regular meetings were held to discuss coding results, resolve discrepancies, and develop a provisional codebook. The codebook included operational definitions and inclusion/exclusion criteria for each code.

Coding process: The same two researchers independently coded a selected set of transcripts (n= 4, chosen based on FPs gender, years of experience and on PHC location) using the provisional codebook. Any coding discrepancies were discussed, leading to refinements in the codebook. The iterative process of coding, inter-rater reliability assessment, codebook refinement, and recoding continued until Cohen’s kappa (κ) exceeded an average κ > 0.80, indicating “very good inter-rater agreement”. Inter -rater reliability was assessed using Cohen’s kappa (κ) in SPSS (version 29), considering κ < 0.20” poor”, 0.21–0.40 “fair”, 0.41–0.60 “moderate”, 0.61–0.80 “good”, and > 0.80 “very good” agreement between coders [25].

Synthesis of findings: A code report was generated, detailing the complete list of codes and their frequency. Two researchers systematically explored descriptive themes examining codes aggregation, relationships between codes, and associations with participant characteristics [23,24,26]. The researchers team collectively reviewed and approved the final synthesis of findings.

To enhance the validity and quality of the study, we adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines [27]. The COREQ checklist was followed throughout all stages of study design, data collection, analysis, and reporting to ensure comprehensive and transparent reporting of our qualitative research. Additionally, to strengthen methodological rigor and transparency, we engaged in ongoing reflexive discussions throughout the research process, critically.

examining potential biases and interpretative frameworks influencing data analysis (see Appendix 2 to see considerations and strategies employed to mitigate potential biases).

Findings are reported narratively, complemented by verbatim examples presented in a tabulated format to illustrate key insights.

We conducted 17 interviews, with the majority taking place in Barcelona (47%) and Madrid (35%), as these urban centres were expected to provide greater participant variability. In contrast, Tenerife accounted for 18% of the interviews. Gender representation was balanced (1:1 ratio).

Most participants (44%) were between 50 and 59 years old, and 41% had 20 to 29 years of experience as FPs. We successfully gathered information from all socioeconomic (SE) levels, except for high-income settings, which were underrepresented (Table2).

Regarding job satisfaction, the majority (65%) reported a score of 8 or higher, citing passion for their work and the ability to serve as the gateway to healthcare and implement preventive strategies as key motivators. In contrast, those reporting lower satisfaction scores, highlighted a lack of resources, challenges in managing complex chronic conditions, and a high workload demands as key concerns.

All audio recordings and transcripts were thoroughly reviewed. One interview was excluded because the participant worked in a non-traditional PHC setting, resulting in 16 interviews being analysed. Throughout this section, illustrative quotes from FPs are referenced as [Q1], [Q2], etc., with full verbatim quotes available in Appendix 3.

Fracture risk assessment: including risk factors, tools used in clinical practice, as well as the criteria for requesting bone mineral density (BMD) tests. Additionally, facilitators and barriers to risk assessment were identified.

Preventive treatment: the use of bisphosphonates as the main pharmacological treatment and the implementation of non-pharmacological strategies were explored. The role of other healthcare professionals in fracture prevention was also examined.

Additionally, we examined FPs perceptions ofshared decision-making (SDM)and their experiences with SDM tools in clinical practice, as well as challenges and opportunities for integrating SDM into primary fracture prevention care.

FPs assess risk factors through clinical interviews and medical history, emphasizing both modifiable factors (e.g., calcium intake, physical activity, smoking) and non-modifiable ones (e.g., corticosteroid use, prior fractures).

Most participants reported familiarity with national clinical guidelines and frequently use the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) to guide decisions on BMD testing. Some FPs noted that FRAX®is integrated into their health centre’s electronic system, facilitating access and use during consultations.

Participants did not completely adhere to any single guideline when determining the BMD testing necessity. Instead, they prioritized individualized decision-making guided by CGs, typically requesting BMD when patients presented one or more key risk factors. Commonly cited risk factors prompting a BMD request included: chronic corticosteroid use, previous fractures, low BMI, and smoking.

Although age was considered relevant, FPs agreed that lifestyle and overall health status played a more decisive role [Q1]. However, there was general consensus that women over 60 should undergo BMD assessment. Participants did not follow a fixed criterion regarding BMD testing frequency. However, in cases where a woman over 60 had a T-score indicating osteopenia, follow-up BMD tests were typically performed every two years.

Interviewees identified facilitators and barriers in fracture risk detection. However, opinions differed whether certain elements acted as obstacles or facilitators. For instance, while many FPs reported relying on clear clinical guidelines (CGs), others cited a lack of clear guidelines as a challenge [Q2].

Nurse’ role: nursing staff played a key role in identifying and referring at-risk patients improving early detection and continuity of care.

Physician training: FPs emphasized the importance of education and training in fracture risk assessment.

Electronic records: Incorporating fracture risk factors into the electronic medical records could facilitate systematic risk evaluation and management.

Socioeconomic disparities: Lower SE populations exhibited reduced awareness and demand for bone health evaluations, whereas in higher SE areas demonstrate, greater awareness and proactive screening.

Private healthcare influence: Some FPs criticized private health care settings for offering unnecessary BMD tests and promoting imprecise diagnoses, overdiagnosis and consequently overtreatment.

Role of some specialists: Rheumatology, was perceived as more medicalized, favouring the prescription of treatments even in low-risk cases.

Healthcare system constraints: Time constraint, high workload, poor coordination between PHC and specialists, and the absence of risk assessment tools adapted to the Spanish context were common barriers.

Regarding the role of primary care in case detection, while continuity of care facilitates identifying cases, the high volume of preventive activities limits the ability to assess fracture risk [Q3]. Additionally, all participants reported a significant decline in active case detection during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. What was previously an “occasional” detection becoming “rare or almost non-existent” [Q4].

Clinical guidelines: some FPs reporting them as a useful reference, while others highlighted the lack of clear diagnostic guidelines.

Role of primary care: in case detection, as continuity of care facilitates the identification of at-risk patients, but the high workload limits active risk assessment.

Doctor-patient relationship, with divided opinions on the usefulness of BMD and FRAX as tools for SDM.

Patient demand and media influence: both can increase awareness of osteoporosis but also lead to excessive requests for unnecessary tests and promote a more medicalized approach to treatment.

Participants reported that many postmenopausal women hold misconceptions about osteoporosis and fracture risk. A common belief is that osteoporosis causes pain, leading some patients to confuse osteoporosis with osteoarthritis [Q15].

Women also tend to over-rely on BMD as the sole diagnostic tool, often requesting densitometry without considering other risk factors that contribute to fracture risk [Q16]. FPs emphasized that women who had witnessed a family member or close friend experience an osteoporotic fracture were more likely to seek medical advice and request monitoring and diagnostic tests [Q17]. However, FPs noted that this heightened awareness did not necessarily translate into proactive lifestyle changes (e.g., healthy diet, regular exercise, tobacco cessation). Instead, many women sought pharmacological treatment out of fear of fragility fractures rather than as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy [Q18].

FPs noted that a common misconception among patients was the belief that BPs cure osteoporosis rather than prevent fractures, leading to unrealistic expectations about treatment outcomes [Q19]. On the other hand, some FPs reported that women are hesitant to take BPs due to concerns about adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues such as heartburn, which they tended to exaggerate [Q20]. This lack of understanding about both treatment benefits and risks reflected a broader gap in osteoporosis awareness, with many women failing to recognize that fracture prevention is an ongoing process that should begin early in life.

Some FPs observed that their patients believe taking calcium and vitamin D supplements is sufficient for non-pharmacological prevention [Q21]. FPs noted that many women had a highly medicalized perception of osteoporosis, associating it only with menopause rather than recognizing the importance of long-term lifestyle factors.

[Q22]. Furthermore, FPs highlighted barriers to behaviour change, noting that many patients did not perceive physical activity as a protective factor for bone health, associating it more with cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, smoking was rarely seen as a risk factor for osteoporosis, despite its well-documented impact on bone density [Q23].

FPs also noted that socioeconomic status (SES) played a significant role in self-care behaviours. Women from higher SES backgrounds were generally more inclined to adopt healthy lifestyle habits, whereas those from lower SES groups were more likely to seek pharmaceutical solutions. Additionally, women who were primary caregivers often prioritized the well-being of others over their own health, resulting in delayed self-care and osteoporosis management [Q24].

B2. Sources of information impact on fracture risk for postmenopausal women.

Some participants noted that postmenopausal women often request unnecessary tests influenced of other peers of the same age. In some instances, participants acknowledged ordering densitometry tests due to patient pressure, even in the absence of clear clinical indications for such testing [Q25].

FPs also highlighted the role of media in raising awareness of fracture risk, they perceive its influence as counterproductive, as it often promotes unnecessary BMD and an overuse of pharmacological treatments. FPs believe that overall, the quality of information available to patients is generally limited, biased, and unverified. This misinformation led to misunderstandings, with a harmful influence from the pharmaceutical industry that is mainly seconded by private sector specialists [Q26].

Participants expressed a strong desire to empower patients to actively participate in decision-making regarding their healthcare. While densitometry was recognized as a.

valuable tool for facilitating discussions about bone health during consultations, they acknowledge that patients often struggled to interpret results [Q27]. FPs suggested several strategies to enhance patient engagement: developing and implementing decision aids to help patients better understand fracture risk and treatment options, provide support tools for healthcare professionals to improve communication and patient education, and expanding outreach and preventive programs in low-income and underserved communities, where osteoporosis awareness and engagement in preventive measures were lower.

Physicians acknowledge their primary role in the SDM process as educators and facilitators, responsible for explaining available diagnostic tests and treatment options, discussing potential benefits and side effects, and helping patients weigh risk s and make informed choices [Q31].

Only by this approach, they argued, can FPs involve patients effectively in SDM and develop a treatment plan that fits patient’s context [Q32].

Despite acknowledging the importance of documenting treatment decisions, most physicians reported that their clinical records only capture whether bisphosphonates (BPs) were prescribed, including details such as dosage and duration. However, they rarely document other critical aspects of SDM, such as patient willingness to undergo BMD, reasons for treatment refusal, including concerns about side effects [Q33].

All participants recognized the need for SDM support tools to facilitate reflection, discussion and informed decision-making. While some participants were aware of international decision aids, almost none actively used these types of tools in their daily clinical practice [Q34].

Using deductive approach, we categorized FPs’ perceptions on barriers to implement SDM support tools in the clinical practice, drawing on existing literature. The most significant barrier was lack of consultation time, which received the highest difficulty score (Appendix 4). Other major obstacles included limited institutional support for integrating SDM tools into clinical workflows and a lack of clear policies or mandates from policy makers regarding the use of SDM support tools.

i) Embedding SDM within evidence-based protocols to ensure consistent implementation.

We did not find any association between FPs PHC location, gender, or SE level of the neighbourhood where their PHC was located. However, when asked about additional challenges in implementing fracture prevention and SDM, participants identified several key difficulties, including: patients’ lower education levels, who may struggle to understand medical information, such as graphs or technical terms; language and cultural barriers: some patients faced communication difficulties, making it harder to comprehend risk information and treatment options and, the shift toward telemedicine consultations during and after COVID-19, was perceived as a barrier, as it limited the effectiveness of decision aids, particularly for patients requiring more personalized discussions and visual explanations [Q35].

Our study identified several key insights. First, there is considerable variability in screening practices and fracture risk assessment among Spanish FPs, largely due to the absence of clear clinical guidelines. Participants expressed significant uncertainty regarding the prescription of BPs for primary fracture prevention, primarily due to concerns about side effects and the lack of clear clinical guidance [1]. While non-pharmacological preventive measures are considered essential, engaging patients in lifestyle changes remains a challenge [5]. Physicians noted significant knowledge gaps and misconceptions among patients regarding osteoporosis and fracture risk [13], and they acknowledge the importance of shared decision-making and the use of decision aids to support this process. However, multiple barriers hinder its implementation in clinical practice.

The variability in screening and fracture risk assessment aligns with previous research on osteoporosis management in primary care, which showed ample variability. For instance, Merle et al. found that French general practitioners reported inconsistent use of fracture risk assessment tools and bone mineral density tests [18]. This suggests that, despite the availability of clinical guidelines, their implementation in primary care remains suboptimal.

The recommendations of the 2018 Spanish Society of Rheumatology (SER) CG emphasize the importance of a comprehensive fracture risk assessment, including both BMD and risk factors assessment [2]. In addition, the SER recommends using tools such as FRAX for fracture risk assessment, reflected in the practices of some of the FPs interviewed in our study. However, the inconsistency in adherence to these recommendations as well as other clinical guidelines (SEMFyC), observed in our study underscores the need for greater dissemination and implementation of these CGs in PHC practice [10].

The emphasis placed on non-pharmacological interventions by FPs in our study reflects the growing recognition of lifestyle factors in fracture prevention. Research has demonstrated that interventions such as prescribed physical exercise—particularly multicomponent training—can effectively delay and even reverse bone fragility [5]. Additionally, FPs highlighted the importance of fall prevention measures as a key strategy in reducing fracture risk [4]. The challenges reported in implementing these strategies align with findings from a recent systematic review by Sale et al., which identified a lack of time and resources as major barriers to lifestyle counselling in osteoporosis management [13].

Our finding that FPs are reluctant to prescribe BPs for primary prevention aligns with recent clinical guidelines. The update of the American College of Physicians guidelines emphasized the limited evidence supporting the efficacy of BPs for primary fracture prevention [1]. While guidelines generally recommend considering pharmacological treatment for patients at high fracture risk—even in the absence of a prior fracture—our study found that FPs primarily prescribe BPs exclusively for secondary prevention. This highlights the challenge FPs face in balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment when making decisions for patients without a history of fractures. On the other hand, the participants’ perception of potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment in the private sector is concerning. This observation suggests that there could be misaligned incentives in different clinical practice settings, which could lead to unjustified variability in care [10].

Our findings regarding patients’ knowledge gaps and misconceptions are similar to those reported in previous studies exploring patients’ perspectives on osteoporosis. For example, Sale et al. found that many patients had a limited understanding of fracture risk factors and overestimated the effectiveness of calcium supplements [13]. The barriers to share decision-making implementation identified in our study, particularly consultation time constraints, align closely with those reported in the literature, like Gravel et al.‘s systematic review of healthcare professionals’ perceptions of SDM [19]. Recent studies in other healthcare settings further corroborate these findings. Bullock et al. identified several barriers relating to clinical and shared decision-making about bone health and osteoporosis medicines, with lack of consultation time being one of the most significant obstacles [28]. Additionally, Bennett et al.‘s study exploring barriers across the acute-to-primary care interface found that while healthcare professionals’ value SDM, there are practical challenges to its consistent application, including interprofessional communication issues and role ambiguity between primary care and specialized services [29].

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Social desirability bias could have influenced participants’ responses, potentially leading to an overestimation of adherence to guidelines or shared decision-making (SDM) practices. Additionally, the study did not include patient perspectives, which might have provided valuable complementary insights.

Despite these limitations, our study has notable strengths. The sample included a diverse range of participants in terms of geographical location, years of experience, and the socioeconomic context of their practice settings. Moreover, the use of semi-structured interviews enabled an in-depth exploration of participants’ attitudes and practices. Finally, the rigorous qualitative analysis approach, including independent coding by multiple researchers, strengthens the credibility and reliability of our findings.

The findings highlight the need for clearer and more actionable clinical CGs for fracture risk assessment and primary prevention of OP in primary healthcare. Policymakers should focus on improving the implementation of these guidelines by addressing systemic barriers, such as time constraints, lack of decision-support tools, and inconsistencies between public and private sector practices. Family practice teaching units should incorporate structured training on osteoporosis management and shared decision-making (SDM) to ensure FPs are equipped with practical approaches for risk communication. Additionally, hospital and private practice physicians should collaborate more closely with FPs to align fracture prevention strategies and ensure consistent, evidence-based care. Enhancing patient education is also critical to addressing knowledge gaps and misconceptions regarding osteoporosis and fracture risk, ultimately improving adherence to preventive measures.

Future research should explore strategies to better integrate clinical guidelines into primary care, addressing structural and systemic barriers. Additionally, research should explore the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including patients, specialists, and policymakers, to identify key facilitators and barriers to effective osteoporosis management [16]. Coordination models such as the Fracture Liaison Service (FLS), although focused on secondary prevention, could inspire similar frameworks to enhance communication between primary and secondary care in the context of primary prevention [30]. It should also prioritize the development and evaluation of decision-support tools for osteoporosis, ensuring their clinical utility and impact on treatment adherence. Defining optimal risk thresholds for bisphosphonate prescription through real-world effectiveness studies is essential, alongside investigating socioeconomic factors and misinformation’s influence on patient decisions. Evaluating the roles of nurses and pharmacists in fracture prevention could provide insights into expanding multidisciplinary care approaches. Additionally, studies should assess the effectiveness of different shared decision-making (SDM) strategies across various healthcare settings, considering patient demographics, healthcare system structures, and cultural attitudes.

Our study highlights the complex challenges family physicians face in fracture prevention among postmenopausal women. Addressing these challenges will require multifaceted interventions that target both healthcare system factors and patient education. Future efforts should focus on developing and implementing strategies that support evidence-based, patient-centred decision-making while considering the constraints of primary healthcare practice.
