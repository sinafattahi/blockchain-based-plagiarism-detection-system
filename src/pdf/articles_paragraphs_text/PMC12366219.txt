Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome resulting from uncontrolled activation of T cells and macrophages, frequently leading to multiorgan failure. Severe lactic acidosis (lactate ≥ 10 mmol/L), a rare yet critical manifestation, poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the intensive care unit. Here, we report two cases of Chinese men with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presenting with extreme lactic acidosis, highlighting the necessity of early hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis screening in intensive care unit patients with unexplained hyperlactatemia.

Case 1: A 43-year-old Chinese male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, presenting with lactate 14.2 mmol/L, cytopenia, and hyperferritinemia. Etoposide therapy rapidly normalized lactate levels (within 24 hours) and led to complete recovery after autologous stem cell transplantation. Case 2: A 60-year-old Chinese male with chronic gout and soft tissue infection developed septic shock and reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (lactate 14.3 mmol/L). Despite initial response to etoposide, he succumbed to invasive aspergillosis due to treatment-related immunosuppression.

Extreme lactic acidosis in intensive care unit patients should prompt urgent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis evaluation, particularly in Chinese populations. Etoposide is effective for malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, while reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may require tailored immunosuppression with strict infection prophylaxis. Routine reporting of patient ethnicity aids epidemiological understanding of rare diseases such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of excessive inflammatory response caused by primary or secondary immune system imbalance, characterized by uncontrolled activation of cytotoxic T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, leading to high cytokine levels and immune-mediated multiorgan and multisystem damage [1]. HLH can be divided into two categories on the basis of its pathogenesis: primary (hereditary) and secondary. Primary HLH is more common in children, while secondary HLH can occur at all ages and is often triggered by infections (viruses, bacteria, rare pathogens), tumors, and autoimmune diseases [2–5].

Although HLH is currently defined as a rare disease [6], the symptoms it presents are common. Clinical and laboratory manifestations include fever, decreased blood cells, splenomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated ferritin, and decreased NK cell function. It can be accompanied by neurological dysfunction, coagulation disorders, liver dysfunction, complex clinical manifestations, a lack of specific symptoms, an easy-to-miss diagnosis, and a rapid onset, progression, and high mortality rate. Early identification, diagnosis, and treatment are crucial.

Currently, the HLH-2004 [7] standard is used, but this standard was developed from clinical data of pediatric hemophagocytic syndrome, and there is insufficient understanding of adult hemophagocytic syndrome (Table1). In addition, some variables that need to be measured in the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria (NK cell activity and soluble interleukin-2 receptor level) are not easily obtained in many hospitals, and the weights of each criterion in the scoring system are unknown. The H scoring system currently developed by Farderet al. is the first validated HLH scoring system in adult patients [8,9]. The scoring system includes nine criteria: three clinical variables (potential immunosuppression, fever, immune abnormalities); five laboratory test variables (triglycerides, ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, fibrinogen levels, and blood cell reduction), and one cytological variable (hemophagocytic characteristics of bone marrow puncture; Table2).

The overlap of HLH with sepsis and other critical illnesses complicates diagnosis, particularly when atypical features such as extreme lactic acidosis dominate the clinical presentation. We report two cases of HPS with severe lactic acidosis, emphasizing diagnostic challenges and therapeutic implications.

A 43-year-old Chinese male with mild hypothyroidism presented with fever (max temperature 38.2 °C); fatigue; tachycardia (140–150 beats per minute) and hypotension (60/40 mmHg); hemoglobin 79 g/L (normal 130–175 g/L); platelets 65 × 109/L (normal: 150–450 × 109/L); hyperferritinemia (1639.73 ng/mL); lactic acidosis (14.2 mmol/L); and splenomegaly. The therapeutic effect of drugs such as anti shock, fluid replacement, and pressure boosting were not satisfactory; chest tightness and palpitations worsened; progressive reduction of his blood cells was noted; and the decline in lactate level was not significant. We excluded septic shock and sepsis, considered that hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was highly likely, and performed a bone marrow biopsy. Etoposide (VP-16) 160 mg was initiated immediately, and lactate levels rapidly decreased from 14.2 mmol/L to 4.4 mmol/L within 24 hours post-etoposide administration (Fig.1). The bone marrow morphology examination showed a phagocytic cell proportion of 2%, with visible hemophagocytosis and phagocytosis of granulocytes, red blood cells, and platelets. In addition, sCD25 was > 44,000, and the bone marrow biopsy results later revealed diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The patient subsequently underwent autologous stem cell transplantation for lymphoma and achieved complete recovery.

A 60-year-old Chinese male with a long history of gout, smoking, and alcohol use presented with worsening gouty arthritis and self-inflicted skin ulcers that led to infection and septic shock. Ultrasound showed subcutaneous abscess, and the antibacterial treatment effect was poor. The patient developed high fever (39 °C), decreased blood pressure 89/59 mmHg, heart rate elevated to 130 beats per minute, mental disorder, and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Initial laboratory findings included severe anemia (hemoglobin 62 g/L); thrombocytopenia (platelets 236 × 109/L); elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin 1300 ng/mL; IL-6 and CRP above the detection limit; PCT 6.81 ng/mL); and coagulation dysfunction (prothrombin time 22.2 seconds; D-dimer 2551 μg/L; fibrinogen 7.44 g/L). Despite initial stabilization with antibiotics and corticosteroids, he experienced a relapse characterized by lactic acidosis (lactate 14.3 mmol/L) and pancytopenia (platelets decreased to 15 × 109/L; fibrinogen to 1.19 g/L). The physician posited that excessive inflammation and bone destruction resulting from gout could potentially lead to bone marrow failure and increase the risk of hemophagocytic syndrome. Therefore, they recommended enhancing bone marrow puncture procedures and NK cell activity assessments. HLH was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow biopsy findings. Owing to recurrent fever and cytopenia after steroid tapering, etoposide (VP-16) was escalated to 200 mg twice weekly. Treatment with etoposide led to significant improvement, with normalization of lactate (1.2 mmol/L; Fig.2), fibrinogen (2.44 g/L), and platelet levels (143 × 109/L; Fig.3). However, the patient succumbed to invasive aspergillosis and cytomegalovirus infection 1 month later, despite initial clinical improvement.

Underestimation of ICU hemophagocytic syndrome: The incidence of HLH in ICU patients is likely to be underestimated. Studies have included 107 critically ill patients who died in the ICU for autopsy without discrimination. Histological and immunological analysis of the bone marrow of the deceased patients was conducted, and, combined with clinical and laboratory data analysis, it was found that 69 patients (64.5%) were identified as HLH, of which 35 patients had moderate-to-severe HLH. Most of the patients with HLH confirmed by histology did not meet the classical clinical/laboratory criteria for HLH. This study identified two major risk factors through multivariate risk factor analysis: intrinsic factors, including late stage malignant tumors, sepsis, and multiple organ failure, and extrinsic factors, including blood transfusion [10]. A study included 25 critically ill patients with H1N1 influenza in the ICU for the diagnosis, progression, and treatment of virus-related hemophagocytic syndrome and analyzed the results. All 25 patients received mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia. Surprisingly, one third of the patients in this study were diagnosed with HLH in nine cases (36%), and eight cases (89%) died. Among the nine confirmed patients, six cases received treatment with etoposide and dexamethasone, but five of them died due to multiple organ failure caused by disease progression, with a higher mortality rate than patients with severe H1N1 who did not develop hemophagocytic syndrome. The research results indicate that HLH may be a common complication of severe H1N1 infection. It is an important factor leading to multiple organ failure and death [11]. A case report reported that patients who underwent ICU aortic replacement surgery experienced fever and unexplained increased oxygen demand. They were treated with antibiotics and invasive ventilators, and HLH was diagnosed through laboratory tests (elevated ferritin and triglycerides, decreased hemoglobin and platelets) and bone marrow puncture with obvious hemophagocytic cells. However, no follow-up treatment, prognosis, or follow-up information was reported for this case [12]; at present, there are no documented cases or literature on hyperlactatemia and hemophagocytic syndrome. Both cases we reported exhibited lactate > 14 mmol/L, far exceeding levels typical of sepsis.

Type B lactic acidosis and HLH: Lactic acid levels > 2 mmol/L in dicatehyperlactatemia. HLH is increasingly recognized as a contributor to multiorgan failure and mortality in critically ill ICU patients [10–12]. However, its association with lactic acidosis has not been previously emphasized. In our cases, both patients exhibited lactate levels exceeding 14 mmol/L, far beyond typical septic thresholds. This suggests that extreme lactic acidosis should prompt HLH screening in ICU settings. Subsequent findings in case no. 1 confirmed diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and the patient’s elevated prolactin levels might have been linked to a significant tumor load [13]. The mechanism of lymphoma combined with hyperlactatemia is not clear. Currently, the Warbury effect of cancer cells is considered the main reason [14], especially related to giant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A large number of tumor cells proliferate rapidly, and tumor cells utilize aerobic glycolysis. Under aerobic conditions, tumor cells maintain a high rate of glycolysis, and the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway necessary for cell division may play a role in the increase of lactate production in cancer cells. Although tumor screening was conducted for case no. 2, no evidence of malignant diseases such as lymphoma was found. Considering the patient’s history of gout and bone destruction, the septic shock and subsequent systemic inflammation likely triggered HLH, leading to cytopenia and bone marrow insufficiency. Relevant studies suggest that HLH is related to bone marrow failure syndrome (BMF) [15]. BMF is a heterogeneous nonmalignant hematological disease characterized by a reduction in single or multiple lineage cells, and the pathogenesis can be genetic or acquired. Abnormal T cells, B cells, or innate immune responses are involved to varying degrees in the pathophysiology of BMF, and the hematological improvement after immunosuppressive or anti-complement therapy is the main indirect evidence that the immune system plays a central role in the development of BMF [16–18]. As a part of this immune disorder, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in forming immune responses and maintaining inflammation during bone marrow failure. Inflammatory factors such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and TNF-α have been fully described for their inhibition of hematopoietic function [19–21]. In an inflammatory environment, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) exhibits both stimulating and inhibitory effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells in a lineage dependent manner, guiding the differentiation of monocytes and neutrophils, inhibiting hematopoietic erythroid progenitor cells, and disrupting the transmission of thrombopoietin signaling in hematopoietic stem cell progenitor cells [22]. High level of IFN-γ and TNF-α are often found in patients with HLH and have been proven to synergistically inhibit bone marrow erythroid proliferation and impair the differentiation potential of multipotent progenitor cells. The mechanism of elevated lactate is unclear. Although case no. 2 received active circulatory support, bedside continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other organ function support treatments, the decrease in lactate was not significant. Treatment with glucocorticoids and etoposide (VP-16) showed significant effects, with lactate rapidly decreasing to normal levels and blood cells returning to normal levels.

HLH treatment plan: When patients who are in the ICU with hemophagocytic syndrome are complicated by hyperlactatemia, conventional methods to correct lactate are ineffective, and treatment should be targeted at the cause. The treatment of HLH usually includes immunosuppressants and chemotherapy drugs. Patients with lymphoma-associated high lactate have high proliferation rates of tumor cells and are highly sensitive to chemotherapy. As the number of tumor cells decreases after chemotherapy, the condition can improve, and lactate levels can rapidly decrease after chemotherapy and return to normal levels within 48–72 hours. According to the HLH-1994 and HLH-2004 research protocols, dexamethasone and etoposide regimens are the mainstream treatment options. In 2007, French scholars proposed an alternative treatment plan that included steroids and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Individualized treatment should be carried out on the basis of the patient’s disease activity and response during the course of treatment [2,23–28]. Treatment with rituximab can be given for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) -associated HLH. Emerging therapies, including anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibodies (for example, emapalumab) [27] and JAK-2 inhibitors (for example, ruxolitinib) [28], show promise in modulating hyperinflammatory states in HLH.. Both case no. 1 and case no. 2 showed a rapid response to glucocorticoid and etoposide chemotherapy, with lactate, blood cell, and fibrinogen levels quickly returning to normal. Case no. 2 had poor tolerance to re-chemotherapy, and after the initial improvement of the condition, there was a recurrence of elevated lactate, decreased blood cells, and death due to worsening of the condition.

We hypothesized that the use of immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids, combined with damaged mucosal barriers, might be key contributors to the widespread fungal infections in case no. 2, and the limitation of this study is the lack of postmortem examination in case no. 2 to confirm aspergillosis dissemination.

The incidence rate of HLH in ICU patients is underestimated. HLH should be suspected in ICU patients with unexplained lactic acidosis and cytopenia. While etoposide is effective for malignancy-associated HPS, its role in reactive forms must be weighed against immunosuppression risks. Tailored therapy and aggressive infection prophylaxis are paramount.
