The rs1842681 polymorphism of theLOC105372028gene was found to correlate with a 3-month functional stroke outcome in a genome-wide association study meta-analysis performed by the GISCOME study. Although the STRONG study confirmed these results, a study in a Chinese population reported no such correlation. We prospectively examined the correlation between the rs1842681 polymorphism of theLOC105372028gene and the 3-month ischemic stroke functional outcome in a Polish population. In 1037 IBioStroke participants, we examined two multivariate logistic regression models, predicting excellent (mRS: 0–1 vs. 2–6) and good (mRS: 0–2 vs. 3–6) outcomes. In an univariate analysis the rs1842681 polymorphism, among several other parameters available in acute stroke, was associated with an excellent outcome in an additive model (AG vs. GG genotype distribution) (OR = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.57–0.97,p= 0.027), in a dominant model (AG + AA vs. GG) (OR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.58–0.96,p= 0,025) and in A/G allele frequencies (OR = 0.81, 95%CI:0.66–0.99,p= 0.044), however, it was not associated with good outcome in an additive, dominant and recessive models, as well as the A/G allele frequencies. The multivariate analyses, including additive mode (AM) and dominant mode (DM) of inheritance showed, that excellent outcome was associated with younger age (AM: OR = 0.95; 95%CI:0.94–0.97,p< 0.001; DM: OR = 0.95; 95%CI:0.94–0.97,p< 0.001), longer education (AM: OR = 1.07; 95%CI:1.01–1.14,p= 0.019; AD: OR = 1.07; 95%CI:1.01–1.14,p= 0.019), neurological improvement within 24 h (AM: OR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.08–1.15,p< 0.001; AD: OR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.07–1.15,p< 0.001), absence of hemorrhagic transformation (AM: OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.30–0.77,p= 0.003; AD: OR = 0.49; 95%CI: 0.31–0.79,p= 0.003), absence of infection (AM: OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.14–0.31,p< 0.001; AD: OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.14–0.31,p< 0.001), lower WBC count (AM: OR = 0.90; 95%CI:0.85–0.96,p< 0.001; AD: OR = 0.90; 95%CI:0.85–0.96,p< 0.001), and lower glucose levels (AM: OR = 1.00; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.035; DM: OR = 1.00; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.037); while good outcome – with younger age (OR = 0.96; 95%CI: 0.94–0.97,p< 0.001); longer education (OR = 1.10; 95%CI:1.03–1.17,p= 0.004); neurological improvement within 24 h (OR = 1.13; 95%CI: 1.09–1.17,p< 0.001), absence of infection (OR = 0.20; 95%CI: 0.14–0.30,p< 0.001) and lower WBC count (OR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.82–0.93,p< 0.001). The influence of the rs1842681 variant on the 3-month functional stroke outcome was not confirmed in the Polish population.

Stroke patients with similar clinical presentations and treatments can have entirely different functional outcomes1. Numerous factors, such as demographics (e.g., age, sex, race), clinical components (e.g., neurological deficit upon admission), stroke treatment, and access to rehabilitation, have been identified as having unequal impacts on stroke functional outcomes2–4. There have also been studies utilizing the candidate gene approach that reveal a genetic component’s influence on stroke outcome5–7. Several studies found a clear association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism and stroke functional outcomes in various populations5. In contrast, there are some candidate gene approach studies showing positive results, that were not studied so far in different populations. For example, Maguire J et al. found in one study that the cyclooxygenase-2 gene rs5275 polymorphism affected functional outcomes6. On the other hand, some candidate gene approach studies bring inconsistent results. Multiple studies examining the association of theAPOEgene e2/3/4 polymorphism with stroke outcome have yielded contradictory results7–9.

Two separate genome-wide association studies (GWASs) published in 2019 identified two polymorphisms related to stroke functional outcome, namelyPATJrs7622140710andLOC105372028rs184268111.

ThePATJgene encodes the Pals1-associated tight junction protein, which regulates several biological processes, including ion channel signaling and transport12. Unfortunately, the impact of thePATJgene rs76221407 intronic low-frequency polymorphism on stroke outcome could not be replicated in two different studies13,14.

TheLOC105372028gene is involved in the expression of protein phosphatase 1, which plays a role in brain plasticity. An intronic polymorphism, rs1842681, within theLOC105372028gene has been found to correlate with functional stroke outcomes11. This correlation was observed in a GWAS meta-analysis by the Genetic Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcome (GISCOME) network group, which identified that carriers of the A allele of the rs1842681 polymorphism were more likely to have worse functional outcome 3 months after a stroke (OR = 1.40,p= 5.27 × 10− 9)11. A replication study, the STRONG (Stroke, Stress, Rehabilitation and Genetics) study, confirmed the association of the A allele of the rs1842681 polymorphism with stroke outcome13. However, Zhu et al. did not find evidence of a significant association between the rs1842681 polymorphism and functional stroke outcomes within a studied Chinese population14.

The obtained results on the influence of the rs1842681 polymorphism of theLOC105372028gene on stroke outcome are conflicting11,13,14. What is more, it was shown that the risk allele frequency varies significantly across different ethnic groups11,13,14. Thus, there is a need to look for this association in an independent, well-defined population.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between the rs1842681 polymorphism of theLOC105372028gene and the 3-month functional outcome in ischaemic stroke patients participating in the Polish segment of the IBioStroke study. This is a first replication study of the rs1842681 polymorphism of theLOC105372028gene on the Central Eastern European population.

We enrolled acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients who were admitted to the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University Hospital in Krakow, Poland, from July 18, 2020, to December 14, 2022. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data prospectively following the protocol of the study “Identification and Clinical Validation of Biomarkers for Long-Term Outcome After Cerebral Ischemia (IBioStroke)”15.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: an ischaemic stroke according to the World Health Organization’s definition16; age ≥ 18 years; and signed consent to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score17> 2 before the stroke; a diagnosis of dementia or depression before the stroke, based on information from the patient, a family member/caregiver, and/or available clinical documentation; and the presence of a concomitant chronic neurodegenerative disorder, chronic autoimmune disorder, or cancer.

Standardized stroke care was provided following current guidelines for stroke care18,19. At 90 days post-stroke, the study subjects were followed up either at an outpatient clinic specifically for stroke patients (65%) or via a telephone call with a study participant or caregiver.

All procedures were carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki20. The study protocol was approved by the Jagiellonian University Ethical Committee (1072.6120.118.2020), all research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

The following clinical data were collected: demographics (age, gender, years of schooling), stroke risk factor profile21, stroke etiology (small vessel disease stroke, large vessel disease stroke, cardio-embolic stroke, stroke of rare etiology, and unknown stroke etiology) based on TOAST criteria (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment)22. The causal treatment comprised either intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (IVT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT), or both23. The neurological deficit was quantified using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission and at 24 h24. Delta NIHSS was defined as the difference between the NIHSS score recorded 24 h after the stroke and the NIHSS score upon hospital admission. Body temperature and systolic and diastolic blood pressure upon admission were also measured.

Upon admission, patients underwent the following neuroimaging study protocol: non-contrast and contrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography, and computed tomography perfusion with post-processing analysis using RAPID (iSchemaView, Menlo Park, CA) software25.

Brain atrophy was evaluated using the Global Cortical Atrophy (GCA) scale. Thirteen brain regions were assessed, with scores for each region ranging from 0 to 3; 0 represents normal, while 3 signifies severe “knife blade” atrophy. A higher GCA score indicates more severe cerebral atrophy26. This assessment was conducted by a trained neurologist (MDC) and a radiologist (BL), and their results were compared. In cases of disagreement (11%), resolution was reached through discussion. Haemorrhagic transformation, as seen on the computed tomography scan taken 24 h after the stroke, was classified according to the ECASS-2 classification27. The location of the ischaemic lesion categorized stroke topography into the right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and cerebellum/brain stem. Medical complications were diagnosed as described elsewhere28.

On day 1, the following fasting blood tests were analyzed: CRP, white blood cell (WBC), platelet count (PLT), fibrinogen levels, INR, creatinine levels, Hb levels, glucose levels.

The DNA samples were isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes with NucleoSpin Blood kit (Marcherey-Nagel). TheAPOEgenotype (APOEe2,APOEe3,APOEe4 alleles) was identified by genotyping two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs429358 and rs7412, National Center for Biotechnology Information) using the TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The genotyping of theLOC105372028gene intronic variant rs1842681 (A/G) was performed through the melting-curve analysis of TaqMan probes (HUMAN C__11627544_10 SNP assay; Thermo Fisher Scientific) validated with appropriate control samples. Fluorescence signals were plotted on an allelic discrimination graph segregating into three well-differentiated clusters corresponding to the two homozygous genotypes and heterozygous genotype. Appropriate genotyping-specific and negative control samples were included in each batch run in a 96-well plate format. The overall call rate was > 99% and there were no ambiguous reads. All patient samples were run in duplicates randomly distributed in separate plates for each pair. The genotypes in the control group were in concordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The rates were blinded to genotypes.

The outcome measure was the mRS on day 90. We analyzed the mRS as two dichotomous variables: (1) mRS: 0–1 (excellent outcome) vs. 2–6 and (2) mRS: 0–2 (good outcome) vs. mRS: 3–6. Excellent outcome means a patient is able to carry out all every day duties activities (no symptoms or no significant disability despite symptoms); while good outcome includes patients presented with excellent outcome and those unable to carry all previous activities, but able to look after own activities without assistance17.

The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study is available within the article tables.

Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as mean and standard deviations for numerical variables. This held both overall and for patient groups with two established mRS outcomes assessed 3 months post-stroke.

The comparison of variables between two groups (1) mRS: 0–1 vs. 2–6 and (2) mRS: 0–2 vs. mRS: 3–6 was conducted using Pearson’s Chi-squared tests and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were utilized for numerical variables.

The logistic regression was conducted to compare the outcomes in three defined models, 3 months post-stroke.

The results of both univariate and multivariate logistic regression are presented. We selected the multivariate logistic regression model using a stepwise selection with a backward elimination algorithm, where the significance level is set at 0.05. The results were presented in terms of OR, 95% confidence intervals for OR, and the corresponding p-value. Minimum detectable odds ratio, for total number of subjects in the study equal 1037, required power = 0.8, AG + AA genotype exposure equal 0.39 in group with excellent (mRS: 0–1) and 0.46 in group with non-excellent (mRS: 2–6) stroke outcome is < 0.70 or > 1.41 (calculated in epiR R package), which is consistent with OR detected in GISCOME study (OR = 1.4). In Haldane Exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value = 0.73 = > no significant deviation from HWE.

All calculations were conducted using R statistical software version 4.2.1 (Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

During the study period, our center admitted 1809 patients with an ischaemic stroke diagnosis. Of these, 1042 patients fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the IBioStroke study. However, we lost track of five patients during the 3-month follow-up. The univariate analyses are based on 1037 patients, but the final multivariate regression analyses relied on data from 1022 patients with complete records (full biochemistry was not obtained in 15 patients).

The demographic, clinical, and radiological characteristics, as well as the genetic profile of the rs1842681 polymorphism of theLOC105372028gene and the commonAPOEpolymorphism in the studied populations, are presented in TableS1.

In an univariate analysis the rs1842681 polymorphism was associated with excellent outcome (mRS:0–1 vs. 2–6) in an additive model (comparing AG vs. GG genotype distribution) (OR = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.57–0.97,p= 0.027), in a dominant model (comparing AG + AA vs. GG genotype distribution) (OR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.58–0.96,p= 0,025) and in allele A/G frequencies (OR = 0.81, 95%CI:0.66–0.99,p= 0.044). However, we did not find any association with good outcome (mRS: 0–2 vs. 3–6) in an additive, dominant and recessive mode of inheritance as far as genotype distribution is concerned, as well as in the A/G allele frequencies (TableS1).

The univariate analysis comparing the distribution of theAPOEgenotypes (e2/e2, e3/e2, e3/e3, e4/e2, e4/e3, e4/e4) in the studied groups did not show any significant differences (for excellent outcome:p= 0.90 and for good outcome:p= 0.50). Similarly, the univariate analysis comparing theAPOEallele frequencies (e2, /e3, e4) did not show any significant differences between the studied groups (for excellent outcome:p= 0.90 and for good outcome:p= 0.50). (TableS1).

Taking into account carriers of the e4 allele (e4/e4, e2/e4, e3/e4) an no carriers of the e4 allele (e2e2, e3/e3 e2/e3), additional univariate analysis did not show any statistically significant associations in patients with excellent outcome (p= 0.54) and in patients with good outcome (p= 0.33).

In further order, in the initial analysis, univariate regression testing revealed the correlation of the following factors to an excellent outcome (mRS: 0–1 vs. 2–6): male sex (OR = 0.62; 95%CI: 0.49–0.80,p< 0.001); younger age (OR = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.93–0.95,p< 0.001), extended education (OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.15–1.26,p< 0.001), absence of the history of smoking (OR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.09–1.97,p= 0.011), hypertension (OR = 0.49; 95%CI: 0.36–0.66,p< 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.6; 95%CI = 0.45–0.80,p< 0.001), ischaemic heart disease (OR = 0.66; 95%CI:0.51–0.86,p= 0.002), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.52; 95%CI: 0.40–0.68,p< 0.001). Lower mRS score before the stroke (OR = 0.33; 95%CI: 0.25–0.43,p< 0.001), higher delta NIHSS (OR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.07–1.12,p< 0.001), lower risk of haemorrhagic transformation on the CT taken 24 h post-stroke (OR = 0.36; 95%CI: 0.25–0.50,p< 0.001), lesions situated in the posterior circulation (OR = 2.01; 95%CI: 1.31–3.15,p< 0.001), a lower score on GCA scale (OR = 0.95; 95%CI: 0.94–0.97,p< 0.001), no cardioembolic stroke aetiology (OR = 0.68; 95%CI: 0.51–0.90,p= 0.002), absence of stroke-associated infections necessitating antibiotic treatment (OR = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.09–0.17;p< 0.001), lower WBC count (OR = 0.88; 95%CI: 0.84–0.92,p< 0.001), lower levels of CRP (OR = 0.99; 95%CI: 0.98–0.99,p< 0.001), fibrinogen (OR = 0.84; 95%CI:0.73–0.96,p= 0.013), creatinine (OR = 0.99; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p< 0.001), and glucose (OR = 0.99; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p< 0.001), and higher haemoglobin levels (OR = 1.16; 95%CI: 1.08–1.24,p< 0.001) also contributed to excellent outcomes (TableS1).

The multivariate logistic regression model with all variables statistically significant in univariate models at the significance level = 0.05, including polymorphism rs1842681 in an additive mode of inheritance, showed that excellent outcome was associated with younger age (OR = 0.95; 95%CI:0.94–0.97,p< 0.001), longer education (OR = 1.07; 95%CI:1.01–1.14,p= 0.019), greater neurological improvement within 24 h (higher delta NIHSS, OR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.08–1.15,p< 0.001), absence of hemorrhagic transformation (OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.30–0.77,p= 0.003), absence of infection (OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.14–0.31,p< 0.001), lower WBC count (OR = 0.90; 95%CI:0.85–0.96,p< 0.001), and lower glucose levels (OR = 1.00; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.035); (Table1).

The multivariate logistic regression model with all variables statistically significant in univariate models at the significance level = 0.05, including polymorphism rs1842681 in a dominant mode of inheritance showed that excellent outcome was associated with younger age (OR = 0.95;95%CI:0.94–0.97,p< 0.001), longer education (OR = 1.07; 95%CI:1.01–1.14,p= 0.019), greater neurological improvement within 24 h (higher delta NIHSS, OR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.07–1.15,p< 0.001), absence of hemorrhagic transformation (OR = 0.49; 95%CI: 0.31–0.79,p= 0.003), absence of infection (AD: OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.14–0.31,p< 0.001), lower WBC count (OR = 0.90; 95%CI:0.85–0.96,p< 0.001), and lower glucose levels (OR = 1.00; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.037) (Table2).

Multivariate logistic regression - model with all variables statistically significant in univariate models at the significance level = 0.05, including polymorphism rs1842681 (dominant model) - explaining excellent outcome at day 90. post-stroke (mRS: 0–1 vs. 2–6).

The logistic regression analysis showed through univariate regression testing, that the following factors were associated with a good outcome (mRS: 0–2 vs. 3–5) 3 months post-stroke: younger age (OR = 0.95; 95%CI: 0.93–0.96,p< 0.001), male gender (OR = 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49–0.83,p< 0.001), longer schooling (OR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.16–1.28,p< 0.001), absence of a history of hypertension (OR = 0.51; 95%CI: 0.36–0.71,P< 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.7; 95%CI: 0.52–0.93,p= 0.014), ischaemic heart disease (OR = 0.67; 95%CI: 0.52–0.88,p= 0.004), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.59; 95%CI: 0.45–0.77,p< 0.001). Also, a lower mRS score before the stroke (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.33–0.52,p< 0.001), higher delta NIHSS (OR = 1.13; 95%CI: 1.10–1.16,p< 0.001 lower initial systolic blood pressure (OR = 1,0; 95%: 0.99-1.00,p= 0.047). Further, the absence of haemorrhagic transformation on a CT scan taken 24 h post-stroke (OR = 0.43; 95%CI: 0.31–0.60,p< 0.001), lesions situated in the posterior circulation (OR = 1.83; 95%CI: 1.16–2.98,p= 0.022), a lower score on the GCA scale (OR = 0.95; 95%CI: 0.93–0.97,p< 0.001), no caedioembolic stroke etiology (OR = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.55-1.00,p= 0.005); small vessel disease stroke etiology (OR = 2.68; 95%CI: 1.01–9.24,p= 0.005), rare stroke etiology (OR = 2.68; 95%CI: 1.11–7.99,p= 0.005), lacking stroke-related infection necessitating antibiotic treatment (OR = 0.12; 95%CI: 0.09–0.16,p< 0.001), and lower WBC count (OR = 0.86; 95%CI: 0.82–0.90,p< 0.001) were significant. The list also includes lower levels of CRP (OR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.98–0.99,p< 0.001), fibrinogen (OR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.71–0.94,p= 0.008), creatinine (OR = 1.00; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p< 0.001), glucose (OR = 0.99; 95%CI: 0.99-1.00,p< 0.001) and higher haemoglobin levels (OR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.04–1.21,p= 0.002) also contributed to excellent outcomes (TableS1).

The multivariate logistic regression model, revealed that the independent factors associated with a 3-month good outcome (mRS:0–2 vs. 3–6)were: younger age (OR = 0.96; 95%CI: 0.94–0.97,p< 0.001); longer education (OR = 1.10; 95%CI: 1.03–1.17,p= 0.004); higher delta NIHSS (OR = 1.13; 95%CI: 1.09–1.17,p< 0.001), absence of infection (OR = 0.20; 95%CI: 0.14–0.30,p< 0.001), lower WBC count (OR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.82–0.93,p< 0.001) (Table3).

There is growing evidence that genetic variation may explain at least part of the variability of stroke outcomes, and efforts are increasing to understand this issue29,30. Two approaches are used to investigate genetic factors affecting stroke risk and prognosis: the candidate gene approach and GWAS. The candidate gene approach seeks to identify correlations between specific polymorphisms involved in stroke pathophysiology31, stroke risk32,33and outcomes5–9,13. Meanwhile, GWAS can identify common genetic polymorphisms, without a preliminary research hypothesis, potentially revealing new pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease in terms of disease risk and prognosis34. Thus far, the first approach, focused on correlations between several different polymorphisms and stroke outcomes, has failed to yield consistent results5,6,35. Conversely, two recent studies using the GWAS approach, conducted in different populations, identified two distinct polymorphisms that might affect stroke outcomes. The first finding, the rs76221407 polymorphism of thePATJgene, was not replicated in two different populations10,14. The second, rs1842681 polymorphism in theLOC105372028gene, found in a GISCOME network study11, was repeated in one13of the two independent populations14. In our study, we aimed to discern the significance of the rs1842681 variant in the ethnically homogeneous Polish population, but we were unable to replicate the results. Even though, we found in an univariate analysis the rs1842681 polymorphism was associated with excellent outcome (mRS:0–1 vs. 2–6) in an additive mode of inheritance (comparing AG vs. GG genotype distribution) and in a dominant mode of inheritance (comparing AG + AA vs. GG genotype distribution) as well as in allele A/G frequencies; the studied polymorphism did not enter the multivariate logistic regression models after adjustment for well established, unambiguous clinical, radiological and biochemical factors affecting stroke prognosis36.

The GISCOME network was established based on 6165 ischemic stroke patients from 12 studies from Europe, the United States, and Australia. These were selected from groups contributing their genetic and clinical data to the International Stroke Genetics Consortium and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke – Stroke Genetics Network (SiGN) study11. Importantly, these studies collected data on functional outcomes at least 3 months following a stroke. The community deemed the positive findings of the GISCOME network group exceptionally valuable35. The reasons for this were multifold: these findings could aid in predicting individual outcomes, planning personalized rehabilitation, identifying potential therapeutic targets post-stroke, and further understanding the biology of brain recovery following a stroke.

The association between the rs1842681 of theLOC105372028gene and stroke functional outcome, found by the GISCOME network study11, was confirmed by the recently published STRONG13study. This was a prospective one-year genetic study conducted among adults with stroke at 28 US stroke centers, involving 763 stroke patients. The study sought an association between specific candidate genetic variants and motor and stress-related outcomes. Finally, the significance of the rs1842681 variant was confirmed through a replication study involving 515 participants from the STRONG study13. The second replication study was conducted by Zhu R et al. on 982 stroke patients from the northern Chinese population, which did not confirm the primary result of GISCOME14.

The question arises: why were we unable to replicate the results of the GISCOME and STRONG studies? This is likely due to differences in the ethnic profiles of the studied populations, the design of the studies, the impact of confounding parameters and the outcomes studied.

It is well known that different races have specific genetic profiles, each with distinct and unique variant frequencies. For example, the prevalence of the A allele for the polymorphism under study, rs1842681, is 0.07 in the East Asian population14, while in in the STRONG population − 0.3513.

Interestingly, the GISCOME network study did not disclose the race and ethnicity of the populations studied11. Meanwhile, the STRONG study featured a diverse population, with only 69.4% being White13. The diversity of race and ethnicity in these study populations may influence their results.

Our study was conducted using a prospectively collected group of ischaemic stroke patients, all of which received the same protocol care. The GISCOME network study amalgamated data from 12 different studies from various global locations. These studies collected patient data over a long timeframe and incorporated different stroke models and post-stroke care styles. The STRONG study differed in its patient demographic, not only including ischaemic stroke patients as in the GISCOME and our study, but also encompassing 15.2% of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage11,13. This diversity in the studied stroke populations might account for the differences in results.

The endpoint in our study and the STRONG study was the mRS score prospectively evaluated at day 90. after stroke. However, in the GISCOME network study, not all outcome data were gathered at the same time point after stroke11. Only 81% of the 12 included studies provided mRS data collected 3 months (± 2 weeks) after stroke, while the rest were collected within a 90–160 day timespan post-stroke37. These differing endpoints may not necessarily reflect the same stage of the disease’s course, which could also affect results.

All studies, including ours, have focused on the relationship between genetics and stroke outcome, as assessed by the mRS scale. Typically, mRS results are categorized as follows: excellent outcome (0–1 points) vs. poor outcome (2–6 points) and good outcome (0–2 points) vs. poor outcome (3–6 points). It is important to note that previous studies, such as reference38, have revealed substantial inter-rater variability in mRS assessments. The GISCOME network study and the STRONG study are both multicenter studies where the endpoint functional outcome was evaluated by several different raters11,13. Additionally, mRS data from the Swedish quality register for stroke was analyzed by a validated translation algorithm11. These two aforementioned methodological issues may skew the results of these studies. In our study, we addressed this issue by having only two doctors in the outpatient clinic evaluate the mRS. For about 65% of patients who came in person for a follow-up visit, while the others were contacted via phone, their mRS was evaluated in a structured interview by the same study nurse. Scoring mRS due to this hybrid follow-up method may be considered as a risk of bias. To avoid this, before the study, the raters and the study nurse discussed possible sources of the bias and established a unified recommendations for the outcome assessment.

Differences in access to post-stroke care, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation intensity between participants from the 12 diverse GISCOME populations and the US centers in the STRONG study may ultimately affect the final mRS outcomes, and this possibility cannot be ruled out.

We would like to emphasize that in our single-centre study, all patients had access to a similar pattern of post-stroke care and post-stroke rehabilitation. According to the rules of the Polish National Health System patients after stroke have uniform access to standardized in- or out-patient rehabilitation and in- or out-patient nursing care. Six hundred and twenty IBioStroke participants used rehabilitation and 91 – nursing care. What is more, Polish neurologists are obliged to adhere to national recommendations on stroke care and treatment, including diet and life style suggestions as well as stroke management18. However, we did not collect data on these matters systematically, what can be considered as an important limitation of the current study.

It should also be highlighted that our results were adjusted for 30 different prospectively collected demographic and clinical data, which could have influenced the final outcomes36. An intriguing observation from our final multivariate models found some shared influencing factors for excellent/good outcomes. These factors included younger age, higher education levels, initial neurological improvements within the first 24 h post-event, absence of stroke-associated infection, and lower WBC count on the first day of fasting post-stroke.

The GISCOME network study adjusted for ten factors but overlooked ethnicity/race11. STRONG study results, on the other hand, were adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity/race, location of the stroke, reperfusion therapy, three-stroke risk factors, and stroke type13. Meta-analysis of Fahay et al.36identified 192 predictors of functional outcome after stroke, thus, we are aware that in our study we included only a portion of parameters that may affect stroke prognosis. The potential residual confounding of unmeasured factors may influence our results.

In our study, we were unable to confirm the relationship between theε4 alleles of theAPOEgene polymorphism and functional stroke outcomes.

APOEis the major apolipoprotein in the human brain, primarily produced by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes39. TheAPOEgene plays a key role in membrane maintenance, repair, and the modulation of synaptic remodeling following ischemic injury40.APOEgene is one of the most extensively studied genes in the context of stroke. Recent meta-analyses have shown that theAPOEε4 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke41. However, studies investigating the influence of theAPOEε4 variant on stroke prognosis have produced conflicting results. Math N et al., could not establish a correlation between the apoε4allele and stroke outcomes with an OR = 1.02; CI: 0.81–1.27;p= 0.9042. This meta-analysis was based on 1306 patients from six different populations. On the other hand, a large Chinese study by Rong et al. involving 1929 patients showed that apoε4allele carriers displayed poorer functional outcomes 90 days after a stroke7. We would like to note that the results of our study align with two previous Polish studies on this topic by Gromadzka et al.9and Sarzynska-Dlugosz et al., which involved 289 and 496 patients respectively43.

Our study boasts several advantages. We successfully recruited a large ethnically homogeneous cohort of stroke patients who were prospectively observed for 3 months using the same protocol. However, the follow-up period was relatively short. We did not systematically collect individual data on lifestyle interventions or access to rehabilitation between discharge and the time of outcome evaluation, which could have an impact on the final mRS results.

We were unable to confirm the prognostic significance of the rs1842681 variant of theLOC105372028gene in a Polish population. However, we were able to verify previous equivocal factors affecting stroke prognosis.

The varied results of genetic studies across different populations, focusing on stroke outcomes, may arise from factors such as: the diverse ethnic/racial profiles of participants, variations in acute stroke care, differences in stroke follow-up models, including access to rehabilitation, the profile of the confounders included, and finally, significant interrater variability in mRS evaluations due to a large number of raters in this studies. Future research on the genetics of stroke functional outcomes should take such concerns into account.
