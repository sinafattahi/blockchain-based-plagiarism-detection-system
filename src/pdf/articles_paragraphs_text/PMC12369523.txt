The CRP–albumin–lymphocyte (CALLY) index has been demonstrated to be a predictive tool for tumors. However, studies on its role and clinical significance in predicting intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) non-response in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) remains limited.

A cohort of 975 patients with KD was recruited from four medical centers to examine their clinical and laboratory characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the association between CALLY and IVIG non-response in KD patients. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression models were utilized to explore potential nonlinear relationships. Subgroup analyses were also conducted. The predictive capability of CALLY was compared to that of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the ratio of C-reactive protein to albumin (CAR).

Regardless of adjustments for confounding variables, CALLY, whether considered as a continuous or categorical variable, demonstrated a negative association with IVIG non-response. The relationship between the natural logarithm-transformed CALLY and IVIG non-response exhibited a non-linear trend, with a threshold identified at −0.752. Below this threshold, a negative association was observed between ln CALLY and IVIG non-response; however, no significant association was detected above the threshold. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant interactions between CALLY and IVIG non-response (allPfor interaction >0.05). The predictive capability of CALLY was found to be superior to that of CAR, NLR and PLR.

The CALLY parameter demonstrated a negative and nonlinear correlation with the risk of IVIG non-response, outperforming traditional inflammatory markers in predicting IVIG non-response.

Kawasaki disease (KD), characterized by acute febrile systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology, represents the leading cause of acquired cardiac disease in children across developed nations, with rising the incidence observed in developing countries [1]. Approximately 25% of untreated KD patients develop coronary artery lesions (CAL), including coronary artery dilatation and aneurysms [2]. While intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) remains the gold-standard therapy, reducing the incidence of CAL from 25% to 5%, 10–20% of patients with KD demonstrate IVIG non-responsiveness [3–5]. IVIG non-responsiveness indicates a severe inflammatory reaction and significantly elevates the risk of CAL [6–8]. Notably, Japanese epidemiological data revealed an alarming escalation in IVIG non-response incidence from 7% (2003) to 23% (2014), paralleled by increased CAL occurrences [9]. This underscores the critical need for reliable biomarkers enabling early identification of IVIG non-responder to optimize therapeutic interventions in order to mitigate the risk of CAL.

Several risk scoring systems such as the Egami score [10], the Sano score [11] and the Kobayashi score [12], haven been demonstrated high predictive power in Japanese [13], but they have not confirmed in other races or regions. Emerging evidence implicates immune dysregulation, inflammatory burden, and nutritional status in IVIG non-responsiveness. Established biomarkers reflecting these domains—including the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and pretreatment prognostic nutritional index (PNI)—have demonstrated the associations with IVIG non-response [3,14,15]. However, their clinical utility is not confirmed in other populations and inability to concurrently evaluate immune-inflammatory-nutritional axes. We hypothesize that a composite biomarker integrating these multidimensional parameters could be a better predictive index.

Hematological biomarkers are extensively employed to reflect the immune function, nutritional status and inflammation level of children with KD. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase response protein, is recognized as a marker of inflammatory response [16]. Albumin, a hepatic synthesis marker, serves as a clinically significant biomarker for assessing nutritional status and disease severity, and also could reflect the inflammatory response [17]. Hypoalbuminemia usually is associated with poor outcomes in critically ill children [18]. Lymphocyte counts serve as surrogates for immune competence. Significantly, these three parameters (CRP, albumin, and lymphocytes) correlate with IVIG non-response [19], representing distinct yet interconnected biological pathways. The novel CRP-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index, synthesizing inflammatory (CRP), nutritional (albumin), and immune (lymphocyte) dimensions, has emerged as a prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer [20], gastric cancer [21], liver cancer [22], ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [23] and critically ill patients with sepsis [24]. Despite this expanding evidence base, no studies have evaluated the association between the CALLY index and IVIG non-response in children with KD. Moreover, comparative analyses evaluating the CALLY index against conventional biomarkers (CAR, NLR, PLR) remain absent.

This study aimed to (1) investigate the relationship between the CALLY index and IVIG non-response in Han Chinese pediatric KD patients in four medical centers, and (2) perform head-to-head comparisons of CALLY’s predictive performance versus established biomarkers (CAR, NLR, PLR).

We collected the clinical data of 975 Han patients with KD hospitalized at the Zigong first people’s hospital, the Mian yang Central Hospital, affiliated hospital of Southwest Medical University, and Beijing Anzhen Nanchong Hospital, Capital Medical University (Nanchong Central Hospital) between May 2019 and March 2023. The diagnosis of KD was established based on the 2017 AHA guidelines [25]. The definition of IVIG non-response was recrudescent or persistent fever at least 36 h after the end of IVIG infusion [25]. All patients received standard therapy consisting of IVIG (1–2 g/kg) and aspirin (30–50 mg/kg) initiated at disease onset [3]. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) Received IVIG prior to admission or failed to undergo IVIG therapy after admission; (2) Used corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before or during hospitalization; (3) Had comorbid conditions including: inflammatory diseases, tumors, autoimmune diseases, hematological disorders, cardiovascular conditions, and malnutrition; (4) patients with a history of KD; (5) Missing >20% of essential clinical or laboratory data. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University(approval number: KY2024514), Mianyang Central Hospital(approval number:2025KY-YJZ001), Zigong First People’s Hospital (approval number:2025-013) and Beijing Anzhen Nanchong Hospital, Capital Medical University (Nanchong Central Hospital) (approval number: 2025-090). The human participants adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 and its later amendments. All Ethics Committees think that due to the retrospective nature of this study, the requirement for informed consent was waived.

Laboratory data of the latest test results were acquired before IVIG administration. CALLY index = Albumin × Lymphocyte÷(CRP × 10) [20]; CAR = CRP/Albumin [3]; NLR: Neutrocyte/Lymphocyte [20]; PLR: Platelet/Lymphocyte [20].

All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.3). Missing data (constituting <20% of the total) were handledviamultiple imputation. Continuous variables were presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and compared using the Mann–Whitney U test (due to non-normal distributions). Categorical variables were expressed as percentages (%) and analyzed using chi-square tests. Since CALLY levels exhibited a non-normal distribution, they were logarithmically transformed (natural log, ln) to approximate normality. The transformed values were then stratified into quartiles (Q1, Q2 and Q3) for further analysis.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between Ln CALLY (both continuous and categorical) and IVIG non-response. Three models were constructed: Model 1: Unadjusted (crude analysis); Model 2: Adjusted for age, sex, and weight; Model 3: Further adjusted for WBC, NEU, HB, PLT, ESR, days of pre-IVIG fever, DBIL, TBA, TBIL, ALT, AST, iKD, IVIG dose, and CAL. Covariates were selected based on clinical relevance and statistical significance in baseline characteristics. Thepvalue for trend was assessed across CALLY quartiles (Q1–Q3). A restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression with four knots was applied to examine potential non-linearity between CALLY index and IVIG non-response. A two-segment linear regression was performed to identify the inflection point and confirm the relationship on either side. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the consistency of CALLY’s predictive value across: Demographics: Sex, age (≤25 vs. >25 months), weight (≤13 vs. >13 kg); Disease characteristics: Days of pre-IVIG fever (≤10 vs. >10 days), CAL, iKD, and IVIG dose. Interaction effects were tested using likelihood ratio tests. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate associations between CALLY index and NLR, PLR, and CAR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for variables linked to IVIG non-response. Differences in AUCs were compared using the Hanley and McNeil method. A two-sidedpvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In total, 975 patients with KD (months: 25.00 (12.00–48.00)) were enrolled. There are significant statistical differences regarding the general characteristics between the IVIG response group and the IVIG non-response group, as showed inTable 1.Table 2outlined the baseline characteristics of patients categorized by CALLY status. Patients with KD were divided onto three groups based on CALLY tertiles. Compared with low CALLY index, higher CALLY index had lower proportion of IVIG non-response and IVIG dose (2 g/kg), higher LYM counts, HB levels, PLT counts as well as ALB levels, and lower ages, Weight, NEU counts, CRP levels, AST levels, TBIL levels, TBA levels, DBIL levels, NLR, CAR and PLR.

Our results indicate a significant association between lower CALLY and increased likelihood of IVIG non-response in the unadjusted model (Model 1) (OR: 0.59; 95% CI 0.48–0.74) and in the minimally adjusted model (Model 2) (OR: 0.57; 95% CI 0.45–0.72). Even after adjusting for all covariates (Model 3), this negative association between CALLY and IVIG non-response still existed (OR: 0.63; 95% CI 0.48–0.82) (Table 3). When we further transformed the Ln (CALLY) levels from a continuous index to a categorical index (tertiles) for sensitivity analysis, those in the highest Tertile 3 group had a statistically significant 58% decrease in the risk of IVIG non-response (OR: 0.42; 95% CI 0.20–0.87) compared with subjects in the lowest Tertile 1 group of Ln (CALLY) levels (Table 3).

The RCS analysis was adjusted for the effects of age, gender, weight, WBC, NEU, HB, PLT, ESR, Days of pre-IVIG fever, DBIL, TBA, TBIL, ALT, AST, iKD, IVIG dose and CAL. We found a significant non-linear relationship between Ln (CALLY) and IVIG non-response (p for nonlinear =0.023) and the dose–response curve showed a U-shaped relationship (Figure 1). Moreover, the results presented an infection point value of −0.752 for Ln (CALLY) in the segmented regression and threshold analysis (Table 4). When Ln (CALLY) was below −0.752, each unit increase in Ln (CALLY) was associated with a 0.473-fold decrease in the risk of IVIG non-response (OR = 0.527, 95% CI 0.334–0.624,p< 0.001). However, When Ln (CALLY) was exceeded −0.752, there was no statistically significant association between Ln CALLY and IVIG non-response (OR = 1.324, 95% CI 0.543–2.425,p< 0.69). Thepvalue for the log-likelihood ratio test was 0.035 (Table 4).

The risk stratification value of the CALLY index for IVIG non-response was further analyzed in multiple subgroups, including IVIG dose (2 g/kg), iKD, gender, ages, weight and days of pre-IVIG fever (Figure 2). None of those stratified variables showed a significant interaction with CALLY (allpfor interaction >0.05). The correlation analysis indicated that CALLY was negative correlated to NLR (r= –0.652,p< 0.001), PLR (r= –0.487,p< 0.001) and CAR (r= –0.833,p< 0.001) (Figure 3), respectively.

Subgroup analysis for the association between CALLY index and IVIG non-response.

As shown inFigure 4, the CALLY index (AUC = 0.66, 95% CI 0.62–0.72) exhibited the highest predictive value for patients with IVIG non-response, followed by CAR (AUC = 0.65, 95% CI 0.58–0.72), NLR (AUC = 0.6, 95% CI 0.51–0.66) and PLR (AUC = 0.56, 95% CI 0.47 − 0.62). The predictive power of CALLY was superior to CAR (z= 4.43,p< 0.001), NLR (z= 3.87,p< 0.001) and PLR (z= 3.41,p< 0.001), respectively.

ROC curves and the AUC values of CALLY, CAR, NLR and PLR in predicting IVIG non-response.

To our knowledge, this multicenter study provided the first evidence establishing the CALLY index as a novel predictor of IVIG non-response in children with KD. Multivariable analysis revealed that a decrease of CALLY index could predict an increased risk of IVIG non-response even after adjusting for various clinical and laboratory variables. Subgroup analyses further demonstrated the predictive power of CALLY index for IVIG non-response risk. Notably, CALLY exhibited superior predictive value compared to other indices such as NLR, CAR, and PLR.

During acute-phase KD, cytokine storms involving IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α drive systemic vasculitis and CAL [26,27]. IL-6 could regulate the balance between IL-17-producing Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Treg) [28]. Innate immune activity is associated with development of KD vasculitis [29]. Hyperinflammatory syndrome is the characteristic of KD, which could affect the occurrence and progression of KD. IVIG non-response is considered to increase the risk of developing CALs [30]. The CALLY index, integrating CRP, serum albumin, and lymphocyte levels, represents inflammation level, nutrition status and immune function, respectively, while immunity, nutrition and inflammation are closely associated with the progression of KD. CRP is a traditional inflammatory parameter and its synthesis in human hepatocytes is upregulated through the stimulation of IL-1β and IL-6 [31]. Clinical investigations have shown that increased CRP levels indicated a more severe inflammatory condition, which was associated with high risk of IVIG non-response [32,33]. Our finding indicated that lower CALLY indices (reflecting elevated CRP) correlate with higher risk of IVIG non-response. Notably, the inverse relationship between the CALLY index and IVIG non-response persisted after adjusting for confounders, reinforcing the predictive power of CALLY index for IVIG non-response.

Nutritional status emerges as a critical modulator of treatment response. The association between hypoalbuminemia (manifested in low CALLY values) and IVIG non-response may be mediated through multiple mechanisms: (1) infection-associated malabsorption exacerbated by inflammatory catabolism [34]; (2) fever-induced metabolic dysregulation, and (3) vascular leakage-induced protein depletion [35]. This is confirmed by established associations between hypoalbuminemia and both inflammation severity [36] and IVIG non-response [37].

Except for inflammation level and nutrition condition, immune function also affects the incidence of IVIG non-response. Research has confirmed that abnormal activation of immunocompetent cells including monocytes, macrophages and T and B lymphocytes occurs in the acute stage of KD [38]. Previous studies have showed that peripheral blood lymphocytes are markedly reduced during acute KD [39,40]. In addition, a study has shown that the critically ill patients with shock and sepsis usually has marked lymphocytopenia, and the severity of clinical course is associated with the grade of lymphocytopenia [41,42]. Lymphocyte depletion typically indicates heightened systemic inflammation [43]. Compared with IVIG response, patients with IVIG non-response had lower lymphocytes, suggesting that IVIG non-response patients have excessive inflammation. Thus, our data supported the view that a lower CALLY index (indicating lower lymphocytes) was associated with a higher occurrence of IVIG non-response.

Additionally, the interaction among inflammation level, nutrition status and immune function should not be ignored, which may further exacerbate the development of KD. Excessive inflammation presented markedly increased inflammatory indexes such as CRP, IL-1β and IL-6, which is prone to expedite the consumption of nutrition [44] and hurt the immune response [45], such as IL-6 could inhibit the production of albumin [46] and inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) could reduce lymphocyte count [47]. On the other hand, acute malnutrition frequently is accompanied by impaired cell-mediated immunity [48,49], and could aggravate inflammation [50]. Collectively, these data could explain why CALLY index can be considered as an index for IVIG non-response in children with KD. We adopt the CALLY index to integrate the representative indicators of inflammation (CRP), nutrition (serum albumin) and immunity (lymphocytes), which can not only make use of the predictive power of these three parameters, but also fully utilize their interaction to comprehensively predict IVIG non-response. Additionally, the subgroup analysis performed in the present study further demonstrated the CALLY index as a marker for IVIG non-response.

Numerous studies have identified various inflammatory biomarkers derived from laboratory data, such as CAR [3,14,15], NLR, and PLR [3,51,52], as potential indicators of IVIG non-response. Our findings showed that the AUC for the CALLY index was significantly higher than that of CAR, NLR, and PLR, thereby demonstrating the superior predictive capability of the CALLY index for IVIG non-response. This enhanced predictive power of the CALLY index is consistent with its previously established efficacy in predicting outcomes in cardiorenal syndrome [53]and overall survival in colorectal cancer [20]. Moreover. the CALLY index is cost-effective, readily accessible, and involves a straightforward calculation, making it a valuable tool for guiding clinical decision-making in patients at high risk of IVIG non-response. However, the observed heterogeneity in defining IVIG non-response across studies investigating inflammatory biomarkers (CAR, NLR, and PLR) may potentially influence the clinical generalizability and predictive performance of the CALLY for identifying IVIG non-response.

It is important to recognize that the present study has certain limitations. Firstly, due to its retrospective design, it is challenging to completely eliminate potential biases, such as selection and information biases. Secondly, while previous research has indicated that the therapeutic effects of IVIG administered at 1 g/kg/day and 2 g/kg/day are comparable in the Chinese population, the dosage of IVIG was not uniform across all participants in this study. Thirdly, despite employing multiple methods to control for confounding factors, there may still be residual or unmeasured confounders, such as dehydration and drug therapy. Fourthly, variations in instruments and fasting status prior to blood collection may influence test results. Lastly, the current findings necessitate validation through further research involving larger sample sizes across different races and regions.

The CALLY parameter demonstrated a negative and nonlinear correlation with the risk of IVIG non-response, surpassing traditional inflammatory markers in predicting IVIG non-response. This observation underscores the potential utility of the CALLY parameter as a clinical tool for identifying patients with KD who are at risk of non-response to IVIG treatment.
