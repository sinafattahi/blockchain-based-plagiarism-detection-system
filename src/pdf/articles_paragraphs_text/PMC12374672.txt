European asylum policies have become increasingly restrictive, raising concerns about the protection of refugee rights, including access to healthcare and adherence to the principle of non-refoulement.

This commentary argues that the suspension of asylum applications for Syrians is premature, legally and ethically problematic, and poses serious health risks. It also emphasises the potential of engaging the Syrian diaspora in policy development and sustainable recovery.

Our commentary calls for European asylum policies to be grounded in context-specific safety assessments and developed through inclusive, coordinated approaches involving all relevant stakeholders.

The fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024 reignited debates in Europe about the future of more than a million Syrian asylum seekers and refugees out of the total 6 million Syrian refugees.4 5Fifteen European Union member states, along with Switzerland and the United Kingdom, suspended asylum claims submitted by Syrians.6These decisions are premature given the ongoing uncertainty in Syria; such plans for ‘refoulement’ are inconsistent with international human rights law, refugee law and customary international law, and further detrimental to a population that has already experienced extreme suffering.7Proposing to return Syrians immediately after the fall of the regime disregards the contextual complexities and plurality of non-state actors and decades-long fragility in Syria. Furthermore, this disregards the five decades of Al-Assad regime’s authoritarianism, war crimes, widespread human rights abuses and the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure across Syria. Syria remains unsafe. The regime’s violent response to the 2011 peaceful uprisings—including indiscriminate bombings, forced displacement and the use of internationally prohibited chemical weapons—triggered one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War II. Widespread and documented use of torture, arbitrary detention and extrajudicial executions underscores the regime’s brutality.8These atrocities have affected both the population inside Syria and those displaced abroad. Around 6 million Syrians reside as refugees, the majority (4.6 million) in neighbouring countries. Türkiye shelters 2.8 million Syrian refugees, while Lebanon hosts about 1.5 million (half of them unregistered) Syrian refugees, and Jordan hosts 564 000 Syrian refugees.4 5Since 2015, over one million Syrians have migrated to Europe, primarily settling in Germany, with smaller numbers in other European countries due to the increasingly difficult circumstances they faced in refugee hosting countries; these including restrictions on employment, movement and education.

Integration is a cornerstone of European refugee policies. Forcing refugees to abandon their progress contradicts this principle.18Well-integrated refugees contribute economically and socially to host countries.19Undermining integration harms both refugees and host communities. Syrian refugees are particularly vital to European labour markets, especially in healthcare. The German Hospital Association warned that rapid deportation of Syrian healthcare workers could exacerbate staffing shortages, harming service quality.20Instead of deportation, European policymakers should empower the Syrian diaspora to contribute to rebuilding efforts.21Diaspora-led organisations have shown remarkable resilience in supporting humanitarian initiatives in Syria and refugee-hosting countries.22 23Policies promoting circular migration, defined as the voluntary, temporary and repetitive movement of individuals across borders, typically between country of origin and host country for work or other reasons,24offer a pragmatic alternative, enabling Syrians to temporarily return to assess conditions and contribute to rebuilding efforts while maintaining stability in host countries.24A circular migration approach could enable Syrians currently working in the German healthcare system, such as the estimated 10 000 Syrian healthcare professionals addressing workforce shortages,20 24to contribute to rebuilding health systems in Syria without jeopardising their stability and integration in Germany. Circular migration balances refugees' needs with the broader goal of stabilising Syria.

In addition to mental health concerns, inadequate healthcare provision in host countries further endangers refugees. Many third-country agreements fail to guarantee healthcare access. Rwanda’s refugee camps, for instance, struggle with limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, mental health services and basic hygiene infrastructure. LGBTQ+individuals and other marginalised groups face heightened discrimination, including healthcare settings. Ensuring continued medical treatment postdeportation is critical. Deportation should be conditional on continuity of access to care, including medicines.26 28Shifting asylum responsibilities to lower-income countries already facing healthcare challenges exacerbates inequities. Instead of externalising asylum obligations, high-income countries must invest in rights-based policies that uphold refugees’ health, including safe asylum pathways and comprehensive healthcare. Failure to do so will deepen health inequities, worsening the global refugee health crisis.

European countries must ensure healthcare continuity for Syrian and other refugees and asylum seekers, especially for those with chronic conditions, through collaboration with international health organisations. The externalisation policies proposed by many European governments will exacerbate health vulnerabilities for forcibly displaced people. As public health professionals and researchers, we emphasise the importance of safeguarding refugees’ rights, ensuring healthcare continuity and fostering inclusive policies. At this pivotal moment, policymakers must uphold international legal standards and prioritise strategies that protect forcibly displaced populations worldwide. Repatriation must not come at the expense of safety, dignity and fundamental rights. The challenges facing Syrian refugees mirror those of other displaced populations, from Afghanis to Rohingya and Venezuelans, who face premature returns and restricted asylum access in different host countries. Instead of offloading responsibilities onto lower-income countries, high-income nations must ensure protection, integration and access to healthcare. Studies reported that recognising refugees’ contributions, especially through inclusive hosting and service integration, can strengthen host communities and support postcrisis recovery, as seen in settings like Uganda29and in fragile health systems.30Rights-based policies that safeguard health and dignity must guide global responses to forced displacement. Government actions today will define the future of refugee protection and public health equity worldwide.
