Postharvest loss (PHL) remains a critical challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Nigeria, where it exacerbates food insecurity and economic vulnerabilities. This study investigates the adoption of postharvest packaging technologies (PHPTs), focusing on reusable plastic crates (RPCs) for tomato harvesting and marketing, and examines farmers’ adoption decisions with market channel choices. Using a dataset of 1,704 tomato farmers, we address the potential endogeneity between RPCs adoption and the choice of market channels through a recursive bivariate probit model. The findings indicate that farmers engaged in long-distance sales are more likely to adopt RPCs, motivated by the potential for higher price premiums and reduced losses during transit. However, there are significant barriers to RPCs’ adoption, including high acquisition costs and limited availability in rural areas. The study findings also underscore the importance of irrigation practices, membership in farmers’ associations, and proximity to major output markets as key drivers of RPCs’ uptake. These insights are critical for informing targeted interventions to improve access to and adoption of PHPTs, thereby reducing PHL and strengthening the resilience of smallholder tomato farmers in Nigeria.

Reducing postharvest loss remains one of the most important pathways to sustainable food system security. Postharvest loss of horticultural crops is high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where smallholder farmers play a critical role in production1. Most losses happen during the production and postharvest handling stages, accounting for 38% and 34% of the total losses, respectively2. The significant amounts of food loss are worrisome, particularly given sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) poverty and food insecurity1. Reducing postharvest losses (PHL) is a key pathway to food and nutrition security in SSA3. Food losses in SSA are influenced by insufficient infrastructure and technology for postharvest handling and storage, limited access to markets and coordinated logistics, and poor knowledge and skills in food handling and preservation techniques4,5. While the Green Revolution saw increased food production through higher yields from modern farming techniques, it inadvertently led to challenges in food distribution. The focus on a limited set of staple crops, such as rice and wheat, crowded out crop diversity in the food systems, particularly non-staple crops like vegetables, pulses, and legumes, which are critical sources of micronutrients and protein. Moreover, the emphasis on boosting yields was not always matched with corresponding investments in storage, transportation, and market infrastructure, exacerbating already high levels of PHL6. Thus, feeding Africa’s growing urban population of 472 million is becoming daunting with the current PHL7. The urban population dependent on agricultural food from rural areas is expected to double over the next 25 years, with an annual growth rate of 4%8. It is essential to tackle PHL in SSA to reduce the food deficit and ensure food and nutrition security3.

SSA countries can reduce food losses by tackling the underlying causes of PHL and implementing effective strategies like upgrading infrastructure and technology for postharvest management, improving market access and transportation, and raising awareness on proper food preservation methods. Post-harvest technologies (PHTs) are crucial in reducing food loss in Africa3,9–11. By implementing proper storage practices, PHTs help to prevent spoilage and preserve the quality of harvested crops12,13. This ensures that more of the food produced reaches consumers and is not wasted by allowing for more extended storage and transportation periods. This ultimately increases access to food, improves affordability, and reduces the risk of food insecurity5. Furthermore, PHTs also help to maintain the nutritional value of harvested crops.

Nigeria’s attempts to address malnutrition by enhancing the accessibility and affordability of nutrient-rich horticultural crops are hindered by the high levels of PHL. Perishable horticultural crops can lead to substantial harvest losses for farmers if adequate postharvest techniques are not applied. This may lead to lower income and food insecurity. Studies estimate that 33–50% of tomato production fails to reach markets in Nigeria due to poor handling and the lack of appropriate storage infrastructure14. Smallholder farmers in Nigeria can benefit significantly from adopting enhanced PHTs to reduce PHL and boost income. Using PHTs, farmers may prolong the shelf life of their products, minimize spoilage, and access higher-value markets. This can result in higher income and more food stability, especially for small-scale farmers who depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Reducing losses in perishable and nutritious food supply chains can help restore essential nutrients to the food system, leading to more supply and lower prices, benefiting low-income households in developing countries15.

Previous research has extensively established the effectiveness of PHTs such as RPCs, particularly among traders21–24. Studies show that replacing traditional raffia with RPCs can significantly reduce PHL23,25, contributing to improved incomes and livelihoods for market actors22,24. Beyond economic benefits, such technologies offer broader systemic benefits across the value chain, promoting standardized measurements, transaction transparency, and better access to safe and fresh produce for consumers25. Despite these benefits, recent studies emphasize that the use of and access to PHTs by smallholder farmers remain very limited, especially in rural and low-income settings20,26–29. Flores et al.30note that persistent gaps in access, coupled with fragmented intervention strategies, continue to undermine efforts to reduce PHL. This study contributes to filling these gaps by examining farmer-level adoption of RPCs across different production systems (rainfed and irrigated), using data from the Nigerian fresh tomato value chain. As one of the largest tomato producers and consumers of tomatoes in SSA31and a country facing significant food and nutrition insecurity15, Nigeria presents a critical case for understanding both the potential and the challenges of PHT adoption. With the largest economy in Africa and a growing agro-industrial private sector, Nigeria is well-positioned to scale up the adoption of novel PHT to reduce PHL. In addition to modelling the drivers of RPCs adoption using various econometric methods, we also examine the self-reported challenges farmers face in adopting RPCs based on responses collected through the structured quantitative survey. This integrated analysis offers a more comprehensive view of the adoption of PHT landscape and provides timely evidence for policymakers, development partners, and private-sector actors to design targeted interventions to reduce PHL and increase the availability and uptake of PHTs such as RPCs in rural farming communities.

The remaining part of the article is structured as follows. Section "Postharvest technology adoption in SSA" presents the current state of knowledge of adoption of PHT in SSA. Section "Materials and methods" discusses data collection procedures and estimation approaches. This is followed by a discussion of findings, and the final section provides the conclusions.

Food security challenges in SSA are increasingly linked to high PHL, driven by persistent inefficiencies across agricultural value chains. Globally, nearly 40% of agricultural output is lost annually2,3,32, with losses particularly severe in SSA due to inadequate storage, limited processing capacity, underdeveloped infrastructure, and weak institutional support20,3334.

Empirical evidence on PHT adoption in SSA remains limited in terms of both commodity focus and the types of technologies studied. Bisheko and Rejikumar20highlight that most postharvest interventions concentrate on storage solutions for cereals, such as hermetic bags and drying tarpaulins, with less than 3% of the available literature addressing packaging technologies. Through a systematic review, Muganyizi and Rejikumar20further emphasize the lack of attention to behavioral, policy, and regulatory constraints. They call for broader research considering adoption barriers for packaging innovations such as RPCs.

Empirical findings from Tanzania by Mutungi et al.27identify key drivers of PHT adoption, including farm size, agroecological potential, access to credit, and social influence. Manda et al.28similarly show that joint exposure to social learning and extension services significantly accelerates the adoption of Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags, with adoption patterns differing between early and late adopters. These studies highlight the importance of multi-channel information dissemination and local context in shaping PHT uptake. However, the empirical literature remains fragmented, with few studies examining adoption across diverse postharvest functions, such as harvesting, transportation, and packaging, particularly for fresh produce. Flores Rojas et al.30argue that many countries lack integrated frameworks to support postharvest innovation in perishable value chains. Affognon et al.3further contend that economic losses often exceed physical ones, reinforcing the need for technologies that maintain product quality and market value.

Although several studies affirm the technical and economic benefits of RPCs—including reduced bruising, improved airflow, stackability35–37, and long-term profitability for producers38—there remains limited empirical research on the enabling or constraining factors influencing adoption at the farm level. Despite their proven effectiveness, RPC adoption is hindered by high upfront costs, lack of financing mechanisms, and low awareness among rural farmers25,39. While previous research has focused primarily on the economic benefits for midstream actors such as traders21–24, little is known about the behavioral, institutional, and market-level factors that influence smallholder adoption decisions, particularly in the context of integrating RPCs into the broader tomato value chain. Against this backdrop, this study addresses a critical gap by examining the behavioral, market, and institutional factors that influence the adoption of RPCs across multiple postharvest stages—harvesting, packaging, and marketing—within Nigeria’s fresh tomato value chain. This contribution is particularly timely and relevant, as postharvest losses for tomatoes in Nigeria are posing significant threats to food security, market efficiency, and nutritional outcomes.

Kano State is located in northwestern Nigeria and is the second most populous state in the country. It lies within a semi-arid region between latitudes 10⁰30′ and 13⁰02′ north of the equator and longitudes 7⁰40′ and 10⁰39′ east of the Greenwich meridian38. Kano has a land area of approximately 20,131 square kilometers and had an estimated population of over 15.46 million people in 2022, with the Hausa ethnic group constituting the majority40. The state is characterized by a dry semi-arid climate suitable for agriculture, with its landscape dominated by semi-arid plains. Agriculture remains the backbone of Kano’s economy, engaging more than 65% of the working population in crop cultivation and related activities41. Major food crops cultivated include millet, cowpeas, sorghum, maize, and rice, while groundnuts and cotton are produced mainly for export and industrial purposes42.

Tomatoes are produced in 33 of Nigeria’s 36 States43; however, production is concentrated primarily in Kaduna, Kano, and Plateau States (the study did not include Kaduna State due to security concerns at the time of data collection). These three states account for over 50% of Nigeria’s total tomato production42as presented in Fig.1. According to data from the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS), Kano State cultivated the largest area of land under tomatoes in 2023, with over 45,000 hectares, highlighting its significance in the tomato production (see Fig.2). The state’s favorable agro-climatic conditions - including its Sahelian climate and extensive irrigation infrastructure, such as the Kano River Irrigation Project (KRIP)- make it highly conducive for rainfed and irrigated tomato farming.

The data used in this study were collected as part of the baseline for the One CGIAR Rethinking Food Market Initiatives (RMI) project, which examines the role of postharvest packaging and marketing innovations implemented by Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in rural Northern Nigeria. A detailed description of the survey design and sampling strategy is available in Yami et al.29. This study uses a cross-sectional survey collected from 1,704 tomato-producing farmers across four Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kano State: Garun Mallam, Bunkure, Bichi, and Karaye as shown in Fig.3. Given the limited availability of LGA-level official statistics, these LGAs were purposively selected based on stakeholder consultations and practical field insights regarding their high tomato production potential44. The selection prioritized LGAs with both irrigated and rainfed production systems. A breakdown of tomato-growing communities, selection justification, and sample distribution is provided in Table1. From a total pool of 103 tomato-producing communities, 84 villages were randomly selected, proportionate to the number of tomato-producing communities in each LGA. Then, a census of tomato producers was conducted in each selected village between May 9 and 17, 2023. Households were included in the sampling frame if they had cultivated tomatoes in both of the preceding two years and expressed continued interest in tomato production. From this list, 20 farmers per village were randomly selected using the research randomizer tool45, giving 1680 sampled farmers. An additional 24 farmers across the four local governments were also interviewed (these 24 farmers were part of the initial census list and were included to address potential non-responses). Data collection was conducted using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) between June and July 2023 and information was captured on farmers’ (and their households’) demographics, production practices (including postharvest storage, handling, and transport technologies), and farmers’ perceptions of constraints related to the access and use of postharvest technologies during the 2022/2023 production.

A major problem with Eqs.3and4is the endogeneity between the choice of marketing channel and the adoption of RPCs for harvesting or marketing. For instance, farmers who engage in long-distance markets may capitalize on higher market prices and have better access to information on modern technology, or those who sell directly to wholesalers are likely to get premium prices for their tomatoes if they adopt RPCs. The market channel is associated with the adoption of RPCs for harvesting and marketing, as the same factors that determine the choice of market outlet also influence RPCs adoption. Previous scholars49–53reported a strong correlation between market participation and technology adoption. As earlier noted, a bivariate probit is likely more suitable to model the impact of the explanatory variables while accounting for jointly determined decisions46,48,54. Thus, the bivariate probit model addresses the endogeneity problem in Eqs.5and7, considering the adoption of RPCs for harvesting and marketing and the choice of marketing channel.

If the error terms ε1and ε2,ϵ1and ϵ2are correlated, then the two outcome variables are endogenously defined46. The set of independent covariates includes farmer age, education status, household size, farm size, market distance, production system, access to credit, association membership, sources of tomato seeds/seedlings, access to extension, and buying input collectively. We used the robust standard error estimate to address homoscedasticity. Details of the measurement of covariates included in our model are presented in Table2.

Descriptive statistics were also employed to analyze the primary data and offer insights into the present level of adoption of RPCs along value chains. The study also sought to identify barriers to using these technologies in rainfed and irrigated farming systems. The survey data were analyzed using Stata (Version 18.5 MP—Parallel Edition, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA;https://www.stata.com). Respondents were categorized as PHT adopters or non-adopters based on their use of RPCs during at least one harvest in the rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. The adoption category classification was applied to determine if the respondent used RPCs in one of the top five harvests, as harvest frequency varies among growers.

Table3illustrates the socioeconomic characteristics of tomato growers during the 2023 production season. We did not consider gender in the estimation because the majority of our sample households (98%) are male-headed. The higher number of men in our sample is because we invited household heads, and the head of a typical Northern Nigerian household is predominantly male. Household heads can avoid potential confounding effects that different roles and positions within the family may have on the results55. This is consistent with the findings of Ibrahim et al.39, Adegbola et al.56, Usman and Bakari57, Sekumade and Toluwalase58, and Sennuga et al.59, who found that 100% of fruit and vegetable production, handling, and selling is basically and exclusively a male business in Nigeria. Their studies opined that the cultural traditions of the study area do not allow females to be actively involved in farming activities. The average age of the household head is about 43 years, most of the respondents have at most a secondary school level of highest education, and the average household size is about 12 members, with at least four adult members and four kids in school. The average total farm size is 2.2 ha, as most farmers, approximately 75%, had access to land ranging from one to 5 hectares, and 69% acquired their farmland through inheritance. Additionally, we find that 64% of them sourced their tomato seed and seedlings from agro-dealers, and only 3% sourced from seed companies. The adequacy and quality of tomato seeds and their source are crucial determinants that significantly affect tomato output60. About 22% of the respondents have membership in a producer association, and only a few household heads have access to credit (8%) and buy input collectively (10%).

Socioeconomic characteristics (farm and institutional covariates).

Tomatoes are a highly perishable commodity, and without proper harvesting, storage, and packaging technology utilization, farmers may lose significant harvests due to spoilage. Thus, the adoption of PHT is critical to minimize PHL. Table4shows the adoption of PHT for harvesting and packaging tomatoes. The results indicate that 17% of the farmers adopt RPCs for packaging their tomato produce at harvesting, and about 12.6% use them as packaging material for transporting tomatoes to the market. On the other hand, only a few (4.4%) of the farmers participate in long-distance markets because the majority of them sell at either farm gates or markets within their local government of residence. Thus, our results show that most farmers use conventional raffia baskets (a traditional PHT) as the primary material for collecting tomatoes during harvest and marketing, as only a few are engaged in distant markets. The dense interlacing of the raffia basket hinders adequate air circulation, further exacerbated by the hot and humid tropical atmosphere. Moreover, the basket’s lack of rigidity results in compression when piled, leading to the tomatoes being crushed during transportation15. High adoption of raffia baskets for packaging and marketing tomatoes along the Nigerian tomato value chain has been noted by several studies, including Adegbola et al.56. and Ibrahim et al.39, who show a high adoption of raffia baskets in Nigeria, with adoption rates of 91% and 64% respectively. Our findings also highlight a dominance of on-farm sales and limited geographical reach of tomato sales for most producers. The dependence on short-market outlets could be explained by liquidity constraints55. Small farmers with low production may depend on immediate cash to finance other household needs61. This is consistent with Fafchamps and Minten62, who find that most farmers choose a market outlet mainly by liquidity needs rather than market price.

Adoption of PHT (use of RPCs for harvest and market) and marketing channel.

Additionally, we find that about 65.1% of those who adopted RPCs acquired them through buyers who came with their own crates, and 25.1% rented them. Hence, only a few of them indicated that they either owned or purchased them, as shown in Fig.4.

Source of acquisition of RPCs. Note: Number of observations is 215.

Figure5reveals the perceived benefits of adopting the RPCs for tomato packaging. Accordingly, the perceived advantages of utilizing RPCs include the reduction of PHL and the anticipation of receiving premium prices for the produce. Our results reveal that about 88% of the farmers reported that RPCs adoption is beneficial in reducing both PHL and obtaining a premium price for tomato, either mutually or exclusively (see Fig.6). This aligns with empirical evidence indicating that switching from raffia baskets to RPCs significantly reduces PHL, particularly in long-distance trade. RPCs adoption reduces tomato PHL from 40% to as low as 5%23,25and contributes to income and livelihood improvements of market actors22,24.

However, the non-adopters of RPCs identify the binding constraints limiting their adoption, as presented in Fig.7. According to the results, unavailability in rural settings is the most critical reason for not adopting RPCs. Another significant factor is the limited incentives for RPCs’ use as the preferred packaging material, as it is not requested by buyers or other buyers coming with their packaging materials, along with concerns about the associated ownership costs of this technology. The reasons for not adopting RPCs are in line with the factors highlighted by Hosking et al.25in Ethiopia, Adegbola et al.56, and Ibrahim et al.39in Nigeria. Adegbola et al.56claim that the high acquisition cost and unavailability are the primary reasons for not adopting RPCs. Similarly, the study conducted by Ibrahim et al.39attributed the low adoption percentage of RPCs to factors such as high cost, insufficient awareness, and unavailability of technology in rural areas. The price for a plastic crate went from $2.51 Before 2021, it went to $5.90 and then to $9.51 in 2022 alone (the official exchange rate of 1 USD in Nigerian currency is ₦398.9, ₦423.9, and ₦638.7 in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively). However, the price slightly decreased to $7.36 in mid-2023. In many cases, the high costs have discouraged farmers’ use of RPCs in favor of traditional raffia baskets despite the high losses associated with their use63. Our findings indicate that unavailability, cost-related barriers to RPC ownership, and lack of rewarding market systems are key constraints to the adoption of RPCs. These results are consistent with broader findings from other studies conducted in Nigeria24and in low- and middle-income countries25. While our study is geographically limited to northern Nigeria, the challenges identified, particularly the considerable distance between production and consumption markets, reflect structural issues that may also be relevant in other tomato-producing regions.

Figure8presents the results of the nonlinear regression estimates of the determinants of RPCs for the harvesting and marketing tomatoes. In models 1 and 2, we used bivariate probit to explain the factors that determine the adoption of RPCs. Specifically, we modelled the adoption of RPCs for transportation (model 1) as a function of prior adoption at harvest. Models 3 and 4 are separate univariate probit regression estimates for the factor predicting the adoption of RPCs at the marketing and harvesting stages, respectively. Overall, all the models appear significant at 1%, except that rho in model 1 is not significant, which suggests that the decision of the household to adopt RPCs for market and harvest is not correlated and may not be simultaneously determined. As noted earlier, we also suspect that the decision to participate in the long-distance market may be correlated with RPCs’ adoption, nullifying our results in models 1, 2, 3, and 4. Prior studies support this potential linkage: for example, Barrett49argued that market participation enhances the adoption of technologies among smallholder households in developing countries. Similarly, Mutungi et al.27found that residence in areas with higher production and market potential is associated with PHT adoption in Tanzania. Awotide et al.50also reported a strong correlation between improved agricultural technologies and market participation. Furthermore, long-distance market participation may influence adoption behaviour through increased access to more market information, price premiums, and income gains52. Therefore, we accounted for this potential endogeneity concern in these models in Table5.

Determinants of RPCs adoption at marketing and harvesting stages. Model 1 presents the first equation of the recursive bivariate probit model estimating the probability of RPC adoption at the marketing stage, conditional on adoption at harvest. Model 2 represents the second equation, modeling RPC adoption at harvest as an independent decision. For comparison, results from corresponding univariate probit models are also estimated: Model 3 for marketing-stage adoption and Model 4 for harvest-stage adoption. All results are presented as average marginal effects with 95% confidence intervals. ***p< 0.01, **p< 0.05, *p< 0.1. The models include additional control variables, with full estimation results reported in Supplementary TableS1.

Endogeneity test between long-distance market participation and RPCs adoption.

Note: Estimates from seemingly unrelated bivariate probit models with robust standard errors. Full models are reported in Supplementary TableS1.represents the correlation between the error terms of the adoption and market participation equations.

We first start by testing the potential endogeneity of long-distance market participation in influencing the adoption of RPCs for harvesting and marketing. For this, we estimated a seemingly unrelated system of probit models. The error correlation coefficient in Table5was statistically significant for both models, indicating that the error terms in both equations are correlated. This confirms that market choice and RPCs adoption in both adoption stages are endogenous, justifying the use of a recursive bivariate probit specification in the second stage for consistent marginal effect estimation by accounting for endogeneity on the impact of long-distance trade on harvesting and marketing stages of RPCs adoption.

Table6reports the results of a recursive bivariate probit model estimating RPCs adoption by accounting for the endogeneity in the effect of long-distance market participation on the adoption of RPCs for harvest and market. We are careful not to assert causation in our report, as our estimation does not address the reverse causality between the adoption of RPCs and market participation. Even though we do not claim causality, these correlations are meaningful. The findings, based on average marginal effects,  suggest that participation in long-distance markets is associated with an 11 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of adopting RPCs at harvest. However, this effect is not statistically significant, implying that while the direction of influence is positive, long-distance trading alone does not explain RPCs’ adoption at the harvest stage after accounting for endogeneity. The lack of a statistically significant effect of long-distance marketing on the adoption of RPCs at the harvest stage likely reflects the prevailing marketing dynamics of smallholder tomato producers in Northern Nigeria. Most smallholders sell their produce at the farm gate or in nearby informal markets, where the economic incentives for investing in improved PHT are limited. Liquidity constraints further restrict farmers’ ability to independently procure or rent RPCs at the time of harvest. In many cases, farmgate buyers or aggregators supply packaging materials—including traditional baskets or RPCs—thereby removing the adoption decision from the farmer29.

Results from the recursive bivariate probit model for different stages of adoption of RPCs.

Notes: Columns (1) and (3) present the results from the structural equations for RPCs adoption at harvest and marketing, respectively, while columns (2) and (4) report the reduced-form equations for the potentially endogenous regressor—marketing beyond the LGA. These models are estimated using the Conditional Mixed Process (CMP) estimator. The figure in parentheses is the robust standard error; we determine statistical significance based on the model parameters and report the implied average marginal effect in percentage changes ***p< 0.01, **p< 0.05, *p< 0.10.

Additionally, marketing to short-distance markets reduces the urgency of minimizing PHL, as the produce undergoes less handling and transport. Since buyers in local markets often do not offer price premiums for better-handled produce, the financial rationale for investing in RPCs at harvest remains weak. These factors suggest that participation in long-distance trade alone cannot drive adoption unless complemented by supporting mechanisms such as crate rental services, bundled logistics, or cooperative marketing arrangements. In contrast, the model shows a statistically significant impact of long-distance marketing on the adoption of RPCs during the marketing stage, with an estimated marginal effect of 19% points (p< 0.001). This result reinforces the hypothesis that access to more distant or urban consumer markets in the southern part of Nigeria, such as the Mile-12 international fruits and vegetable market in Lagos, incentivizes the uptake of improved postharvest handling technologies owing to price premiums and minimal loss during transit. This result aligns with the findings of Jijue et al.52that farmers who engaged in long market participation may have high income from premium price and valuable information that can aid the adoption of PHT. Similarly, Anríquez et al.64noted that the adoption of RPCs for harvest and transport can improve tomato quality and enhance farmers’ income through better market prices.

In addition, we find a significant and positive association between farmers practicing irrigated production systems and both rainfed and irrigated farming and RPC adoption at harvest and for the marketing stage in tomato production. Irrigation gives farmers more control over water availability, allowing them to cultivate crops year-round and mitigate the impacts of low or variable rainfall. This ability to manage water supply can guarantee more stability and availability of agricultural products for the market65and further encourage the adoption of RPCs. Also, we noticed that the marginal effect of farmers combining production systems is higher than that of those engaging solely in irrigated production systems. An explanation for this is that farmers who combine rainfed and irrigation systems are more likely to adopt RPCs for tomato harvest and marketing. In the same vein, producers who belong to a producer’s association or cooperatives are associated with a 4.4 and 4.9% points higher likelihood of adopting RPCs for the harvest and marketing of tomatoes, and these estimates are significant at 10% and 1%, respectively. These findings mirror the results of Bisheko and Rejikumar20, who found that group membership influences the adoption of specific PHT. Quan et al.53and Manda et al.28also noted that cooperative associations, social networks, and enterprises promote technology adoption significantly.

On the other hand, we find a negative association between age, log of asset value, distance to primary market, tomato farm size cultivated (although the latter is not statistically significant), and the likelihood of adopting RPCs. These findings suggest that older household heads, or those farther from the nearest primary market, are less likely to adopt RPCs. This pattern contrasts with conventional expectations that wealthier farmers would have greater capacity and incentives to adopt PHT. However, in Northern Nigeria’s tomato value chain context, the observed behavior may be driven by how midstream actors coordinate transactions. As Hernández et al.66found, midstream actors such as wholesalers and aggregators often mitigate idiosyncratic risks such as inconsistent supply or variable product quality by selectively sourcing from socially or economically prominent farmers. These lead farmers are perceived as more reliable and tend to attract buyers who often bring their packaging materials to the farm gate. This reduces the need for farmers in this segment of the chain to invest in technologies like RPCs independently. Thus, the lack of RPC adoption among resource-endowed farmers may reflect a market dynamic in which packaging technology is externally provided rather than farmer-driven. Lastly, the factors that influence long-distance market participation in selling their tomato products are influenced by education status, number of kids in school, household size, tomato farm size, and acquisition of seeds from agro-dealers. This agrees with the work of Awotide et al.50, Haile et al.67, and Akrong et al.68, who reported that education, household size, farm size, and access to input markets promote long-distance market participation.

To ensure the robustness of our empirical findings, we estimated the standard probit regression as a specification check against the original bivariate probit models. The results from the probit model presented in Supplementary TableS2are consistent with our main estimates, both in sign and statistical significance, thereby reinforcing the validity of our identification strategy. This consistency suggests that the assumptions underpinning the bivariate probit specification, particularly regarding the joint determination of the endogenous binary variables, are not driving the core results in a spurious manner46,48,54. Overall, the robustness check affirms the credibility of our results and the reliability of the inferences drawn from them.

A diverse range of constraints exacerbates the already high PHL. Using the mean average weighted score, we ranked the postharvest challenges faced by the tomato-based household, and the result is presented in Table7. According to tomato producers, the five most significant postharvest challenges they encountered during the study’s production season include the frequent occurrence of pests and diseases (89%), erratic weather conditions (79%), limited access to formal agricultural credit (74.5%), availability of ineffective or counterfeit pesticides (70.3%) and inadequate knowledge of postharvest handling procedures (64.6%). These challenges underscore the multifaceted nature of issues affecting tomato production and postharvest management. This is consistent with previous study findings of Ochilo et al.69. , Adebisi-Adelani et al.70. , and Usman and Bakari57, who highlighted that pest and disease attacks, climate change, and shortage of inputs, as well as unavailability of storage facilities, are among the most important constraints. In particular, 68% of farmers reported insect pest challenges as severe. As Ochilo et al.69. pointed out, tomato production is highly affected by the incidence of diseases and insects. Climate change even worsens the situation, which increases pest infestation by increasing the atmospheric carbon dioxide impacts of pest species directly and indirectly through interactions with other environmental factors.

This article investigates how smallholder tomato growers’ engagement in long-distance market channels impacts their decision to adopt RPCs in Northern Nigeria. First, we model the decision to adopt RPCs as a conditionally independent decision from the choice of farmers’ market channels. Second, we estimate the probability of RPCs adoption as an endogenous variable determined by the choice of marketing channels and use a recursive bivariate probit specification to model this decision. Our findings reveal persistently low adoption rates of RPCs, with only 17% of farmers using them at harvest and 12.6% during transport, while just 4.4% participate in long-distance trade. We show that the decision to use RPCs is endogenous to the choice of long-distance market channels. Farmers engaged in long-distance and high-value markets such as Mile-12 in Lagos are significantly more likely to adopt RPCs at the marketing stage, due to incentives like price premiums and reduced transit postharvest losses. However, adoption at the harvest stage remains limited, mainly due to the dominance of on-farm sales. Given the scale of postharvest losses and the low uptake of RPCs, urgent coordinated action is needed. We recommend that the federal and state governments, in partnership with development organizations, private sector actors, and farmers’ cooperatives, prioritize the immediate establishment of village-level RPCs’ rental and distribution centers in key tomato-producing areas. These centers should improve farmers’ timely access to affordable packaging technologies and reduce the cost and availability constraints that currently hinder the adoption of RPCs. Furthermore, development partners, agricultural extension systems, and producer organizations should promote bundled interventions, including regular dissemination of market price information, support for aggregation, and logistics coordination, to facilitate smallholders’ participation in distant, high-value markets and promote more inclusive value chain integration.
