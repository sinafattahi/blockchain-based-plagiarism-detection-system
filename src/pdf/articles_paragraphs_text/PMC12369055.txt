Advanced gastric cancer frequently leads to severe complications, such as bleeding, which severely impacts patients' quality of life and prognosis. Traditional approaches for hemostasis include endoscopic treatments and surgery, but their invasive nature and potential for significant morbidity have made less invasive options like radiation therapy (RT) and transarterial embolization (TAE) appealing. Nonetheless, studies comparing the therapeutic effects and prognosis of RT and TAE are limited, underscoring a significant gap in research and clinical practice.

This retrospective study analyzed patients with advanced gastric cancer who experienced uncontrollable bleeding and were treated with RT or TAE. The efficacy of these treatments was assessed based on the achievement of hemostasis, defined as the absence of the need for blood transfusion within 14 days post-treatment and no requirement for additional intervention for bleeding. Furthermore, the study evaluated the post-treatment course, including survival outcomes and re-bleeding rates, to compare the prognostic implications of treatment success or failure.

This study encompassed 28 patients, of whom 19 underwent RT and 9 received TAE. RT was associated with a superior rate of immediate hemostasis (94.7% versus 66.7%, p = 0.047). Nonetheless, the incidence of re-bleeding in the RT cohort was 15.8%, compared to 44.4% in the TAE group, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.11). Furthermore, the occurrence of adverse events was comparable between the two treatment modalities (21.1% for RT versus 33.3% for TAE,p= 0.48). An examination of long-term outcomes underscored the initial treatment's effectiveness and the potential transition to additional therapies as critical determinants of the re-bleeding risk. Groups achieving favorable initial outcomes (p< 0.001) and those for whom subsequent interventions were viable (p= 0.014) demonstrated a significant enhancement in re-bleeding-free survival. Despite the discrepancy in rates of immediate hemostasis, the comparison between the RT and TAE groups revealed no statistically significant difference in re-bleeding-free survival (p= 0.55).

RT exhibited superior hemostasis in advanced gastric cancer bleeding compared to TAE, yet both treatments showed similar re-bleeding-free survival rates. The success of the initial treatment, along with potential for further interventions, critically influenced outcomes, emphasizing the importance of effective initial hemostasis.

Bleeding in advanced gastric cancer presents a formidable challenge, significantly impacting patient prognosis and quality of life [1]. The prevalence of bleeding in gastric cancer patients is estimated to be 1–8%, necessitating prompt and effective hemostatic interventions [2–4]. In the management of advanced gastric cancer, palliative local therapies including interventional radiology, endoscopic treatment, surgery, and radiation therapy play a pivotal role in addressing symptoms that are unmanageable with conventional pharmacotherapy, such as bleeding and obstruction [5–8]. Hemostasis for tumor bleeding traditionally prioritizes endoscopic treatments as the first-line approach. However, controlling bleeding through endoscopy can be challenging, and surgical interventions for stenosis or bleeding are often avoided due to their invasive nature. In such instances, palliative radiation therapy (RT) and trans-arterial embolization (TAE) are considered viable alternatives. These methods provide essential options for symptom control in patients where less invasive or conventional treatments fail or are deemed unsuitable due to the complexity of their condition or the invasive nature of the alternatives [9–14].

Palliative RT serves as an essential treatment for managing bleeding in patients with advanced gastric cancer, providing symptomatic relief in cases where surgery and chemotherapy are not options [13,14]. The JROSG 17–3 study, a landmark multicenter prospective investigation, highlighted the efficacy of RT in controlling gastric cancer bleeding, demonstrating a high bleeding response rate [15]. Furthermore, this study revealed improvements in symptoms such as dyspnea, pain, and stress post-radiotherapy, underscoring the potential benefits of RT in enhancing patient quality of life [16]. Notably, the choice between single-fraction versus multiple-fraction radiotherapy has implications for patient outcomes, with single-fraction therapy showing a significant reduction in fatigue and stress, suggesting a preferable option for patients with a limited prognosis [16].

TAE represents a critical intervention for gastric cancer bleeding, particularly when endoscopic methods fail [9–12]. It is deemed a more invasive procedure, typically reserved for cases where non-invasive treatments are ineffective [11,12]. Despite its invasive nature, TAE is crucial in the hemostatic management of advanced gastric cancer, necessitating further research into its role and effectiveness relative to other treatment modalities. Moreover, the determination of predictive factors for endoscopic hemostasis failure in gastric cancer bleeding remains an area ripe for investigation, potentially guiding the selection of TAE in clinical practice [15,17].

The literature currently lacks comprehensive comparative studies on the effectiveness of RT and TAE in the management of bleeding in unresectable advanced gastric cancer. This gap highlights the critical need for rigorous research to evaluate these treatments side-by-side, to establish evidence-based guidelines for their application. Such studies are essential for advancing clinical practice, ensuring that patients receive the most effective, tailored treatment for bleeding complications associated with advanced gastric cancer.

This is a prospective compiled retrospective study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sakai City Medical Center, where the research was conducted. Participation was contingent upon obtaining informed consent from all individuals, or through an opt-out mechanism, after thoroughly explaining the study's objectives and nature. The study harnessed data from a prospectively maintained database to identify eligible cases diagnosed with gastric cancer from May 2013 through January 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed cases where hemostasis via endoscopic intervention or surgical procedures was deemed either challenging or unfeasible, as well as instances regarded as surgically inoperable due to the patient's condition. The cohort consisted of patients experiencing uncontrollable bleeding stemming from gastric cancer, for whom either RT or TAE was administered. All patients required transfusions at least once weekly before treatment. Patients with clear arterial bleeding on CT scans were excluded; the focus was on venous tumor bleeding. Eligibility was strictly limited to cases exhibiting bleeding from lesions verified through imaging to originate from either primary gastric carcinoma or post-surgical local recurrences. It was imperative that no active bleeding was detected from lesions other than those attributed to the primary or recurrent gastric cancer.

The study's primary aim was to ascertain the hemostatic efficacy of RT/TAE in managing bleeding in patients with gastric cancer and to determine the subsequent therapeutic course following intervention. The efficacy of the selected treatments was assessed by evaluating the proportion of cases achieving hemostasis, defined by two criteria: 1) Absence of the need for blood transfusion for a continuous duration of 14 days post-treatment initiation, and 2) No subsequent interventions targeting the bleeding lesion, including surgery, endoscopic hemostasis, RT, or TAE, post-treatment commencement. The patients who underwent RT or TAE were those who had been evaluated for tumor bleedings with endoscopy and were deemed unsuitable for endoscopic or surgical treatment due to the severity of their condition or the high risk associated with general anesthesia. Both groups included patients who were unsuitable for endoscopic treatment following evaluation. Patients with CT scans with clear arterial bleeding were excluded from this study to focus on cases where venous tumor bleeding was predominant.

The clinical and pathological characteristics between the two groups were compared using statistical methods appropriate for the data type: the chi-squared test for categorical variables and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables. Hemoglobin levels prior to treatment were recorded, but complete data on blood transfusion volumes were not available. Re-bleeding free survival (RbFS) was delineated as the duration of survival without any rebleeding post-treatment. Survival rates were calculated employing the Kaplan–Meier estimator and comparisons drawn using the log-rank test. Statistical significance was established at a p-value of less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were executed using JMP® PRO software (version 16.1.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study are summarized in Table1. A total of 28 patients were analyzed, with 19 undergoing radiation therapy (RT) and 9 receiving TAE. Only one case in the RT group involved bleeding from locoregional recurrences after initial surgery. All other cases involved bleeding from the primary tumor. The median age was 73 years (range 50–91) for the RT group and 72 years (range 59–77) for the TAE group, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.94). The distribution of sex, body mass index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, tumor location, use of anticoagulants, and previous treatment modalities showed no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups, except for previous treatment where chemotherapy was significantly more common in the RT group (p= 0.029).

Details regarding the RT/TAE are provided in Table2. For the RT group, the majority received a radiotherapy dose of more than 30 Gy (n = 14 (73.7%)). In the TAE group, various embolization techniques were employed, including gelatin sponge embolization and coiling, with a median number of feeding arteries targeted being 2 (range 1–2). For TAE, the primary goal was to embolize the main feeding artery to achieve hemostasis or reduce bleeding volume. Histology revealed that all cases involved venous tumor bleeding.

Outcome measures are detailed in Table3. All patients in the RT group completed the planned treatment, compared to 77.8% in the TAE group, with a statistically significant difference (p= 0.033). Successful hemostasis was achieved in 94.7% of the RT group and 66.7% of the TAE group, which was also statistically significant (p= 0.047). Re-bleeding rates and adverse events (AEs) of all grades and grade ≥ 3 did not show significant differences between the groups. Specific AEs noted include intra-tumor hemorrhage, pancreatic necrosis, splenic infarction, pyloric stenosis, pneumonitis, small intestine bleeding, and dermatitis, with varying incidences in each group. The data presented in Table3elucidate the treatment trajectory post-intervention, revealing a statistically significant greater propensity for the TAE cohort to undergo additional therapeutic interventions in comparison to the RT cohort (p= 0.023). Observations did not detect late toxicity within either cohort.

Subsequent analyses exploring the predictors of re-bleeding risk underscored the significance of the initial treatment's effectiveness and the potential for transition to subsequent therapies as crucial prognostic indicators (Table4). Additionally, the examination of re-bleeding-free survival curves, predicated on the successful outcome of the primary intervention (p< 0.001) and the capacity for transitioning to further treatments (p = 0.014), revealed that cohorts with efficacious initial treatments and feasible subsequent treatment transitions exhibited improved prognoses (Fig.1). However, when comparing re-bleeding-free survival rates between the RT and TAE groups, no statistical significance was observed, underscoring the comparable efficacy of these treatment modalities in mitigating re-bleeding risk.

In our exploration of treatment modalities for bleeding in patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer, the pivotal role of both RT and TAE is highlighted, as they offer considerable benefits for achieving hemostasis. The efficacy of RT in controlling bleeding has been supported by the JROSG 17–3 study, which demonstrated a high bleeding response rate, underscoring the potential of RT to enhance patient quality of life by improving symptoms such as dyspnea, pain, and stress post-radiotherapy [15,16]. Similarly, TAE has been acknowledged as a critical intervention, especially when endoscopic methods are unsuccessful, emphasizing its importance in the hemostatic management of advanced gastric cancer [11,12,15,17]. Despite these advances, the decision-making process for selecting the most suitable treatment modality remains complex, necessitating further research to establish evidence-based guidelines.

Our analysis suggests that the disparity in hemostatic success rates between TAE and RT might be attributable to the anatomical complexity of the gastric vasculature. In particular, the presence of multiple primary and collateral vessels, especially in the vicinity of larger tumors, complicates the complete embolization process, potentially leading to a lower success rate for TAE [18]. RT, by contrast, can be uniformly administered over a predetermined target area, which may confer a therapeutic advantage in achieving primary hemostasis. Considering these factors, RT could be posited as a preferable initial hemostatic intervention in certain clinical contexts. This perspective is integral to our study's findings, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach to the management of inoperable progressive gastric cancer bleeding. While RT appears to offer a higher immediate rate of hemostatic efficacy compared to TAE, it is essential to recognize that this does not translate into differences in overall survival outcomes. The implication here is a call for personalized treatment modalities that prioritize the patient's overall health status and the specificities of their condition, aiming to reduce the treatment burden and mitigate the risk of adverse complications [15–17]. Thus, the therapeutic decision-making between RT and TAE should be tailored, eschewing a uniform strategy in favor of one that is carefully aligned with the individual patient profile and the intricate nuances of the presenting clinical picture.

Our research delineates that the differential impact of RT and TAE on long-term outcomes in advanced gastric cancer management is minimal. Crucially, it is the initial treatment's hemostatic efficacy and the patient's eligibility for subsequent interventions that are instrumental in prognostic enhancement. This suggests a paradigm where the primary intervention's success is more predictive of improved survival than the choice between RT and TAE per se. These insights necessitate a tailored approach to therapeutic decisions, emphasizing the salience of a successful initial intervention and subsequent treatment accessibility. Our findings advocate for a judicious selection strategy for initial hemostasis, which could pivot on the potential of RT and TAE to facilitate further therapeutic options, potentially improving survival metrics [15,16]. The imperative thus shifts from a uniform treatment algorithm towards a more individualized, condition-sensitive protocol that aligns with the patient's overall treatment trajectory and their capacity for additional therapeutic endeavors [19,20].

However, the study's retrospective nature and the potential for selection bias due to the non-randomized choice between RT and TAE underscore the limitations inherent in our analysis. The relatively small sample size and the heterogeneity in treatment protocols further complicate the interpretation of our findings, necessitating cautious generalization to broader patient populations. Moreover, the absence of detailed patient-reported outcomes limits our understanding of the full impact of these treatments on patient quality of life, highlighting a significant gap in the current literature and underscoring the need for future research focused on these outcomes. Given the small sample size of this study, it is not possible to conduct a detailed statistical analysis or definitively state which treatment method is superior. However, it is evident that the success of the initial treatment is critically important. In this regard, RT shows a higher success rate compared to TAE, likely because RT targets the entire tumor area. This suggests that RT could be a valuable treatment option in such patient groups. Additionally, the TAE group had more patients with better ECOG-PS and fewer previous treatments, which may have influenced outcomes. Future studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these findings and provide a clearer understanding of the optimal use of RT and TAE in managing bleeding in advanced gastric cancer.

In summary, our study validates the effectiveness of RT and TAE in controlling hemorrhage in patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer. Despite observed differences in immediate hemostatic efficacy, both modalities show promise, particularly when initial success and the availability of follow-up treatments are complemented by subsequent treatments. Given the prevalence of severe systemic impairment in this patient cohort, tailored treatment selection is paramount. The interplay between successful initial hemostasis and the availability of follow-up treatments emerges as a critical determinant of improved prognoses, guiding future research towards optimizing therapeutic strategies in this complex clinical context.
