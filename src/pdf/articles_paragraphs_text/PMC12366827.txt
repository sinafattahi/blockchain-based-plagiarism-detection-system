Despite recent advancements in antifungal therapy, the antifungal armamentarium remains limited compared to antibiotics available for bacterial infections. Developing novel and effective therapeutic strategies is imperative but challenging. One promising approach involves synergizing existing antifungals with complementary agents to enhance efficacy and reduce the required dosages. This study investigates the synergistic effect of isobavachalcone (IBC) and amphotericin B (AmB) againstCryptococcus neoformans in vitroandin vivo, focusing on ferroptosis modulation. Ferroptosis-related markers, including glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), ferrous ions, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were analyzed inCaenorhabditis elegansmodel infected withC. neoformans. IBC (4 μg/mL) significantly lowered AmB’s MIC from 1 μg/mL to 0.25 μg/mL, indicating a fourfold enhancement in potency. The IBC-AmB combination caused structural damage toC. neoformans, compromising membrane permeability and cell wall integrity. The combination elevated host GSH levels while reducing ferrous ions, MDA, and ROS in the infectedC. elegansmodel. Mechanistically, the treatment upregulated antioxidant/stress response genes (SKN-1, GST-4, GST-5, GPX-1, DAF-16, CNC-11) and antimicrobial peptides (NLP-29). Conversely, the pro-inflammatory pathway gene PMK-1 was downregulated. The IBC-AmB combination not only reduces the MIC of AmB by fourfold but also enhances antifungal efficacy through a multifaceted mechanism that directly targets the fungal pathogen and modulates the host response. This dual action has the potential to reduce the adverse effects of AmB and improve therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of cryptococcal infections.

Globally, over one billion individuals are plagued by superficial and invasive fungal infections, with invasive fungal infections being of particular concern [1–4]. Among these,Cryptococcus neoformansstands out as a significant pathogen of concern, predominantly causing cryptococcal meningitis and pneumonia. These infections pose a serious threat to human health, especially among individuals with weakened immune system. It is estimated that there are approximately 223,100 cases of cryptococcal meningitis worldwide annually, leading to around 180,000 fatalities [5–8]. The situation is especially serious in countries with limited resources, where the high cost of effective treatment contributes to the persistently high mortality rate. Consequently, there is an urgent imperative to develop therapeutic strategies againstC. neoformansthat are not only efficient and low in toxicity but also affordable and accessible [9,10].

The current armamentarium for treating cryptococcal infections consists primarily of three classes of antifungal agents: polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins. Amphotericin B (AmB), a polyene antifungal, is the preferred treatment for systemic cryptococcus infections due to its extensive efficacy and relatively low propensity for resistance [11,12]. However, chronic administration of AmB can lead to severe side effects such as renal impairment, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and anemia [13–16]. Furthermore, the widespread use of AmB is constrained by economic and geographical limitations. To mitigate the adverse effects associated with AmB, various formulations have been developed, including AmB liposomes, AmB cholesterol complex, and AmB deoxycholate. Despite these advancements, the high cost and challenges associated with intravenous delivery methods continue to limit the availability of AmB liposomes [17–21]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative strategies, particularly combination therapies, that can reduce the toxicity of AmB while enhancing its therapeutic efficacy.

Isobavachalcone (IBC) is a natural flavonoid derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal plantPsoralea corylifolia, also referred to as bavachalcone, with the molecular formula C20H20O4[22]. Our preliminary research has demonstrated IBC’s potent anti-C. neoformansactivity, highlighting its potential as a novel antifungal agent [23]. In addition to its antifungal properties, IBC has shown significant antioxidant capabilities, effectively neutralizing free radicals and mitigating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage [24]. While AmB is a broad-spectrum antifungal, its clinical application is curtailed by adverse side effects. Combination therapy not only minimizes the dosage of individual drugs, thereby slowing the emergence of resistance, but also enhances therapeutic outcomes through synergistic effects, diminishing adverse reaction [25]. Moreover, the combined approach not only enhances treatment efficacy and diminishes medication-related risks but also alleviates the financial burden on patients, particularly in resource-constrained environments [26,27]. However, the synergistic effect and underlying mechanisms of IBC when used in conjunction with AmB remain largely unexplored.

In this study, we explored the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of IBC in combination with AmB againstC. neoformans. Furthermore, the underlying synergistic mechanism was examined using theCaenorhabditis elegansmodel, a robust tool for studying host–pathogen interactions. Our findings not only expand the current understanding of antifungal therapies but also lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at developing more potent synergistic treatment strategies against cryptococcal infections.

TheC. neoformansH99 strain that was kindly provided by Dr Liu Tongbao from Southwest University, was cultured in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium under standardized conditions (30°C, 220 rpm agitation).Escherichia coliOP50 was inoculated in Luria Broth (LB) medium by incubating at 37°C for 16 h. Subsequently, the bacterial suspension was transferred to fresh nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates to establish a nutrient base for sustainingC. elegansN2 populations that were kindly provided by Dr. Xu Dan from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology, during experimental assays.

IBC (Shanghai, China) and AmB were dissolved in DMSO to prepare stock solutions at 1000× the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). These stocks were aliquoted for single-use and stored at −80°C. For experiments, the stocks were diluted with liquid YPD medium to the desired working concentrations.

The reagents and kits were utilized, including propidium iodide (PI), Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos, Mito-FerroGreen, and 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), all sourced from MedChemExpress (Shanghai, China). FerroOrange was acquired from Maokang Biotechnology (Shanghai, China), and BODIPY 581/591 C11 was also obtained from MedChemExpress (Shanghai, China). Sodium azide (NaN3) were sourced from Solarbio Life Science (Beijing, China). A range of assay kits, including those for ATP, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH + GSSG), as well as NADPH/NADP+, were procured from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). The iron assay kit was purchased from Abcam (Shanghai, China). All additional analytical-grade reagents used in the study were supplied by Xilong Scientific (Shenzhen, Guangdong, China).

The MIC of the IBC and AmB combination (IBC-AmB) was determined using the broth microdilution assay according to the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines. Freshly prepared RPMI-1640 medium was used to create twofold serial dilutions of the IBC-AmB mixture. Each dilution (100 μL) was added to a 96-well plate, followed by 100 μL of overnight-culturedC. neoformans(final concentration: 1 × 103CFU/mL). The plates were incubated at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h, and OD600values were measured. 8 μg/mL AmB and 1 μg/mL AmB were used as positive controls, while the medium alone served as the negative control. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration showing no visible fungal growth. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated as previously described [28–30].

Fungal cells from overnight cultures were diluted to 1 × 105CFU/mL in YPD medium, and 900 μL of this suspension was added to each well of a 24-well plate. Various drug concentrations were then added to achieve final concentrations of 8 μg/mL IBC, 1 μg/mL AmB, 4 μg/mL IBC, 0.125 μg/mL AmB, and a mixture of 4 μg/mL IBC and 0.125 μg/mL AmB, with each well having a final volume of 1000 μL. The plates were incubated at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h. Every 2 h, 10 μL of the culture was sampled, diluted 10-fold with YPD medium, and 5 μL of the diluted solution was spotted onto YPD agar plates. These plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h, after which colonies were counted and time–kill curves were plotted [31,32].

Fungal cells from overnight cultures were diluted to 1 × 105CFU/mL in YPD medium, and 900 μL of the suspension was added to each well of a 24-well plate. Drugs were then added to achieve final concentrations of 4 μg/mL IBC, 0.125 μg/mL AmB, and a combination of 4 μg/mL IBC with 0.125 μg/mL AmB, with a total volume of 1000 μL per well. After incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with PBS.

For cell morphology analysis, cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4°C for 24 h, followed by dehydration in a graded ethanol series (30%–100%, 15 min each), soaking in isoamyl acetate for 1 h, and drying under vacuum. The samples were then gold-coated and examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).

For cell membrane integrity assessment, cells washed with PBS were stained with SYTO 9 and PI (final concentration: 5 μM), incubated at 30°C for 25 min, and washed three times with PBS. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to examine the cells, with excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/520 nm for SYTO 9 and 535/617 nm for PI. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software.

To assess the inhibitory effect of the IBC and AmB mixture onC. neoformansbiofilm growth, a 24-well plate method and microscopy were used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Fungal cells from overnight cultures were diluted to 1 × 105CFU/mL in YPD medium, and 900 μL of the diluted solution was added to each well of a 24-well plate, with a glass slide placed in each well. Drugs were added to achieve final concentrations of 4 μg/mL IBC, 0.125 μg/mL AmB, and a combination of 4 μg/mL IBC with 0.125 μg/mL AmB, with a total volume of 1000 μL per well. The plate was then incubated at 30°C with shaking at 50 rpm for 24 h.

For qualitative analysis of biofilm inhibition, the supernatant in each well of the 24-well plate was aspirated, and the glass slides were gently washed three times with PBS. Each well was then stained with 200 μL of 0.1% crystal violet solution for 15 min. Unbound dye was removed with PBS, and the biofilm structure on the glass slides was observed under a FESEM.

For quantitative analysis of biofilm inhibition, the glass slides were gently washed three times with PBS, stained with 200 μL of 0.1% crystal violet solution for 15 min, and unbound dye was removed with PBS. The crystal violet bound to the biofilm was dissolved with 33% acetic acid, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader.

C. neoformanscells from overnight cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then diluted to 1 × 106CFU/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 165 mM MOPS (pH 7.0). An 1800 μL volume of this suspension was transferred into individual tubes, and drugs were added to achieve final concentrations of 4 μg/mL IBC, 0.125 μg/mL AmB, and a mixture of 4 μg/mL IBC with 0.125 μg/mL AmB, with a total volume of 2000 μL per tube. The tubes were incubated at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h.

After incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. For capsule thickness assessment, the cells were mixed with India ink, incubated for 15 min, and visualized under an optical microscope. Capsule thickness was analyzed using ImageJ software. To evaluate melanin production, 10 μL of the cell suspension was spotted onto solid L-DOPA medium and incubated at 30°C for 72 h. The cultures were photographed, and melanin production was quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ [33]. Additionally, the quantitative laccase assay was performed with slight modifications to the method described by Albuquerque et al. (2024) [34].

C. neoformanscells from overnight cultures were diluted to 1 × 106CFU/mL in YPD medium, and 1800 μL of the diluted solution was transferred into tubes. Drugs were added to achieve final concentrations of 4 μg/mL IBC, 0.125 μg/mL AmB, and a mixture of 4 μg/mL IBC with 0.125 μg/mL AmB, with a total volume of 2000 μL per tube. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and diluted with YPD medium to prepare a series of dilutions. To investigate the effects of the drugs on the cell wall, 5 µL of the diluted solution was spotted onto YPD agar medium containing various stress-inducing compounds: calcofluor white (1.5 mg/mL), caffeine (0.5 mg/mL), sodium chloride (0.5 M), 0.03% SDS, and 0.1% Congo red. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h for observation. For temperature stress analysis, plates were incubated at both 30°C and 37°C.

C. neoformanscells from overnight cultures were diluted to a concentration of 1 × 106CFU/mL with YPD medium, and then 1800 μL of the diluted solution was transferred into test tubes. Antioxidant-related inhibitors, including Acetylcysteine, L-glutathione, and liproxstatin-1, were added to each tube, followed by the addition of a mixture of IBC-AmB. The tubes were incubated under conditions of 30°C and 150 rpm. After 12 h, 10 μL of the culture broth was sampled, diluted 10-fold serially, and 5 μL of each dilution was spotted onto YPD agar plates. The plates were then incubated at 30°C for 48 h.

In vivo toxicity and antifungal activity analysis was conducted as previously described. For toxicity evaluation, various final concentrations of the IBC-AmB mixture (0 MIC, 1 MIC, 2 MIC, 4 MIC, and 8 MIC) were tested by examining their effects onC. eleganslifespan. Worm survival was monitored using a dissecting microscope, with records taken every 2 days. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, using at least 50 worms per group. For qualitative analysis, PI uptake was measured. Nematodes were washed three times with M9 buffer and incubated with 20 μM PI for 30 min. PI uptake was then examined using CLSM with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 555 nm and 580 nm, respectively. The images were analyzed using ImageJ software.

The lipofuscin assay was performed with minor modifications to the described method [35–37]. Worms were cultured at 20°C on NGM plates, either with or without IBC-AmB treatment. They were then anesthetized using a 0.2% NaN3 solution and mounted on 2% agarose pads. Intestinal lipofuscin fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence microscope at excitation and emission wavelengths of 385 nm and 420 nm, respectively. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed using ImageJ software. Twenty worms were randomly selected for imaging in each group.

The DCFH-DA assay was used to evaluate intracellular ROS levels [38,39]. For qualitative analysis, CLSM was employed with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 488 nm and 525 nm, respectively. Over 20 worms from each experimental group were randomly selected for imaging. Mean fluorescence intensity, indicative of ROS levels, was calculated using ImageJ software. Additionally, we assessed the activities of SOD and CAT, quantified MDA and total GSH levels, and determined the NADPH/NADP+levels, following the protocols outlined in the assay kits.

Lipid peroxidation inC. eleganssubjected to various treatments was evaluated. After treatment, the nematodes were incubated with 10 mM BODIPY 581/591 C11 in M9 buffer for 1 h. They were then washed three times with M9 buffer to remove unbound dye. The nematodes were visualized using CLSM with excitation wavelengths at 488 nm and 543 nm, and emission wavelengths at 530 nm and 590 nm, respectively. Oxidized lipids emit green fluorescence (excitation: 488 nm, emission: 530 nm), while non-oxidized lipids emit red fluorescence (excitation: 543 nm, emission: 590 nm). The images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ software.

Intracellular and mitochondrial ferrous iron ion levels were assessed with minor modifications to the previously described method [40]. Nematodes (100 mg) from each group were collected, homogenized in liquid nitrogen, and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the supernatant. Total ferrous ion levels were measured using an iron assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a Varioskan LUX Multifunctional Microplate Reader used for quantification. For intracellular and mitochondrial ferrous ion evaluation, nematodes were incubated with 1 μM FerroOrange and 5 μM Mito-FerroGreen in the dark at 25°C for 30 min. After incubation, the nematodes were washed twice with M9 buffer and examined using CLSM. Specific regions of interest, including the head, intestine, and tail, were captured and magnified. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 542 nm/572 nm for FerroOrange and 488 nm for Mito-FerroGreen. Twenty consecutive fluorescence images were taken, and fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ software.

Total RNA was extracted from nematodes subjected to various treatments and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Beijing, China). RT-qPCR was performed to assess the mRNA expression levels of Skn-1, Sod-4 (superoxide dismutase 4), Gst-4 (glutathione S-transferase 4), Gst-5 (glutathione S-transferase 5), Gcs-1 (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit), Ctl-1 (catalase 1), Gsr-1 (glutathione reductase 1), Gpx-1 (glutathione peroxidase 1), Pmk-1 (p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase), Nlp-29 (neuropeptide-like protein 29), Nlp-31 (neuropeptide-like protein 31), Daf-16 (dauer formation 16), and Cnc-11 (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein 11). Gene expression was normalized to the geometric mean of the housekeeping gene Actin 3 using the 2−∆∆Ctmethod. All primer sequences for the target genes are provided in Table S1.

All experimental data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. Lifespan curves were compared using log-rank tests, while quantitative data were evaluated through one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Mean value comparisons were conducted with unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests, and results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Individually, IBC and AmB have MICs of 8 µg/mL and 1 µg/mL, respectively, againstC. neoformans. However, when used in combination, their MICs are significantly reduced to 4 µg/mL for IBC and 0.125 µg/mL for AmB, with a FICI value of 0.625, indicating a strong additive interaction (Figure 1(A)). This combination reduces the MIC of IBC by 2-fold and the MIC of AmB by 8-fold, highlighting the potential of drug synergy to enhance antifungal efficacy while minimizing drug concentrations.

IBC-AmB combination treatment disrupted physiological traits inC. neoformans.

(A) Assessment of the combined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isobavachalcone and amphotericin B. The experimental solution exhibits a color change from blue to light gray in the presence of dead fungal cells. Conversely, the retention of the light gray color at combined concentrations of 4 μg/mL for isobavachalcone and 0.125 μg/mL for amphotericin B confirms the combined MIC values. Multimodal analysis of IBC-AmB combinatorial effects onC. neoformansviability and cellular architecture: (B) longevity assessment, (C) ultrastructural morphology, and (D) membrane integrity. The experimental design incorporated four treatment cohorts: untreated control (IBC−/AmB−): C. neoformans maintained in standard culture medium; IBC monotherapy (IBC+/AmB−): 4 μg/mL IBC treatment; AmB monotherapy (IBC−/AmB+): 0.125 μg/mL AmB treatment; combinatorial therapy (IBC+/AmB+): 4 μg/mL IBC +0.125 μg/mL AmB co-administration. Experimental groups: IBC (isobavalachalcone), AmB (Amphotericin B). Treatment indicators: “+” = therapeutic agent present, “-” = agent absent. Data represent mean ± SEM from triplicate biological replicates. Scale bars in CLSM and FESEM micrographs correspond to 10 μm and 5 μm, respectively,  under defined culture conditions (30°C, 5% CO₂).

The time–kill curve was used to further assess the antifungal efficacy. As shown inFigure 1(B), 8 μg/mL IBC and 1 μg/mL AmB demonstrated fungicidal activity againstC. neoformansat 12 h and 6 h, respectively. In contrast, neither 4 μg/mL IBC nor 0.125 μg/mL AmB alone effectively inhibited fungal growth. However, the combination of 4 μg/mL IBC and 0.125 μg/mL AmB significantly reduced fungal growth.

As shown inFigure 1(C), significant morphological changes were observed in fungal cells treated with the IBC-AmB combination (4 µg/mL IBC and 0.125 µg/mL AmB). These cells exhibited distinct surface wrinkles, in contrast to the smooth and compact structure of untreated cells. Furthermore, cell membrane integrity was assessed using dual staining with SYTO 9 and PI (Figure 1(D)). The control group, including untreated cells and those treated with IBC or AmB alone, predominantly showed bright green fluorescence. In contrast, cells treated with the IBC-AmB combination exhibited pronounced red fluorescence, indicating compromised membrane integrity.

The effect of the IBC-AmB combination onC. neoformansbiofilm formation on glass slides was investigated. Light microscopy showed a significant reduction in biofilm coverage on glass slides in the IBC-AmB combination treatment group compared to the control group, which included untreated cells and those treated with IBC or AmB alone (Figure 2(A)). The biofilm biomass was reduced to 40.4% in the IBC-AmB combination group relative to the untreated group, as measured by the crystal violet assay (Figure 2(C)). FESEM images revealed thick, tightly aggregated cell layers in untreated and individually treated groups, while the IBC-AmB combination group showed reduced extracellular matrix and disintegrated biofilms (Figure 2(B)). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the IBC-AmB combination effectively inhibitsC. neoformansbiofilm growth.

IBC-AmB combination inhibited the biofilm formation and decreased virulence factor production inC. neoformans.

The anti-biofilm activity of the IBC-AmB combination againstC. neoformanswas assessed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative analysis was performed using light microscopy (A, ×40 magnification) and FESEM (B). Quantitative analysis was conducted by measuring the absorbance of crystal violet staining (C). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments (n= 3). Scale bar: 20 μm. Representative images ofC. neoformanstreated with various concentrations of IBC-AmB and cultured in DMEM for 48 h at 30°C are shown. (D, F) Capsule visualization was performed using India ink staining, and capsule diameter was measured under a microscope. (E, G)C. neoformanscells were cultured on L-DOPA agar plates for 72 h at 30°C, both in the presence and absence of IBC-AmB. A concentration-dependent reduction in melanin production was observed, as evidenced by decreased colony pigmentation. (H) Laccase activity was measured fromC. neoformanscultures both with and without IBC-AmB treatment. Data are presented as enzyme activity units per milligram of protein (U/mg). Error bars represent standard deviations from three independent experiments. Statistical significance is indicated by *p< 0.5, **p< 0.01 ***p< 0.001, and ns signifies no significant difference.

The virulence of the fungal pathogenC. neoformansis characterized not just by its capacity to thrive at 37°C, but also by its ability to synthesize a capsule and produce melanin. Capsule formation was significantly inhibited by the IBC-AmB combination treatment compared to the untreated group (Figure 2(D,F)), and there were notable changes in cell morphology (Figure 2(D)). Additionally,Figure 2(E)shows that, compared to the untreated control group, melanin formation inC. neoformanswas significantly inhibited under the combined treatment of IBC-AmB. Quantitative analysis using ImageJ revealed that the average grayscale values of colonies on L-DOPA medium increased significantly after IBC-AmB treatment, indicating reduced melanin content (Figure 2(G)). Moreover, laccase activity was significantly reduced inC. neoformanscultures treated with the IBC-AmB combination compared to untreated control (Figure 2(H)). These results suggest that IBC effectively curbs capsule synthesis and melanin production inC. neoformans, thereby reducing its pathogenic potential.

The susceptibility ofC. neoformansto a range of cellular stressors was evaluated. The strain was cultured on YPD agar media enriched with various cell stressors and different concentrations of IBC-AmB combination. As depicted inFigure 3(A), the IBC-AmB combination renderedC. neoformanssensitive to all five cell stressors tested, leading to impaired growth. Specifically, exposure to IBC-AmB in combination with Calcofluor white, Congo Red, NaCl, or KCl almost completely inhibited fungal growth, leading to a decrease in the number of fungal colonies.

Effects of cell stressors and antioxidant-related inhibitors onC. neoformanstreated with IBC-AmB combination.

(A) Growth phenotypes ofC. neoformanswere assessed in the presence of various cell stressors, with or without IBC and AmB. Cultures were normalized based on OD600and subsequently diluted. Serial dilutions were prepared, and 5 µL aliquots were spotted on YPD agar medium supplemented with the following stressors: calcofluor white (1.5 mg/mL, CFW), 0.2% Congo red, KCl (0.5 M), and NaCl (0.5 M) at 30°C, respectively. For temperature stress, YPD plates were incubated at 37°C. Experiment was repeated three times to ensure reproducibility, and representative images are shown. (B) Effects of antioxidant-related inhibitors onC. neoformanstreated with IBC-AmB combination were examined. Cells were normalized by OD600and then grown on YPD agar plates containing various antioxidant-related inhibitors, including Acetylcysteine, L-glutathione, and liproxstatin-1. The plates were incubated at 30°C, and images were captured at the indicated time points.

To investigate whether thein vitroantifungal effect of the IBC-AmB combination onC. neoformansis related to oxidative stress, treated fungal cells were transferred onto YPD agar plates supplemented with ROS scavengers (Acetylcysteine and L-glutathione) and the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1.Figure 3(B)displays that Acetylcysteine and L-glutathione were able to protect the drug-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner, implying that they may facilitate cell survival by neutralizing the excess ROS generated within the cells following IBC-AmB treatment. In contrast, liproxstatin-1 did not protect the drug-treated cells, indicating thein vitroantifungal effect of the IBC-AmB combination may not associate with ferroptosis.

To evaluate the potential toxicity at high drug concentrations, worms were treated with various concentrations of IBC and AmB mixture (0, 4 μg/mL IBC +0.125 μg/mL AmB, 8 μg/mL IBC +0.25 μg/mL AmB, 16 μg/mL IBC +0.5 μg/mL AmB, and 32 μg/mL IBC +1 μg/mL AmB) for 24 h. As shown inFigure 4(A), worms treated with IBC at 0–4 MIC showed no significant change in lifespan, with mean survival times of 14 ± 0.1 days, 13 ± 0.5 days, and 11 ± 0.5 days, and 14.3 ± 0.5 days (negative control). In contrast, at 8 MIC, worm lifespan significantly decreased to 6.4 ± 0.5 days. The in vivo antifungal efficacy of the IBC-AmB combination was assessed by monitoring the lifespan ofC. elegans.Figure 4(B)shows that the average lifespan ofC. elegansinfected withC. neoformanswas 8.1 ± 0.5 days. In contrast, the IBC-AmB combination extended the lifespan of infected worms to 13.5 ± 0.5 days, comparable to the negative control. Additionally, the PI uptake assay was performed. As shown inFigure 4(C), the IBC-AmB combination modulated membrane permeability inC. elegans, as evidenced by PI staining. Notably, the combination protected cell membrane integrity against fungal-induced damagein vivo, indicated by the absence of red fluorescence. These results highlight the potentin vivoantifungal efficacy of the IBC-AmB combination without significant toxicity.

IBC-AmB combination enhanced theC. neoformans-infectedC. eleganslifespan without toxicity.

(A) The lifespan ofC. elegansworms was determined in the presence of high concentrations of IBC-AmB combination (0 MIC to 8 MIC). Survival curve was plotted based on the observed data. (B) The effect of IBC-AmB combination on the lifespan ofC. neoformans-infectedC.elegansnematodes was evaluated, and the survival curve was plotted. Values represented the mean survival rates from three biological replicates. (C) The effect of IBC-AmB treatment on the cell membrane integrity ofC. elegansworms infected withC. neoformanswas examined using CLSM in combination with PI dyes. Scale bar: 100 μm. Treatment indicators: “+” = therapeutic agent present, “-” = agent absent.

We evaluated the effects of IBC-AmB combination on the accumulation of lipofuscin inC. elegansfollowingC. neoformansinfection. After treatment with IBC-AmB combination post-infection, we quantified the intestinal autofluorescence of lipofuscin in infected worms. As illustrated in the results (Figure 5(A–C)), lipofuscin levels in the infected group increased significantly from 1.00 to 2.00 ± 0.8. In contrast, IBC-AmB treatment reduced the lipofuscin levels in the infectedC. elegansto 0.8 ± 0.5.Figure 5(C)provides a comparative analysis of lipofuscin levels between the infected group and the IBC-AmB treated group. The data highlight the significant difference in lipofuscin accumulation, with the treated group showing a marked decrease compared to the infected control. These results indicate thatC. neoformansinfection induces pigment aging inC. elegans, activating antifungal immunity and stress responses that deteriorate host health.

IBC-AmB combination treatment reduced lipofuscin accumulation, ROS and lipid peroxidation inC. elegansinfected withC. neoformans.

(A and B) IBC-AmB combination reduced lipofuscin accumulation inC. neoformans-infectedC. elegans. Intestinal autofluorescence of lipofuscin in infected worms were evaluated using CLSM. (C) The fluorescence intensity of lipofuscin in CLSM images was quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ software to assess lipofuscin levels in the worms. The sample size for this analysis was 20 (n= 20). D and F illustrate the qualitative and quantitative detection of ROS levels inC. elegansunder various treatment conditions, using the fluorescence probe DCFH-DA. These images are presented in both bright field (D) and fluorescence modes (E). (F) provides a quantitative analysis of ROS content in the worms. Scale bar: 100 μm. Data are depicted as the standard deviation mean ± SEM for three replicates (n= 3).

ROS are pivotal in the initiation of ferroptosis. DCFH-DA was utilized to measure ROS levels in nematodes. Intracellular ROS can convert the non-fluorescent probe DCFH-DA into the green-fluorescent DCF, allowing qualitative assessment of ROS levels based on fluorescence intensity. As shown inFigure 5(D,E), nematodes infected withC. neoformansexhibited significant green fluorescence than the negative control and IBC-AmB-treated groups. Quantitative analysis (Figure 5(F)) revealed that ROS levels in the infected group increased by 48.5% compared to the normal group. Conversely, ROS levels in the IBC-AmB-treated group decreased by 59.3% relative to the infected group, closely resembling the normal group levels, indicating no significant difference.

Lipid peroxidation is a key indicator of ferroptosis. As shown inFigure 5(G–I), infection withC. neoformanssignificantly increases lipid peroxidation in nematodes, indicated by enhanced green fluorescence signals. In contrast, IBC-AmB combination therapy significantly reduces the green fluorescence signal, corresponding to oxidized lipids. As depicted inFigure 5(J),C. neoformansinfection increases MDA levels compared to normal conditions. In contrast, IBC-AmB treatment reduces MDA levels in infected nematodes, returning them to normal levels. The IBC-AmB combination effectively diminishes both ROS and lipid peroxidation, highlighting its efficacy in mitigating oxidative stress induced by infection.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, making intracellular ferrous ion levels a key indicator of ferroptosis occurrence. As shown inFigure 6(A–E), infection withC. neoformanssignificantly increased orange fluorescence indicative of intracellular ferrous ions, with widespread distribution throughout the nematode body. After treatment with IBC-AmB, this fluorescence diminished, indicating reduced intracellular ferrous ion levels. Similarly, as illustrated inFigure 6(F–J), green fluorescence representing mitochondrial ferrous ions was enhanced in the mitochondria of infected nematodes, particularly in the head region. This fluorescence was also significantly reduced after IBC-AmB treatment, indicating lower mitochondrial ferrous ion levels. Furthermore, as depicted inFigure 6(K), the total ferrous ion content in infected nematodes was significantly higher than that in the control group. In contrast, the ferrous ion content in nematodes decreased markedly following drug treatment. These results suggest that the IBC-AmB combination effectively reduces ferrous ion concentrations in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, providing visual evidence of dynamic changes in ferrous ions.

IBC-AmB combination treatment inhibited the increase of intracellular total ferrous ions inC. eleganscaused byC. neoformansinfection.

FerroOrange and Mito-Tracker Green fluorescence probes were used to examine changes in intracellular (A-E) and mitochondrial (F-J) ferrous ion levels, respectively. The images presented include both bright-field (A and F) and fluorescence modes (B, C, D, E, G, H, I, and J). C, D, and E provide enlarged views of the head, abdominal cavity, and tail regions corresponding to B, while H, I, and J display enlarged views of the same regions corresponding to G. The scale bars are 100 μm for A, B, F, and G, and 40 μm for C, D, E, H, I, and J. The 96-well plate method was used to quantitatively analyze the effect of IBC-AmB treatment on intracellular ferrous ions (K) and total GSH (L) in the worms, with a sample size of 3 (n= 3). The scale bars are 100 μm (A, B, F, and G) and 40 μm (C, D, E, H, I and J), respectively. Experimental groups: CN (C. neoformans), IBC (isobavalachalcone), AmB (Amphotericin B); “+” indicates treatment administration, “-” denotes untreated controls. Statistical significance is indicated by ***p< 0.001. ns indicates no significant difference.

In the ferroptosis pathway, reduced intracellular GSH levels can lead to increased ROS levels, inducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. As shown inFigure 6(L), the total GSH content in the infected group was significantly lower at 42.6% of the control group level. In contrast, the treated group had a GSH content of 92.7% of the control group, with no significant difference. As depicted inFigure 7(A), the NADPH/NADP+ratio in the infected group was significantly reduced by 88.6% compared to the control group. Conversely, the treated group had an NADPH/NADP+ratio that was only a bit higher than the control group, indicating no significant difference. Additionally, the activities of CAT and SOD were analyzed as oxidative stress indicators. As shown inFigure 7(B,C), the activities of CAT and SOD in the infected group were significantly lower than in the control group. In contrast, the treated group exhibited significantly higher activities of these enzymes, with no significant difference compared to the control group.

IBC addition suppressed the decline in the antioxidant capacity inC. eleganscaused byC. neoformansinfection.

We further explored the antioxidant mechanisms underlying the IBC-AmB combination. As shown inFigure 7(D), the IBC-AmB combination at the MIC significantly upregulated the expression of antioxidant-related genes, including Skn-1, Sod-4, Gst-4, Gst-5, Gcs-1, Ctl-1, Gsr-1, and Gpx-1. These genes likely contribute to the antioxidant activity of the IBC-AmB combination. Additionally, the combination at MIC markedly upregulated the expression of antifungal-related genes Nlp-29, Nlp-31, Daf-16, and Cns-11, while downregulating Pmk-1. These findings suggest that the IBC-AmB combination enhances the host’s antifungal defense mechanisms.

Despite progress in managing cryptococcal infections, the range of antifungal agents at our disposal is still limited compared to the extensive array of antibiotics for bacterial infections. AmB is a cornerstone in the treatment of cryptococcal infections, renowned for its broad-spectrum antifungal efficacy and minimal drug interactions. However, AmB is associated with significant dose-limiting toxicities, particularly infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity. To address these challenges, strategies such as developing new antifungal compounds, novel drug formulations, and synergistic drug combinations have been explored [21].

IBC is a naturally occurring flavonoid that boasts a diverse array of pharmacological properties. It is implicated in multifaceted therapeutic potential, including anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, neuroprotective, and bone-protective activities. IBC exhibits antimicrobial activity against a spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa [41,42]. Moreover, IBC has demonstrated antifungal properties, attributed to its ability to modulate various pathways associated with cell wall and membrane integrity, as well as apoptosis and mitochondrial homeostasis in fungi such asCandida albicansandC. neoformans. These multifaceted actions position IBC as a promising candidate for further exploration in the realm of antifungal therapies [43,44].

Our study examined the synergistic effect of the IBC-AmB combination againstC. neoformans, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings revealed a significant reduction in the MIC of AmB when combined with IBC, with a decline from 1 μg/mL to 0.125 μg/mL. This reduction emphasizes the potential of the combination to enhance the efficacy of AmB, a primary antifungal agent in the treatment of cryptococcal infections. Furthermore, even at a high concentration of the combination, equivalent to 4 times the MIC with 8 μg/mL IBC and 1 μg/mL AmB, there were no deleterious effects on lifespan inC. elegans, a commonly used model organism for evaluating the effect of drugs on lifespan. The present study suggests that the combination therapy could be well tolerated by humans, even at higher doses.

Similar to the effects of IBC alone, the combined use of IBC and AmB altered cellular morphology and damaged cell permeability, with mechanisms of action that may be attributed to the mechanisms of the individual drugs. Specifically, this additive effect may disrupt the integrity of the cell wall and cell membrane. Furthermore, the synergistic administration of IBC and AmB was found to have a disruptive effect on the cell wall ofC. neoformans, evidenced by a marked decrease in the organism’s resistance to various cell wall stressors. Specifically, the treatment enhanced the susceptibility ofC. neoformansto chitin-binding agents such as Congo red and Calcofluor white, which are known to interfere with cell wall integrity by binding to chitin. The combination also increased the vulnerability of the cells to NaCl and KCl. These findings suggest that the IBC and AmB combination may weaken the structural defenses of the fungal cell wall, thereby enhancing the permeability of the cell and potentially increasing the efficacy of antifungal treatments.

In addition, the ROS scavengers Acetylcysteine and L-glutathione were able to protect the IBC-AmB- treatedC. neoformanscells in a dose-dependent manner. This observation indicates that the excess ROS generated within the cells following IBC-AmB treatment may be a critical factor contributing to the antifungal activity. The ability of these scavengers to mitigate the effects of the IBC-AmB treatment implies that drug-induced oxidative stress is likely a key contributor to combat fungal cells. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that an increase in ROS can cause cellular damage to cellular biomolecules, ultimately leading to cell death [38]. In contrast, the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 did not effectively protect the drug-treated cellsin vitro. This suggests that thein vitroantifungal effect of the IBC-AmB combination may not be mainly associated with ferroptosis. These results indicate that thein vitroantifungal mechanism of the IBC-AmB combination againstC. neoformansis more likely related to oxidative stress.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death characterized by lipid ROS accumulation, has been implicated in pathogen-infected cell models [45–47]. Researchers have shown a growing interest in studying lipid peroxidation, which is driven by the imbalance of iron metabolism and ROS, particularly in pathogen-infected cell model [48]. Our study presents evidence that ferroptosis is a pivotal factor inC. eleganscell death triggered byC. neoformansinfection, as evidenced by reduced GSH and increased MDA, ferrous ions, and ROS levels. Conversely, IBC-AmB treatment mitigatedC. neoformans-induced cell death by suppressing ROS and iron accumulation and increasing GSH levels, thereby extendingC. eleganslifespan. This effect was attributed to the suppression of ROS and iron accumulation, alongside an elevation in GSH levels.

In this study, several indicators, including reduced lipofuscin and ferrous ion accumulation, as well as enhanced oxidative stress response, were observed inCryptococcus-infectedC. elegansfollowing treatment with the IBC-AmB combination. Notably, these improvements may not be exclusively attributed to the direct pharmacological effects of the drug combination. Apart from this, they could be a consequence of the reduced infection-induced oxidative burden, as the drug treatment alleviated the pathogenic burden. As the pathogen load decreases, the host’s oxidative stress response may also diminish, leading to lower levels of oxidative damage markers such as lipofuscin and ferrous ions. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between infection levels and host responses when interpreting the effects of combination therapies [36,37]. These findings imply that the combination of direct drug effects and indirect benefits induced by IBC and AmB may represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing infections caused byC. neoformans.

The host maintains homeostasis against ferroptosis through a variety of antioxidant systems, including the GSH/GPX4 system, FSP1/CoQ system, DHODH/CoQ system, and GCH1/BH4 system [49]. These systems play crucial roles in neutralizing ROS and preventing lipid peroxidation, which are key processes in ferroptosis. For instance, the GSH/GPX4 system detoxifies lipid peroxides into non-toxic products, while the FSP1/CoQ system scavenges free radicals to inhibit lipid peroxide accumulation [46,50,51]. Additionally, the GCH1/BH4 system and DHODH/CoQ system contribute to maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage [52].

To explore the mechanisms underlying the anti-ferroptosis effects of IBC-AmB combination, we utilized RT-qPCR to evaluate the transcriptional profiles of genes implicated in ferroptosis. Our results showed that the IBC-AmB combination upregulated the expression of SKN-1, GST-4, GST-5, and GPX-1 while downregulating PMK-1 in infectedC. elegans. These findings suggest that the combination enhances the survival ofC. elegansinfected withC. neoformansby targeting antioxidant pathways that are dependent on the GSH/GPX-1 system. Specifically, SKN-1 is a master regulator of the oxidative stress response inC. elegans. It activates the transcription of downstream antioxidant genes such as GST-4 and GST-5, which in turn reduce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. GST-4 and GST-5 are glutathione S-transferases that play crucial roles in the detoxification of ROS and the maintenance of GSH levels [49,53]. The upregulation of these genes by the IBC-AmB combination likely contributes to increased GSH levels, which are essential for the antioxidant defense against ferroptosis. Furthermore, the downregulation of PMK-1, a gene involved in stress response and immune signaling, may also contribute to the overall protective effect. PMK-1 is part of the p38 MAPK pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cellular stress response [49]. Its downregulation by the IBC-AmB combination may help to reduce the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, thereby enhancing the survival ofC. elegansunder infection. Collectively, these data suggest that the IBC-AmB combination enhances the survival ofC. elegansinfected withC. neoformansby targeting antioxidant pathways that are dependent of GSH/GPX-1. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise gene regulation mechanisms by which the combined use of IBC and AmB influences ferroptosis inC. neoformans-infectedC. elegans. Additionally, future studies should explore the potential to optimize combination therapies in order to maximize their therapeutic benefits while minimizing adverse effects.
