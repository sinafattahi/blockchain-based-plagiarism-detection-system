The isomerization of substituted allylic alcohols, including α-vinyl benzyl alcohol,trans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol, cinnamyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol, farnesol, 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol, (1R)-(−)-myrtenol andS,R-(−)-carveol, catalyzed by the [RuCp(OH2)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (1) and [RuCp(OH2)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(2) (PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane, mPTA =N-methyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) complexes was examined in pure water and water-containing media. The isomerization of the chalconetrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol catalyzed by 1 to produce the natural product propiophenone displays the highest known turnover number for this reaction to date (TON = 200 and TOF5h= 40 h−1). A study delving into the catalytic reaction mechanisms was carried out, aiming to understand the influence of different functional groups on the studied isomerization processes. The intermediates of the isomerization of α-vinylbenzyl alcohol and 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol catalyzed by 1 and 2 were isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy.

The [RuCp(OH2)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) and [RuCp(OH2)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3complexes were assessed for the isomerization of substituted allylic alcohols in water and aqueous media under mild conditions.

It is important to note that complex 1 was found to be useful for the easy synthesis of some pheromones28–38involved in the natural aggregation/anti-aggregation system of the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae), which is known to be the major killer of conifers.39Therefore, the study of the catalytic properties of these complexes not only provides a new insight about how the substituents of the allylic alcohols influence their catalytic activity in aqueous media, but also provides new useful synthetic procedures for obtaining valuable compounds.

Linear allylic alcohols containing aromatic rings:trans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol, α-vinylbenzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol, and coniferyl alcohol.

The isomerization oftrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol into dihydrochalcone was performed in CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1) at 70 °C andiPrOH/H2O (1 : 1) at 80 °C, with varying catalyst loadings (Table S1).Table 1summarizes the results obtained, along with a comparison with published catalysts. It is significant to stress that complete substrate conversion was achieved within 4 h using 1 mol% of 1 in CH3OH/H2O (TOF4h= 24.8 h−1). Decreasing the catalyst to 0.2 mol% iniPrOH/H2O resulted in 40% conversion (TOF5h= 40 h−1) after 5 h. In contrast, 1 mol% of 2 in MeOH/H2O failed to isomerize the substrate, as no more than 5% conversion (TOF4h= 2.6 h−1) was obtained in 4 h. Therefore, the catalyst loading was increased to 10 mol%, leading to a conversion of 53% in 24 h (TOF24h= 0.22 h−1). Dihydrochalcone was obtained with 99% conversion. The resulting pure product was characterized by1H NMR (Fig. S81). It was obtained by extracting the reaction mixture with CHCl3, drying over CaCl2, filtering the collected organic layers through a silica gel column, and drying under vacuum overnight.

Although the catalytic redox isomerization oftrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol has been extensively reviewed in organic media, fewer studies were reported in aqueous environments, where a heterodimetallic Ru/Fe complex is the most efficient catalyst in water reported so far, achieving TON = 49 and TOF = 2.5 h−1at 80 °C and in the presence of KOtBu.63Thus, complex 1 showed the best catalytic profile for this reaction in terms of both TON and TOF.

The isomerization of α-vinylbenzyl alcohol into propiophenone was evaluated under the same conditions as the previous substrate in CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1) at 70 °C oriPrOH/H2O (1 : 1) at 80 °C (Table S2). Using 1 mol% of 1 or 2 in CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1), 40% conversion into propiophenone was achieved in both cases after 24 h (TOF24h= 1.7 h−1). Changing the solvent toiPrOH/H2O (1 : 1) resulted in higher and faster transformation into propiophenone, achieving a conversion of 44% with 1 at 8 h (TOF8h= 5.5 h−1) and of 71% with 2 (TOF8h= 8.9 h−1). Increasing the catalyst loading of both complexes to 2 mol% led to complete isomerization, in both CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1) andiPrOH/H2O (1 : 1), and evidenced that complex 2 is more active (CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1): TOF4h= 3.1 h−1;iPrOH/H2O (1 : 1): TOF1h= 34.5 h−1, TOF4h= 12.4 h−1) than 1 (CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1): TOF4h= 3.3 h−1;iPrOH/H2O (1 : 1): TOF4h= 8.4 h−1, TOF8h= 6.2 h−1). Complex 2 clearly showed higher activity in theiPrOH/H2O (1 : 1) mixture than in CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1). Propiophenone synthesis was achieved with 99% conversion. The process was the same as that used to obtain dihydrochalcone. Its characterization by1H NMR is shown in Fig. S82.

As shown inTable 2, previously published results showed that some Ru(ii) and various Ru(iv) complexes and Rh complexes exhibit notable catalytic activity for the isomerization of α-vinylbenzyl alcohol in aqueous media.3,7,62,64–67The most notable contribution was the Ru(iv) complex bearing η3:η3-C10H16and a bidentate acetate ligand, [Ru(η3:η3-C10H16)Cl(κ2O,O–CH3CO2)], which was found to be a highly efficient catalyst for this reaction in water at 75 °C (TON = 99, TOF = 1200 h−1).3Other studies include the complex [Ru(η3:η3-C10H16)(Cl)2(pyrazole)], which also achieved high TOF values (495 h−1) in water at 75 °C (TON = 99);64and/or the [Ru(η3:η3-C10H16)(Cl)2(benzimidazole)] complex65in KH2PO4phosphate buffer containing MgSO4(39.6 h−1, TON = 99) at 50 °C.66The Ru(iv)-complex [Ru(η3:η2:η3-C12H18)Cl2] also exhibited high catalytic activity for the transformation of this allylic alcohol, with TOF values of 20 h−1(TON = 99) in water and 80 (TON = 99) in H2O/CsCO3at 75 °C.62Among the Ru(ii) compounds, the Ru-arene complex bearing mTHPA, [RuCl2(mTPHA)(η6-C6H6)], proved to be a suitable catalyst for this reaction in water with KOtBu at 75 °C (TON = 97, TOF = 129 h−1).12However, the highest catalytic activity for this reaction with Ru(ii)-arene complexes was obtained with [RuCl2(η6-C6H5OCH2CH2OH)P(OMe)3] and [RuCl2(η6-C6H5OCH2CH2OH)P(OiPr)3], achieving both of them TOF values of 600 h−1(TON = 99) in water and KOtBu at 75 °C.62Regarding the Rh-complexes, active catalytic systems were generatedin situupon using [Rh(COD)Cl]2and PTA or aryl sulfonated phosphines as cocatalysts, affording the highest activity when PTA was used.7It is important to stress that complexes 1 and 2 are also the first Ru(ii)-cyclopentadienyl complexes evaluated for this reaction in water, and although the results show that they are efficient and useful for this reaction, they do not equal or surpass previously published catalysts.

In view of the obtained results for the catalytic isomerization of allylic alcohols containing unsubstituted aromatic compounds, the catalytic isomerization of some examples ofpara-phenyl-substituted allylic alcohols was assessed. Thus, catalytic isomerization of 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol into 3,4-nitrobenzenepropanal and dihydroconiferyl aldehyde, respectively, was evaluated with complexes 1 and 2. No conversion of the substrates into dihydroconiferyl aldehyde was observed under the tested conditions in CH3OH/H2O (1 : 1) at 70 °C andiPrOH/H2O (1 : 1) at 80 °C. Nevertheless, minor conversion (<5%) for the isomerization of 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol was achieved with 10 mol% of both catalysts after 48 h (Table S4), which is a very low conversion, but it is the first reported for this substrate to the best of our knowledge.

The catalytic efficiency of both complexes was evaluated against farnesol and 1,5-hexadiene-3,4-diol. Despite employing a high catalyst loading of 10 mol%, the isomerization of farnesol in CH3OH/water (1 : 1) at 75 °C did not occur, and iniPrOH/H2O (1 : 1) at 80 °C, only a low conversion to dihydrofarnesal was obtained after 48 h (1 : 3%; 2 : 1%). Likewise, the isomerization of 1,5-hexadiene-3,4-diol in methanol at 70 °C and in water up to 100 °C did not occur (Table S5).

Regarding the study of the reactions with the substrates (1R)-(−)-myrtenol,S,R-(−)-carveol, farnesol, 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol, farnesol, and coniferyl alcohol, in which a range of modest to no conversion was observed, no additional signals were detected in the31P{1H} and1H NMR spectra even after 72 h at 80 °C, apart from the abovementioned signals, which is a consequence of the reaction with the solvent media. The lack of isomerization of (1R)-(−)-myrtenol andS,R-(−)-carveol, but also of observable intermediates, is likely due to steric hindrance. These substrates are constituted by bulky substituents, such as a bicyclic group in the case of (1R)-(−)-myrtenol and a methyl group at the vinyl position inS,R-(−)-carveol, which is also a cyclic substrate. These bulky substituents make difficult the coordination of the allylic alcohols to the metal centre by the double bond and OH. The substrates 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol also have bulky groups in their structure. Alternatively, farnesol has a long chain containing methyl groups and multiple double bonds, which compete with the allylic CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C group for coordination with the metal. Finally, it seems that when the phenyl groups are in the vinyl position and para-substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, the isomerization process is hindered. Nevertheless, despite being substituted alkenes, 3-methyl-2-cylohexen-1-ol,trans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol, cinnamyl alcohol, α-vinyl benzyl alcohol and 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol underwent transformations. The follow-up reactions of 3-methyl-2-cylohexen-1-ol with 2 both in CD3OD and in D2O are illustrated in Fig. S1–S4. Notably, the31P{1H} NMR spectra over time suggested the decomposition of 2 as the signal at −10.3 ppm decreased, but no additional peak appeared. In contrast, the catalyst gave rise to new species different from that expected by reaction with the solvent when the catalytic isomerization oftrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol with 1 (Fig. S5–S8) was studied by31P{1H} NMR (Fig. S6), which are assigned to O=PTA (−7.2 ppm) and [RuCpH(PTA)2] (−10.73 ppm).70,71Nevertheless, no signals ascribed to reaction intermediates were observed. Considering that this catalyst facilitates the isomerization more effectively and faster than 2, the obtained results suggest that once the respective intermediates are formed, they evolve faster than possible to be determined by NMR. Although this is also a bulky substrate, its electron-withdrawing group in the allylic position appears to aid the isomerisation process. Besides the abovementioned substrates, the study of the catalytic isomerization with 1 of cinnamyl alcohol (Fig. S9 and S10) showed that two doublets arise in the31P{1H} NMR spectra. Their weak abundance prevented the complete characterization of these species, but their chemical shifts at −26.9 ppm and −36.6 ppm, together with the magnitude of their coupling constant of2JPP= 46.0 Hz, suggested that the CHCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH group of cinnamyl alcohol is coordinated to the metal, similar to that found with 1,5-hexenadien-3,4-diol and α-vinyl benzyl alcohol.

α-Vinylbenzyl alcohol was tested in CD3OD/D2O (2 : 1) at 70 °C and at room temperature with both complexes 1 and 2 (Fig. S11–S18). After 24 h, the1H NMR spectra evidence the formation of propiophenone (Fig. S11 and S13), while in the31P{1H} NMR spectra, two sets of doublets appeared, corresponding to two AB systems located in the range of −21.6 ppm to −26.6 ppm in the reaction with 1, and −6.0 ppm to 9.3 ppm with 2 (Fig. S12 and S14), respectively. Additionally, the31P{1H} NMR spectra display two less intense singlets at −10.23 ppm and −12.39 ppm (<4%), which were not possible to characterize (Fig. S14). The proportion of the two sets of doublets was 8.3 : 1.7 in the reaction with 1, and 7.5 : 2.5 in the reaction with 2. At room temperature, no conversion of the substrate was observed (Fig. S15 and S17), but31P{1H} NMR displayed the same peaks as that at 80 °C (Fig. S16 and S18). The reaction between α-vinylbenzyl alcohol and 2 iniPrOH/H2O was monitored at 25 °C and 60 °C by31P{1H} NMR experiments using a D2O capillary (Fig. S19). At 25 °C, the31P{1H} NMR spectrum exhibited four doublets (54%), in a 7.7 : 2.3 proportion, along with a singlet corresponding to complex 2 (46%), where theexo/endoratio remained constant after heating to 60 °C.

The observed intermediates were synthesized and characterized as complexes [RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (3) and [RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(4), which were obtained by reacting 1 and 2 with 50 eq. excess of α-vinylbenzyl alcohol in CH3OH at room temperature and under N2, followed by precipitation with diethyl ether (see SI, Section 9), respectively. Both complexes are stable in solution at room temperature up to 48 h under N2and were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR in CD3OD (3: Fig. S32–S39 and 4: Fig. S40–S46). The31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 3 (Fig. S33) displays a set of four doublets between −23.00 ppm and −28.1 ppm, in an 8.7 : 1.3 ratio. In contrast, the31P{1H} NMR spectrum of 4 (Fig. S41) only shows two doublets in the range of −6.0 to ppm −10.0 ppm, along with four other singlets (<25%), which were assigned to 2, O = mPTA, [RuCp(OH)(mPTA)2]2+and [RuCp(OCD3)(mPTA)2]+. An additional singlet at −12.1 ppm was also observed, which could not be characterized.

The study of both complexes by1H–1H ROESY experiments suggests that 3 in solution is mainly the isomerexo-[RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (exo-3), as indicated by the correlation between the H1aand H3protons to the Cp protons, while the minor species isendo-[RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (endo-3), where H1band H2are related to the Cp protons (Fig. S39). In contrast, only theexo-[RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(exo-4) was observed in CD3OD, which was supported by the cross peaks related to H1aand H3with Cp-H (Fig. S46 and2). Theendo-isomer was not detected, even at 60 °C, where only the transformation of complex 4 into 2, [RuCp(OCD3)(mPTA)2]+, O = mPTA, [RuCp(OH)(mPTA)2]+and an unidentified species (−12.5 ppm) was observed (Fig. S47). Notably, the addition of D2O to a methanolic solution ofexo-4 gave rise to the formation to two doublets corresponding to theendo-isomer (−7.19 ppm, d, mPTA,endo-4,2JPP= 41.52 Hz) and −8.85 ppm; d, mPTA,endo-4,2JPP= 41.52 Hz)), together with 2 and propiophenone (Fig. S48 and S49), respectively. Theendo-isomer was characterized by multinuclear NMR in CD3OD/D2O 2 : 1 (Fig. S50–S58). The special disposition of this isomer was supported by the correlation between Cp-H and H1bH−3in the1H–1H ROESY experiment (Fig. S58). Theexo-4/endo-4 proportion in 2 : 1 CD3OD/D2O was 8.7 : 1.3, evidencing the strong importance of water in triggering theexo/endoisomerization of 4. In the temperature range of 25–60 °C theexo-4/endo-4 ratio decreased to 8.6 : 1.4, releasing 2 and propiophenone (Scheme 2and Fig. S59).

Furthermore, to understand why the substrate transformation catalyzed by 2 is more efficient in the mixtureiPrOH/H2O than in CH3OH/H2O, the same experiment was conducted by replacing CD3OD withiPrOH (Fig. S60). In this solvent mixture, theexo/endointerconversion at room temperature shifted to the formation ofendo-4 (exo/endoratio = 8.5 : 1.5). After heating for 15 min at 60 °C, only the transformation ofendo-4 into 2 and propiophenone was observed in the31P{1H} NMR spectrum (Fig. S60). Although all tests conducted in the presence of water show the presence of theexoandendoisomers, iniPrOH/H2O, the amount ofendoisomer was the highest found. This may be the factor explaining the highest conversion obtained iniPrOH/H2O (Scheme 2).

The NMR spectra for the isomerization of 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol are shown in Fig. S20–S31. Both catalysts tested were found to be inactive for its isomerization. In both solvents, D2O and CD3OD, the31P{1H} NMR spectra of the reactions between 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol and 10 mol% of 1 and 2 displayed the formation of eight doublets for 1 between −20.0 ppm and −25.0 ppm, and for 2 in the range of −6.0 to −9.0 ppm. The powder obtained by precipitation with Et2O from these solutions displayed identical patterns in the31P{1H} NMR spectra to that obtained during the reactions, independently of the solvent D2O and CD3OD. Due to the strong signal overlap, it was only possible to characterize two of the major species given by each starting complex. The analysis of the1H–1H COSY,1H–13C HSQC,1H–13C HMBC and finally1H–1H ROESY spectra (5: Fig. S61–S70 and 6: Fig. S71–S80) revealed that these species correspond to the complexesexo-[RuCp(η2-(+/−)-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–CHOH–CHCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH2)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (5a),exo-[RuCp(η2-meso-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–CHOH–CHCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH2)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (5b),exo-[RuCp(η2-(+/−)-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–CHOH–CHCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH2)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(6a) andexo-[RuCp(η2-meso-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–CHOH–CHCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH2)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(6b). The 1,5-hexadiane-3,4-diol disposition in all these species is anexo-η2-CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C–Ru configuration, as confirmed by the ROESY1H–1H NMR experiment (Fig. S70 and S80), given that the Cp-H protons belonging to complexes 5 and 6 are coupled to H1a/H3(Fig. 2). The analysis of the3JH-Hcoupling constants between the vicinal hydrogens H3and H4(5a:3JH-H= 9.58 Hz; 5b:3JH-H= 12.20 Hz) suggests that the 1,5-hexadiane-3,4-diol ligand is syn in 5a and anti in 5b. Unfortunately, the signal overlapping prevented the measurement of the corresponding values for 6a and 6b. The overall results obtained for the reactions of 1 or 2 with 1,5-hexenadien-3,4-diol suggest that upon coordination to the catalyst, anexo-η2-allylic complex is formed, which is stable enough to stop the isomerization reaction.

The catalytic activity of the [RuCp(OH2)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (1) and [RuCp(OH2)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(2) complexes was assessed for the isomerization of the substituted allylic alcoholstrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol, vinylbenzyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol, (1R)-(−)-myrtenol, cinnamyl alcohol, 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol, farnesol, coniferyl alcohol,S,R-(−)-carveol and 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol in water and aqueous media. The catalytic activity of 1 was notable for the isomerization oftrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol into dihydrochalcone (TON = 200, TOF5h= 40 h−1), α-vinylbenzyl alcohol into propiophenone (TON = 34, TOF4h= 8.4 h−1), and 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol into 3-methylcyclohexanone (TON = 285, TOF15h= 19), while only modest activity was observed for the isomerization of (1R)-(−)-myrtenol into myrtanal (TON = 7, TOF48h= 0.2 h−1). In contrast, complex 2 exhibited good efficiency for the synthesis of propiophenone (TON = 35, TOF1h= 35 h−1) and moderate activity for the synthesis of 3-methylcyclohexanone (TON = 18, TOF5h= 3.6). The remaining substrates were not isomerized.

The obtained results support the hypothesis that the size and substitution of allylic alcohols influence the isomerization conversion, revealing that these complexes are more effective for isomerising branched substrates with electron-withdrawing groups in the allylic position, such as intrans-1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol and α-vinylbenzyl alcohol. Additionally, substrates with a CH2OH terminal group such as cinnamyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol, were poorly converted. Steric hindrance, particularly from bulky groups and the methyl group in the vinyl position, may hinder the coordination to ruthenium. The combination of both steric hindrance and the presence of a CH2OH terminal group seemed to impede the isomerization of (1R)-(−)-myrtenol. Additionally, mechanistic studies confirmed the formation of the [RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(PTA)2](CF3SO3) (3) and [RuCp(η2-CH2Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019CH–CHOH–C6H5)(mPTA)2](CF3SO3)3(4) intermediates during the isomerization of α-vinylbenzyl alcohol. These findings support the proposed thermodynamic equilibrium of the η2-allylic-alcohol-intermediates (exo→endo)preceding the isomerization. Additionally, the low reactivity of 1,5-hexadien-3,4-diol was attributed to the formation of inactive intermediates, which probably block the reaction.
