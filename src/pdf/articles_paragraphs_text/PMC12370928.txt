We evaluated the efficacy of switching to intravitreal injection of faricimab (IVF) in patients with aflibercept-refractory neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) over 2 years of follow-up. We retrospectively reviewed 47 consecutive eyes of 45 Japanese patients with nAMD who switched from aflibercept to faricimab. Thirty-one eyes of 30 Japanese patients were included in this study. The mean visual acuity (BCVA) at month 24 was stable relative to the baseline. The mean central retinal thickness and subfoveal choroidal thinning significantly decreased at 24 months (P< 0.0001,P< 0.0001, respectively). At 24 months, 22 eyes (70.0%) achieved a dry macula and had improved VA levels with an improvement of 0.80 lines, which was significantly different from the remaining 9 eyes (P< 0.01). The mean interval of IVF was 11.8 weeks, which was significantly longer than that of aflibercept (10.0 weeks) at baseline (p= 0.014). Progression of macular atrophy or newly developing macular atrophy was seen in 3 eyes (9.7%), showing decline of 1.0 line, no other complications were seen. These results indicate that switching to IVF stabilized VA, significantly improved the anatomical changes and the achievement of a dry macula was significantly associated with the visual outcome, in patients with aflibercept-refractory nAMD over a 24-month period.

Macular neovascularization (MNV), which has been used as a term for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), causes significant visual loss1–3. nAMD can be divided into types 1 and 2, mixed types 1 and 2, 3 and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and it is well-known that the prevalence of nAMD differs between Caucasians and Asians4–8.

Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using bevacizumab (off-label), ranibizumab, aflibercept (IVA 2 mg), brolucizumab, and new anti-VEGF drugs (faricimab or aflibercept [IVA 8 mg]) in patients with nAMD is considered to be a major first-choice treatment that is both reasonable and useful based on evidence of the relationship between VEGF and MNV complexes in vitro and in clinical trials9–19. Anti-VEGF drugs tend to elicit different responses based on MNV subtypes in clinical settings. Furthermore, a long-term follow-up study for nAMD treated with ranibizumab demonstrated that the mean best-corrected VA (BCVA) declined to a mean of 8.6 letters due to the development of macular atrophy and persistence of active exudative disease at 7 years20. It is well known that brolucizumab has superior effectiveness to aflibercept in reducing exudation in patients with nAMD; however, it is associated with a risk of intraocular inflammation (IOI)17,21–23. Therefore, it is important to use anti-VEGF drugs appropriately according to the MNV subtype or response to first- or second-line treatments.

Faricimab, a novel anti-VEGF drug, has demonstrated vision benefits and favorable anatomical outcomes in major trials and has a unique mechanism that inhibits both VEGF-A and Ang-2, which can allow an interval of injection of up to 16 weeks and stabilization of vessels18. Recently, several studies on switching to intravitreal faricimab at 6 months or 1 year have reported its efficacy in maintaining the BCVA, improving anatomical outcomes, and extending the injection interval24–29. However, no studies have followed patients for longer than one year.

The purpose of the current study was to clarify the efficacy of intravitreal injections of faricimab in patients with aflibercept-refractory nAMD over a 2-year follow-up period.

Thirty-one eyes of 30 Japanese patients (22 men, 8 women; mean age ± standard deviation, 76.0 ± 7.5 years; range, 59–92 years) were included in the current study. Sixteen eyes (34%) were excluded because they were switched to brolucizumab owing to insufficient efficacy of faricimab within 24 months (Fig.1). All of the 16 eyes were switched to IVbr within 12 months after a mean of 3.4 (1–6) injections of faricimab.

All patients (31 eyes of 30 patients) were Japanese and were followed-up for at least 24 months. The proportion MNV was as follows: type 1 MNV, 21 eyes (67.7%); mixed (type 1 + Type 2) MNV, 4 eyes (12.9%); PCV, 6 eyes (19.4%) (Table1). All eyes had a treatment history of IVA, and the mean number of previous injections of aflibercept and the mean interval of IVA were 15.5(5–38) times and 10.0 (6–12) weeks, respectively. At baseline (at first intravitreal injection of faricimab: IVF), subretinal fluid (SRF) was observed in 26 eyes (83.9%), ME was observed in 7 eyes (22.6%), and PED was observed in 16 eyes (51.6%) (Table1).

The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) BCVA (Snellen equivalent) levels were 0.30 (20/40) at baseline, 0.24 (20/35) at 3 months after treatment (month 3), 0.23 (20/35) at month 6, 0.24 (20/35) at month 9, 0.25 (20/36) at month 12, 0.29 (20/39) at month 16, 0.29 (20/39) at month 20, and 0.30 (20/40) at month 24. A significant improvement in BCVA was observed at 3 (P< 0.05), 6 (P< 0.05), and 9 (P< 0.05) months (Fig.2).

The mean changes in BCVA at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 were 0.61, 0.68, 0.60, 0.49, 0.17, 0.10, 0.02 lines, respectively. At 24 months, an improvement in BCVA of ≥ 3 lines was seen in 2 (6.5%) of the 12 eyes, a decrease in BCVA of ≥ 3 lines was seen in 3 (9.7%) eyes, and the remaining 26 (83.9%) eyes had stable BCVA (defined as a loss of < 3 lines of vision).

The mean central retinal thickness (CRT) significantly decreased from 245 ± 77 μm at baseline to 174 ± 53 μm at month 3 (P< 0.0001), 175 ± 84 μm at month 6 (P< 0.0001), 176 ± 60 μm at month 9 (P< 0.0001), 168 ± 82 μm at month 12 (P< 0.0001), 167 ± 86 μm at month 16 (P< 0.001), 170 ± 103 μm at month 20 (P< 0.001), and 152 ± 48 μm at month 24 (P< 0.0001) (Fig.3). The mean subfoveal choroidal thinning (SFCT) also significantly decreased to 176 ± 71 μm at month 3 (P< 0.01), 171 ± 67 μm at month 6 (P< 0.001), 167 ± 63 μm at month 9 (P< 0.001), 170 ± 67 μm at month 12 (P< 0.001), 165 ± 68 μm at month 16 (P< 0.0001), 162 ± 68 μm at month 20 (P< 0.0001), and 162 ± 66 μm at month 24 (P< 0.0001) relative to baseline (190 ± 67 μm) (Fig.4).

At month 24, 22 eyes (70.0%) had achieved a dry macula (dry group). Of the remaining 9 eyes, 4 had SRF and 5 had macular edema (wet group). The mean logMAR BCVA at month 24 was 0.15 in the dry group and 0.66 in the wet group, which was a statistically significant difference (P< 0.001), despite there being no difference in the mean logMAR BCVA at baseline between the dry (0.23) and wet (0.47) groups (P= 0.055) (Mann-Whitney U test). The mean changes in BCVA at month 24 improved by 0.80 lines in the dry group and declined by 1.53 lines in the wet group, which also amounted to a statistically significant difference (P< 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The mean interval between faricimab injections in the dry and wet groups at 24 months was 9.1 weeks. PED disappeared in 5 eyes, decreased in 4 eyes, and remained in 7 eyes.

During the 24-month follow-up period, the mean number of faricimab injections was 9.1 (7–12) and the mean interval was 11.8 (8–16) weeks. Eighteen eyes (58.1%) had injection intervals of ≥ 12 weeks during follow-up. The mean interval of faricimab injection at month 24 was significantly longer than the mean interval of aflibercept injection at baseline (p= 0.014, Mann-Whitney U test).

Macular atrophy detected using short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF) was observed in 17 (54.8%) eyes at baseline (type 1 MNV, 11 eyes (64.7%); mixed (type 1 + Type 2) MNV, 2eyes (11.8%); PCV, 4 eyes (23.5%)) (Table1). The mean logMAR BCVA (Snellen equivalent) levels of the 17eyes with macular atrophy and the remaining 14 eyes without macular atrophy at baseline were 0.33 (20/43) and 0.27 (20/37), respectively, with no significant difference (P= 0.57) (Mann-Whitney U test). At month 24, the progression of macular atrophy or newly developing macular atrophy was observed in 3 eyes (9.7%), which showed a decline of 1.0 line.

There were no complications, including subretinal hemorrhage (> 1 disc diameter), RPE tear, ocular inflammation, intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg, severe vision loss, endophthalmitis, cataract progression, or systemic adverse events (Table2).

The current study showed that switching to intravitreal injection of faricimab stabilized VA and significantly improved anatomical changes in patients with nAMD refractory to aflibercept during the 24 months. Moreover, the achievement of a dry macula at month 24 was significantly related to the VA levels and change in VA at month 24.

nAMD is responsible for significant visual loss and should be considered as an early and appropriate treatment. Anti-VEGF treatment with ranibizumab, aflibercept, and brolucizumab has become the standard therapy for nAMD in clinical settings14–19. However, caution should be taken when considering well-known problems, including the decline in BCVA and high prevalence of macular atrophy in the 7-year results with ranibizumab or IOI may develop as a complication in patients treated with brolucizumab17,20–23. Although it is difficult to avoid these problems or complications completely, the appropriate use of anti-VEGF drugs according to the MNV subtype or response to first- or second-line treatments could be important. Several reports on switching to IVF showed stabilization of the VA and significant efficacy in improving anatomical changes24–29. However, most reports had a follow-up of ≤ 12 months; therefore, the 24-month outcomes were unclear. In the present study, all eyes had a history of IVA treatment, which showed inadequate efficacy with regard to anatomical changes. Therefore, we switched to IVF, and 22 eyes (70.0%) achieved a dry macula (dry group). The remaining 9 eyes showed exudation (wet group) at month 24. The dry group showed significantly better BCVA and improvement at 24 months. Therefore, achieving a dry macula may be important for improving or maintaining visual acuity (VA) in the long-term follow-up treatment of nAMD.

The 7-year results with ranibizumab showed a mean 8.6-letter decrease in BCVA, and one of the main reasons was the persistence of active exudative disease using the PRN regimen20. It is important but difficult to achieve a dry macula with fewer injections. In the current study, we used a “treat and extend, then fix” regimen, which could be easier for all investigators and less stressful for patients, due to the scheduling of treatment. The mean number faricimab injections during the 24-months study period was 9.1 (7–12), and in 18 eyes (58.1%), an injection interval of ≥ 12 weeks was achieved during follow-up. The mean interval of faricimab injections at month 24 was 11.8 weeks, which was significantly longer (p= 0.024) than the mean interval of aflibercept injections (10 weeks) before the baseline. The CATT study reported that frequent anti-VEGF injections were associated with a higher incidence of macular atrophy, and the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Age-Related Choroidal Neovascularization Trial 2-year results study also reported that continuous anti-VEGF therapy was associated with a higher incidence of atrophy30,31. Therefore, the current study demonstrates that switching to faricimab with a “treat and extend, then fix” regimen may be useful for reducing the number of injections, and should be considered for the long-term management of patients with nAMD.

PED is one of the primary indicators of the presence of MNV6,8. The regression of PED in nAMD patients after administration of anti-VEGF drugs may be strongly related to the delivery of anti-VEGF drugs to MNV under the RPE and the degree of MNV regression. Faricimab has been reported to reduce the height of PED32,33. In the current study, although the height or size of PED was not calculated, disappearance or reduction of PED was achieved in 9 eyes (56.3%) of 16 eyes that had PED at baseline. Faricimab also may be adequate effective to MNV under the RPE.

In the current study, we excluded 16 of 47 eyes (34%) because patients were switched to brolucizumab after faricimab showed insufficient efficacy. All 16 eyes were switched to IVbr within 12 months of a mean of 3.4 (1–6) IVFs. Although it is difficult to precisely determine the efficacy of anti-VEGF drugs, the remaining 31 eyes included in the current study showed significant improvement in anatomical changes, and the achievement of dry macula at month 24 was significantly associated with VA levels and changes in VA at month 24. Further switching to another anti-VEGF drugs (e.g., brolucizumab) may be needed during the long-term management of nAMD.

It is well known that macular atrophy is most strongly associated with the outcomes of VA during long-term follow-up20,30,31. However, theoretically, it is very difficult to avoid macular atrophy. In the current study, macular atrophy was already seen in 17 (54.8%) eyes at baseline, with no significant difference in BCVA compared with the remaining 14 eyes without macular atrophy. At month 24, although the progression of macular atrophy or newly developing macular atrophy was only seen in 3 eyes (9.7%), all eyes showed a decline of VA (mean decline, 1.0 line). Progressive or new macular atrophy was highly dependent on visual outcomes. Although the current study had a small sample size and a follow-up period of only 2 years, the low incidence of macular atrophy in the current study suggests that switching to faricimab when anti-VEGF therapy is ineffective may be useful for reducing the causes of macular atrophy. The mechanism underlying the development of macular atrophy remains to be elucidated; however, most ophthalmologists would aspire to avoid this complication. Although faricimab has a novel effect on the stabilization of vessels by inhibiting Ang-2, it is difficult to demonstrate a significant effect on the stabilization of blood vessels relative to conventional anti-VEGF drugs in clinical practice. A study using bispecific Ang-2 and VEGF antibody-treated mice demonstrated a relationship with decreased collagen remodeling in vitro34. The presence of fibrosis at month 12 in patients with nAMD has been reported to be strongly associated with poor VA at month 1235. The novel characteristics of faricimab should be expected to prevent the development of fibrosis in the clinical setting, and since the incidence of macular atrophy was low in the current study, further consideration should be given to the fact that faricimab may also reduce macular atrophy in the clinical setting.

During the 24-month follow-up period of the current study, none of the complications that occasionally occur after brolucizumab injection were observed after faricimab injection (e.g., unexpected severe decline in VA, RPE tear, increased subretinal hemorrhage, or IOI), and no other general complications were observed. If brolucizumab is required because faricimab is ineffective, the use of the laser flare-cell photometer (LFP) score may prove beneficial in predicting and following IOI, as we previously reported23.

The present study was associated with some limitations. The current study was a single-center, retrospective, in nature with a relatively small population and a two-year follow-up period. The small sample size due to excluding 16 eyes may have led to selection bias, especially in subgroup comparisons, which may limit statistical analysis. Further large, long-term, prospective, randomized studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety profiles of switching to intravitreal faricimab in patients with aflibercept-refractory nAMD.

In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that switching to intravitreal faricimab significantly improved the anatomical changes over a 24-month period in patients with aflibercept-refractory nAMD.

We retrospectively reviewed 47 consecutive eyes of 45 Japanese patients (32 men, 13 women; age range, 59–91 years; mean age 75.8 years) with nAMD who switched from aflibercept 2 mg (Eylea; Bayer) to faricimab at Iwaki City Medical Center from June to September in 2022, and who were followed for at least 2 years (Fig.1).

All eyes had persistent or recurrent exudation with intraretinal or subretinal fluid or sub-RPE fluid despite treatment with the IVA on a treat-and-extend (TAE) regimen, and the treatment interval was not extended to 12 weeks after more than 6 months of follow-up. All eyes were initially treated with 3 monthly IVAs, followed by a TAE regimen. The TAE regimen using IVA was selected based on the presence of disease activity at intervals of 4–16 weeks36. All patients were switched to IVF, followed by intervals of 8–16 weeks with fixed injections at the most appropriate interval in the maintenance phase. The interval between the first and second IVF injections was selected as the last interval of the previous IVA. We decided the interval of fixed injection with “treat and extend, then fix” regimen by extending for 4 weeks or shortening by 2 weeks according to the presence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid on OCT B scans36. Eyes in which the injection of faricimab was discontinued due to inadequate efficacy were excluded from the study, and switching to brolucizumab was planned.

After a detailed explanation of the potential risks and benefits, all patients provided their written informed consent for treatment (particularly for switching to faricimab) and the retrospective chart review of this study. The Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of Iwaki City Medical Center approved this observational study with regard to the protocol, including all methods, treatments, follow-up, and retrospective comparative analyses performed in this study. All of the study protocols adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

All patients underwent a standardized examination, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a contact lens, red-free fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and/or indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) with a fundus camera (TRC-50 FA/IA/IMAGEnet H1024 system; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) (RS-3000, Mirante; Nidek, Gamagori, Japan), and OCT angiography (OCTA) (RS-3000, Mirante; Nidek, Gamagori, Japan) during the follow-up period. CRT and SFCT were measured at each visit using an internal caliper software program. MNV subtype was diagnosed at first treatment with IVA based on the results of FA, ICGA, OCT and/or OCT angiography (OCTA). Patients with a dry macula at 24 months were defined as the dry group, whereas patients with SRF or macular edema were defined as the wet group.

Macular atrophy was defined as the area with increased visibility of the choroidal vasculature on fundus photographs and SW-AF images with hypoautofluorescence > 175 mm in the linear dimension37. We examined the SW-AF at baseline and month 24.

The mean BCVA was calculated using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) scale, using BCVA measured with a Japanese standard decimal VA chart. Stable BCVA was defined as a defined as a loss of < 3 lines of vision using logMAR conversion. We converted the decimal VA into Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study VA letter scores using a mathematical method to present the cases, as previously reported, according to the Japanese guidelines for ranibizumab retreatment38,39.

In all eyes, the vitreous cavity was injected with faricimab 3.5 to 4.0 millimeters posterior to the corneal limbus using a 30- or 34-gauge needle under topical anesthesia applied according to the Japanese guidelines.

Statistical analyses were performed using Student’st-test to analyze the visual, CRT, and SFCT outcomes, and Mann-Whitney U test for comparison of the results between dry and wet groups, subgroups with and without macular atrophy, and the mean interval injections of faricimab and aflibercept. P values of < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.
