Nursing management has been a cornerstone of the healthcare system, playing a crucial role in ensuring high-quality care. However, the dynamic nature of healthcare environments necessitates managerial agility to respond effectively to emerging challenges. Despite its significance, the concept of managerial agility in nursing remains underexplored, with unclear dimensions and implications.

This study employed Walker and Avant’s concept analysis approach to clarify the concept of managerial agility in nursing. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and SID. Keywords including “managerial agility,” “nursing management,” and “healthcare leadership” were utilized in English and Persian, applying Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” to refine the search.

Managerial agility in nursing encompasses crisis management proficiency, proactive foresight, swift and informed decision-making, resource and workforce flexibility, and innovative problem-solving in healthcare settings. It involves integrating innovative strategies, fostering resilience, and ensuring effective leadership to enhance patient care and organizational efficiency.

The findings underscore the necessity of reinforcing managerial agility in nursing education, practice, and policy-making. Enhancing this competency can contribute to improved decision-making, better resource management, and higher-quality patient care. Future research should focus on developing frameworks to operationalize managerial agility in diverse nursing contexts.

Nursing management is one of the core pillars of the healthcare system and medical centers [1]. It plays a vital role in improving patient care quality, boosting nurses’ job satisfaction, and enhancing the overall performance of the health system [2]. Amid this, the ability of nursing managers to adapt quickly to changes, make timely decisions, and remain flexible in the face of challenges becomes incredibly important [3].This is where the concept of “managerial agility” comes in, now recognized as a key trait for nursing managers at all levels [4,5]. These managers often work in dynamic and complex environments, shaped by factors like staff shortages, rapid shifts in treatment methods, public health crises, and technological advancements [6].

Managerial agility means a manager can make quick decisions, stay flexible in changing situations, tackle problems with creativity, and handle changes effectively. This idea first took root in business management and information technology, but over time, it found its way into public administration and healthcare [5]. In hospitals where unpredictable situations and fast changes are the norm managerial agility helps nursing managers perform better, manage crises well, and make the most of available resources [5].

In recent years, the healthcare system has faced numerous challenges. Rising patient numbers, staff shortages, increasingly complex care, emerging diseases, and shifting health regulations have all underscored the need for agile and adaptable managers [7]. Nursing managers are on the front lines of these changes and need to adjust to new realities fast. In nursing, agility in management means adapting quickly, using resources wisely, supporting the nursing team, and coming up with creative solutions to problems [8].

A crucial part of managerial agility is the ability to lead nursing teams through tough, high-pressure situations. Nurses, especially in emergency and critical care units, often face unexpected challenges that demand swift and effective decisions from their managers [9]. In these moments, agile managers can overcome obstacles and improve team performance with innovative solutions [10]. Furthermore, the constant updates to treatment protocols and care standards create challenges that only managers with strong agility can effectively manage [1].

Managerial agility in nursing is a set of skills that helps managers thrive in complex and tough settings. These skills include fast and informed decision-making, adaptability to change, problem-solving, human resource management, and using new technologies to improve care processes [11]. Managers with this trait can create a dynamic workplace where nurses feel secure, supported, and motivated [8].

Despite its importance, a clear and complete definition of managerial agility in nursing is still missing. Many studies in healthcare management have touched on topics like change management or decision-making, but few have dug into managerial agility specifically in nursing. That’s why we have chosen the Walker and Avant method for this study, as it is a reliable approach to gaining a deeper understanding of this concept. It looks at the concept’s core features, different examples, background factors, and outcomes to provide a practical definition [12].

Defining managerial agility in nursing can enhance managerial effectiveness and improve patient care quality by ensuring timely interventions and adaptive strategies that address evolving patient needs, reducing delays, and increasing safety; therefore, analyzing managerial agility in nursing can pave the way for new management models and offer real-world solutions to boost managers’ performance in healthcare settings. Our goal here is to clarify this concept, pinpoint its key traits, and explore its impact on nursing management. This analysis can not only shape more effective management policies but also help nursing managers work more efficiently, ultimately raising the quality of patient care.

Walker and Avant’s concept analysis method [12] was employed as a systematic and rigorous framework to elucidate the descriptions, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents of the concept of ‘managerial agility’ in nursing. Managerial agility is a broadly relevant concept that transcends traditional nursing management, influencing various aspects of healthcare leadership and organizational performance. Consequently, the literature review incorporates all identifiable applications of managerial agility, capturing both its implicit and explicit dimensions. The stages of this concept analysis method are as follows: (A) selecting a concept, (B) determining the aims or purposes of the analysis, (C) identifying all uses of the concept that can be discovered, (D) determining the defining attributes, (E) identifying a model case, (F) identifying borderline, related, contrary, invented, and illegitimate cases, (G) identifying antecedents and consequences, and (H) defining empirical referents.

A literature review was conducted across multiple health and management-related databases, including PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, SID, and IranDoc. The concepts “managerial agility,” “nursing management,” and “healthcare leadership” were searched using Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” in the title and abstract fields of each database. No temporal restrictions were imposed, and articles published in English or Persian up to March 2025 were retrieved to reflect the most current understanding of the concept. Two authors, HG and RN, independently reviewed all the selected articles to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The significance of a concept is shaped by a variety of internal and external factors within its domain over time, rendering concepts without precise definitions worthy of further investigation [12]. In the field of nursing, where healthcare systems, patient needs, and workforce dynamics are in constant flux, the concept of managerial agility has gained prominence. This importance is driven by the critical role nursing managers play in ensuring high-quality patient care amidst complex and unpredictable challenges, such as resource shortages, shifting health policies, and sudden healthcare crises. Despite its extensive exploration in fields like business management and information technology, managerial agility has received limited attention in nursing management, where the dynamic nature of healthcare settings demands adaptability and rapid response. Given the increasing emphasis on adaptive leadership in healthcare and the lack of a clear, unified definition, this concept was selected for analysis to elucidate its dimensions and characteristics.

The concept of “managerial agility” in nursing has been inadequately examined within the healthcare context, resulting in ambiguity surrounding its definition and application. This study aims to refine the meaning of managerial agility in nursing by identifying its descriptions, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents, providing a foundation for enhancing managerial effectiveness and improving patient care quality.

To fully examine the concept of managerial agility in nursing, it is essential to explore the individual meanings of its components “managerial” and “agility” using diverse sources such as dictionaries, thesauruses, websites, and scholarly literature.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, managerial is an adjective pertaining to the role or functions of a manager, involving planning, organizing, directing, and controlling resources to achieve organizational goals [13].

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “agility” as the ability to move quickly and easily or to think and respond rapidly. In a broader sense, it encompasses nimbleness and adaptability in the face of change [13]. Similarly, the Oxford English Dictionary describes it as the ability to move or think quickly and easily; nimbleness [14]. In a business context, Goldman et al. (1995) define agility as a dynamic capability that enables an organization to respond rapidly to changes in the marketplace, customer demands, and technological advancements through flexibility, speed, and innovation [15]. Within healthcare, characterize agility as the capacity of leaders and systems to adapt swiftly to unpredictable challenges, such as patient surges or resource shortages, while maintaining quality and efficiency [16].

In nursing literature, managerial agility refers to the capacity of nursing managers to anticipate, respond to, and navigate complex and rapidly evolving healthcare environments effectively [17–19]. This concept draws from organizational management theories and adapts them to the unique demands of nursing. Managerial agility manifests in two key dimensions: reactive and proactive agility [20].The reactive dimension focuses on swift decision-making during crises, such as reallocating staff during a sudden influx of patients or managing resources during equipment shortages. In contrast, the proactive dimension emphasizes strategic foresight, such as anticipating staffing needs based on seasonal illness trends or implementing innovative care delivery models to enhance efficiency [20–22].

In clinical settings, managerial agility is reflected in practices like optimizing shift schedules to reduce nurse fatigue, leveraging technology for real-time data access to support decision-making, and fostering a flexible team culture that adapts to unexpected challenges [23–25]. Additionally, it involves balancing workload distribution, enhancing communication across interdisciplinary teams, and promoting resilience among staff, all of which contribute to improved patient care quality and organizational sustainability [17,26].

The concepts of leadership agility and strategic agility are closely related to managerial agility, as all three involve the capacity to respond quickly and effectively to environmental changes. However, there are key distinctions among them: leadership agility focuses on the personal abilities of leaders to be self-aware, guide others, and manage interpersonal dynamics during change; strategic agility emphasizes an organization’s capability to reorient its long-term goals and strategies in response to external shifts [27]. In contrast, managerial agility is more operational and practical, referring to a manager’s ability to make timely decisions, allocate resources, and solve problems effectively in day-to-day clinical and organizational contexts.

To analyze the concept of managerial agility in nursing using Walker and Avant’s approach (12), the fourth step involves identifying its defining attributes those essential characteristics that are fundamental to the concept’s existence and distinguish it from similar concepts. Managerial agility in nursing is a dynamic set of abilities and skills that empower nursing managers to respond effectively to changes, crises, and complex decision-making scenarios in healthcare settings. Below, the critical attributes of this concept are outlined, each contributing uniquely to its formation and application.

One of the fundamental pillars of managerial agility is the ability to make rapid yet well-informed decisions in situations characterized by time pressure, high stress, and uncertainty. In such circumstances, nursing managers cannot rely solely on fixed protocols or pre-established decisions; rather, they must simultaneously draw on multiple critical sources of information to guide their actions. These sources include real-time data—such as patients’ vital signs, available capacity within treatment units, and the status of human and material resources; past clinical experiences which can help identify recurring patterns or clinical probabilities; and professional ethical principles which ensure that decisions are made in alignment with patient dignity, safety, and justice [10,22,28]. Unlike routine decision-making, which may rely on fixed protocols, this form of agility involves the swift analysis of complex information to address unpredictable challenges, distinguishing it from static managerial approaches [15,25].

Agile nursing managers excel at adjusting resource allocation and workforce utilization to meet fluctuating demands. This encompasses rapidly reassigning staff during an emergency clinical situation, securing additional equipment during shortages, or modifying shift schedules to prevent burnout [7,28,29]. In contrast to traditional resource management, which emphasizes long-term planning, this attribute prioritizes immediate, context-specific adaptability, ensuring operational continuity amidst the volatility of healthcare settings [7,23].

Managerial agility extends beyond reacting to change, encompassing the proactive anticipation of future needs and corresponding preparation. For instance, a manager might analyze local disease trends to stockpile supplies ahead of an influenza season, preventing shortages in staff or resources [5,30]. This forward-looking approach, often supported by data analytics or health forecasting systems, sets agility apart from mere responsiveness, enabling nursing managers to act as strategic planners rather than just crisis responders. It also complements swift decision-making by providing a foundation for informed actions, enhancing system resilience. However, inaccurate forecasting or resource constraints may pose challenges, requiring careful planning and organizational support [11,31].

During acute disruptions such as pandemics, natural disasters, or sudden staff absences agile managers demonstrate proficiency in sustaining care delivery. This involves coordinating interdisciplinary teams, maintaining clear communication under stress, and implementing contingency plans, such as redistributing workloads during a COVID-19 surge [32–34]. Unlike general crisis leadership, this attribute emphasizes rapid, nursing-specific structural adjustments, ensuring patient safety and team stability amid turmoil. It also enhances swift decision-making by providing a structured response framework, bolstering system resilience. However, rapid adjustments under stress may lead to team fatigue or resistance if not supported by adequate resources [22,35].

Agile managers distinguish themselves by employing creative, non-traditional solutions to complex challenges. This may include leveraging real-time data systems to monitor patient acuity or designing peer-support programs to boost morale during prolonged crises. By prioritizing innovation over reliance on established methods, this attribute diverges from conventional problem-solving, directly enhancing nursing performance and care quality in evolving environments [29,32].

Managerial agility in nursing is not a static concept but a dynamic process that requires continuous development of managerial skills, learning from past experiences, and fostering an organizational culture based on flexibility and rapid responsiveness. Without these attributes, nursing managers cannot make effective decisions in complex and evolving conditions or enhance the performance of nursing teams.

In this stage of Walker and Avant’s analysis [12], a model case is presented that fully embodies all essential attributes of managerial agility in nursing, illustrating its application in real-life scenarios.

Mr. Rezaei, a nursing manager at a metropolitan hospital, arrives on Monday morning to find the emergency department overwhelmed by a sudden patient surge predicted from prior seasonal trends and the ICU lacking critical devices due to a supply disruption. Having anticipated such a possibility, he had stockpiled backup supplies the previous week, showcasing proactive foresight. He promptly convenes an emergency team meeting, assesses real-time patient data, and reallocates nurses from less busy units to the emergency department, adjusting shifts flexibly to maintain hospital operations. To address the equipment shortage, he collaborates with the hospital’s biomedical engineering team to repurpose compatible respiratory equipment from the surgical unit, demonstrating innovative problem-solving. Throughout the crisis, he coordinates with physicians via a rapid-response protocol, reassures his staff to sustain morale, and adapts to evolving needs, ensuring both immediate stability and long-term process improvements.

In this stage of Walker and Avant’s analysis, a contrary case is presented that lacks the essential attributes of managerial agility in nursing, illustrating the consequences of its absence.

Mr. Karimi, a nursing manager at a large hospital, faces a sudden surge in emergency patients but delays decisions, insisting on lengthy approvals before adjusting nurse shifts or workloads, ignoring real-time reports from staff about patient acuity. When nurses report a shortage of critical ICU equipment, he waits passively for the main supplier instead of exploring local alternatives, failing to anticipate ongoing delays due to past supply issues. He refuses to reassign nurses from quieter units, adhering rigidly to preset schedules despite rising staff stress. As a result, treatment delays lead to patient complications, nurse dissatisfaction escalates with increased burnout, and care quality declines, ultimately creating managerial challenges and prompting complaints from families.

A borderline case exhibits some attributes of managerial agility in nursing but lacks the full spectrum of its essential features, highlighting partial agility with notable shortcomings.

Ms. Mahmoudi, a nursing manager at a public hospital, faces an infectious disease outbreak causing a surge in emergency patients. She flexibly reassigns five nurses from the outpatient clinic to the emergency ward and adjusts their shifts, yet delays implementation awaiting management approval, lacking swift decision-making. When a shortage of protective equipment emerges, she submits a standard request to the central supply but waits passively for delivery instead of seeking local alternatives, showing no proactive foresight. During the crisis, she holds meetings to support staff morale, demonstrating limited crisis management, but relies on outdated paper-based reporting rather than innovative solutions. Consequently, her partial agility marked by flexibility and minimal crisis response but lacking rapid decisions and creativity reduces overall efficiency, leaving nurses frustrated and increasing patient wait times.

A related case partially reflects the defining attributes of managerial agility but does not fully exemplify the concept.

Ms. Hosseini, a senior nurse leader in a regional hospital, is tasked with implementing a new electronic health record (EHR) system to improve patient data management. Recognizing the potential resistance from staff due to the change, she develops a comprehensive training program over several weeks, conducts workshops to address nurses’ concerns, and adjusts her leadership style to encourage open communication and team buy-in. Her approach demonstrates adaptability and leadership agility by fostering a supportive environment and guiding her team through the transition. However, her actions are part of a planned, systematic change management process, focusing on long-term adoption rather than rapid, real-time responses to unpredictable challenges. While Ms. Hosseini’s approach shares the adaptability attribute with managerial agility, it lacks the swift decision-making, proactive foresight in crisis situations, and innovative problem-solving required for managerial agility in nursing, as her focus is on structured change rather than dynamic, operational adjustments in a crisis-driven context.

An illegitimate case misuses the term managerial agility in a context where the concept does not properly apply.

Ms. Ahmadi, a nursing manager in a community hospital, faces a sudden increase in patient admissions due to a local flu outbreak. She adheres strictly to the hospital’s standard operating procedures, relying on outdated protocols to assign nurses and manage resources. Instead of reallocating staff from other units or seeking alternative equipment sources, she insists on following the existing schedule and waits for directives from senior management. When nurses report high stress levels, she dismisses their concerns, assuming they should handle the workload as per routine expectations. Although Ms. Ahmadi believes she is managing the situation effectively by adhering to established guidelines, her approach lacks swift decision-making, flexibility, proactive foresight, and innovative problem-solving. This rigid adherence to protocol does not constitute managerial agility, as it fails to address the dynamic needs of the situation, leading to delays in patient care and increased staff burnout.

Walker and Avant define antecedents as events or conditions that must precede a concept’s occurrence, while consequences are the outcomes that follow its application [12]. This study identifies the antecedents and consequences of managerial agility in nursing to clarify its prerequisites and impacts (Fig.2). Dynamic and Changing Healthcare Environment.

Managerial agility in nursing emerges from a blend of individual competencies and organizational factors. Individual competencies include rapid decision-making skills, adaptability, leadership acumen, and analytical foresight Organizational factors encompass a dynamic healthcare environment necessitating real-time responses (e.g., patient surges or crises) [36] access to advanced technology and information systems for timely data-driven decisions [37], and a supportive organizational culture that embraces change and innovation [11]. Flexible hospital policies, well-trained nursing teams capable of adapting to sudden shifts, and robust support from senior management through resources and decision-making autonomy further enable agility.These prerequisites collectively lay the groundwork for nursing managers to implement agile strategies effectively [11,38].

Consequences are the outcomes that emerge following the successful implementation of managerial agility in nursing.

Managerial agility delivers wide-ranging benefits to patients, nursing staff, healthcare systems, and organizations. It enhances patient care quality and safety by enabling rapid problem-solving, reducing wait times, and minimizing clinical errors such as through swift resource adjustments during shortages [22,39]. For nurses, it boosts job satisfaction and reduces burnout by fostering a controlled, adaptive work environment that mitigates stress from sudden changes [23,40].

At the organizational level, agility improves hospital efficiency and productivity by optimizing resource use and minimizing waste [10,40]. It also strengthens resilience during crises (e.g., pandemics), ensuring service continuity with minimal disruption [34,35].

Furthermore, it builds staff trust in leadership and elevates nursing managers’ strategic influence in healthcare policy-making, reinforcing their role as key decision-makers. These outcomes highlight managerial agility’s profound impact on care quality, operational performance, and staff well-being [35,41].

According to Walker and Avant [12], the final step in concept analysis involves identifying empirical referents, which illustrate how defining attributes can be recognized or measured, rather than serving as direct instruments for the concept itself These real-world examples aid in validating the concept’s significance and operationalizing its attributes. While no single tool fully measures managerial agility in nursing, the following instruments exemplify ways to assess its key.

The General Decision-Making Style Questionnaire (GDMS), developed by Scott and Bruce (1995), evaluates decision-making styles across five subscales, enabling measurement of nursing managers’ ability to make swift and intelligent decisions under pressure [42]. Complementarily, the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) assesses cognitive adaptability in complex decision-making scenarios [43].

The Organizational Flexibility Scale, adapted from organizational research, measures managers’ adaptability in workforce and resource management, focusing on flexibility in task assignments and structural changes [31].

The Crisis Management Preparedness (CMP) questionnaire evaluates readiness for crises through subscales like risk assessment and rapid coordination, while the Organizational Resilience Questionnaire (ORQ) gauges managers’ capacity to sustain performance during unexpected events [31,44].

The Organizational Innovation Assessment (OIA) examines creativity and innovation in proposing solutions, and the Transformational Leadership Questionnaire (TLQ) assesses managers’ ability to foster innovative changes in nursing settings [40,45].

Managerial agility in nursing is a key characteristic for effective and efficient management in dynamic and complex hospital environments [8].The findings of this concept analysis indicate that managerial agility is a combination of quick decision-making, flexibility in changing conditions, and the ability to adapt to unforeseen challenges [26]. This concept not only plays a role in improving nurse performance and reducing their job-related stress but also has a direct impact on the quality of patient care [46].

The results of this study show that managerial agility is influenced by factors such as the ability to recognize environmental changes, access to appropriate resources, and the use of modern technologies for data and information management. In fact, nursing managers who utilize advanced information systems to monitor staff performance and anticipate future needs can make more effective decisions in critical situations [28,47].

On the other hand, several challenges hinder the implementation of managerial agility in nursing. Staff shortages, bureaucratic structures, and lack of access to proper training for enhancing rapid decision-making skills are among the barriers that can limit nursing managers’ ability to practice managerial agility [48]. Therefore, to enhance managerial agility, it is essential to design specific educational programs aimed at developing flexible leadership skills and quick decision-making abilities [34,49].

Moreover, effective communication among healthcare teams is a vital component of managerial agility. Managers who can improve team coordination through advanced communication techniques are more successful in implementing managerial decisions [50].

Managerial agility in nursing fosters a supportive work environment, reducing nurse burnout and enhancing job satisfaction through rapid decision-making and flexible resource allocation [7]. By reallocating staff during patient surges, agile managers alleviate workload pressures, enabling nurses to perform effectively under stress [8,46]. This adaptability minimizes delays, optimizes resources, and ensures care continuity, improving patient safety and care quality [23]. Enhanced team resilience and communication further strengthen organizational efficiency and service delivery in dynamic healthcare settings [34,35].

Ultimately, this concept analysis highlights that managerial agility in nursing is an essential attribute for improving care quality and enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems. Healthcare organizations should adopt policies that support the development of this capability among nursing managers, enabling them to effectively and efficiently adapt to environmental changes.

This concept analysis focused on literature directly addressing managerial agility in nursing, potentially missing insights from related fields like organizational psychology or healthcare administration due to search scope limitations. The overlap of attributes, such as adaptability, with related concepts like transformational leadership complicates their precise delineation per Walker and Avant’s method. The study emphasized hospital settings, with limited exploration of contexts like community health or long-term care due to sparse data. Organizational factors and individual competencies, identified as antecedents, may also serve as consequences, challenging strict categorization. Finally, while tools like the GDMS and CFI measure specific attributes, no comprehensive instrument exists for managerial agility, suggesting a need for future studies to refine contexts and develop validated tools.

The findings of this concept analysis highlight the critical importance of reinforcing managerial agility across nursing education, clinical practice, and healthcare policy-making. In an increasingly complex and dynamic healthcare environment, the ability of nursing managers to adapt quickly, make informed decisions, and allocate resources efficiently is essential to maintaining care quality and organizational resilience. Strengthening this competency not only supports real-time responsiveness to crises and systemic changes but also fosters long-term improvements in staff satisfaction, patient outcomes, and institutional performance. Therefore, integrating managerial agility as a core competency in leadership development programs, organizational standards, and academic curricula is strongly recommended. Future research should aim to develop valid tools and conceptual frameworks that can guide the assessment, implementation, and evaluation of managerial agility in various nursing settings, ensuring its effective translation into practice.
