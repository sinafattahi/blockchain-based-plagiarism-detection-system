Cloud seeding is a technique used for weather modification, but the commonly used material, silver iodide, has environmental concerns. In response to this concern, we report a biocompatible hyaluronate/polyacrylate/basil seed nanocomposite was synthesized in this study using microwave irradiation and chemical esterification. A new approach involving polarized CO2laser ablation was developed to enhance the nanocomposite’s active surface area. The study focused on investigating changes in morphology and surface area during irradiation, which are crucial for effective cloud seeding while minimizing environmental impact. Thermogravimetric analysis showed acceptable water adsorption/absorption properties of up to 98.55%. with this feature, the synthesized nanostructure displayed hygroscopic properties. Also, these amorphous nanocomposites exhibited pseudo-stacking disorder properties in their X-ray diffraction patterns making them a promising cloud seeding agent with glaciogenic properties. In the present study, after investigating nanocomposites, C5 sample with 5 min microwave radiation and one-minute pulse between each radiation, was chosen as the best among the samples. Evaluation in a calibrated cloud seeding chamber revealed the nanocomposite’s reliability, producing up to 1.18 (± 0.11) × 1014particles of active cloud seeding compound per gram within a 45-minute timeframe. These results were observed at temperatures between − 14 and − 16 °C with a relative humidity exceeding 90%.

Rain precipitation happens after moisture collects around the naturally occurring particles in the air, causing the air to reach a saturation level at which it can no longer hold that moisture1. In areas with very low humidity, there are at least some water molecules in the sky as clouds, and only a small part of the accessible moisture in the clouds is transformed into precipitation that reaches the surface of the earth2. Some aspects of the environment induce changes in the weather, which is called "Weather Modification" and has been performed for more than a half-century. Weather modification is one of those areas in which science can have an immediate and obvious benefit for society3. This fact has prompted scientists and engineers to explore the possibility of augmenting water supplies by means of cloud seeding. If more water drops could be transformed into precipitation, the potential benefits would appear very attractive4,5. Cloud seeding, therefore, plays a role as a common technique that serves several climate purposes, such as changing the amount or type of precipitation, suppressing hailstorms, or weakening hurricanes6,7. Cloud seeding for rain enhancement is often the most cost-effective method with the highest quality for providing additional water resources8. There are some methods to increase precipitation, such as cloud seeding, electrification techniques, laser technology, hygroscopic flares, water condensation. Among these methods, using cloud-seeding materials such as "Cloud Condensation Nuclei" (CCN) is an effective method to accelerate the formation of water droplets and then harvest the water vapor in the atmosphere via precipitation9,10. This phenomenon essentially helps that process along, providing additional "nuclei" around which water condenses1. A key challenge in this field is the selection of suitable cloud-seeding materials that are both highly effective and environmentally safe. Additionally, there are two ways that ice can form its nuclei: homogeneously, without the presence of a solid surface, or heterogeneously, on a solid surface11. However, ice does not form in the atmosphere until a temperature of − 38 °C unless ice nuclei and heterogeneous nucleation are present, which can happen at much warmer temperatures12–14.

Also, glaciogenic seeding and hygroscopic seeding are the two primary techniques for convective cloud seeding9,15. For hygroscopic seeding, materials with high water absorption capacities are necessary16,17, such as NaCl, NaNO3, etc.18. Hygroscopic seeding significantly increases the rate at which raindrops form while also producing signs of an expedited collision-coalescence process19. The disadvantage of using this material is that it necessitates a large amount of hygroscopic seeding materials for each project and the usual corrosive character for these materials20.

On the other hand, glaciogenic seeding materials include dry ice and silver iodide in particular21. Dry ice is a homogeneous nucleation, which is considered a type of coolant that generates ice crystals by strong cooling22and silver iodide is regarded as one of the most effective known heterogeneous ice nucleators, causing ice formation23. Scientists show that, AgI (β-AgI, γ-AgI, and sd-AgI) displays a strong tendency to form stacking-disordered materials24,25. Stacking-disordered materials briefly consist of structurally well-defined layers that are stacked on top of one another in a disordered way. Naturally, stacking disorder is frequently found for layered materials, such as graphite, ice, and AgI, which often exhibit strong chemical bonding within their layers and weak interactions between them26,27Zielke et al.24, using model simulations, proposed a potential mechanism for ice nucleation by AgI particles that involve some AgI surfaces imposing a structure in the surrounding water layer that is similar to a layer that exists in the bulk ice24. Ice forms at these surfaces and spreads outward, generating successive layers that eventually comprise the bulk28. The advantages of these systems include acceptable efficiency for AgI, low cost, and the convenience of using salts, whereas these systems are seriously suffering from problems like the fact that AgI is considered a hazardous substance and toxic pollutant29the most crucial factor for effective cloud seeding is the choice of seeding material30. Hygroscopic materials require large quantities due to their high solubility and have corrosive properties that limit their widespread use16. On the other hand, AgI, although highly efficient as an ice nucleating agent, is classified as a toxic pollutant, raising environmental concerns26. Additionally, the mechanisms of ice nucleation on AgI surfaces are still not completely understood, and its effectiveness varies depending on environmental conditions15. Given these challenges, the development of novel cloud seeding materials, remains a significant research gap. Moreover, advanced methods to characterize the surface properties of hygroscopic nanomaterials, which play a critical role in their nucleating ability, are still limited18.

Considering the points mentioned, for the first time in this study, we report the synthesis of a multifunctional nanocomposite material that exhibits both hygroscopic and ice-nucleating properties. The innovative synthesis method, which combines microwave radiation with polarized CO₂ laser ablation, is thoroughly described and offers a promising new approach.

Lasers, known for generating coherent and focused beams of light, have revolutionized a wide range of industries, from communications to medicine31. A fascinating application is CO₂ laser ablation at the nanoscale, which enables precise, controlled modifications of materials in laboratory environments32. This level of precision becomes even more critical in fields like advanced diagnostics and photonics, where even the tiniest detail can make a huge difference33. Mastering such precise and adaptable nanoscale techniques is laying the groundwork for major advancements in materials science, diagnostic tools, and many other cutting-edge areas34.

Furthermore, a novel analytical technique was employed to evaluate the anhydrous surface characteristics of highly hygroscopic nanomaterials, providing valuable insights into their seeding performance.

All of the reagents were of analytical grade. For this purpose, hyaluronic acid (> 98%, AGFW: 3–7 × 106g mol−1) was purchased from the PubChem-NIH Company. Poly acrylic acid (> 98%, AGFW:406.25 g mol−1) was from the PubChem-NIH Company. In addition, NaOH granules with purity percentage > 99.9% and average gram formula weight (AGFW) of 40 g mol−1was related to the Merck Company.

The nanocomposites were synthesized by using the Ball-mill grinding process, microwave synthesis process, Laser ablating activation system, fabricated device, and Gaussian 09 program package. Detailed descriptions of these tools have been reported in the Supplementary Manuscript, Sect. 1, "The Instrumentation details".

At the first step, the optimum mass of both polyacrylic acid and the same amount of purified hyaluronic acid were introduced to the ball-mill system for powdering to reach the sub-micrometer size and homogeneously mixing together. At the second step, 0.1 g of NaOH powder was added to the mixture and irradiated with microwave radiation (experimental conditions and number of samples is listed inTable S1).

In the third step, which was based on basil utilization, basil seed was powdered with a ball mill and then washed with ethanol (10 ml) to remove a large percentage of lipids. For this section, the amount of ethanol was mixed with powder basil seed and then placed in a centrifuge device for 10 min at 4000 rpm. This was repeated five times, and the supernatant was removed with a pipet or medicine dropper. After it, the remaining powder was dried in an oven at 50 °C for 24 h and stored in a desiccator36. Finally, after this step, a certain mass (1.0 g) of the third precursor was added to the previous material and mixed well. Then, the mixed materials were re-exposed to the microwave. All the products were irradiated for 1.0 min, after which the microwave cavity and the reaction vessel were hot. After each minute, the reaction vessel was shaken to redistribute its substances for one minute and was then replaced in the microwave oven. In the final step, the product was exposed to infrared laser irradiation at a rate of around 0.20 ± 0.01 g s−1for surface ablation and the creation of new junctions or breaks, and finally the desired composite was obtained.

To evaluate the hygroscopic properties of the materials and synthesized nanocomposite, a rough strategy was followed by a simple instrumentation system. For this purpose, a cubic, closed glass box with 15 × 15 × 10 cm dimensions were fabricated (Figure S3A). With the introduction of a cold-water aerosol using humidifiers (Figure S3B) (Humidifier Water Panels, SCHMITT, 24 V DC) introduced inside a fixed volume of water (~ 200 mL) containing inside a plastic trap (~ 500 mL) (Figure S3C), the relative humidity (RH) inside the box was controlled up to around 90% (Figure S3D). The humidity aerosols were then directed and introduced into the glass cubic box using several (~ 5) mL min−1of air flow. The surface temperature of the analyzed composite during the experiment process was also controlled using a Peltier Cooling crystal (5 × 5 cm, Thermoelectric Cooler, Peltier Cooling Technology (Figure S3F), Cooling with Electric Current, Industrial Heating & Cooling, DBK Industrial, Europe). The sample was then introduced to the system via its location on the surface of a flat basket.Figure S3Eillustrates the miniature diaphragm air pump to create turbulent inside the glass chamber. The result of this device is shown inFigure S6. In this part, since cellulose is the main constituent of basil seed, we chose it instead of basil seed since basil seed is a complicated chemical and it is impossible to simulate such a substance.

The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by different analytical techniques, such as Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET). Detailed descriptions of the analytical instrumentation system have been reported in the Supplementary Manuscript (See Supporting information,Sect. 5. “Characterization apparatus”).

The goal of this study was to create novel organic-based composites with properties such as high and acceptable water-permeable, biocompatible; available and partially low-cost. To reach this aim, it was described as focusing on commensal compounds such as hyaluronic acid, polyacrylic acid, and basil seed. These compounds, besides their properties such as acceptable water adsorption properties and their availability, showed adequate water permeability because of the presence of different polar functional groups such as C = O, O-H, etc. as the active sites for better interaction with water through the hydrogen bond38. Basil seed is a complex carbohydrate distinguished by a significant amount of gel and has an enormous ability to hold molecules of water. In other words, the microstructure of the three-dimensional cross-linked polysaccharide network seen in the gel of basil seeds may provide favorable conditions for the absorption of water and formation of hydration shells39. These features directed us to focus on these compounds more precisely. However, the above-mentioned compounds seemed to have adequate water permeability, but a higher water capacity was estimated based on the synergistic effect(s) of these compounds via different mechanisms, such as (i) the formation of a physical homogeneous mixture and (ii) the formation of covalent bonds during irradiation with simple and effective driving forces such as microwave radiation at solvent-free conditions35. Based on this background, the recommended procedure for the large-scale synthesis of this compound was introduced.

Based on the literature, duration time taken for the esterification of acid and alcohol under microwave irradiation was restricted to 5–10 min. Also, this reaction was reported in the literature by conventional heating at 120 °C using a homogeneous acid catalyst and solvent in 4.0 h40. Under the influence of the microwave, the reaction time is thus reduced significantly. Microwaves accelerate the rate of the reaction by an order of magnitude35.

The FT-IR spectra of materials are depicted in Fig.1. The IR spectrum of a nanocomposite in optimum condition (E) is different from that of its raw precursors and the mixture of those raw precursors’ spectra, which relate to the existence of interactions between the three components (Fig.1E). The vibration of the ester group is responsible for the peak at 1735 cm-1in Fig.1E, which does not appear in other spectra. The Fig.1F demonstrates the occurrence of carbon-carbon peaks about 1500 cm-1, which may be connected to the compound burning and loss of functional groups. Additionally, the hydroxyl peak has disappeared, a sign that these materials no longer contain the crucial hydroxyl functional groups.

According to the theory of kinematical scattering, X-ray diffraction peaks broaden either when crystallites become smaller than about a micrometer or if the crystal lattice becomes imperfect or faulty in great abundance41. To reduce the size of particles and the production of nanoparticles, a ball milling instrument was utilized based on a top-down method in which mechanical forces were applied42. Consequently, it was tried to decrease the error approach to optimize the ball milling parameters, including time, rotational speed, and ball-to-powder mass ratio, to obtain nanoparticles in a short time. To evaluate the effectiveness of the synthesized nanocomposite for cloud seeding, the initial effects of both hygroscopic and glaciogenic seedings were evaluated in the presence of various particles. As it was previously reported, hydrophilic materials such as NaOH, CaCO3, etc. were used, which are able to lead to hygroscopic seeding43,44. However, some commercial and well-known particles, such as (AgI, during its direct use or in-situ formation during conversion of AgIO4) with the stacking disorder structure caused glaciogenic seeding in some positions. It can be estimated, cubic structure available in composite generates the different surfaces, then cubic phase of ice can be constructed by pseudo stacking disorder of water formed. On the other hand, the XRD pattern of the composite powders shows that the intensity of the polymorphic ring is weak, so they are poorly crystallized and partly amorphous.

Figure2shows the XRD pattern of all the samples. The XRD pattern showed diffractions [111], [220], and [311] at 2θ of 42.0, 36.0, and 52.0o, in which the first peak positioned at the low 2θ range, that was associated with the cubic crystal structure24,27. The XRD-expanding peak indicated the presence of small and poor crystalline phases with weak internal organization. The crystallization in the cubic structure took place in all samples, and the intensity of [111] diffraction increased, owing to the increase in crystallinity, in C5, C4, and C6 samples, respectively. Consequently, the lattice parameter decreased with increasing microwave radiation. This result was in good agreement with the water absorption of the C5 sample and was attributed to the excellent chemical compatibility and cohesion of hyaluronic acid and polyacrylic acid under determined microwave radiation.

Figure2depicts a notable decline in the intensity of the initial peak within the lower 2θ range, specifically in relation to the [111] diffraction pattern. This broadening effect of the diffraction is particularly pronounced in the C7, C8, and C9 samples. Furthermore, the intensity (Lin, counts) of the [220] and [311] diffraction patterns has substantially decreased in these aforementioned samples, ultimately resulting in their absence. It can be inferred that the absence of diffraction in these samples indicates the absence of crystalline structure. These data showed that there was no cubic crystal in these samples; in fact, this phase had disappeared with the increasing microwave radiation.

Other important factors about the morphology of the synthetic products are the effects of external driving forces, such as laser beam ablation. This technique has a strong influence on the sample ablating and etching processes. These conditions often resulted in samples with high porosity, a large active surface area, and multiple layers of the synthesized structure with different properties like stacking disorder44. To reach this purpose, often a laser beam seems to be considered an acceptable choice. This effect is attributed to dealing with different controllable factors such as frequency, amplitude, continuous wave (CW), and/or pulse nature of the irradiated laser source45. However, the determination of operating parameters for particle surface ablation is often based on a method of trial and error. It is often difficult to produce repeatable and desired carving with a laser46. Nevertheless, in spite of the widespread use of laser technologies, detailed information about the interactions between the laser wave and materials such as polymers is scarce. According to the research results, laser-material interaction is photo-thermal and photochemical in the IR and UV regions, respectively47.

In this experiment the nano-size dimension of the synthesized composite was attributed to (1) ball-milling the initial compounds before starting the reaction process to access up to receiving organic compounds granules with amorphous morphology at the nano size scale, (2) somewhat smart control the path of the growth of the matrix of the synthesized composite during the partial esterification process that played roles as the basal planes (3) formation of plenty of edge planes with active sites for the effective interception with water molecule during optical etching (optical) ablation with the CO2laser48and (4) formation of flexible one-dimensional (1-D) structure with high active surface area during irradiating with microwave and CO2electromagnetic sources as non-linear driving force. The representative TEM images of C5 and C9 composites before and after laser ablation are shown in Fig.3. During the synthesis of various types of nanocomposites, sample C5 exhibited 1-dimensional nanostructure morphology, as observed directly through TEM images. This observation was attributed to the non-linear property of the laser beam during the sequential change in the morphology of the components (matrix) of the synthesized nanocomposite49. Nevertheless, the effect of pulse laser was further evaluated via direct observation through the TEM system.

The other key point is that the amount of water absorbed at the beginning of absorption reflects the material’s immediate response to humidity and indicates its ability to quickly interact with water vapor (start of absorption). According to this issue, any product, whose absorption peak is higher indicates that, it has absorbed the most amount of water in the first moment53. Peak absorption (start of saturation) refers to the maximum amount of water absorbed by the material during the absorption process. It corresponds to the highest point in the water uptake curve. Whereas the samples start absorbing water from the beginning, and the samples that absorb the most water have the highest water absorption capacity and are the most suitable for cloud seeding. Results are shown in Fig.4; Table1.

H2O adsorption/absorption of all samples over time.

The relevance of samples to start absorbing and water absorption capacity.

The water content of the samples increased with the passing of time, up to a point where maximum absorption was reached. When the 1.0 g sample is exposed to water vapor (50.0 ± 0.3% RH), if it has the ability to rapidly absorb the maximum amount of water vapor, the process of droplet formation and growth will occur more quickly, resulting in a superior outcome. According to these results (Table1; Fig.4), Taking into account the time of water absorption, it was observed that sample C5 began absorbing water 13 s after exposure to saturated moisture, The absorption rate then increased exponentially, reaching its peak after 8 min 51 s. At this point, the absorption rate of sample C5 reached an impressive 98.55%, it was the best selection among all the products.

The C6 sample is also a good case after the C5 sample because it absorbs a large amount of moisture (81.28%) in 14 s. The C4 sample has started to absorb 86.58% of its moisture after 3 min 2 s, as a middle sample. The C7 sample began to absorb moisture after 25 s and absorbed the least amount, only 17.53%. Based on the results, more pulses and longer reaction times produced undesirable products, that are, the C8 and C9 samples. they began to absorb moisture after 12 min 51 s and 12 min 52 s, respectively. Additionally, these samples absorbed a relatively small amount of moisture, with the C8 sample absorbing 41.91% and the C9 sample absorbing 41.85%. These results indicate that these samples are incapable of effectively absorbing moisture. All the results pointed to the effectiveness of the sample C5 with its maximum water absorption properties compared to other types of the tested nanocomposites.

Adsorption isotherms of nitrogen were collected in the P/P0, relative pressure range of 0.05–0.30 in the porosity research, where P0is the saturation pressure at 77 K. Three factors (specific surface area, volume, and size of cavities) can be measured and listed in Table2.

Based on a variety of underlying concepts, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherms are used to calculate the rate of adsorption. The IUPAC recognized the first six types of adsorption isotherms: I, II, III, IV, V, and VI54. The behavior of the sorption isotherms for the C4 and C5 samples was very similar and is shown in Fig.5A, which is ascribed to the typical mixed II/IV type isotherms with largish H1 and H2 hysteresis loops due to the existence of macropores and mesopores structures, which show the uniformity of particle size distribution and the large number of pores55. Adsorption in isotherm II is associated with macroporous materials; at higher P/P0, gradually increasing quantities of multi-layered adsorption started after the pores filled. The presence of Type II characteristics in our samples (C4, C5, and C6) suggests that these materials possess a macroporous structure, enabling a higher uptake of water molecules at elevated humidity conditions, which is favorable for sustained moisture retention during cloud seeding. Also, Fig.5A shows that in isotherm IV, which is relevant to mesoporous materials, due to the N2uptake steadily increasing at a significantly higher P/P0. The efficiency of the reaction is improved, and the rapid penetration of water molecules from the external surface of the absorbent to the interior mesoporous is enabled by the presence of a sufficient amount of mesoporous structure in the cloud seeding process. In the context of cloud seeding, mesopores facilitate rapid water vapor condensation and droplet formation within the porous network, enhancing the initial absorption rate and accelerating cloud droplet nucleation. In Fig.5B, the C6 exhibits the typical mixed II/IV type isotherms with H1 and H2 hysteresis loops, but it has lower adsorption compared to the C4 and C5 samples. The C7 sorption isotherm, is attributed to the typical mixed IV/V isotherms with H2 and H3 hysteresis loops and a very wide distribution of pore size. Type V forms because lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules are stronger than interactions between the adsorbent surface and the adsorbate56. This is credited to the lower porosity and hydrophilicity of C7 compared to other samples. Figure5C shows the sorption isotherm of C8 and C9 samples. The C6 exhibits the typical mixed II/IV type isotherms, and the C9 exhibits the typical mixed IV/V type isotherms with H2 and H3 hysteresis loops and a diversity distribution size. These results imply that microwave and CO2laser radiation affect the pore structures of the samples. Their balanced combination of macroporous and mesoporous structures facilitates both rapid initial water absorption and efficient moisture retention essential features for effective cloud seeding performance. Therefore, based on these results, both the C4 sample and the C5 sample exhibited superior hygroscopic properties as compared to other products. In contrast, Type V isotherms are less common and are typically observed in materials with weak adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. The occurrence of Type V behavior (e.g., in sample C7 and C9) indicates the presence of a wide distribution of pore sizes and weaker hydrophilic properties. This can lead to lower water uptake capacity compared to samples with Type II/IV characteristics. Theses samples demonstrated reduced hydrophilicity and lower water uptake, making them less favorable for such applications.

The specific surface area calculated for samples from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms according to the BET method is given in Table2. Based on the difference in mean pore diameter, all samples were classified as meso or macroporous. Based on the results, the shape of the adsorption isotherm of the C5 and C4 samples shows hydrophilic behavior and higher water uptake than the parent sample, with rapid saturation at lower partial pressures. On the other hand, changes in the shape of the isotherms of the other samples are probably due to the reduction in relative crystallinity and the increasing contribution of an amorphous phase. Given that molecules of N2are unable to penetrate the entire existing pore space when compared to molecules of H2O, the obtained BETN2values indicate only the surface pores that are accessible to this adsorbent57.

Thermal gravimetric analysis was used to determine the swelling behavior and amount of absorb water of the samples using thermal studies. The TGA of the different samples has been shown in Fig.6. In general, C4, C5, and C6 samples have shown a similar trend of weight loss with increasing temperature. A similar trend was also observed in the C7, C8, and C9 samples. Figure6A as clearly shown, the TGA profile (thermogram) has three weight losses for samples C4, C5, and C6, while it has two weight losses for samples C7, C8, and C9 (see in Fig.6B). Increasing the moisture content in each sample could be done by determining the weight loss, as can be seen in Table3. The loss of adsorbed water, as indicated by the thermo-gravimetric curve, resulted in a significant decrease in the mass of the samples. These samples contained two distinct types of water: loosely bonded water and chemically bonded water. These water molecules can be trapped within the compositional structure due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups, such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, in both polymers58. As depicted in Fig.6A, the first degradation step occurred at around 100 °C, which corresponded to the evaporation of absorbed water from the samples. Additionally, a second decrease was observed at approximately 150 °C, which was attributed to the release of chemically bonded water. It can be inferred that the water molecules in these samples are absorbed in two distinct states, and the two observed peaks correspond to the evaporation of these two types of absorbed water. These materials not only rapidly absorb water from the environment (loosely bonded water) but also retain water more effectively through chemical interactions (chemically bonded water). This dual absorption mechanism is highly favorable for cloud seeding since it ensures both rapid initial moisture uptake and prolonged water retention within the particles, facilitating sustained droplet growth in the atmosphere. In Fig.6B, one peak can be observed around 125 °C, indicating the apparent overlap of two different processes where both types of water are lost, resulting in the observed peak.

The other change in slope of TGA curves was displayed around 200oC in both figures for all samples, due to the decomposition of the organic layers that was started at this temperature. It can be observed that a major weight-loss stage appears in the temperature range of about 200oC, this is associated with the destructive thermal decomposition of all of the samples and is in fact attributed to the decomposition of covalently bonded organic groups. The process is completed at 300oC and shows that the thermal stability is below 200oC. In addition, according to the results shown in Table3, greater water absorption was observed in the C4, C5, and C6 samples. However, since cloud seeding operates at ambient or low atmospheric temperatures, the thermal decomposition stage is less relevant for their practical application. Instead, the key differentiating factor for cloud seeding performance lies in the distinct water loss stages samples with clearly separated peaks (C4, C5, C6) demonstrate superior hygroscopic behavior and moisture retention capacity, making them more effective candidates for cloud seeding purposes.

The difference in the absorption of left and right circularly polarized light by any optically active chiral compounds is actually measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). For the investigation of secondary structures, CD spectroscopy is important. Consequently, the various structural components result in a unique CD spectrum59. The effect of the microwave irradiation as well as the laser conditions were evaluated and compared for the synthesis of the nanocomposite. As shown in Fig.7A andB, the CD analysis was evaluated and analyzed with a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder at two different cool (from − 15 to −17oC) and warm (from 5 to 8oC) conditions via controlling the temperature of each tested sample. Based on the results significant change was observed on the sensitivity as well as the degree of the CD phenomenon when testing the samples at two different temperatures under other similar conditions at wavelength around 600 nm. This wavelength was attributed to the n-π* of the C = O and -O-H functional groups during the ester formation60, which pointed to the structural changes in the morphology of the synthesized nanocomposites as the "Secondary Structure" after irradiated and activated with microwave and laser beams. In addition, the sensitivity (peak height/area of the peak) majorly pointed to the reliability of the C5 sample that showed the flexible structure with maximum water adsorption/absorption and cloud seeding properties. Consequently, the recommended procedure strongly showed the influence of ester functional group as at least one of the most important active sites for playing role as a suitable cloud seeding compound.

The effect of the laser pulse as well as the time interval of the microwave irradiations was also considered another important factor for controlling the secondary structure of the synthesized nanocomposite (Fig.7C). However, more precise optimization and structural evaluation are recommended before large scale synthesis of this nanocomposite for cloud-seeding purpose, it is deducted that this experiment shows new horizons for focusing on new, natural and safe compounds for global controlling the atmospheric manipulations, artificially.

Nanocomposite materials were chosen for their excellent physicochemical properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-toxicity. They were synthesized quickly and cost-effectively using a simple, solvent-free, microwave-assisted method. XRD analysis indicated that increasing microwave time reduced composite crystallinity, resulting in a compact structure. Samples C4, C5, and C6 exhibited beneficial pseudo-stacking disorder. HR-TEM was utilized to examine particle size and laser-activated sites. Based on the analysis, the C5 sample showed a possible mechanism for ice nucleation due to pseudo-stacking disorder resembling bulk ice structure. The material’s reliability was evaluated by testing the symmetrized nanocomposite inside a cloud seeding chamber. The nanocomposite demonstrated the ability to access ice cloud seeding particles as large as 1.18 (± 0.11) × 1014particles per gram within a 45-minute time interval. Under specific conditions (temperature: −14 to −16oC, Relative humidity: > 90%), the composite exhibited combined hygroscopic and glaciogenic behavior, making it an effective cloud seeding product.
