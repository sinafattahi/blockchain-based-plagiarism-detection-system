Undesired scalar and dipolar couplings are two major
interactions
that complicate structural and dynamic studies in solution nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Recent developments in site-specific
isotopic labeling technologies have gone a long way toward alleviating
these problems. While some nuclei have intrinsic properties that make
them suitable for specific NMR experiments, these same properties
render them inefficient in other experiments. Site-specific isotopic
labeling facilitates the controlled incorporation of isotopes to enable
facile analysis of RNAs. Here, we describe the synthesis and incorporation
of [1′-13C, 2-19F, 7-15N]
adenosine 5′-triphosphate into the 9 kDa rRNA, thus expanding the applications of previously
synthesized [2-13C, 7-15N]-adenosine 5′-triphosphate,
with the added benefit of19F incorporation. We utilized
these13C and15N probes to characterize the
structural dynamic features within this RNA, and19F was
used to monitor binding interactions. Finally, we leveraged the chemical
shielding anisotropy-dominated relaxation of15N7-adenosine
for straightforward analysis ofR1andR1ρrates.

Among the several biophysical techniques
for the structural determination
of RNAs, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy remains an
attractive tool, as it provides structural information at the atomic
level.−Nonetheless, some inherent problems are associated with NMR. These
include line broadening, signal overlap, and spectral overcrowding
as molecular weight increases.−To limit these problems, spectroscopists
have developed several stable isotope labeling technologies (e.g.,2H,13C,15N, and19F).−They choose the isotope to probe by NMR spectroscopy based on practical
and efficiency considerations. For example, the low gyromagnetic ratio
of15N nucleus translates into relatively sharper lines
at high molecular weights.,But again, the low
gyromagnetic ratio makes15N less sensitive to external
magnetic fields, resulting in weaker NMR signals. In contrast,19F not only has a high gyromagnetic
ratio that makes it very sensitive to such fields but also a high chemical shift dispersion (at least six
times that of1H) that potentially mitigates spectral crowding. Nonetheless, the large chemical shielding anisotropy
(CSA) of19F leads to extensive line broadening in19F NMR at high molecular weights and high magnetic field strengths. This is a significant limitation to the use
of19F NMR for studying larger biomolecules. Conversely,
the very narrow line widths of the15N nucleus make it
an attractive candidate for use in large RNAs, regardless of its inherently
low sensitivity. In addition to15N and19F,13C has a gyromagnetic ratio 1/4th that of1H, also translating to sharp lines, albeit broader
than15N. Nonetheless, the line width of13C
in the ribose ring is relatively sharper due to its small CSA values.
This makes ribose13C desirable for experiments that require
relatively high magnetic field strengths. Given that some of the limitations
of15N,13C, and19F are offset by
each other, consolidating the properties of all three into a single
probe would likely enhance its overall utility in studying RNAs by
NMR spectroscopy.

For instance, we recently incorporated15N and13C into the same nucleotide. We synthesized
and incorporated
[2-13C, 7-15N]-adenosine 5′-triphosphate
into ∼20 kDa human hepatitis B ε RNA viral element. With1H–15N heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments, we obtained well-resolved peaks, with all expected signals accounted
for. We further characterized this RNA with15N-edited
NOESY HSQC and13C spin-relaxation
experiments.,,In
another previous work, researchers have shown that the substitution
of adenosine-H2 with19F does not significantly perturb
RNA’s physical or structural properties. It is unclear if we can ascribe this observation to two
opposing effects: Is19F’s ability to destabilize
Watson–Crick base pairing counteracted by its stable base π-stacking?,Another noteworthy observation is that because19F polarizes
uridine nucleotides, researchers can readily identify different RNA
secondary structural motifs. A similar
observation was documented by Sochor et al. Imino protons of uridines involved in canonical Watson–Crick
base pairing to 2-fluoroadenosine showed significant chemical shift
perturbations (CSPs) from the regular A-U base pair. Additionally,
the presence of fluorine at the H2 position makes it very sensitive
to its chemical environment.,With such a dual13C–19F label, Kreutz and co-workers characterized
RNA-small molecule interactions and detected low-populated dynamic
processes in RNA on the microsecond time scale, otherwise invisible
in a1H spectrum, and different RNA secondary structural
motifs.

In this work, we therefore
extend those dual labels to a triple15N–13C-19F site-specific label.
This site-specific triple label exploits the favorable spectroscopic
properties of19F and thus may enhance its versatility.
We synthesized and applied [1′-13C, 2-19F, 7-15N] adenosine 5′-triphosphate to a 9 kDa rRNA. This new isotopic labeling pattern
enables us to qualitatively tease out the effects of19F substitution on nuclei even up to five bonds away and analyze the
structural dynamics and interactions of RNA with ligands.

The chemical shielding tensors
(CST) for1H8-15N7 and H1′–C1′
spin pairs were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) methods,
as described in previous work (Tables S1 and S2).−Using these CST parameters, we computed theR2relaxation rates usingeqsand  for the1H8–15N7 and1H1–13C1′ spin
pair in A (FigureA) assuming isotropic tumbling. We assumed
an isolated N7–H8 and H1′–C1′ spin pair,
where dipolar contributions from neighboring nuclei were ignored.
For bond distances between H8–N7 and H1′–C1′
in A, we used 2.1 and 1.1 Å, respectively, based on the helical
region of the PDB structure 6VAR, the human hepatitis B encapsidation
signal ε RNA. We repeated these
calculations using SPINACH software to consider every significant
relaxation, cross-relaxation, and cross-correlation process in a rigid
system with two spin-1/2 nuclei.

A detailed description of the synthesis
of [2-13C, 7-15N]-adenine and [7-15N]-guanine was described previously.,Commercially
available reagents were used for the syntheses of the nucleobases
without further purification. Isotopically labeled [15N]-sodium
nitrite was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

[1-13C]-ribose was purchased from
Omicron Biochemicals (IN). The enzymes used in the one-pot coupling
reaction of [1-13C]-ribose to an isotopically labeled nucleobase
were ribokinase (RK), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPPS),
and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT). These enzymes were
purified and expressed by methods we have previously described.,−Thermostable pyrophosphatase was purchased from New
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Bovine serum albumin, creatine kinase
(CK), and myokinase (MK) were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific
(Waltham, MA). A boronate column with Affi-Gel Boronate Gel (BioRad)
was used in the purification of isotopically labeled nucleoside triphosphates.

The DNA template used for transcription
is 5′-mGmGC GAC TTC ACC CGA AGG TGT GAC G C CTA TAG TGA GTC
GTA TTA G-3′. The T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was 5′-CTA
TAG TGA GTC GTA TTA G-3′. DNA template was purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT) (Coralville, IA). 10 mLin vitrotranscription reaction was carried out at 37 °C using a transcription
buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM spermidine and 0.01% Triton
X-100), 0.3 μM single strand DNA template, 80 mg/mL PEG, 1 mM
DTT, 2 U/μL thermostable inorganic pyrophosphatase, 10 mg/mL
T7 RNA polymerase, a total of 10 mM rNTPs (2.5 mM each of unlabeled
GTP, CTP, UTP, and either18or19), and
10 mM MgCl2. The concentrations of rNTPs and MgCl2were chosen following optimization in small (50 μL) reactions.
After 3 h, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA
(pH 8). 10 mL of phenol–chloroform was added to the aqueous
transcription reaction. The suspension was spun in a centrifuge at
10,500 rpm for 15 min. Upon completion, the aqueous RNA layer (top
layer) was collected into a clean falcon tube with a pipet, followed
by the addition of 1 mL of 3 M NaOAc and 30 mL of ice-chilled absolute
ethanol. This solution was left in the refrigerator overnight at −20
°C. The solid precipitate formed was isolated from the solution
by centrifugation at 10,500 rpm for 1 h. The aqueous solution was
decanted, leaving behind a white solid crude RNA residue that was
resuspended in a 1× TBE buffer. The crude RNA solution was purified
via preparative polyacrylamide (10%) denaturing gel electrophoresis,
followed by extraction of RNA from the gel using the crush and soak
method. The collected RNA was exchanged
with deionized water and lyophilized. The RNA pellets were dissolved
in 270 μL of D2O and 30 μL of 10× NMR
buffer (200 mM Na3PO4pH 6.5, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM
DTT, 2 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.27 mM NaN3, 0.1 mM DSS). The RNA
solutions were heated to 95 °C for about 3 min and rapidly cooled
on ice for 5 min. Concentrations of RNA were calculated using a molar
absorption coefficient for the rRNA of 281 mM–1cm–1. The concentrations
of the purified unbound rRNA
samples were ≈0.6 mM. The concentrations of the purified paromomycin-bound rRNA samples were 0.3 mM.

All NMR experiments were conducted
at 14.4 T (600 MHz1H frequency) on a Bruker Avance III
HD spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance shielded z-gradient
probe. Two-dimensional two-bond (2JH8N9)1H–15N HSQC data for fluorinated
and nonfluorinated RNAs were collected in D2O at 277 and
298 K. Two-dimensional one-bond (1JH1′C1)1H–13C HSQC data
for fluorinated and nonfluorinated RNAs were collected in D2O at 277 and 298 K.13CR1ρrelaxation data on fluorinated rRNA were collected in D2O at 298 K using standard Bruker
pulse programs. For the13CR1ρexperiment, relaxation delays of 0.004 (x2), 0.016, 0.02, 0,024,
0.036, and 0.064 s were used.15NR1andR1ρrelaxation data
on fluorinated rRNA were also
collected in D2O at 298 K using standard Bruker pulse programs. For the15NR1experiment, relaxation delays of 0.02 (x2), 0.04, 0.06, 0.08,
0.12, 0.16, 0.2, 0.24, and 0.3 s were used. For the15NR1ρexperiment, relaxation delays of 0.004
(x2), 0.016, 0.02, 0.024, 0.036, and 0.064 s were used.15NR1ρrelaxation data on nonfluorinated rRNA were also collected in D2O at 298 K using standard Bruker pulse programs. Relaxation delays of 0.004 (x2), 0.016, 0.02, 0.024, 0.036,
and 0.064 s were used. Spin-lock strength of 1.9 kHz was applied for
allR1ρmeasurements. Two-dimensional
(2D)1H–1H NOESY was conducted on the
fluorinated RNA with 300 ms mixing time, 64 scans, and 2048 ×
1024 complex data points in the1H dimensions at 298 K.
2D imino1H–1H NOESY was conducted on
both fluorinated and nonfluorinated RNAs with 250 ms mixing time,
64 scans, and 2048 × 400 complex data points in the1H dimensions at 283 K. 2D13C- and15N-edited
NOESY HSQC data were collected on the fluorinated RNA with a 250 ms
mixing time at 298 K. 2D15N-edited NOESY HSQC experiment
was carried out with 40 scans per increment with spectral widths of
14 ppm (2048 complex data points) in the direct1H-dimension
and 14 ppm (200 complex data points) in the indirect1H-dimension.13C-edited NOESY HSQC experiment was carried out with 64 scans
per increment with spectral widths of 14 ppm (2048 complex data points)
in the direct1H-dimension and 14 ppm (200 complex data
points) in the indirect1H-dimension.1H–1H TOCSY was collected for the fluorinated RNA with a mixing
time of 120 ms at 298 K. This experiment was carried out with 128
scans per increment with spectral widths of 12 ppm (2048 complex data
points) in the direct1H-dimension and 10 ppm (234 complex
data points) in the indirect1H-dimension. 2D13C-edited TOCSY HSQC experiment was performed with 64 scans per increment,
with spectral widths of 16 ppm (2048 complex data points) in the direct1H-dimension and 16 ppm (200 complex data points) in the indirect1H-dimension. All NMR data were processed and analyzed by Bruker
Topspin Software version 4.1.4.

1 μM solutions of18and19-labeled RNA were prepared in a buffer
containing 15 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.4), 25 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM
EDTA (pH 8), such that their absorbances were between 0.1 and 1. Samples
were then transferred into clean cuvettes and placed in a ultraviolet
(UV) spectrophotometer with the temperature change set at 1 °C
per minute. The temperature range was set from 4 to 95 °C. The
absorbances were recorded as a function of varying temperature. The
melting curves were fit by using the Marquardt nonlinear least-squares
method. Melting point and thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG298Kwere extracted using the van’t Hoff
expression and nonlinear curve fitting previously described for unimolecular
hairpin formation by Luteran et al. and
Siegfried and Bevilacqua. The heat-up
(4 to 95 °C) and cool-down (95 to 4 °C) absorbances were
used as duplicates for data analysis.

Mass spectrometry was conducted using
a JEOL AccuTOF-CS electrospray instrument (ESI) with positive mode
ionization for nucleobase and negative mode ionization for nucleoside
5′-triphosphate.

The synthesis
of the atom-specifically labeled [2-19F, 7-15N] adenine probe was carried out in 10 chemical steps, starting with
the sodium ethoxide (C2H5ONa)-mediated cyclization
of guanidine1and ethylcyanoacetate2to
yield diaminopyrimidinone 3 (Scheme). Nitrosylation of3with commercially
available15N-sodium nitrite (Na15NO2) then installed15N at the 5-position to afford compound4.

The nitroso group in4was reduced
by sodium dithionite
(Na2S2O4) to form triaminopyrimidinone5, which was then cyclized by reacting with formamide (CH3NO) and formic acid (CH3COOH) to provide guanine6. Chlorination of6was achieved using the Vilsmeier–Haack
reaction to yield intermediate7followed by subsequent
reactions with CH3COOH and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to yield8and9. The chloro group in9was
converted to an azido group by the addition of sodium azide (NaN3) to afford10. In the second-to-last step, a
diazotization reaction with tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4) provided fluorinated11. Finally, the azido group
in11was reduced by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to yield the desired [7-15N]-2-fluoroadenine12. Taken together, our synthetic route provided12in
10 chemical steps with an overall yield of 5% (cf 12% for previously
synthesized phosphoramidites and 5% nonhydrolyzable 2FATP) and without the need for chromatographic purification
(Scheme).

We
then adapted our established one-pot enzymatic reaction,,,,to couple the newly synthesized [7-15N]-2-fluoroadenine12with [1-13C]-d-ribose followed by subsequent phosphorylation to the corresponding
adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) (Scheme). In brief, ribokinase (RK, E.C. 2.7.1.15)
phosphorylates [1-13C]-d-ribose13at its position O5 to yield14. Then, phosphoribosyl
pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPPS, E.C. 2.7.6.1) pyrophosphorylates14at its O1′ site to form 5-phospho-d-ribosyl-α-1-pyrophosphate15. Adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT, E.C. 2.4.2.7)
then facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the C1′ position
of15by N9 of12to afford the 5′-monophosphate16. Finally, myokinase (MK, E.C. 2.7.4.3) phosphorylates16to yield 5′-diphosphate17, which is
phosphorylated a final time by creatine kinase (CK, E.C. 2.7.3.2)
to form the desired [1′-13C, 2-19F, 7-15N] ATP18in 95% yield (Scheme). The characterization of compounds9,10,11,12, and18is shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S11).

We
synthesized building block18for NMR analysis of RNA.
To this end, we used our atom-specifically labeled18along with unlabeled guanosine (G), cytidine (C), and uridine (U)
5′-triphosphates to make a 27-nucleotide (nt) fluorinated RNA
construct by DNA-templated RNA polymerase-based in vitro transcription
(FigureA). This RNA
is derived from the aminoacyl site of the rRNA in and is therefore critical for protein synthesis
and bacterial survival. We will refer
to this RNA as the A-site throughout the text. A one-dimensional (1D)19F NMR spectrum of18-labeled RNA showed all
four fluorine signals corresponding to each of the modified adenosine
nucleotides although two peaks downfield overlap with each other (FigureB). As a control
(FigureA), we made
a nonfluorinated (i.e., unmodified) RNA construct with our recently
reported [2-13C, 7-15N]-adenosine into [1′,2-13C2, 7-15N]-ATP19.

(G)18-labeled A-site RNA. Asterisks (*) indicate proton
signal with the largest chemical shift perturbation between18- and19-labeled A-site RNA as confirmed by
imino–imino NOE contacts in F and G.

The H2 position in purines is sensitive to changes
in chemical
environment such as drug binding due to its direct involvement in
π-stacking interactions in an RNA. Given that fluorine is also
extremely sensitive to changes in its environment owing to the uneven
distribution of electrons in its valence p-orbitals, the substitution
of1H with19F at the 2-position should be an
effective probe to validate binding of cognate ligands. Not surprisingly,
we observed significant chemical shift perturbations in the19F NMR spectrum upon addition of the well-characterized bulge-binding
A-site ligand paromomycin (PAR) to18-labeled RNA (FigureB).

Optical
melting experiments with these two RNAs confirmed that19F labeling did not significantly perturb A-site thermal stability
or folding thermodynamics (FigureC), in agreement with previous reports. Optical melting experiments provided overall
thermodynamics comparison between the fluorinated and nonfluorinated
RNAs. To ascertain local site-specific differences between both RNAs,
we monitored changes in the H-bonded imino proton signals upon fluorination
of the RNA. The imino proton of U18 (U18 H3), which is base-paired
to A9 within the regular A-helix, appeared to be more shielded in
the fluorinated RNA (FigureD,E). This is likely due to the electrostatic
repulsions between the fluorine atom of fluorinated adenosine (F2)
and oxygen (O2) of uridine. This observation agrees with previous
reports on HIV TAR RNA. While we observed
more imino1H signals in the fluorinated RNA, the NMR imino
melt experiment revealed no differences in the melting profiles for
both fluorinated and nonfluorinated RNAs (Figure S12).

Upon titration of PAR, both RNA constructs undergo
CSPs (FigureD,E), indicating that the fluorinated RNA retained
the binding
properties of the nonfluorinated RNA (FigureB). Again, both RNA samples had nearly similar
imino–imino proton NOE contacts (FigureF,G). For example, even though U18 H3 was
more shielded in the fluorinated RNA, the pattern of its NOE cross
peak with the preceding G17 H1 was comparable to that of the nonfluorinated
RNA (FigureF,G).

As a second application, we implemented
two-dimensional (2D) HSQC
experiments using one (1JH1′C1′)- and two (2JH8N7)-bond couplings
for coherence transfer in both fluorinated (i.e.,18-labeled)
and nonfluorinated (i.e.,19-labeled) RNA. As expected,
all four H8–N7 (FigureA) and H1′–C1′ (FigureB) resonances were observed. In the1H–15N experiment, fluorine incorporation
deshielded the15N–N7 atoms but shielded the1H atoms (FigureA). Nucleotides A20 and A21 exhibited the largest CSPs between the
fluorinated and nonfluorinated RNAs in both15N and13C HQSCs (FigureC,D).

Carbon and Nitrogen NMR parameters of
fluorinated and nonfluorinated
RNA. (A) 2D1H–15N HSQC experiments using
the two-bond (2JH8N7) coupling
for coherence transfer (inset) to show all H8–N7 resonances.
(B) 2D1H–13C HSQC experiments using
the one-bond (1JH1′C1′) coupling for coherence transfer (inset) to show all four H1′–C1′
resonances. Both HSQC experiments were conducted at 298 K. Chemical
shift differences were calculated as Δδ =(ΔδH)2+(αΔδN/C)2between18- and19-labeled RNAs in (C)1H–15N and (D)1H–13C HSQCs, where ΔδHand ΔδN/Care the changes in proton and nitrogen/carbon
chemical shifts, respectively, and α is the ratio of the gyromagnetic
ratio between nitrogen/carbon and proton. All NMR spectra are annotated
with resonance assignments.

To qualitatively assess the effect of fluorine
on the spectroscopic
properties of nearby nuclei in more detail, we repeated our HSQC experiments
after titration with PAR and at a reduced temperature. Any19F-induced effect on relaxation will be amplified when bound to PAR
or at lower temperatures. Indeed, titration with PAR resulted in the
disappearance of two H8–N7 resonances in the nonfluorinated
RNA spectrum (FigureA) while only a single signal was lost in the fluorinated construct
(FigureB). In the
case of H1′–C1′ resonances, only one nonfluorinated
RNA signal was lost upon PAR titration (FigureC), while the fluorinated RNA retained all
four resonances (FigureD). However, in all cases, we observed attenuation of the signal
intensity of A20 or the complete disappearance of its signal. This
agrees with previous reports that have shown nucleotide A20 to be
a dynamic hotspot for aminoglycoside binding. At a lower temperature of 10 °C, only one WT H8–N7 resonance
disappeared (Figure S13A), while all four
signals were retained in the fluorinated construct (Figure S13B). The H1′–C1′ resonances,
on the other hand, were mostly unaffected (Figure S13C,D).

Ligand titrations in fluorinated and nonfluorinated RNA.
2D1H–15N HSQC experiments with PAR titrated

A-site. 2D1H–13C HSQC experiments with
PAR titrated against (C)19-labeled and (D)18-labeled A-site. All HSQC experiments were conducted at 298 K. All
NMR spectra are annotated with resonance assignments.

We also performed a 2D1H–1H total
correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiment to reveal all uridine and cytidine H5/H6 cross peaks. Given our
previous findings that fluorination of adenosine at the 2-position
alters the chemical environment of H8–N7 and H1′–C1′
resonances, we hypothesized that fluorine may perturb additional nearby
resonances relative to the unfluorinated RNA. Given that all adenosine
nucleotides are in or near the bulge, any19F-induced chemical
shift perturbations (CSPs) would likely affect uridine and cytidine
nucleotides that are near this structural motif. Indeed, comparison
of fluorinated and nonfluorinated spectra shows CSPs for H5/H6 nuclei
in bulge nucleotides C6 and C8, as well as the adjacent but overlapping
U5/C10/U23 (FigureA). However, CSPs were also observed for nucleotides C10–U12
that extend into the top of the upper helix and into the tetraloop.

TOCSY
experiments in fluorinated and nonfluorinated RNA. (A) 2D1H–1H TOCSY experiments in the18-labeled
and19-labeled A-site. (B) 2D1H–1H TOCSY experiments with PAR titrated against the19-labeled A-site. (C) 2D1H–1H TOCSY
experiments with PAR titrated against the18-labeled
A-site. All TOCSY experiments were conducted at 298 K. All NMR spectra
are annotated with resonance assignments. CSPs mapped onto the secondary
structure of the 27-nt A-site RNA are shown to the right of each respective
spectrum.

To further explore this observation that19F-induced
CSPs localize mainly to bulge nucleotides, we titrated PAR against
WT RNA. Again, paromomycin binds to the A-rich bulge region of the
nonfluorinated rRNA. Here, we observed a set of CSPs similar to those
of bulge nucleotides C6, C8, and U5/C10/U23 (FigureB). As before, CSPs to upper helix nucleotides
C10 and C11 were also observed, as were CSPs to lower helix nucleotides
C3, C24, and C26 (FigureB). As with the WT RNA, a very similar set of CSPs was observed
for the fluorinated RNA upon titration of PAR (FigureC). Taken together, these data establish
a set of shared19F- and PAR-induced CSPs that correspond
to H5/H6 nuclei from uridines and cytidines in and around the bulge
region (Figure).
Given that only adenosines were fluorinated (18-labeled
RNA), we expected the most significant CSPs for nucleotides near adenosines.
Similarly, the binding pocket for PAR in the nonfluorinated RNA (19-labeled RNA) is the A-rich bulge. Hence, we also expected major CSPs upon PAR binding to be localized
to the nucleotides near adenosines.

Peak patterns observed in both1H–13C and1H–15N HSQCs (FigureA,B) were offset but identical
for both RNA constructs (i.e.,18-labeled and19-labeled RNAs). Hence, we performed a series of experiments to assess
our preliminary assignments for the fluorinated RNA, which was solely
based on the peak patterns for the WT RNA.

We performed a1H–1H NOESY experiment on the fluorinated
RNA to obtain intranucleotide adenosine H8–H1′ correlations
(FigureA). However,
given severe signal overlap among aromatic, ribose, and H5 of pyrimidine
hydrogen atoms, we employed a series of13C- and15N-edited experiments to simplify data analysis.15N7-edited
NOESY provides both intranucleotide H8–H1′ cross peaks
and internucleotide cross peaks between H8 and neighboring protons
in the 3′ to 5′ direction. Similarly,13C1′
edited NOESY produces intranucleotide H1′–H8 cross peaks
and internucleotide cross peaks between H1′ and neighboring
aromatic protons in the 5′ to 3′ direction. A set of
shared cross peaks between both13C1′- and15N7-edited NOESY experiments unambiguously represents intranucleotide
H1′–H8 correlation (Figure S14). In addition,13C1′- and15N7-edited
NOESY experiments are complementary techniques in that they permit
analysis of internucleotide correlations in either 5′ to 3′
or 3′ to 5′ directions, respectively.

showing H1′–H2′ correlations within adenosines

were conducted at 298 K.

First, we performed both13C1′-
and15N7-edited NOESY HSQC experiments that enabled facile
correlation
of13C1′ to their corresponding intranucleotide15N7 between their shared proton resonances, even in the absence
of chemical shift assignments (Figure S15). These correlations (Figure S15) corroborate
our preliminary assignments for the fluorinated RNA (FigureA,B). Furthermore, we observed
the expected set of shared cross peaks between15N7- and13C1′-edited NOESY experiments (highlighted by the magenta
asterisks*), indicating intranucleotide H1′–H8 correlations
within the adenosines (FigureB,C). Additionally, we observed internucleotide cross peaks
in both15N7- and13C1′-edited NOESY
experiments (FigureB,C).

Given the anticipated flexibility of the bulge, we used our newly
synthesized probe18to monitor the RNA dynamics. Such
RNA motions at different time scales are implicated in its various
cellular processes such as ligand sensing and signaling, viral genome
packaging, and catalysis. Longitudinal
(R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates measure the rates at which magnetization
decays along the longitudinal and transverse planes, respectively. In addition,R2is
directly proportional to the line width of an NMR signal and the spin-relaxation
rate in a rotating frame (R1ρ).

The1H8–15N7 spin pair is isolated
from other active nuclei in our site-specific label, making it an
attractive system to probe. Our simulations for an RNA with a correlation
time of 5 ns at 600 MHz showed that an isolated1H1′–13C1′ spin pair exhibits ∼2-fold broader line
widths for13C1′ nuclei compared with15N7 nuclei in an isolated1H8–15N7 spin
pair (FigureA). In agreement with our simulations, the
average experimental15N line width was ∼2×
narrower than13C (FigureB). Additionally, we observed attenuatedR1ρvalues for A21 and A20 in both13C
and15NR1ρexperiments,
indicating increased internal motions within both nucleotides. We
observed the same trends forR1ρin both the15N7 and13C1′ relaxation
rates (FigureB).
The measured13C1′R1ρvalues were identical for corresponding adenosines in the fluorinated
and nonfluorinated RNAs (FigureB), except for A21.

Interestingly, there was no significant difference
between measuredR1values (FigureC). LikeR2, the attenuatedR2/R1ratios indicate
fast local motions, with the added benefit of removing variations
in local CSAs and dipolar interactions. Again, both A20 and A21 had
the smallest R2/R1values,
indicating fast motions within those nucleotides (FigureD).

1H NMR is routinely used for
structural studies due
to its high sensitivity to magnetic fields. However, the use of1H NMR in biomolecular systems is limited owing to low chemical
shift dispersion and line broadening.19F, on the other
hand, has better chemical shift dispersion in addition to its high
sensitivity. Unfortunately, the high CSA of19F also limits
its application in larger biomolecules at high magnetic fields due
to large line broadening. Conversely,13C and15N have lower gyromagnetic ratios, which render them less sensitive
to external magnetic fields, yet possess sharper NMR line widths.
A chemical probe that can establish a “middle ground”
by leveraging the benefits of all three nuclei shows promise to be
versatile for studying both small and large RNAs.

First, we
demonstrated in a series of NMR experiments that the
incorporation of19F into RNA is not completely innocuous.
While we do not observe significant changes in thermodynamic properties
between18- and19-labeled RNA, we observe
these changes in the magnetic properties of nuclei proximal and distal
to the site of fluorination. Furthermore, these changes are not limited
to the fluorinated nucleotide but are also seen in neighboring nuclei,
as evidenced by the1H–1H TOCSY experiment.
Additionally,19F can simplify an otherwise highly overlapped
spectrum. Consequently, we showcase the ability of19F
to detect the binding of cognate ligands to RNA by monitoring the
CSPs. It is worth noting that the application of19F is
not limited to only small RNAs, as recent studies have shown that
installing13C–19F pairs in RNA nucleobases
reduces the directly attached13C line width by a factor
of 2–5, allowing its application to large RNAs.,A suite of elegant experiments has also been designed using19F as a probe to measure various protein dynamics properties
that can be implemented in RNA studies.

Second, we demonstrated the application of the site-specific
label
to simplify an otherwise overlapped1H–1H NOESY spectrum. We observed all adenosine intranucleotide H8–H1′
cross peaks in both13C- and15N-edited NOESY
experiments that were subsequently used to confirm preliminary chemical
shift assignments. In addition, we observed TOCSY cross peaks for
H1′- H2′ correlations in the13C-edited TOCSY
HSQC experiment. The presence/absence of these correlations provides
structural information about the ribose sugar pucker. Taken together,
our labeling scheme enables complementary probing of structural features
within the RNA in the 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′
direction.

Finally, we performed spin-relaxation experiments
on the18-labeled RNA. We obtained ∼2-fold sharper
lines for15N7 compared with13C1′ from
our simulations
for an RNA tumbling at 5 ns at a magnetic field strength of 600 MHz.
Our experimental results corroborated this prediction, where we measured
∼2-fold increase in the average line widths of13C1′ compared with15N7, under the same experimental
conditions. We also show that there is no significant difference in
the transverse relaxation rates for the fluorinated and nonfluorinated
RNAs, except for nucleotide A21.

Taken together, we have demonstrated
the utility of the novel triple
labeling pattern to obtain invaluable structural and dynamics information
on a 27-mer RNA. Our data also suggest that there may be a link between
chemical shift changes induced by19F incorporation and
nucleotide flexibility for the RNA system we investigated. While we
did not fully leverage the capability of19F in this study,
we intend to do so by enriching the C2 position with13C, as reported recently. This, in turn,
should produce very sharp lines in13C as the two relaxation
mechanisms of dipole–dipole relaxation and chemical shielding
anisotropy almost cancel out.
