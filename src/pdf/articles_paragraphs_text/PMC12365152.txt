High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been associated with prognosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, but data on its role in elderly individuals remains limited. This single-center, retrospective study included 590 elderly AMI patients, who were stratified into three groups based on hs-CRP tertiles. The incidence of adverse in-hospital events increased progressively across higher hs-CRP tertiles (17.2%, 25.5%, and 48%, P<0.001). Notably, patients who experienced these events had significantly higher hs-CRP levels compared to those without adverse outcomes (7.04 [2.38, 20.00] vs. 2.59 [1.06, 6.07], P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified hs-CRP as an independent predictor of in-hospital outcomes in elderly AMI patients (Q3: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.23–3.97, P=0.008). The area under the curve (AUC) for hs-CRP’s predictive accuracy was 0.712 (95% CI 0.664–0.755, P<0.001). Furthermore, integrating hs-CRP into an established risk factor model significantly improved both reclassification and discrimination (Continuous NRI: 0.461, 95% CI 0.292-0.631, P<0.001; IDI: 0.046, 95% CI 0.025-0.067, P<0.001), although it did not substantially enhance the C-statistic (0.867 (95% CI 0.831-0.895, P<0.001) vs. 0.876 (95% CI 0.841-0.905, P<0.001) , P=0.183). These findings suggest that hs-CRP is a reliable and practical biomarker for predicting poor prognosis in elderly patients with AMI.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, progresses rapidly with high mortality risks. As the most severe coronary event, it maintains elevated fatality rates despite advances in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques, the proliferation of advanced mechanical equipment and medical strategies1. Multiple interacting risk factors contribute to AMI-related mortality, among which age and systemic inflammation persist as independent predictors of adverse outcomes2,3.

By mid-21st century, population aging will escalate into a major global challenge, profoundly transforming societal structures and economic systems4. In China, this demographic shift demonstrates an accelerating trajectory, with projections indicating 150 million citizens aged ≥75 years by 20505, imposing substantial pressure on healthcare infrastructure and resource allocation. Crucially, aging functions as a non-modifiable risk factor strongly associated with increased post-PCI mortality and complication rates6,7, yet evidence-based risk stratification frameworks for elderly populations remain critically underdeveloped. Compounding this challenge, age-related comorbidities like frailty and malnutrition8not only amplify systemic inflammation but also create therapeutic dilemmas in clinical practice9, forming a self-perpetuating cycle that undermines treatment efficacy.

C-reactive protein (CRP), a fundamental inflammatory biomarker, serves dual clinical roles as both an inflammation indicator and a validated predictor of cardiovascular events10. Elevated CRP concentrations demonstrate concerning associations with critical endpoints including ischemic stroke and sudden cardiac death11,12. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) represents a technological advancement in vascular inflammation assessment, offering enhanced precision over standard CRP measurements13. However, evidence remains notably limited regarding inflammatory biomarkers’prognostic value for short-term outcomes in elderly AMI patients. This investigation specifically addresses this critical knowledge gap by evaluating hs-CRP’s predictive capacity for in-hospital adverse events within this high-risk population.

The present study is a single-center, retrospective observational cohort study. From January 2019 to December 2019, 590 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years with AMI were enrolled at Beijing An Zhen Hospital. The diagnosis of AMI was established according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (2018) endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and World Heart Federation (WHF), requiring at least two of the following criteria: (1) a clinical history of ischemic chest pain, (2) dynamic evolution of the ECG, and (3) dynamic changes in serum myocardial marker concentrations indicating myocardial necrosis14.

Exclusion criteria were defined as hs-CRP >20 mg/l at time of hospital admission, fever (temperature > 38 °C), or experience of an acute infection with fever within 14 days before study inclusion, chronic inflammatory disease, and lacked a hs-CRP laboratory value at admission. The present study was performed by the Helsinki Declaration of Human Rights (2000). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Beijing An Zhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, waived the requirement for obtaining informed consent.

Patients’ data of demographic and clinical characteristics regarding the age, sex, BMI, Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), smoking status, previous medical history, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were collected from Beijing An Zhen Hospital’s medical information recording system. Meanwhile, We also record laboratory examinations including the white blood cell count, Hemoglobin, Platelet count, hs-CRP, eGFR, Uric acid, FBG, HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG), which were determined at the central laboratory of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Briefly, hs-CRP levels were measured using a particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay with a Roche Cobas c702 analyzer and commercial kits, demonstrating a detection range of 0.1–20 mg/L, inter-assay coefficient of variation <3%, and compliance with International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization. Baseline fasting blood samples (collected within 12 h of first medical contact) for hs-CRP, cardiac troponin, and lipid profiling were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes within 30 minutes post-collection, and serum aliquots were stored at −80°C until analysis.

Malignant arrhythmia was defined as an arrhythmia that causes hemodynamic disturbance in a short time, leading to syncope or even sudden death, including ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and third-degree atrioventricular block, etc. The mechanical complication was defined as a complication of anatomical changes in the heart after myocardial infarction, including septal perforation, rupture of the papillary muscle of the mitral valve, and rupture of the heart. Cardiogenic shock was defined as a severe acute peripheral circulatory failure resulting from a significant decrease in cardiac output due to extreme cardiac dysfunction. Bleeding events were defined using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) classifications15. Stroke was defined as an acute cerebrovascular disease, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Thrombosis includes left ventricular mural thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and acute stent thrombosis. Congestive heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by structural or functional impairment of the heart, resulting in abnormal pumping and/or filling function of the heart, insufficient cardiac output, pulmonary circulation and/or systemic circulation congestion, and decreased blood volume.

The in-hospital outcomes were the composite of death, malignant arrhythmia, mechanical complication, congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, thrombosis, bleeding, and stroke.

Continuous variables were presented as the mean ± standard deviation is consistent with a normal distribution, otherwise as to the median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages. A one-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in continuous variables. The Pearson chi-square test (Pearson X2test), Fisher’s exact test, or the Cochran-Armitage Trend test, were used to analyze categorical variables. The admission values of hs-CRP were divided into three quartiles to stratify the incidence rates of in-hospital adverse events. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the in-hospital adverse events. the baseline variables showed p<0.05 in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Three regression models were built and variables showed p<0.05 in univariate analysis were adjusted in these models. Model 1 was the unadjusted model, model 2 was the partially adjusted model that was controlled for age, SBP, and DBP, and model 3 was the fully adjusted model that was controlled for variables in model 2 plus Previous Stroke, LVEF, Grace score, WBC count, Hemoglobin, eGFR, FBG, CK-MB, hs-TnI, LAD, STEMI. The analysis results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To verify the robustness of our results, sub-group analyses were performed to explore the association between the hs-CRP and in-hospital adverse events.

The C-statistic was calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, which reflects the predictive value of the hs-CRP for the in-hospital outcome. Meanwhile, to evaluate whether introducing the hs-CRP into the model of established risk factors could improve the predictive value, the C-statistic was compared by Delong’s test16. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated differentiation improvement (IDI) risk models were used to further evaluate the incremental predictive value of hs-CRP. Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS statistics 24 and R software. For all comparisons, two-sided probability values <0.05 indicated statistical significance.

A total of 2,092 patients were initially diagnosed with AMI. however, after applying exclusion criteria, 288 individuals were excluded from the study. This left 1,804 eligible participants, from which 590 patients aged over 65 were ultimately selected for analysis. These patients were further stratified into three groups based on the tertiles of their hs-CRP levels (illustrated in Figure1). The average age of these participants was 71.0±5.18 years with male predominance (65.9%). Comparative analysis (Table1) revealed progressive clinical variations across hs-CRP tertiles: as hs-CRP levels increased, several clinical markers rose correspondingly. Heart rate surged, the GRACE score followed suit, and the white blood cell count spiked noticeably. Additionally, FBG, TC, LDL, CKMB, hs-TNI, and the percentage of patients with Killip ≥2 increased simultaneously. Even the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors increased significantly. Conversely, some markers showed a notable decline as hs-CRP levels rose. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), hemoglobin levels, eGFR, and the number of patients with dyslipidemia all decreased as inflammation escalated. Remarkably, each of these trends demonstrated strong statistical significance (p<0.05).

Moreover, differences between the event and non-event groups were analyzed, as shown in Table2. Older adults in the event group exhibited elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, and impaired cardiac and renal function. They also had higher concentrations of white blood cells (WBC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hs-CRP, and markers of myocardial necrosis. Additionally, this group had a greater proportion of individuals with a history of stroke, higher use of tirofiban and oral ACEI/ARB medications, and a larger proportion of STEMI patients.

The incidence of these in-hospital outcomes was 30.2%. When AMI patients were divided into lower, middle, and higher groups based on hs-CRP tertiles, there was a significant increase in the risk of death, congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, mechanical complications, and combined in-hospital outcomes as patients moved from the lower to the higher groups (all p for trend < 0.05, Table3). Additionally, as shown in Figure2A, the prevalence of in-hospital outcomes rose significantly with increasing hs-CRP levels (17.2% vs. 25.5% vs. 48%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the Event group had a significantly higher hs-CRP concentration compared to the Non-Event group (7.04 [2.38, 20.00] vs. 2.59 [1.06, 6.07], p < 0.001, Figure2B).

Univariate and multivariate analysis results and predictors for in-hospital outcomes are presented in Table4. In the univariate logistic analysis, when hs-CRP was treated as a categorical variable, it, along with age, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, previous stroke, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), GRACE score, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting blood glucose (FBG), CK-MB, hs-TNI, target vessel of LAD, and STEMI diagnosis, were all identified as risk factors for in-hospital outcomes in older patients with AMI (all p < 0.05, Table4). As shown in Table5, for each 1-unit increase in hs-CRP, the odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital outcomes was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.06-1.14) in the fully adjusted regression model. Compared to tertile 1, the fully adjusted ORs for in-hospital outcomes in tertile 2 and tertile 3 were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.56-1.89) and 2.21 (95% CI: 1.23-3.97), respectively.

As shown in Figure3, the analysis demonstrated consistent predictive utility of hs-CRP for in-hospital outcomes across all predefined subgroups—including age (<75 vs ≥75 years), sex, BMI (<25 vs ≥25 kg/m2), smoking history, diabetes status, hypertension, LVEF (<50% vs ≥50%), and LDL cholesterol (<70 vs ≥70 mg/dL)—with no significant interaction effects observed (all P for interaction >0.05). Notably, however, a differential predictive pattern emerged between MI subtypes: while the association remained nonsignificant in non-STEMI patients [OR 1.057 (95% CI 0.993-1.125)], hs-CRP exhibited a stronger predictive capacity in STEMI patients [OR 1.154 (95% CI 1.084-1.229)], demonstrating a statistically significant interaction (P for interaction=0.033). These differential patterns imply distinct pathophysiological contributions of inflammatory pathways to acute coronary syndromes, potentially mediated through plaque instability mechanisms in STEMI.

As shown in Figure4, the area under the curve (AUC) for hs-CRP in predicting in-hospital outcomes in older AMI patients was 0.712 (95% CI: 0.664-0.755, p < 0.001). The AUC for the baseline risk model, which included age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), history of stroke, ejection fraction (EF), GRACE score, and STEMI diagnosis, was 0.867 (95% CI: 0.831-0.895, p < 0.001). Adding hs-CRP to the baseline risk model resulted in a modest increase in AUC to 0.876, but this increment was not statistically significant (p = 0.183). However, hs-CRP significantly improved reclassification and discrimination ability, as evidenced by a continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) of 0.461 (95% CI 0.292-0.631, p < 0.001) and an integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) of 0.046 (95% CI 0.025-0.067, p < 0.001), as detailed in Table6.

In this investigation, hs-CRP was identified as a robust and independent prognostic indicator for short-term clinical outcomes among elderly individuals presenting with AMI. Notably, the inflammatory biomarker demonstrated persistent predictive capacity even following comprehensive adjustment for established clinical risk factors. The strength and consistency of this association suggest that hs-CRP quantification provides incremental prognostic value beyond conventional risk stratification models in elderly patients with AMI.

The role of hs-CRP in predicting cardiovascular events in AMI patients continues to be debated. While some observational studies suggest a link between elevated CRP levels and poor short-term outcomes following AMI, their relevance to long-term mortality predictions remains uncertain. For example, one study indicated that elevated CRP levels were associated with a negative short-term prognosis after AMI but did not show a significant correlation with long-term mortality risk28. Conversely, a different observational study of 463 elderly patients (over 80 years old) with AMI identified hs-CRP as a definitive independent risk factor for all-cause mortality29. Recently, Lucci et al. reported a notable finding: hs-CRP not only predicts in-hospital outcomes—such as mortality, cardiogenic shock, and acute pulmonary edema—but also two-year mortality, in both AMI patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM)30. Despite strong evidence supporting hs-CRP as a predictor of short-term cardiovascular events, most research has focused primarily on in-hospital mortality and heart failure, often neglecting other important considerations. Few studies have investigated the impact of hs-CRP on elderly populations or on other severe AMI-related complications, such as mechanical complication and malignant arrhythmias. Consistent with previous findings, our research also identified hs-CRP as an independent predictor of in-hospital outcomes in AMI patients. However, unlike most prior studies, our focus was on older patients and compounded outcome events, providing new insights into this complex and evolving area of study.

In this investigation, heart failure and mechanical complications emerged as the primary factors influencing in-hospital outcomes. Our analysis revealed a concerning trend: the incidence of both in-hospital heart failure and mechanical complications increased with higher tertiles of serum hs-CRP levels. This finding is consistent with previous research, reinforcing a growing body of evidence. For example, a large-scale prospective cohort study has documented a clear association between hs-CRP levels and the incidence of in-hospital heart failure in patients with AMI31. Furthermore, another observational study found that hsCRP was a valuable predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ACS undergoing PCI32. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors. One significant explanation involves the interplay of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, malnutrition, and frailty, which are common among the elderly8,33–35. These conditions not only elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease but also markedly influence the prognosis of AMI. Importantly, frailty, an irreversible condition in older adults, has been associated with elevated inflammatory markers. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that frailty and pre-frailty are linked to increased levels of inflammatory parameters, particularly CRP and IL-636. In essence, frail older individuals show heightened inflammation, which exacerbates infarct size through mechanisms such as complement activation25.

The present study has several limitations. First, the single-center retrospective design carries inherent risks of selection bias. Although the overall sample size provided adequate power for the primary composite endpoint analysis, exploratory subgroup analyses may have been underpowered. Second, the omission of frailty assessment—a known confounder of inflammatory responses—may have influenced the observed associations with hs-CRP levels. Third, while admission hs-CRP levels offer valuable early prognostic information, unmeasured peak post-AMI levels represent a potential source of residual confounding. Fourth, incomplete revascularization data may limit the generalizability of our findings. Finally, key medications (aspirin, beta-blockers, ACEi/ARBs) documented in Tables1-2were not included in regression models due to event rate constraints. Given their established prognostic value in AMI, this omission may influence the observed associations.

Consequently, these results should be interpreted as preliminary evidence requiring validation in large-scale randomized trials.

hs-CRP is a clinically significant independent predictor of in-hospital outcomes in elderly AMI patients, maintaining robust prognostic value even after adjusting for key cardiovascular risk factors. Its integration into clinical practice could refine risk stratification by providing inflammation-specific insights, particularly for guiding treatment intensity, selecting targeted anti-inflammatory therapies, and optimizing post-discharge monitoring in older AMI populations.
