This study evaluates the formation of ethical responsibility among master’s students enrolled in the “Applied Physics and Nanomaterials” program. Recognizing the pivotal role of ethics in the evolving field of nanoscience, the research implements a three-phase methodology that integrates an Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment, a facilitator-led Group Discussion, and a Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment. The assessments are based on realistic scenarios reflecting ethical dilemmas that students may encounter in professional practice. This dual approach — combining quantitative assessment with qualitative analysis — provides a comprehensive understanding of students’ ethical reasoning and decision-making. Results indicate varying levels of ethical responsibility, underscoring the need for more integrated ethics education in nanoscience curricula. The study contributes to ongoing discussions on the importance of ethics in scientific training, especially in high-impact fields such as nanotechnology. It offers educators a structured framework for embedding ethics into technical education, ensuring that future nanomaterials specialists are not only proficient scientists but also ethically responsible professionals. The article concludes with recommendations for enhancing ethics education in nanoscience through interactive, scenario-based, and discussion-centered learning methods.

Nanotechnology is experiencing rapid expansion and is making a transformative impact in numerous fields, including energy, medicine, chemical manufacturing, and electronics (Manikandan et al.,2023; Saxena et al.,2020; Shah et al.,2022; Suchikova et al.,2022). This growth is highlighted by over 11,000 registered products incorporating nanomaterials, signaling the sector’s significant contribution to modern technological advancements. New materials with unique and often unprecedented properties are developed daily, fulfilling demands traditional materials cannot meet (Karipbayev et al.,2022; Suchikova et al.,2023).

However, nanotechnology presents complex ethical, environmental, and regulatory challenges alongside these innovations. The potential risks associated with nanomaterials—ranging from their long-term environmental impact to concerns over privacy and security—raise urgent questions about how nanotechnology should be responsibly managed (Vambol et al.,2017a,b; Nizam et al.,2021). Ethical concerns extend to privacy, environmental responsibility, and social acceptance, reflecting the broad societal implications of advancing nanotechnologies (Besley et al.,2008; Cameron,2006; Pandey & Jain,2020; Malik et al.,2023). These ethical challenges emphasize the importance of structured ethical considerations and comprehensive regulatory frameworks for nanotechnology.

In response to these challenges, the scientific community has increasingly highlighted the need for ethical guidelines and standards. Research has shown that a lack of integrated ethical training in STEM programs, particularly in fields like nanomaterials and applied physics, limits students’ ability to engage with the societal implications of their work critically (Joyce et al.,2018; Balakrishnan et al.,2012; McGinn,2010). Acknowledging this gap, several studies argue for embedding ethics directly within scientific and engineering education to bridge the divide between technical knowledge and ethical awareness (Rolfe,2014; Goldie et al.,2001; Johnson et al.,2017; Fransson,2017).

This paper addresses the need for a more integrated approach to ethics in nanoscience education by presenting a new methodology for assessing ethical responsibility among future nanomaterials specialists. The study was designed as a pre-post intervention: participants first completed a scenario-based ethical responsibility assessment, then engaged in a facilitated group discussion analyzing each scenario, and finally repeated the same assessment. This approach allowed us to evaluate students’ initial ethical reasoning and the potential influence of peer discussion on their decision-making skills, thereby providing deeper insights into how ethical responsibility can be developed through interactive learning methods.

The paper is structured as follows: Section “Literature Review on Ethical Training in Nanoscience” provides a comprehensive literature review on ethical training in nanoscience, discussing regulatory, ethical, and educational aspects. Section “Methodology” describes the methodology employed in this study, including the design of scenario-based testing and discussion sessions. Section “Results” presents the findings on students’ ethical awareness and engagement with complex ethical challenges. Finally, Sect. “Discussion” offers conclusions and recommendations for incorporating ethical training into STEM curricula to foster responsible decision-making among future professionals.

As nanotechnology applications proliferate, regulatory frameworks for managing the lifecycle of nanomaterials remain in their infancy. According to Vambol et al.,2017a,b; Nizam et al. (2021), there is a pressing need to develop methods for assessing nanomaterials’ environmental and health impacts at all stages, from production to disposal. The scale of the nanotechnology industry is exemplified by over 11,000 registered products containing nanomaterials (StatNano, 2025). However, effective oversight is still lacking, which raises ethical concerns about potential impacts on human health and the environment. These risks have led to increasing global calls for standards on the ethical use and disposal of nanomaterials, with new regulations emerging annually (Fisher,2007).

In tandem with regulatory efforts, there has been an expanding discourse around the ethical implications of nanotechnology. Besley et al. (2008), Cameron (2006), and Pandey and Jain (2020) emphasize that ethical considerations in nanotechnology extend beyond environmental impact to include privacy, security, and societal acceptance. Malik et al. (2023) and Caballero-Díaz et al. (2013) argue that a structured ethical framework is essential to ensure responsible conduct in nanotechnology, given its transformative potential and accompanying ethical challenges.

The ethical complexities of nanotechnology highlight the corresponding need for educational programs that integrate ethical training directly into nanoscience curricula. Traditional STEM education models have often treated ethical training as an isolated topic, separate from core scientific and technical content (Rolfe,2014). This division can lead to a disconnect, where students are technically proficient but lack the ethical grounding needed to navigate the broader implications of their work (Goldie et al.,2001; Johnson et al.,2017; Fransson,2017).

The embedded ethics model has been proposed as a promising solution to this challenge. In this study, we refer specifically to the framing presented by Barakat and Jiao (2010), who advocate for integrating ethical reflection directly into science and engineering curricula through case-based discussion, contextualized scenarios, and active dialogue. Their model emphasizes ethics as a component of technical problem-solving rather than an add-on, aligning with our approach to ethics education through realistic, scenario-based assessments. By embedding ethical discussions directly into scientific and technical courses, this model fosters a holistic understanding of science and technology, encouraging students to consider ethical implications as an inherent part of scientific work. It promotes a deeper awareness of ethical issues and cultivates an integrated perspective that connects scientific advancements with societal well-being.

Broader educational trends support this integrated approach, with recent studies advocating for STEM programs that combine technical knowledge with moral and civic education (Martin et al.,2021; McGee et al.,2023; Kovachov et al.,2023). These programs aim to prepare students to handle ethical challenges in their professional roles by aligning ethics training with technical education. Jones et al. (2013) and Mitcham et al. (2013a,b) argue that as nanotechnology becomes more deeply embedded in various sectors, education systems must address ethical issues such as environmental impact, privacy, and social responsibility within STEM disciplines.

Despite progress in ethics education, there remains a need for more immersive and experiential approaches, particularly in fields like nanotechnology, where complex moral challenges arise. Research shows that traditional methods, which often separate ethical training from technical knowledge, are insufficient for developing ethical awareness among students (Joyce et al.,2018; Balakrishnan & Visvanathan,2012; McGinn,2010). Scholars have noted that ethical training through scenario-based discussions and case studies can be particularly effective in engaging students and promoting critical thinking skills (Johnson et al.,2017; Fransson,2017). This gap highlights the importance of using methods that simulate real-world ethical challenges, allowing students to experience the impact of their decisions and engage deeply with ethical dilemmas they may encounter in their careers (Rolfe,2014).

Recent studies, such as those by Kotluk and Tormey (2022), emphasize the role of scenarios in promoting emotional empathy rather than focusing on catastrophic consequences. They suggest that well-crafted scenarios encourage students to relate to ethical issues personally, enhancing their ethical decision-making abilities. Alfred Nordmann’s critique (2007) of early nanoethics, which often relied on misleading science-fiction scenarios, highlights the importance of using realistic and plausible situations. Rather than emphasizing dramatic, large-scale destruction, compelling scenarios should reflect practical ethical challenges to help students critically analyze and thoughtfully respond to real-world issues.

This study is grounded in experiential learning and critical thinking theories, which are essential for developing ethical awareness and decision-making skills. As Kolb (1984) described, Experiential learning theory posits that learning is most effective when it involves active participation and reflection. By engaging students in scenario-based assessments and collaborative discussions, this study aligns with experiential learning principles, offering an interactive environment where students can explore ethical issues and reflect on their decisions. Critical thinking theory complements this approach by encouraging students to question assumptions, evaluate consequences, and consider multiple perspectives in their ethical reasoning (Brookfield,2012).

The choice of scenario-based assessments as a core methodology is supported by research demonstrating its effectiveness in ethics education (Schwartz,2017). Scenario-based methods allow students to apply ethical principles to specific, relatable contexts, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application (Mitcham et al.,2013,b). These scenarios provoke soft emotional engagement, fostering empathy and moral reflection without resorting to sensationalism or hypothetical extremes. This approach aligns with Kotluk and Tormey’s (2022) argument that ethically challenging scenarios are most effective when they foster an environment for empathy and reflection, which is critical for developing ethical competencies.

Furthermore, Nordmann’s (2007) critique of science-fiction-based scenarios in nanoethics serves as a reminder of the importance of grounded, realistic scenarios. This study seeks to provide students with a nuanced, practical understanding of ethical challenges by avoiding sensationalized narratives and preparing them for real-world professional contexts. The design of the discussion sessions, based on studies by Barakat and Jiao (2010) and Fransson (2017), supports a reflective, interactive format that encourages students to collaboratively analyze ethical dilemmas, fostering critical thinking and ethical reasoning.

The study was conducted during the 2nd semester (October - November) of 2022 at Berdyansk, Ukraine. In Ukraine, the training of specialists in the field of nanoscience is carried out under the specialty “Applied Physics and Nanomaterials.” Berdyansk State Pedagogical University was initially located in Berdyansk city. With the onset of the large-scale Russian-Ukrainian war in 2022, Berdyansk was occupied. Consequently, the university was relocated to Zaporizhzhia (Tsybuliak et al.,2023). The university now operates in a “University without Walls” format (Suchikova & Tsybuliak,2023; Lopatina et al.,2023; Bohdanov et al.,2023). All classes are conducted online via video conferencing (Popova et al.,2023).

The research was conducted with ten master’s students in the Applied Physics and Nanomaterials program. The methodology included three main components: scenario-based testing, group discussion, and Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment.

Notably, before participating in this study, students had not completed any specialized courses, modules, or training related to ethics in nanoscience. Ethical issues were introduced through the scenario-based tests and group discussions within the framework of this research. The absence of prior ethics training allows for assessing students’ baseline level of ethical responsibility, providing a foundation on which the effectiveness of research methods, such as group discussion and Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment, can be evaluated.

This study employed a structured three-phase research design to assess the development of ethical responsibility among students in nanoscience. The research process consisted of three stages: (1) an Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment, (2) a Group Discussion After Assessment, and (3) a Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment. These phases correspond to the structure illustrated in Fig.1.

The aim was to explore whether collaborative scenario-based reflection could influence ethical reasoning and decision-making. The subsections below describe each stage in detail.

The study began with the Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment, which consisted of five scenarios related to ethical responsibility in nanoscience. Each scenario represented a realistic ethical challenge that nanoscientists might encounter in their professional activities, including confidentiality, unexpected research findings, peer review integrity, handling hazardous materials, and maintaining honesty in collaborative work.

For each scenario, participants were presented with three response options (A, B, C), each corresponding to a different level of ethical responsibility—beginner, intermediate, or advanced. The three-option structure was intentionally chosen to offer participants a realistic yet manageable range of choices, facilitating intuitive ethical judgments without overcomplicating the decision-making process.

The assessment was conducted online using Google Forms. Participants were given 10 min to complete the test, which allowed sufficient time for thoughtful reading and response while capturing their immediate ethical intuitions. Importantly, no feedback or indication of correct responses was provided after submission to preserve the integrity of the retest phase.

Following the Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment, students participated in a one-hour group discussion aimed at deepening their understanding of the ethical issues presented in the scenarios. During this session, each of the five scenarios was discussed in sequence, with approximately 12 min allocated per case to ensure focused and dynamic engagement.

The discussion was facilitated by two trained moderators with expertise in ethics and nanoscience. One facilitator guided the conversation, asking open-ended questions to stimulate reflection without introducing personal opinions or leading comments. The second facilitator managed timing, recorded the discussion, and documented key points to ensure a comprehensive account of the group’s ethical reasoning.

Both facilitators received prior training in neutral facilitation techniques, including strategies for encouraging balanced participation and avoiding influence on participants’ responses. They also prepared by reviewing each scenario in advance, anticipating discussion pathways and formulating prompts to provoke critical thinking.

To preserve the authenticity of students’ perspectives, facilitators minimized the use of non-verbal cues and refrained from offering evaluative feedback. This structured yet open approach created an environment in which participants could freely articulate and refine their ethical positions through peer dialogue.

At the conclusion of the group discussion, participants completed the Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment, which consisted of the same five scenarios presented in the initial assessment. The retest was conducted using the same format and time allocation (10 min), and students were not given access to their initial responses.

This phase aimed to capture any changes in students’ ethical reasoning that may have resulted from the peer discussion. By comparing responses from the initial and retest phases, the study assessed the influence of reflective dialogue on the development of ethical responsibility. The consistent structure of both assessments ensured that any differences in outcomes could be attributed to the impact of the discussion rather than changes in format or context.

The ethical scenarios used in both the Initial and Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessments were carefully designed to reflect the kinds of dilemmas nanoscience professionals may realistically face in their work. These scenarios are described in detail below.

The scenarios focused on common ethical issues in nanoscience, such as confidentiality in research, reporting unexpected discoveries, review processes, handling nanomaterials, and honesty in collaboration (Table1). Each response option (A, B, C) in the scenarios was assigned a score (1, 2, and 3, respectively).

The answer options in Table1were deliberately not arranged in any specific order to avoid potential bias. This randomized approach ensured that participants were not influenced by a particular order, allowing them to consider each response option on its own merit.

Each scenario was designed to reflect real ethical challenges that nanoscience professionals might encounter. The scenarios covered issues such as research confidentiality, reporting unexpected discoveries, review processes, handling nanomaterials, and honesty in collaboration, representing the diversity and complexity of ethical dilemmas in the field. The purpose of each scenario was to stimulate deep ethical reflections and critical thinking, helping students envision situations they might face in their professional practice.

The scenarios were crafted to be concise yet detailed enough to provide sufficient context for understanding the ethical dilemma without overwhelming participants with excessive information. This approach ensured that students could focus on the core ethical issue while maintaining engagement and making quick, intuitive assessments. The text style was kept neutral to allow participants to interpret the ethical challenges independently, free from any influence toward a specific viewpoint.

The scenarios were also written with potential emotional impact in mind, encouraging students to feel a sense of responsibility in ethical decision-making. For instance, the scenario on reporting unexpected hazardous properties of a nanomaterial aimed to prompt students to consider the societal consequences of leaving such risks undocumented. Creating these emotional connections helped reinforce the learning objectives, particularly the development of ethical responsibility and a critical approach to their actions in scientific work.

The primary learning objective was to allow students to identify, evaluate, and articulate ethical decisions that hold practical significance for their future careers. The scenarios encouraged students not only to select responses but also to gain a deeper understanding of the potential consequences of their actions in the professional sphere. Each scenario was crafted to spark discussion, encourage self-reflection, and cultivate ethical responsibility, which is critically important for scientists today.

Each scenario and its respective answer options were carefully designed and rated according to commonly accepted ethical standards and principles within scientific research and professional conduct. For instance, in the scenario involving research confidentiality, the highest-rated response best aligns with the ethical responsibility to protect sensitive information, as is typically required in projects with commercial or confidential aspects. This response was deemed the most ethical, reflecting an awareness of confidentiality obligations while balancing the professional expectation to share non-sensitive information.

To ensure validity, the ratings were reviewed by subject matter experts in both ethics and nanoscience, who evaluated the relevance and appropriateness of each response option in the context of real-world ethical challenges. This process aimed to ensure that the assigned ratings accurately reflect levels of ethical responsibility as aligned with professional norms. Scenarios were crafted to allow for nuances in responses, acknowledging that there may be context-specific variations in practice. Where applicable, the scenarios were structured to imply that the confidentiality applies primarily to critical research details, rather than general project information, unless stated otherwise.

Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment: The initial test responses were analyzed to assess the students’ basic ethical decision-making skills. Each response was classified into primary, intermediate, or advanced levels of ethical understanding based on a predefined key.

Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment: The responses from the retest were similarly analyzed and compared with the initial test results to identify any changes in ethical considerations or shifts in the level of ethical responsibility following the discussion.

The group discussion was video-recorded and professionally transcribed. The transcripts underwent a thorough review to ensure a deep familiarization with the data. To ensure quality and accuracy, several authors independently analyzed the data. Key points, arguments, and shifts in perspectives were identified. The discussion allowed for an understanding of the group’s collective ethical reasoning and highlighted areas where ethical responsibility was strong or needed improvement.

Comparing the initial and retest results aimed to assess the impact of the group discussion on the students’ ethical decision-making. Improvements, regressions, or consistencies in choices made during the retest compared to the initial test were identified and analyzed to understand how the discussion influenced or reinforced the students’ ethical responsibility.

The comparison of initial and retest results was conducted by analyzing changes in each participant’s overall scores and responses to each individual scenario. First, the total scores from both test phases were calculated to determine the level of ethical responsibility (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) before and after the group discussion. Next, we compared changes in responses to each scenario, which allowed us to assess how the group discussion influenced ethical considerations in specific dilemmas.

In addition to quantitative score comparison, a qualitative analysis of the responses was performed to evaluate shifts in participants’ reasoning between the initial and retest phases. Key arguments that emerged during the discussion, which might have influenced participants’ retest responses, were documented and correlated with their responses. This approach identified improvements, regressions, or consistencies in participant choices, providing a deeper understanding of how the discussion impacted their ethical views.

This methodology provided a comprehensive approach to assessing the levels of ethical responsibility among future specialists in nanomaterials. It combined individual assessment with collective learning, offering a nuanced view of the development of ethical responsibility among students in a critical scientific field.

The ethical responsibility assessment test was quantitatively evaluated using a structured scoring system to evaluate the levels of ethical responsibility among students in the “Applied Physics and Nanomaterials” program. This system was designed to classify responses into three levels of ethical responsibility: Initial, Average, and Advanced.

Scores for each response were summed to obtain a total score for each student. The total scores ranged from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 15 points.

The students’ ethical responsibility formation levels were determined based on their total score (Table2).

The decision to reduce the level of measurement from continuous to ordinal data was made to accommodate the limited sample size and the nature of the assessment. Given the focus on ethical responsibility levels (Initial, Average, and Advanced), an ordinal scale was more appropriate for categorizing responses meaningfully. This approach allowed for a more precise analysis of ethical responsibility formation without requiring the precision of continuous measurement, which may not have been as informative given the sample constraints and study objectives.

Comparing scores before and after the discussion helped us understand how group discussions could influence students’ ethical responsibility. Increased test scores after the discussion indicated an enhancement of ethical responsibility. In contrast, a decrease or absence of change pointed to areas where further ethical training might be needed.

This study uses descriptive statistics only to analyze the results, due to the small sample size (n= 10), which does not permit statistically significant generalizations or the application of inferential statistical tests, such as the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. This study aimed to provide a preliminary understanding of the level of ethical responsibility among students in the “Applied Physics and Nanomaterials” program and to examine the impact of group discussion on their ethical reasoning. While the results cannot be generalized to a broader population, this descriptive approach offers valuable insights that may serve as a basis for future studies with larger sample sizes.

We confirm that the Helsinki Declaration conducted the study. Participation was entirely voluntary, with informed consent obtained prior to involvement. The study program was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of [Anonymous] (protocol № 2 − 1/2022 dated 15.09.2022).

The individual responses during Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment revealed a range of levels of ethical responsibility (Table3).

In Scenario 1 (Research Confidentiality), responses were fairly balanced, with a slight inclination towards more complex ethical decision-making, indicating a good understanding of the importance of confidentiality in research.

In Scenario 2 (Reporting Unexpected Findings), the majority leaned towards advanced ethical considerations, demonstrating a solid awareness of the necessity to report unexpected findings responsibly.

Scenario 3 (Review Process) revealed a mix of responses, with several students demonstrating a high ethical responsibility in providing objective feedback.

Scenario 4 (Handling Nanomaterials) showed that many students chose the most ethical option, indicating a high ethical responsibility regarding safety protocols.

In Scenario 5 (Honesty in Collaboration), responses were again varied but with a noticeable tendency to uphold high ethical standards in collaborative research.

The overall scores indicate the presence of both “beginner” and “advanced” level responses within the group, suggesting a diverse range of ethical competencies. In the presented scenarios, students who achieved “Advanced” level scores (2 and 5) demonstrated a deeper understanding and a more sophisticated approach to ethical decision-making. Conversely, students at the “beginner” level (3 and 8) showed a basic level of ethical responsibility, indicating the need for further education in ethics and ethical behavior.

In summary, Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment results reflect diverse ethical responsibilities among students, suggesting that while certain aspects are well-formed, others require significant improvement. This discrepancy underscores the need for a more nuanced and targeted approach to integrating ethical training into applied physics and nanomaterials curriculum.

The discussion followed a “step-by-step” principle, systematically addressing each scenario. The discussion began with each student sharing their initial thoughts on the scenarios.

In this scenario, students faced an ethical dilemma regarding the confidentiality of a research project with significant commercial potential. They had to choose between sharing information, maintaining strict confidentiality, or partially disclosing details to assess potential collaboration benefits.

This viewpoint sparked a debate, as another student responded, “However, sharing knowledge to some extent promotes collaboration and scientific progress,” a similar opinion was expressed by another student who claimed, “Sharing knowledge can foster scientific progress. We can be open without harming key confidential details.” This viewpoint highlighted the importance of collaboration in science, though it requires a more responsible approach to information. There were also responses leaning towards moderate disclosure of information (“only for the benefit of one’s project”): “Sometimes sharing some information can lead to beneficial collaboration. It is about finding the right balance.” This perspective pointed to a pragmatic approach to research confidentiality.

Overall, the trend observed during the discussion indicated a balanced division among students. Those advocating for strict confidentiality (option B) generally demonstrated a more cautious approach, emphasizing the ethical and legal responsibilities inherent in research work. Conversely, students inclined to share information (options A and C) reflected a more open and collaborative stance, though they recognized the need to balance this openness with confidentiality considerations.

The varied responses to this scenario demonstrate that students know the ethical complexities of research confidentiality. However, their differing views also suggest that there is room for deeper exploration and understanding of balancing ethical obligations with the potential benefits of collaboration. This indicates a need for educational programs further to emphasize ethical decision-making in the context of research confidentiality, highlighting both ethical behavior principles and the practical realities of scientific collaboration.

In this scenario, students had to decide how to deal with the unexpected discovery that the nanomaterial they were developing could pose a potential health hazard. The choices included focusing solely on the main goals of the research, reporting and highlighting these findings for further investigation, or ignoring the results altogether.

The discussion of Scenario 2 demonstrated a strong inclination towards ethical responsibility, with most students opting to report and highlight the results (Option B). This trend indicates a high level of ethical responsibility among students, recognizing the importance of addressing potential risks even if they fall outside the main goals of the research. A student advocating for this option argued, “When our research unexpectedly reveals potential risks, it becomes our ethical duty to report it. Ignoring this could have serious consequences.” Such a stance reflects a strong sense of ethical responsibility for the broader impact on society.

Those who decided to focus exclusively on the research’s main goals or ignore the results showed a preference for the efficiency and practicality of the research over ethical considerations. Although this viewpoint was less common in the discussion, it highlights a potential conflict between ethical duties and research objectives in nanoscience. One student noted, “If these findings are not part of our primary goals, they could distract from our main research. It is more practical to stay focused.” This perspective suggests a more pragmatic, albeit ethically questionable approach.

While most students demonstrated a commendable understanding of ethical responsibility in research, differing opinions underscore the need for more comprehensive training that emphasizes the ethical implications of research findings, regardless of their alignment with the leading research goals. Enhancing students’ ability to balance practical research objectives with ethical considerations is crucial for preparing them for responsible professional practice in nanomaterials science.

Scenario 3 presented an ethical dilemma in the review process, where students had to decide how to handle a manuscript that closely resembled their team’s work but had some questionable conclusions.

Another student countered, “If the results are questionable and too similar to our work, it could be plagiarism or a lack of originality. We must uphold research standards.” This perspective reflects a concern for scientific rigor and originality in research publications.

One student offered a compromise: “Discussing with the team can provide a fuller perspective and help make a fair decision.” This choice indicates a preference for team discussions in ethically ambiguous situations, leaning towards collective decision-making and valuing collective input over individual judgment.

In Scenario 4, students were presented with an ethical situation involving a junior scientist not following standard safety protocols while working with potentially hazardous nanomaterials. Options ranged from immediate correction and reporting, warning, and additional safety training to observing behavior before taking any actions.

Most students in the discussion chose immediate correction and reporting, indicating a strong inclination toward adhering to safety standards and ethical conduct in the laboratory. This choice reflects an understanding of the critical nature of safety protocols in nanoscience, where incorrect handling of materials can have serious consequences. One student noted, “Immediate correction and reporting are crucial for safety. It is an aspect of ethical conduct in the laboratory that is not up for discussion.” Another student agreed and emphasized, “Laboratory safety is non-negotiable. Immediate actions not only correct behavior but also set a precedent for others.” This response highlights the importance of prompt response to safety violations, illuminating a proactive approach to laboratory safety and ethical responsibility.

Alternative opinions were raised: “While immediate actions are important, education and retraining might be more effective in the long term. It is about creating a culture of safety.” This viewpoint suggests a preference for corrective education over punitive measures.

Students who preferred warning and additional training demonstrated faith in education and corrective actions as practical tools for ensuring long-term adherence to safety standards. The minority who chose observation emphasized the importance of understanding behavior patterns before intervening, offering a more analytical approach to problem-solving. One student remarked, “Sometimes it is better to understand the pattern before jumping to conclusions. This helps address the root cause.” This response indicates a more cautious and investigative approach to addressing safety violations.

The discussion outcomes for Scenario 4 indicate an overall high level of students’ ethical responsibility concerning the importance of safety protocols in nanomaterial science. The predominant choice for immediate actions reflects a commendable dedication to safety and ethical responsibility. However, the variety of responses also points to the need for further discussion and training on handling safety violations in research settings. Highlighting a balanced approach that combines immediate actions with education and understanding can enhance the culture of safety and ethical conduct in the scientific research environment.

In the fifth scenario, students faced an ethical dilemma related to collaborating with another institution that promised significant breakthroughs but whose research practices were not ethically justified. The options presented were to continue the collaboration, address and resolve ethical issues, or exit the collaboration to adhere to ethical standards. This scenario sparked the most discussions. The discussion revealed a nuanced understanding of maintaining honesty in scientific collaboration. Most students leaned towards actively considering and resolving ethical issues (Option B), indicating a preference for engagement and ethical problem-solving in collaborative research. A student who chose option B remarked, “Collaboration is important, but not at the expense of adhering to ethical standards. We should strive to align practices.” Students who advocated for continuing the collaboration despite ethical concerns demonstrated a pragmatic approach, although this was less common among responses. A student who chose this option said, “The potential scientific benefits of this collaboration may outweigh ethical concerns. It is about the bigger picture of scientific progress.” This viewpoint values the outcomes of the research over the process. Conversely, those who decided to exit the collaboration (option C) emphasized the priority of ethical standards in scientific endeavors: “Compromising our ethical standards, regardless of potential scientific benefit, sets a dangerous precedent. It is better to disengage.” This response underscores a firm adherence to ethical principles, even at the cost of scientific progress.

The discussion results for scenario 5 indicate that while students recognize the importance of collaboration for advancing scientific research, they also understand the need to balance this with ethical considerations. The majority’s opinion, which supports addressing ethical issues, indicates a willingness to lead in ensuring ethical standards are upheld in collaborative work. However, the variety of responses also underscores the need for deeper discussions about making ethical decisions in the context of collaborative research. This would help students navigate the delicate balance between scientific collaboration and maintaining ethical integrity.

The group discussion showed promising student engagement with ethical issues but highlighted areas needing further development. It emphasized the importance of including robust ethical training in nanoscience education, which goes beyond theoretical knowledge and incorporates practical, scenario-based learning. Such an approach would better prepare students to address ethical problems they will encounter in their professional careers, ensuring they contribute to the field of nanoscience in a responsible and ethically sound manner.

Following group discussions, the results of the Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment show a noticeable improvement in ethical responsibility among most students. Most students were categorized as “Advanced,” indicating a deeper understanding and a more refined approach to ethical decision-making (Table4).

The post-discussion test results underscore the effectiveness of group discussions in enhancing ethical argumentation skills. The significant presence of “Advanced” level responses after discussions suggests that interactive and reflective learning experiences are crucial in developing ethical understanding in nanoscience. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating collaborative and discussion-based pedagogical methods in ethics education for nanoscience students.

Group discussions likely stimulated deeper critical thinking about the ethical dilemmas presented. Experiencing different viewpoints and participating in debates could expand students’ perspectives, enabling them to consider more complex factors in decision-making.

Interaction with peers during discussions could have provided students with new ideas or considerations they had not contemplated, leading to more nuanced ethical judgments during the re-testing.

Detailed discussion of each scenario allowed students to reflect on their initial responses and reconsider their choices, potentially leading to more ethically grounded decisions.

The increase in scores observed after the group discussion may reflect a combination of factors. While it is likely that the discussion facilitated deeper ethical understanding by encouraging students to consider various perspectives, other elements could have also contributed. For instance, the repetition of questions in the post-discussion assessment might have allowed students to reflect on what was discussed, possibly aligning their answers more closely with the viewpoints that emerged as dominant in the group. This could suggest that the score increase partially reflects the influence of group dynamics, where students collectively processed ethical concepts rather than individually internalizing them.

In this context, we acknowledge that the quantitative results primarily indicate engagement and attention to the discussion rather than a definitive measure of individual ethical commitment. The qualitative analysis remains central in this study, as it more effectively captures the nuanced development of ethical reasoning and the shifts in students’ arguments and perspectives. This approach aligns with the study’s goal to assess the influence of collaborative learning on ethical awareness while recognizing the potential limitations of interpreting quantitative score increases in isolation.

This study aimed to assess and enhance the ethical responsibility of master’s students in Applied Physics and Nanomaterials through a two-part methodology that included an initial test, group discussion, and subsequent Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment. The findings provide significant insights into students’ capacities for ethical reasoning and the effectiveness of discussion-based pedagogical approaches in ethics education.

The study results revealed students’ deep engagement in discussing each scenario’s ethical aspects. Students often drew on personal experiences or theoretical knowledge, demonstrating the ability to apply acquired knowledge in real-life situations. The questions posed during discussions were exploratory, indicating a genuine desire to understand the complexities of making ethical decisions in nanoscience. Notably, students who chose more advanced ethical options provided more detailed justifications, indicating a higher level of ethical maturity. These students often led the discussions, encouraging peers to consider not only the immediate consequences of their decisions.

Our findings align with existing research indicating that traditional STEM education often separates ethical training from technical and scientific learning, leading to a divide between students’ scientific knowledge and their understanding of its broader societal implications (Rolfe,2014). The observed deep engagement of students in ethical discussions, where they applied personal experiences and theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, underscores the importance of integrating ethical considerations into STEM curricula. This integration fosters a more holistic understanding of science and its impact on society (Hildt et al.,2024; Kreth et al.,2024).

During discussions, students were aware of the complexities of making ethical decisions in a scientific context. They carefully weighed the advantages and disadvantages of different actions, considering the broader implications of their choices. This aligns with research that underscores the importance of discussing real-world dilemmas in developing ethical sensitivity and critical thinking in nanoscience education (Tammeleht et al.,2019; Tawiah et al.,2024).

A recurring theme in the discussions was the challenge of balancing scientific goals with ethical standards. Students faced decisions that required prioritizing either research objectives or ethical considerations. The literature supports the need for ethics education that effectively addresses managing such balances (Thiel et al.,2011; Mnyusiwalla et al.,2003).

Students advocated for ethical leadership and constructive engagement, especially during collaboration or when encountering unexpected research findings. This reflects students’ readiness to acknowledge and proactively address ethical issues, aligning with conclusions on the importance of group discussions on ethical dilemmas for fostering ethical responsibility (Balakrishnan & Visvanathan,2012).

The varied levels of ethical responsibility and the nature of the discussions underscore the need for more comprehensive ethics training in curricula. Such training should focus on developing critical thinking about ethical dilemmas, understanding the consequences of decisions, and fostering a culture of ethical responsibility in professional practice. The improvement in results following discussions emphasizes the value of interactive and reflective learning methods in ethics education (Göçen & Bulut,2024).

However, differences in improvement results also point to the need for individualized approaches to ethics education. Adapting ethics training to each student’s needs may be more effective in raising ethical standards among nanoscience students. Such an approach ensures that the educational needs of each student are adequately met, promoting a more comprehensive development of ethical responsibility in future nanoscience professionals.

While many of the pedagogical strategies observed in this study align with broader STEM ethics education, several ethical issues emerged as particularly relevant to nanoscience. For instance, scenarios addressing research confidentiality reflected the high-stakes nature of nanomaterials development, often linked to commercial applications and sensitive intellectual property. Similarly, the scenario on reporting unexpected findings raised concerns about long-term health or environmental risks specific to nanoscale materials, which are less predictable and more difficult to control than conventional substances. Discussions about the safe handling of nanomaterials highlighted students’ awareness of the physical and regulatory uncertainties associated with emerging technologies. These findings underscore that ethics education in nanoscience must address challenges such as dual-use technologies, safety protocols under uncertainty, and the societal implications of nanoscale innovations — concerns that are less emphasized in general STEM ethics training (Mnyusiwalla et al.,2003; Khan,2014). In content-heavy programs like «Applied Physics and Nanomaterials», flexible instructional formats such as scenario-based discussions offer a practical way to integrate these ethical dimensions without overburdening the curriculum.

Following group discussions, the observed enhancement in ethical responsibility scores suggests that group dynamics significantly shaped students’ ethical judgments. Prior studies in ethics education highlight that group discussions can foster a shared sense of ethical responsibility as students engage in dialogue that broadens their understanding of ethical dilemmas (Davis & Feinerman,2012). By interacting with peers and exchanging perspectives, students may develop a collective ethical consciousness, where group norms and values influence decision-making processes.

Furthermore, research in ethics education, such as Sunderland (2019), suggests that group discussions can enhance “ethical sensitivity” and “ethical commitment” by fostering empathy and deeper reflection on the social impacts of scientific work. In our study, the collaborative nature of group discussions may have helped students internalize ethical concepts as part of their broader professional identity in nanoscience rather than simply responding to individual scenarios in isolation. This aligns with the goal of ethics education, which is to integrate ethical reasoning into students’ professional identities, encouraging them to uphold ethical standards throughout their careers.

However, the influence of group dynamics also introduces certain limitations. Group discussions may create implicit pressure for students to align with majority viewpoints, potentially stifling unique or dissenting perspectives (Kotluk & Tormey,2022). While this collective engagement supports ethical understanding, future studies could explore methods to balance group influence with individual reflection, ensuring that students develop independent ethical reasoning skills alongside shared learning experiences.

This study evaluates ethics education by examining the development of ethical responsibility among future nanoscience professionals through scenario-based assessments and collaborative discussions. Traditional ethics education in STEM fields often struggles to bridge the gap between technical knowledge and ethical reasoning (Davis & Feinerman,2012). In our study, the combination of scenario testing and group discussions encouraged students to engage with ethical dilemmas at a deeper level, promoting skills that align with critical educational goals in ethics, such as “ethical sensitivity,” “ethical knowledge,” “ethical judgment,” and “ethical commitment” (Davis & Feinerman,2012).

The group discussions in this study stimulated ethical sensitivity by encouraging students to recognize the nuances of each dilemma and the ethical considerations involved. This process aligns with Sunderland’s (2019) observation that student engagement can relocate ethics to a core technical education component, fostering awareness of societal impacts. Through exposure to peers’ perspectives, students expanded their ethical knowledge, broadening their understanding of potential implications and societal responsibilities in nanoscience.

Our findings demonstrate that students’ ethical judgments evolved through scenario-based discussions as they evaluated various solutions to ethical challenges. This process allowed students to practice ethical judgment in a collaborative setting, providing a foundation for making informed, ethical decisions in their professional lives. The qualitative analysis revealed that students often desired to uphold ethical standards beyond immediate research goals, indicating a growing sense of ethical commitment. These aspects highlight the effectiveness of group discussions in nurturing ethical dedication, a quality vital for professionals in fields with significant societal implications, like nanoscience.

While the quantitative results offer insights into the general trend of score improvements, they serve primarily as an indicator of engagement. As Kotluk and Tormey (2022) suggested, quantitative assessments may not capture the full extent of ethical learning, which often involves personal reflection and peer influence. Thus, our study positions qualitative assessment as the central tool for evaluating ethics education outcomes. The qualitative analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of students’ evolving ethical perspectives and better aligns with educational goals to foster deep, lasting ethical commitment.

The findings of this study underscore the importance of developing and refining assessment tools that capture the complexities of ethical learning. Ethics education, especially in research and engineering, benefits from a combination of assessment methods reflecting individual understanding and group-influenced development (Borenstein et al.,2010). Although multiple-choice tests are convenient, they lack the depth provided by scenario-based and discussion-driven assessments. By shifting the evaluation focus toward qualitative assessments, this study contributes to the ongoing development of comprehensive approaches in ethics education that support knowledge acquisition, ethical sensitivity, judgment, and commitment.

The findings of this study underscore the effectiveness of discussion-based activities in enhancing ethical responsibility among nanoscience students, as shown by improvements in both quantitative scores and qualitative reflections. These results reinforce the potential value of interactive, reflective learning within ethics education. Students engaged actively in scenario-based discussions, stimulating ethical sensitivity, judgment, and commitment. Based on the findings of this study, we propose several targeted recommendations for integrating ethics education into nanoscience curricula. These are summarized in Table5below.

It is important to note that while all five recommendations align with the broader goals of strengthening ethics education in nanoscience, only the first two — scenario-based learning integration and guided group discussions — are directly supported by the empirical findings of this study. The remaining three recommendations are forward-looking suggestions inspired by observed student engagement and discussions, but they extend beyond the scope of this specific research with Master’s students. As such, they should be interpreted as possible directions for future curriculum development and ethics training initiatives, which require further study in diverse educational and professional contexts.

The findings of this study emphasize that ethics education in nanoscience must go beyond theoretical knowledge to actively engage students in practical, discussion-based experiences that deepen their ethical understanding. Through scenario-based testing and guided group discussions, our research demonstrates that students can develop a more nuanced awareness of ethical issues they may encounter as professionals in nanoscience. This approach equips students with a foundational skill set for making ethically informed decisions in real-world contexts, fostering scientific rigor and ethical integrity (Rasmussen & Ebbesen,2013; Corley et al.,2015).

A solid ethical foundation prepares future professionals for responsible decision-making, enhances the sector’s reputation, and fosters public trust. Integrating ethics within the curriculum aligns with societal expectations for responsible technological advancement and ensures that graduates contribute positively to fields where the impact of their work extends far beyond the lab (Ashraf et al.,2021; Assey & Malasi,2021; Alfaro Serrano et al.,2024).

The study also highlights the dynamic nature of ethical challenges in nanoscience. New ethical dilemmas will arise as the field evolves, underscoring the need for educational strategies that cultivate adaptability and ethical resilience. Training students in ethical reasoning through active learning ensures they are better prepared to navigate emerging ethical questions, contributing to nanotechnologies’ sustainable and socially responsible advancement (Mnyusiwalla et al.,2003; Khan,2014).

In conclusion, this study’s findings reinforce the importance of practical, discussion-centered ethics education responsive to the evolving nature of scientific responsibility in nanoscience. Such an approach will strengthen the quality and impact of research and uphold the ethical standards necessary for sustainable progress in the field.

This study has several limitations that should be considered. The small sample size and focus on master’s students in a single academic program limit the generalizability of the results. Future research could include larger and more diverse samples and longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of discussion-based ethics education on students’ professional development.

The study relied on descriptive statistics without inferential tests, as the sample size did not support statistical generalization. Expanding future studies with larger samples would enable statistical testing and more robust conclusions.

The study primarily used scenario-based assessments and group discussions without comparing alternative pedagogical methods, such as role-playing or case studies. Incorporating multiple methods and testing their effectiveness across different student groups would provide a more comprehensive understanding of approaches to developing ethical responsibility.

Finally, group discussions may have introduced peer influence and social desirability bias, despite efforts to minimize facilitator involvement. Future research could consider independent observation to reduce potential biases further and explore the role of group dynamics in shaping ethical decision-making.

This article presents an approach for assessing the level of ethical responsibility formation among master’s program students in “Applied Physics and Nanomaterials.” It suggests improvements in this level through a three-phase methodology consisting of an Initial Ethical Responsibility Assessment, a facilitated Group Discussion, and a Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment.

The study aimed to assess and enhance students’ ethical reasoning and decision-making skills in the context of nanoscience by using realistic, scenario-based assessments combined with structured peer discussion.

The results revealed varying levels of ethical responsibility among students. While some demonstrated advanced levels, others were at beginner or intermediate levels, indicating the need for more differentiated and targeted ethics education.

Improvements observed in the Retest Ethical Responsibility Assessment underscore the effectiveness of interactive, discussion-based learning methods. The group discussion served as a catalyst for deepening ethical understanding and critical reflection.

The diversity of responses and degree of change between assessments highlight the need for a comprehensive ethics curriculum in nanoscience — one that integrates active learning formats such as case studies, ethical scenarios, and collaborative discussions.

This study affirms that ethical responsibility is a core element of professional readiness for future nanoscience specialists. As the field continues to evolve and influence society and the environment, it is vital to prepare graduates who are both technically skilled and ethically grounded. By fostering a culture of ethical responsibility, nanoscience education can contribute to the sustainable and responsible advancement of the field. The findings offer a foundation for educators and policymakers to further integrate ethics into scientific education, aligning with the real-world challenges of nanotechnology.
