Congenital hearing loss (CHL) affects approximately 1–2 in 1000 children and significantly impacts development. Exposure to medications during pregnancy may impact offspring hearing; however, the ototoxic effects of different drugs have not been systematically investigated.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and analysed 21 experimental and observational studies examining 60 drugs across various categories.

Magnesium sulphate and systemic steroids, alone or in combination, showed potential protective effects towards CHL. Specific antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin and metronidazole) and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs were associated with an increased risk of CHL. Modest evidence indicated that low‐dose acetylsalicylic acid increased risk, whereas higher doses did not. Other drugs, such as anti‐neoplastic agents and valproic acid, showed weaker associations with CHL. Most studies had methodological limitations.

Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust research to minimise preventable hearing loss in children.

Hearing loss present at birth or in early childhood can significantly affect a child's development. Some medications taken during pregnancy may potentially influence the risk of hearing loss in infants, but this has not been thoroughly studied. We reviewed 21 studies investigating 60 different drugs to gain a better understanding of their effects. We found that certain medications, such as magnesium sulphate and steroids, might offer protection against hearing loss. Conversely, others, including some antibiotics and anti‐inflammatory drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, may increase the risk. Our findings underscore the need for further research to inform safer medication use during pregnancy and reduce preventable hearing loss in children.

Congenital hearing loss (CHL) affects 1–2 in 1000 children worldwide [1,2] and negatively affects language development, academic performance and social and emotional well‐being [3]. Several recognised risk factors for CHL in children include hereditary HL, in utero infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and prolonged neonatal intensive care [4]. However, the aetiology remains unknown for 25%–40% of affected children [3,5,6,7].

The development of the inner ear begins around the fourth gestational week. By the sixth gestational week, formation of the cochlear duct commences; the bony labyrinth is ossified by the 23rd week and fetal hearing commences by approximately 27 weeks gestation. The inner ear, however, remains vulnerable to external stimuli throughout pregnancy and postnatally until the age of 4 years, as several structures of the inner ear, such as hair cells and neurons, continue development [8,9].

Pregnancy exposure to drugs may contribute to CHL. In adults, several classes of drugs can potentially damage or impair the function of the inner ear, including some classes of antibiotics, loop diuretics, salicylates and antimalarial drugs [10,11,12,13]. For example, aminoglycosides are known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptosis in cochlear hair cells [14]. Salicylates impact outer hair cell electromotility and cochlear blood flow, causing reversible hearing changes [15,16]. Loop diuretics impair endolymph production by disrupting ion transport in the stria vascularis of the cochlear duct, leading to a collapse of the endocochlear potential and causing transient, reversible hearing loss [17]. Finally, some antineoplastic agents accumulate in cochlear structures, leading to excessive ROS production and DNA damage in cochlear cells [18]. As most drugs cross the placental barrier [4], specific drugs may affect the development of the fetal inner ear, resulting in CHL. Importantly, the majority of pregnant women are exposed to medications during pregnancy; in 2018, 63.3% of pregnant Danish women redeemed at least one prescription during pregnancy [19] and worldwide prescription drug use during pregnancy ranged from 27% to 93% [20].

There has been no systematic data reviewing the relationship between pregnancy drug exposure and CHL. This knowledge is crucial to reduce preventable causes of HL, allow for early diagnostics and optimise treatment should exposure occur. We aimed to systematically review the literature on the potential association between maternal drug exposure and CHL in children.

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [21,22] and registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 14 February 2023 (registration number CRD42023399514).

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies and case–control studies were included. Reviews, systematic reviews, meta‐analyses, editorials, case reports, case series, cross‐sectional studies, descriptive studies, poster presentations and conference abstracts were excluded due to risk of bias, inability to establish causality and insufficient data.

Studies on pregnant women of all ages were included. Animal studies were excluded.

Studies on the use of all prescribed and over‐the‐counter drugs, regardless of trimester and indication, were included, as were findings on combinations of drugs. Studies of all recreational drugs, alcohol, caffeine, vitamins/supplements or complementary medicine were excluded.

Studies reporting on sensorineural CHL in children as their primary or secondary outcome were included, defined as mild, moderate and severe hearing impairment diagnosed in early childhood due to damage to inner ear structures or central auditory pathways. Studies on hearing loss of all degrees of severity were included. Studies on children with congenital infections or genetically induced hearing loss were excluded.

Studies where intrauterine and postnatal drug exposure in children were reported as combined exposures rather than individually were excluded. Studies reporting hearing loss in conjunction with other outcomes, such as neurodevelopmental outcomes, were also excluded.

As the first author is proficient in English, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Turkish, studies published in these languages were evaluated.

If only an abstract were available, the study was excluded.

PROSPERO and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were searched to identify ongoing or recently completed systematic reviews. The systematic literature search was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines [21,22].

A database search was conducted on Embase, PubMed and Web of Science on 25 January 2023. A second search was conducted on the same databases on 5 September 2024. The search string used in PubMed is shown in AppendixA. A flow diagram of the search and screening process is shown in Figure1.

The specific search strategies were created with assistance from a Health Sciences Librarian with expertise in systematic review searching, with input from the project team. No lower limit for publication dates was applied. Literature search strategies were developed using the medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words related to the subject. The search strings were performed following the PICO strategy [23], using pregnancy (patient), drug exposure (intervention) and HL in children (outcome). Three major medical electronic databases were used: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. To ensure literature saturation, the reference lists of included studies were scanned. See AppendixAfor the search string used in PubMed.

Search results were imported to the reference program EndNote 20 (Clarivate, London, UK), where duplicates were deleted automatically. The literature was then imported into the online program Covidence (Melbourne, Australia) to check for missed duplicates and to support the screening and selection process.

Two reviewers (A.S.K. and M.Ø.T.) independently screened all titles and abstracts using Covidence. The study was excluded if the title and abstract failed to fulfil the predefined eligibility criteria. If the title and abstract met the predefined eligibility criteria, or if eligibility was uncertain, the article was included for full‐text screening. Disagreement between the reviewers was resolved through discussion. Reviewers were not blinded to the journal titles, authors, or institutions. Microsoft Excel was used as the primary data management tool.

Study characteristics (author, publication year, study design, study size, year of conduct, country or continent), patient characteristics (maternal diseases, trimester of exposure and exclusion/matching/adjusting criteria/randomisation method), exposure characteristics (type of drug, dose of drug, number of exposed and non‐exposed pregnant people), outcome characteristics (gestational age at birth, weight at birth, number of children with and without hearing loss), hearing loss characteristics (type of hearing loss, method of diagnosis and age at diagnosis) were extracted by the first author. Data from all included studies reporting effect estimates (odds ratios (OR), risk ratios (RR) or mean differences) for the outcome CHL was extracted, along with corresponding confidence intervals. Studies where OR were either directly reported or where sufficient information (number of participants in each group) was provided to allow us to calculate OR were used to conduct a meta‐analysis.

We present a quantitative analysis using forest plots where sufficient data were available in the included studies, complemented by a narrative of key findings of the included studies in text and tables. We prioritised using the adjusted estimates when they were presented in the studies; if not, we utilised raw estimates. If none were provided but there was sufficient data about exposed and non‐exposed, we calculated the estimates ourselves. We employed a random‐effects model to account for heterogeneity and calculated pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals.

The methodological quality and the risk of bias within the included studies were assessed by the first author using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS) [24] for non‐randomised trials and the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias (ROB2, August 2019 version) [25] for randomised trials. The NOS includes three categories of criteria, giving a total maximum score of 9 points to each study. The ROB2 includes five domains used to grade the risk of bias in the studies, where studies are either graded ‘high risk’, ‘some concerns’ or ‘low risk’.

The quality of evidence for all outcomes was assessed by the first author using The Oxford Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine 2011 (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence [26], where each study is given a score from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest level of evidence (systematic review or [RCTs]) and 5 being the lowest level of evidence (expert opinion without critical appraisal).

The quality assessment scores were used to contextualise the strength of individual studies; but did not influence inclusion or weighting in meta‐analyses. Sensitivity analyses by study quality were not conducted.

A search on PROSPERO did not identify any relevant systematic reviews.

We included four RCTs, 12 cohort studies [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37] and five case–control studies [38,39,40,41,42] (Table1). Four studies were conducted in Asia, three in South America, three at multiple centres worldwide, three in Europe, three in North America, two in Australia/New Zealand and one in Africa.

There were four publications from the 2000s, eight from the 2010s and four from the 2020s.

The 21 studies examined a total of 60 drugs from 13 different categories: corticosteroids alone [32,33,36,41,42,43,44,45], magnesium sulphate alone or in combination with corticosteroids [32,33,40,41,42,47], antibiotics [28,33,39,40,41], antimalarials [27,34,35,39], non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [39,46], antiretrovirals [29], antineoplastic drugs [30], neurological drugs [39], diuretics [39], topical agents [39], attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication [37], drugs not specified [38].

Twelve [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,38,42] of 21 (57%) studies reported the assessment method used to diagnose hearing loss. The methods included otoacoustic emissions (OAE), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEAOE/TOAE), auditory brainstem response (ABR), automated auditory brainstem response (AABR/A‐BAEP) and pure tone audiometry (Table2). In fifteen [27,30,32,33,34,35,36,37,39,42,43,44,45,46,47] of 21 (71%) studies, drug intake was the primary exposure (Table3).

•The study can not exclude the effect of abnormal hearing screening due to incomplete development of the newborn on HL.

•The study did not explore the effect of antenatal steroid use of different doses on development of HL.

•Low number of antenatally exposed children and sample size insufficient to evaluate associations for different types of drugs.

•Based on registry data and cannot include subclinical conditions and does not contain information on alcohol or illegal drug use.

•Risk of misclassification when using redeemed prescriptions to define status of exposure.

•Did not include doses of ADHD medication, which can underestimate exposure time.

• No adjustment for several potential confounders (GA, familiar disposition, perinatal asphyxia, NICU stay, hyperbilirubinaemia, intrauterine infections or genetic HL).

• Four of nine mothers in the exposed group discountinued their drugs during pregnancy but no detailed information on durage of drug use.

• High‐risk and low‐risk infants selected from two different centres, potentially leading to selection bias.

• Small study size of exposed group (n= 18). No information on or adjustment for several potential confounders (GA, familiar disposition, perinatal asphyxia, NICU stay, postnatal aminoglycoside use, intrauterine infections or genetical HL).

• All infants with impaired initial OAE have been treated with unspecified antibiotics for 2 weeks but a possible causal relationship between postnatal antibiotic treatment and HL has not been taken into account.

• Age at diagnoses (2.87 years +/−1.05 years) may be too early to diagnose all with HL.

• The study mainly investigates differences in outcomes in newborns of HIV exposed and HIV non‐exposed mothers, but they also compare the hearing of newborns in the treated vs. non‐treated HIV exposed group. There is therefore no control group of mothers without HIV. Unhealthy children at 1‐month old were excluded, potentially leading to both selection and information bias.

• The data is collected from newborns at a high‐risk centre, and the results can therefore not be extrapolated to general population.

• Pregnancy induced hypertension significantly higher in non‐exposed group (indomethacin).

• Mothers not recieving indomethacin might have presented with advanced preterm labour or delivered due to maternal or fetal indications.

The age at hearing loss diagnosis was provided in 18 studies [27,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,38,39,40,41,43,44,45,46,47] and ranged from a non‐specified age (‘newborn’) to 11 years of age.

An OR or adjusted OR estimate together with 95% confidence intervals was reported for 37 drugs or drug combinations (adjusted factors are presented in Table2). Additionally, the OR for 16 drugs in 10 studies [27,28,30,34,35,37,38,39,43,46] could be calculated using the reported numbers of exposed and non‐exposed cases and controls. A RR estimate together with 95% confidence intervals was reported in two publications for two drug or drug combinations. Results for all studies are summarised in Table1. Whenever ORs were reported or calculated, they were used to perform a meta‐analysis, which was visually displayed using forest plots using the software package R and a random‐effects model.

The overall effect estimate of the meta‐analysis on magnesium sulphate with or without steroids was OR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.42–1.00) in favour of magnesium sulphate or magnesium sulphate in combination with steroids [32,33,41,42,47] (Figure2). The overall effect estimate of the meta‐analysis on betamethasone and systemic corticosteroids given alone was OR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.69–1.08) in favour of systemic corticosteroids [32,33,36,39,41,43,44] (Figure3). One study found an adjusted OR of 1.16 (95% CI: 0.62–2.16) for dexamethasone compared to betamethasone [45].

We identified only two studies on NSAIDs including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Foch et al. [39] first studied the association for antithrombotics as a group and found an overall OR of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.02–1.99). In a subgroup analysis, they found an OR of 1.53 (95% CI: 1.12–2.11) for a daily dosage of ASA ≤ 300 mg and an OR of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.81–1.12) for a daily dosage of ASA > 300 mg and other NSAIDs. An OR of 1.32 (95% CI: 0.27–6.49) for indomethacin was calculated using the numbers reported in the study of Soraisham et al. [46]; a meta‐analysis of ASA and NSAIDs at all doses yields an overall point estimate of OR 1.21 (95% CI: 0.87–1.68) (Figure4).

Six studies investigated the relationship between antenatally administered antibiotics and CHL in children. A number of antibiotics in pregnancy indicated a possible association with HL. A meta‐analysis of all antibiotics together yielded an overall point estimate of OR 1.23 (95% CI: 0.97–1.57) [28,31,33,39,40,41] (Figure5).

This systematic review and meta‐analysis identified 21 studies on antenatal drugs and CHL. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design and exposure. Given the observational design of most studies, causal relationships cannot be inferred due to the inherent risk of confounding, selection bias and lack of randomisation. Therefore, any observed association should be interpreted cautiously.

Key drugs investigated were magnesium sulphate, systemic steroids, ASA and other NSAIDs and antibiotics. Magnesium sulphate and systemic steroids, either alone or in combination, showed potential protective effects. There was modest evidence of an increase in the risk when ASA was given at lower doses but not at higher doses. Several antibiotics, including gentamicin and metronidazole, showed some evidence of an increased risk. Several other drugs showed weaker evidence of an association with CHL, including anti‐neoplastic agents and valproic acid.

Antenatally administered systemic corticosteroids in infants subsequently born preterm are associated with reductions in cerebral palsy, lower risk of neurodevelopmental impairment and lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, possibly due to improved respiratory function and lower rates of intraventricular haemorrhage [48,49,50]. Antenatal corticosteroids may directly protect against congenital sensorineural CHL by reducing inflammation caused by chorioamnionitis [51] and by improving blood circulation to inner ear cells and brain areas regulating hearing. However, antenatal administration of antenatal steroids to women who subsequently deliver at term has been associated with mental and behavioural disorders in children in the long term [52].

Magnesium sulphate, often given with corticosteroids, is used as a neuroprotectant for pregnancies at risk of preterm delivery [53]. Studies on magnesium sulphate primarily focus on mortality and cerebral palsy [54], but magnesium alone has been shown to reduce hearing damage caused by acoustic trauma in guinea pigs [55,56,57]. We speculate that the potential mechanism could be due to its ability to preserve inner hair cells and cochlear function and protect these areas from damage related to prematurity. Another possible mechanism is that magnesium lowers the risk of complications of prematurity and therefore protects against the development of HL in the newborn.

Our systematic review found that low doses (ASA ≤ 300 mg/day), but not high doses (> 300 mg/day) of ASA were associated with hearing loss, based on the study by Foch et al. [39]. This is in contrast with evidence from adults, where high doses of salicylates, commonly used as an analgesic, can induce reversible hearing loss [12,58] through vasoconstriction and ischaemic damage [59]. We hypothesise that this discrepancy may be due to the timing and duration of the exposure, rather than the daily dosage itself. High doses of ASA are typically discontinued in the third trimester due to an increased risk of premature ductal closure [60,61], whereas low doses are typically administered from before the 16th gestational week and throughout the pregnancy to women at risk of preeclampsia. The extended exposure and possibly higher cumulative doses during critical developmental periods could influence fetal physiology, contributing to the higher risk of CHL.

Several antibiotics have well‐documented ototoxic effects in children and adults [58,62]. Aminoglycosides are toxic to inner hair cells of the cochlea, the stria vascularis, marginal cells and spiral ganglion neurons and damage to these structures may contribute to hearing loss [58]. This is in accordance with our findings, which provide some evidence for an association between specific antibiotics, including gentamicin and metronidazole and CHL.

Evidence linking antimalarial drug usage in utero to CHL is limited. A systematic review concluded that it might be the case for not all but for some antimalarials, through loss of outer cochlear hair cells and damage of the neural cells in the cochlea [63]. This could explain the varied results, underlining the necessity of examining these drugs separately rather than as a group.

Previous studies have found an association between treatment with platinum analogues for cancer in children and adults that increases the risk of hearing loss [64,65] through oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in cochlear cells [66,67]. A similar mechanism could affect the foetus when exposed antenatally.

Valproic acid is teratogenic through possible mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, folate antagonism and histone deacetylase inhibition [68,69]. However, there is a lack of evidence of its effect on the development of the inner ear and hearing. We identified only one study [39] investigating this association, suggesting strong evidence of increased risk of CHL following pregnancy exposure to valproic acid.

Dopamine receptors expressed in the cochlea indicate they have a role in auditory function; however, evidence on how they affect hearing development is unclear [70]. This could explain why antenatal exposure to dihydroergocryptine could alter hearing.

For highly active antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS treatment, the study by Fasunla et al. [29] found a strong protective effect (RR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.05–0.32). We speculate that this is due to a direct therapeutic effect on HIV/AIDS, limiting the negative impact of the disease on the development of the fetal ear.

The studies in this systematic review were highly heterogeneous in terms of study size, study design and methods of analysis, making it difficult to systematically compare the studies across all parameters. For some of the exposures, the combined evidence was based on very few exposed, limiting the power of the analyses.

Only four of the 16 studies [43,44,45,47] were RCTs; 12 were cohort studies [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,46] and five were case–control studies [38,39,40,41,42]. Although RCTs are often considered the gold standard for drawing causal inferences due to their better control for confounders [71], they are not feasible or ethical for investigating antenatal drug exposure and hearing loss as the primary outcome in children.

In studies where HL and/or drug exposure are not the primary outcomes, the study design and methods might be more prone to using less specific and thorough methods for assessing these variables, leading to both misclassification and underreporting—for example, in the study by Azizi et al. [38] it is unclear whether all cases and controls were examined by the same diagnostic methods.

This systematic review included studies from 47 different countries. A global survey on newborn hearing screening [72] found that, among these countries, 18 (38.3%) had a universal newborn hearing screening program, 19 (40.4%) did not and for 10 countries (21.3%) the status was unknown. The absence of newborn hearing screening in many countries creates a critical gap in early hearing loss detection. While maternal records often provide detailed information about medical exposures during pregnancy, the lack of early screening means that HL in newborns frequently goes undetected until later in childhood or adulthood. This delay postpones intervention and makes it difficult to link hearing loss to prenatal drug exposure. Over time, this connection becomes less likely to be considered, as other postnatal factors may arise that could contribute to hearing loss.

The definition of hearing loss in all studies ranged from unspecified hearing loss to more specific criteria, such as hearing screening in newborns with OAE and AABR, to more definitive methods like diagnostic ABR and pure‐tone audiometry. The test method also varied, from only using single screening methods (e.g., OAE) to using several diagnostic methods in combination. The age of diagnosis ranged from shortly after birth up to several years. The lack of standardisation in defining and diagnosing cases could cause an over‐ or underrepresentation of cases in each study. Several studies relied on screening tools (e.g., OAE or AABR); this might have produced false positives and very few of the studies followed up with confirmatory audiometry or ABR to confirm sensorineural hearing loss. The inconsistent follow‐up increases the likelihood that some reported cases reflect false‐positive findings rather than true CHL. Conversely, these screening tools may also yield false negatives, potentially underestimating the true prevalence of CHL. Further, as diagnosis of hearing loss may be difficult in newborns and younger children and if diagnosed later may be affected by postnatal contributors to hearing impairment, i.e., traumatic hearing loss, a potential bias may have been introduced in studies with longer follow‐up.

Teratogenicity may be dose‐dependent and related to timing in pregnancy [73], data on drug dosage were limited in the included studies. Furthermore, for the majority of the investigated drugs in the included studies, the trimester of exposure was not reported.

These limitations are likely to have contributed to the inconsistent findings. The prevalence of CHL in the included RCTs ranged from 0.09% to 3% and in the other study designs from 0% to 16.5%. In comparison, the prevalence of CHL requiring treatment is 0.4% in Danish children [74].

To accurately assess the impact of specific drug exposures on hearing, known risk factors for hearing loss must be considered and controlled for in the analysis. Several pre‐, peri‐ and postnatal risk factors associated with early childhood hearing loss include genetic disposition, neonatal intensive care over 5 days, hyperbilirubinaemia requiring exchange transfusion, aminoglycoside administration for over 5 days, congenital infections and several congenital malformations [3]. Many studies included in this systematic review did not systematically assess or exclude children with genetic hearing loss, anatomic malformations or congenital infections, such as CMV. Most included studies adjusted for few or no risk factors (Table2). Genetic hearing loss and congenital infections were exclusion criteria in this review; however, only one study was excluded based on this criterion and most studies did not investigate these causes, potentially inadvertently including these patient groups. The lack of proper adjustment for known confounders in most studies could lead to spurious associations between antenatal drug exposure and CHL.

Many of the drugs administered perinatally are related to the risk of premature birth. Of 21 included studies, seven studies only included preterm infants or children with low birth weight [31,32,33,36,41,42,46]; 13 included either only term or both term and preterm children [27,28,29,30,34,35,37,39,40,43,44,45,47] and one included children of unknown gestational age at birth [38]. Several studies have found a negative association between gestational age, birth weight and neurodevelopmental impairment [75,76]. Drugs like steroids, magnesium sulphate and antibiotics, administered to manage preterm birth risks, may therefore be subject to confounding by indication. For all antenatally administered drugs studied, it is crucial to differentiate between the drug's effects and those of the treated condition on CHL, to avoid confounding by indication. This potential for confounding by indication, particularly in high‐risk pregnancies requiring medical treatment, is a major inherent limitation in evaluating drug‐specific effects.

A further important limitation is that not all studies reported adjusted effect estimates and we therefore used unadjusted effect estimates or calculated crude estimates from available data, potentially increasing the risk of residual confounding. As the unadjusted effect estimates and calculated estimates do not account for known risk factors, the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution and observed associations may potentially be explained by unmeasured confounders.

None of the included studies considered socioeconomic factors, although this may influence health‐seeking behaviour and health literacy, access and drug use in pregnant people and affect child health outcomes.

Most of the included studies did not mention the use of multiple drugs in the interpretation of their results. However challenging, polypharmacy is an important factor when conducting studies on the effects of drug use, as many patients consume multiple medications, either prescribed or over‐the‐counter. Some associations could therefore possibly be due to drug–drug interactions known to be related to polypharmacy.

In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, only 21 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria; many of these studies were of too small a size to detect an association with a rare outcome such as CHL. Although some found associations between the investigated drugs and CHL, none of these results are unfortunately sufficient to draw clinical conclusions.

While screening and evaluating studies in several different languages stated in the Methods section minimises language bias within those languages, it introduces a potential limitation by excluding studies published in other major languages, such as French, Chinese and Spanish. This restriction may potentially have led to the exclusion of relevant findings, reducing the global representativeness of the review. We were able to identify 11 possibly relevant publications that could not be included in the systematic review due to language criteria (AppendixC). Several non‐analytical studies that could potentially contain additional important information were excluded due to study design.

An important limitation in our meta‐analysis was the lack of reporting of effect estimates in some included studies. While the necessary numbers of study participants were provided, we calculated an effect estimate to include in our meta‐analysis. This allowed for a more comprehensive inclusion of available data but also led to unadjusted effect estimates, as we were not able to account for potential confounders that the original studies might have adjusted for in their analyses. Therefore, the pooled effect estimates may overestimate the effect of antenatal exposure to the investigated drug on the development of CHL.

The limitations of the review process highlight the need for a cautious interpretation of our results and underline the need for research using population‐linked data from multiple countries, although this approach cannot account for over‐the‐counter drugs or all confounders. Alternatively, conducting cohort or case–control studies using large registries on sensorineural hearing loss or deafness could be considered, recognising that this method may be prone to bias. Future larger clinical studies should account for the many factors associated with exposure (dosage of drug, trimester of exposure) and outcome (other known risk factors associated with CHL) and explicitly adjust for potential confounders, such as congenital CMV, genetic predisposition, maternal infections and socioeconomic factors. Confounding by indication should also be considered, especially in high‐risk pregnancies where drug exposure is more common. The methods used to diagnose hearing loss should be standardised, e.g., by performing newborn hearing screening and follow up as indicated using gold standard methods and there should be a sufficient time window for follow up, diagnosing all childhood hearing loss cases while excluding cases caused by other factors later in life. Finally, international collaboration using standardised data collection methods could improve sample sizes and generalisability.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis identified several antenatal drugs potentially related to CHL and some that may protect against it, including magnesium sulphate and systemic steroids. We found a reverse dose–response effect of ASA, which may be explained by a cumulative dosage effect or that the fetal ear is more susceptible in the late part of the pregnancy. Several antibiotics, including gentamicin, metronidazole and aminoglycosides, may increase the risk of CHL but part of these associations might be explained by confounding by indication due to the underlying disease. Given the widespread use of drugs during pregnancy and the negative impact of hearing loss on child development, large, rigorous studies are warranted.
