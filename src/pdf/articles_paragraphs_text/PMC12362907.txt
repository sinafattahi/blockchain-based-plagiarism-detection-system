The Cell Biology ofDictyosteliumarticle collection highlights the benefits of usingDictyosteliumas a model system for studying fundamental cellular processes. The studies compiled in this collection showcase the many waysDictyosteliumis used to enhance our understanding of the eukaryotic cell.

For almost a century,Dictyosteliumhas been used as an inexpensive and high-throughput model system for studying conserved cellular and developmental processes. First isolated in the 1930s,Dictyosteliumwas later shown in the 1960s to aggregate in response to cyclic AMP, establishingDictyosteliumas the first eukaryotic model for chemotaxis [1,2]. For most of its life,Dictyosteliumexists in a single-celled state, feeding on bacteria via phagocytosis and dividing mitotically. Upon nutrient depletion, cells elongate and migrate via chemotaxis to form multicellular aggregates that differentiate into fruiting bodies with specialized cell types. Its haploid genome (34 Mb), ease of genetic manipulation, and well-developed biochemical and imaging tools have made it a powerful system for uncovering mechanisms of evolutionarily conserved processes such as cell division, migration, and development, many of which are relevant to human health and disease.

A wide range of tools and resources supportDictyosteliumresearch, providing essential data and materials for investigators. dictyBase serves as a comprehensive database, offering curated genomic information forDictyostelium discoideumand related species [3]. It includes gene sequences, functional annotations, and Gene Ontology terms, along with links to relevant scientific literature that connect articles to specific genes. Additionally, dictyBase provides detailed information onDictyosteliumstrains, mutants, and transgenic cell lines, as well as research protocols, teaching materials, and a Listserv for researcher collaboration. Complementing this, the Dicty Stock Center, housed at Northwestern University, maintains a repository ofDictyosteliumstrains and genetic materials, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility in research. Together, these resources form theDictyosteliumCommunity Resource, integrating both digital and physical components to support the scientific community efficiently.

In addition to dictyBase and the Dicty Stock Center, theDictyosteliumresearch community benefits from several other valuable resources, including dictyExpress, the REMI-Seq Project, and Japan’s National BioResource Project (NBRP). dictyExpress is a web-based tool that enables scientists to explore and analyzeDictyosteliumgene expression data [4]. It allows users to examine gene expression over time, perform clustering analyses, investigate co-expression networks, and conduct Gene Ontology enrichment studies. The REMI-Seq Project builds upon traditional REMI (restriction enzyme-mediated integration) mutagenesis by integrating next-generation sequencing, generating a Genome-WideDictyosteliumInsertion Bank of approximately 23,000 mutants with precisely mapped insertion sites [5]. The NBRP Cellular Slime Mold Project provides essential plasmids and genetic tools, including an all-in-one CRISPR/Cas9 vector for genome editing and genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors like Flamindo (a cAMP sensor) and GCaMP6s (a calcium sensor). These imaging tools allow researchers to visualize intracellular signaling and cellular responses in real time, significantly advancing the study ofDictyosteliumbiology [6].

As mentioned above,Dictyosteliumhas served as a powerful model for elucidating the molecular basis of cell polarity in the context of directed migration, which has direct relevance to the molecular mechanisms underlying immune cell migration, cancer metastasis, and wound healing in more complex eukaryotes. Work inDictyosteliumrevealed that cells detect shallow gradients of cyclic AMP through activation of G protein-coupled receptors, initiating intracellular signaling pathways that amplify the signal and drive cell polarization and aggregation via chemotaxis [7]. Notably, recent studies continue to make important discoveries related toDictyosteliumchemotaxis such as the role of cyclic GMP in regulating myosin II dynamics [8].

In the last few decades, the use ofDictyosteliumhas expanded, with research programs adopting the organism as a model for studying host-pathogen interactions, endocytic mechanisms, autophagy, and the evolution of social behaviour and altruism [9]. The contributions ofDictyosteliumas a human disease model have been particularly significant with recent studies using the organism to study a wide range of diseases including, but not limited to acute respiratory distress syndrome, tuberculosis, and various forms of neurodegeneration [10–12]. Additionally, althoughDictyosteliumevolved after the plant-animal split, some aspects of its life cycle support an evolutionary link to plants. For example,Dictyosteliumproduces and uses cytokinins, which are growth-regulating hormones in plants, to regulate various aspects of its life cycle [13]. The multi-faceted uses ofDictyosteliumshowcase the many benefits of studying the organism and its practical applications that range from understanding how cells evolved to examining the impacts of cellular dysfunction on human health [14,15].

In conclusion, the applications ofDictyosteliumdemonstrate its utility as a model system and how it contributes to knowledge in cell biology. As research withDictyosteliumcontinues to progress, it is anticipated that the organism will continue to provide novel insight into signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms that govern fundamental cellular and developmental processes. We look forward to the Cell Biology ofDictyosteliumcollection bringing together the most innovative new research using this one-of-a-kind organism with the aim of showcasing its immense contributions to cell biology.
