Augmented reality (AR) can provide rich interactive experiences by integrating virtual information with the real environment, showing great potential in healthcare, especially in nursing. However, the current applications and effectiveness of AR in nursing have not been comprehensively summarized. This scoping review aims to identify existing studies on the applications of AR in nursing and evaluate its effectiveness across different domains.

A scoping review was performed following the Arksey and O’Malley framework. A systematic literature search was conducted from the database inception to December 2024 in the following nine electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, China Biomedical Database, PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature(CINAHL). Two researchers independently conducted the literature search, selection, and data extraction.

The preliminary literature search yielded 4158 articles, and 41 studies were included in the final analysis. Head-mounted displays were the most popular AR devices (n= 20). AR applications in nursing were categorized into three primary domains: nursing education, clinical nursing, and tele-nursing. Among these, 66% (27/41) of the studies explored application scenarios of AR in nursing education. Several studies included demonstrated that AR could significantly enhance participants’ theoretical knowledge, critical thinking skills, self-confidence, and learning motivation (P< 0.05). It had also shown positive effects on improving patient rehabilitation exercises, alleviating preoperative anxiety, improving social behaviour of children with autism, and facilitating remote visits and guidance (P< 0.05). Participants consistently thought the AR intervention was feasible, showing a high satisfaction rate. Finally, AR remains controversial in terms of skill performance and self-regulated learning ability. Due to methodological limitations, some studies did not identify the effects of AR.

These findings show that AR has positive applications in nursing education, clinical nursing, and remote nursing, with broad satisfaction, acceptability, and feasibility, especially in nursing education. However, existing studies remain controversial. Future studies should focus on high-quality randomized controlled trials, standardized evaluation indicators, and long-term evaluations to strengthen the evidence base for AR applications in nursing.

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays computer-generated virtual elements on real-world environments, effectively blending the digital and physical realms [1]. It is characterized by three core features: the integration of virtual and real components, real-time interactivity, and three-dimensional spatial registration [2]. Unlike virtual reality, which immerses users entirely in a digital environment, AR superimposes digital content on the real world [3]. Through head-mounted displays, mobile devices, and projection systems, AR integrates digital images, text, and animations into users’ physical surroundings, enabling a seamless and authentic experience of virtual elements in real environments [4]. Moreover, users can interact meaningfully with these 3D digital objects, enhancing the relevance and impact of their engagement.

In recent years, AR has demonstrated considerable promise in healthcare, offering innovative solutions in clinical practice, medical education, and patient care by integrating digital information into physical settings. In the field of nursing, AR has shown high levels of acceptability, feasibility, and practical utility [5], with growing recognition of its potential benefits [6]. For instance, studies have reported that AR interventions can effectively reduce preoperative anxiety in patients [7,8]. Additionally, Hill et al. [9] conducted a case-control study demonstrating that AR-guided negative pressure wound therapy significantly reduced complications, hospital readmissions, and unplanned surgical revisions through remote clinician support using 3D visual aids.

Beyond patient care, AR has emerged as a valuable tool in nursing education. It has been used for training in specialized procedures [10–12] and has contributed to improving students’ theoretical knowledge [13–15]. However, despite its potential, the adoption of AR in nursing remains inconsistent, with significant variation in application strategies across specialties and healthcare settings. The heterogeneity in interventions, control conditions, and outcome measures presents challenges for systematic evaluation and underscores the need for a broader, more exploratory review approach [16].

Unlike systematic reviews, which address narrowly defined clinical questions, scoping reviews are particularly well-suited to examining emerging fields by mapping the existing body of evidence and identifying research gaps [17]. A preliminary search revealed that only two scoping reviews have been conducted specifically on AR in nursing. One, published in 2018, offered a general overview of AR in nursing [6], while another by Stavropoulou et al. [5] focused on AR applications in intensive care unit nursing education. Other scoping reviews have examined AR use in more specialized areas such as surgery [18], patient education [19], critical care [20], and emergency medicine [21], however, few have comprehensively addressed AR’s broader implications for nursing practice overall. Moreover, the rapid advancement of AR technology—particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic—demands a renewed exploration of its applications in nursing. This includes not only educational uses but also clinical practice and direct patient care.

The objective of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current AR applications in nursing. By synthesizing the available evidence, this review aims to (1) identify existing research gaps, (2) assess the effectiveness of AR interventions in various nursing contexts, and (3) offer recommendations for future research and practical implementation. This review will contribute to the growing literature on AR in nursing and support the development of evidence-based guidelines for integrating AR technologies into nursing education and clinical practice.

This scoping review is based on the review report framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley [22]. The framework of this method comprises five stages: (1) identifying the study question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting studies; (4) charting the data; and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Additionally, we reported the findings following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist [23] to ensure rigour and transparency in the reporting process. Open Science Framework registration number: org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4NHWU.

Two key search concepts, including “AR” and “nursing”, were identified. Subsequently, the search strategies for the two concepts were systematically developed by expanding keywords through variations in terminology, truncations, and abbreviations. Finally, the Boolean operator was applied to combine the recognized keywords “augmented reality” AND “nursing”. The Chinese and English search terms related to the two main concepts and the detailed search strategy in PubMed is illustrated in Tables1and2, respectively.

The inclusion criteria were structured using the PCC framework [24]. The population (P) focused on registered nurses, nursing students, or patients receiving AR-based care or rehabilitation therapies. The concept (C) focused on validating the effectiveness of AR technology in nursing. Specifically, studies were required to clearly describe the relevance or potential impact on nursing practice, nursing education, or clinical nursing. The context (C) was any type of clinical or educational setting or participants’ residences. Additionally, the types of included evidence sources were primary research studies (eg, randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental, cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, or case report) using qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods approaches. Given the cultural and language background of the authors, only articles published in English or Chinese were included.

Studies were excluded if they (1) were not available in full text; (2) focused on the development or design of programmes/systems; (3) were reviews, newsletters, system evaluations, or meta-analyses; (4) were conference abstracts or clinical registry trials without reported results; or (5) were duplicates of published literature.

The PRISMA-ScR checklist, which comprises a flow diagram, was used in this study. This flow diagram illustrates the changes in the number of literature screens and reasons for exclusions, enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of the study [23].

Excel was used to create a data extraction template. Two researchers independently extracted data from the included studies, with discrepancies resolved by a third researcher. The data extraction template included the following items: author, country, publication date, study topic, type of study design, purpose of study, sample size, study participants, AR device, intervention setting, intervention contents of intervention and control groups, measurement indicators, and conclusion.

Descriptive statistics were used to present the data in tables, which aligned with the review objective. Additionally, a narrative synthesis was used to explore the current state of AR in nursing, the AR devices employed, and the effectiveness of AR in different areas in tabular form.

After conducting an extensive search of selected databases and grey literature sources, the preliminary literature search yielded 4158 records, comprising 440 Chinese and 3718 English records. After removing duplicates, 3703 studies were screened for title, abstract, and full text according to the eligibility criteria. Ultimately, 41 studies were included for analysis. Fig.1presents the process of selecting these studies and the final inclusion.

Most of the included studies were conducted in Asia (n= 24). Specifically, 12 studies were published by authors from China, three from Japan, six from South Korea, one from Iran, one from Turkey, and one from Egypt. This was followed by North America (n= 14), with 13 studies from the United States and one from Canada. Additionally, two studies were conducted in Europe (the United Kingdom and Spain). One study occurred in the Middle East (Israel). The main trends in geographic distribution are depicted in Fig.2to highlight the regional differences in AR applications.

The publication years of included studies ranged from 2017 to 2024, with more than 90% of the studies published since 2020. Regarding the type of study design, approximately 53% of the studies (n= 21) employed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 40% (n= 16) of the studies used a quasi-experimental approach. Furthermore, three studies used mixed-methods approaches, and one study was a case report. The total study population of the included studies was 3655 participants, with individual study sample sizes ranging from 1 to 566 participants (See Table3).

Applications of AR in nursing were categorized into three primary domains: nursing education, clinical nursing, and tele-nursing. Among the identified studies, 27 explored the application scenarios of AR innursing education, including applications in CPR training [25–29], AR-based teaching [14,30–40], first-aid training [13,41], basic nursing procedures [10–12,42–44], affective training [45] and simulations and assessments [46]. Eight studies applied AR toclinical nursing, focusing on alleviating preoperative anxiety [7,8,15,47], rehabilitation exercises [48–50], and improving social functioning for children with autism [51]. Six publications explored the value of AR intele-nursing, including remote visitation [52], remote guidance (primarily for remote wound care) [9,53–55], and remote training [56].

AR can be used through a range of devices, broadly divided into two categories: mobile devices and head-mounted displays (HMDs). Mobile devices typically include smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches, while HMDs include different types of smart glasses, Microsoft HoloLens, and AR headsets [57]. Among the 41 studies analysed, HMDs were the most popular AR devices (n= 20). Specifically, Microsoft HoloLens was the most used device, appearing in 14 studies. Other HMDs included in the studies were smart glasses (n= 5) and AR headsets (n= 1). Regarding mobile devices, six studies used mobile AR applications deployed on smartphones. Twelve studies involved AR software or systems, including UNITY3D, Vuforia Engine, 360° photospheres, AR-PFAES applications, AR-CPR systems, UINCARE Home RV (Uincare Co), the Selfit system, the CPReality system, an AR remote guidance system, and an augmented reality situational simulation system. Two studies did not specify the AR devices [32,33]. One study combined Google Glass and a smartphone app [51], where Google Glass provided facial expression recognition and social cues to children, while the smartphone app functioned as a control centre for managing the Google Glass systems [51]. Table4presents a detailed categorization of AR devices and application domains across the included studies.

The included studies showed that AR technology held great application potential in nursing education, clinical nursing, and tele-nursing. Table5summarizes the significant findings of AR in different nursing domains.

In nursing education, AR intervention effects were primarily evaluated through the theoretical knowledge test, skill performance, critical thinking, satisfaction with using AR learning, participant anxiety, self-learning ability, and self-confidence. Several studies confirmed that AR significantly improved participants’ theoretical knowledge level [13,14,30–33,37,42], skill performance [13,14,25,26,30,33,42,44], critical thinking skills [28,30], and self-confidence [12,13], and increase their motivation [28,42] (P< 0.05). Nonetheless, some studies reported no significant differences in specific skill tests (e.g, endotracheal aspiration) [10], and self-regulated learning competency [30,36]. To be specific, Jiwon et al. [36]found that the self-regulated learning competency of the control group was higher than that of the AR group. Regarding participant satisfaction, 11 studies evaluated participants’ satisfaction with using AR. Compared to traditional teaching approaches, students in the AR group expressed higher satisfaction with teaching [14,31–33], with satisfaction rates of 84% to 98% [10,30,34,37].

Regardingnursing training, AR technology was applied in various nursing training scenarios, including surgical collaboration [44], ventilator settings [12], and CPR training [26–28]. Three studies on AR-CPR training revealed that significant improvements in healthcare workers’ CPR performances [26], critical thinking skills [28], and feasibility of training [27]. However, Leary et al. [29] conducted a RCT demonstrating that AR-CPR training applications did not improve CPR quality compared to a standard audio-visual feedback manikin among healthcare providers (P>0.05). Eight studies could not definitively determine the intervention effect of AR due to methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes [34], a lack of control groups [27,38,40,43,46], and pre-test and post-test comparisons [39,45], and failed to separate comparisons of AR effects [11].

Included in the study, the effects of AR interventions in clinical nursing were evaluated across perioperative anxiety, patient satisfaction, rehabilitation exercises, and social behaviour. Specifically, four studies using AR for patients’ preoperative education showed that AR significantly reduced patients’ preoperative anxiety [7,8,15,47] (P< 0.05). However, one study found no significant effect on postoperative anxiety and pain [7] (P>0.05). For rehabilitation exercises, three studies demonstrated that AR-based systems improved balance [49,50] and reduced fear of falling in stroke patients [49]. Similarly, one study showed that an AR-based exercise system could improve patients’ self-efficacy [48] (P< 0.05). AR technology also showed promise in enhancing social behaviour among patients with autism by promoting facial engagement and emotion recognition [51]. Overall, AR interventions consistently showed higher patient satisfaction rates. Only one participant experienced an adverse effect during rehabilitation exercises with the AR system; fortunately, the patient had no significant neurological sequelae [49].

The evaluations of the effectiveness of AR technology in tele-nursing included patients’ anxiety and depression, the incidence of adverse events, the prognosis of pressure injuries, and defibrillation success rates. Particularly, one study combining 5 G and AR for remote visitation reported improvements in anxiety and depression, reduced adverse events, and higher satisfaction among ICU patients [52] (P< 0.05). One study revealed that expert telematics support via Google Glass improved CPR success rates and task completion times in simulated clinical settings [56]. Similarly, three studies using an AR teleguidance system for wound care revealed that teleguidance improved the prognosis for pressure injuries [9] and could provide effective treatment for wounds [55], with high interrater reliability (98% for intrarater assessment and 100% for treatment plan interrater reliability) [54]. However, three studies [53–55] could not determine the effect of AR due to the lack of a control group.

Our scoping review investigated the applications and effectiveness of AR in nursing, focusing on its use in various domains, particularly nursing education. The United States led in study contributions, probably due to early software advances such as Microsoft’s HoloLens, Unity, and Unreal Engine, fostering a robust AR ecosystem. In China, AR has gained prominence, with 66% (8/12) of studies applied to nursing education. Over 90% of studies were published since 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic’s push for telemedicine [58]and the November 2019 release of Microsoft HoloLens 2 [59]. Although AR has gained attention in recent years, the integration of AR in nursing remains limited, particularly in clinical nursing and tele-nursing. This might be due to the insufficient evidence of its effectiveness. Several included studies were conducted with a small sample size, which might reduce the statistical power and limit the generalisability of the results. Comparably, the lack of control groups may prevent the inference of causality, affecting the reliability of the results. In order to improve the generalisability and reliability of the results, future studies should adopt rigorous research designs, particularly randomised controlled trials with sufficient sample sizes, to test the effectiveness of AR in nursing.

Our scoping review identified three primary themes in the application of AR technology in nursing: nursing education, clinical nursing, and tele-nursing. Overall, the application of AR was mainly focused on nursing education, and participants had positive attitudes towards AR-based applications, consistent with previous reviews in nursing [5,6]. Additionally, several of the included studies showed statistically significant differences in the effectiveness of AR applications in improving theoretical knowledge, skills, critical thinking skills, and confidence (P<0.05). By superimposing virtual information on real-world environments, AR can create diverse and immersive clinical scenarios, enhancing students’ understanding of complex nursing concepts [60]. Similarly, AR technology can simulate various clinical scenarios, providing participants with opportunities to practise procedures in a safe environment. However, the effects of AR on skill performance and self-regulated learning remain debated. Several studies [13,14,25,30,33,42] reported improvements in skill performance with AR. However, Arakida et al. [10] and Leary et al. [29] found no significant differences in endotracheal suctioning and CPR performance between AR-based and control groups (P>0.05). The inconsistent findings may be explained by the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM), which emphasizes that perceived usefulness and ease of use are key factors in promoting the use of new technologies. Limited tactile feedback and the novelty of AR interfaces may reduce users’ perception of the usefulness and ease of use [10,29]. In addition, AR devices, participants’ experience, and research design may also be potential confounding factors.

Similarly, Longjiao W [30] and Jiwon et al. [36] found that AR-based teaching did not significantly improve independent learning abilities (P>0.05). A systematic review revealed [61] that the development of self-regulated learning competence is influenced by the interaction environment, personal influence, and learning attributes. Therefore, these differences may be due to first, the intervention period was too short to improve self-regulated learning skills. Second, students’ prior knowledge, experience, and expectations toward AR may influence the outcomes. Third, the differences in virtual environment settings may affect users’ engagement and self-directed learning behaviours [36]. These findings highlight that the effectiveness of AR in nursing education is influenced by various contextual factors. Further studies should consider the teaching environment, students’ learning styles, expectations of AR technology, and standardize AR teaching programme design to evaluate the effectiveness of AR in skill performance and self-regulated learning abilities.

AR technology also holds significant potential in fostering ethical development in nursing education. Nakazawa et al. [45] developed an AR-based nursing communication training system, which enabled participants to interact with a simulated patient, whose facial expressions and gaze direction were dynamically controlled based on the students’ movements. This immersive experience enabled participants to practise empathy and communication skills in a controlled environment, receiving real-time affective feedback on their performance. The results showed that the AR group significantly improved in empathy scores compared to the control group (P= 0.030). However, this study only conducted pre- and post-tests without comparative analysis between the two groups, making the AR effect uncertain. Future studies should focus on the role of AR in ethics education, integrating AR-based teaching into humanities courses such as narrative medicine, ethical literacy, and patient-centred care. Meanwhile, a curriculum system that closely integrates nursing technology and humanities should be established, evaluating its effectiveness in improving nursing students’ moral competence, empathy, and moral decision-making.

In clinical nursing, AR technology provides an engaging multimedia approach, positively impacting preoperative anxiety and exercise rehabilitation. AR enhances patients’ understanding of surgical processes, familiarizes them with the environment, and boosts their sense of control [7], while offering interactive guidance to reduce preoperative anxiety [8]. However, its limited effect on postoperative anxiety and pain may stem from subjective patient-reported outcomes and small sample sizes [7]. In rehabilitation, AR shows promise for stroke patients, aligning with Vinolo et al.’s meta-analysis [62], by providing realistic practice and real-time visual feedback, which boosts motivation and mobility [49,50,63]. Patients generally report high satisfaction and acceptability of AR interventions, although intervention duration and frequency vary. Future research should explore the long-term effects and tolerability of AR in nursing care.

The results of this study showed that AR technology holds significant value in tele-nursing, particularly in remote visitation, guidance, and training. AR remote technology has made notable contributions since the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, AR enables real-time expert guidance by superimposing experts’ gestures and markers on the operator’s screen via image fusion, enabling simultaneous viewing of real-time scene and expert information [64]. This reduces infection risks for healthcare professionals and improves the practice efficiency [53]. Additionally, AR technology has been applied in telewound care [9,54,55], which enables expert nurses in telemedicine centres to guide bedside nurses in remote settings through the assessment and treatment process. Although existing studies have shown that AR in remote wound care is clinically reliable, is comparable to bedside assessments, and positively impacts the prognosis of patients receiving wound care, they are limited by small sample sizes and a lack of high-quality RCT evidence. Future research should explore the effects of this technology in diverse clinical wound settings to enhance its generalizability.

Although AR technology has shown promise in nursing, several limitations and safety concerns were identified across the included studies. First, technical challenges were commonly reported. Difficulties with operating systems, software installation, and unstable network connections were noted in two studies [43,48]. Second, issues existed concerning user comfort and safety. Some students experienced adverse reactions when using AR devices, including dizziness, disorientation, eye fatigue, and distraction [7,10,41]. These symptoms may affect participants’ experiences and reduce the effectiveness of the training. Third, the high cost of AR devices, insufficient teacher training, and policy barriers limit the widespread adoption of AR technology in resource-limited settings [65]. Therefore, future studies should focus on user feedback related to the usability, safety, and comfort of AR devices. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary collaboration should be conducted to develop AR devices ergonomically designed and tailored to nursing needs. Finally, cost-effectiveness analyses should be conducted to inform policymaking and implementation.

Firstly, quality assessment of the included studies was not performed in this review since this was optional for the scoping review [66]. This may contribute to variability in the quality of the included studies, limiting the reliability of these findings. Secondly, although we searched various Chinese and English databases and the grey literature, only Chinese and English studies were analysed due to language limitations, overlooking studies from regions such as Europe or Latin America. This may lead to a global perspective bias and limit the applicability of our findings in different cultural and clinical contexts. Finally, standard evaluation tools for the effectiveness of AR in nursing were lacking, and the evaluation indicators of the included studies were diverse and unsystematic, hindering the synthesis and comparison of the results.

In the future, large-sample, multicentre, rigorously designed RCTs should be conducted, as well as prioritizing longitudinal studies to identify the long-term effects of AR in nursing. Additionally, future research could conduct multilingual reviews and strengthen collaboration with international researchers, which would accelerate the integration of AR technology into global nursing practice. Finally, future studies should develop standardized evaluation criteria for assessing the effectiveness of AR, such as the adoption of validated scales to assess knowledge or skill performance, and use the System Usability Scale to assess user experience [67]. Researchers can also adopt the Kirkpatrick model to evaluate the AR effect in terms of four dimensions: reaction, learning, behaviour, and results [68].

This scoping review synthesizes the applications and effectiveness of AR in nursing, highlighting its significant potential in nursing education, clinical nursing, and tele-nursing. In summary, the application of AR in nursing is feasible and acceptable. HMDs emerged as the most used AR hardware. AR, as an innovative teaching tool, can enhance students’ theoretical knowledge, confidence, motivation, and satisfaction. In clinical nursing, AR technology has contributed to alleviating patients’ preoperative anxiety and improving the effectiveness of their rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, AR technology has demonstrated positive effects in remote visitation and guidance. However, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the use of AR simulation technology in improving skills and self-regulated learning competency. Future research should prioritize rigorously designed RCTs and longitudinal studies, while conducting cost-effectiveness analyses to provide evidence for future clinical implementation. Future studies should use validated scales or combine the Kirkpatrick model to evaluate AR effects. In addition, future studies should further explore the role of AR in ethics education, with a focus on integrating AR technology into humanistic nursing to improve patient care outcomes.
