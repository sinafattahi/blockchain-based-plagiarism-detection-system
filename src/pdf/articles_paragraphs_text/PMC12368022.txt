Fourth-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase are in development to overcome common resistance mutations. We performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) of the EGFR kinase domain in the context of L858R by introducing a saturation library of ~17,000 variants into Ba/F3 cells. DMS library-expressing cells were exposed to osimertinib or BLU-945 to identify escape mutations. L718X mutations were enriched across all conditions. BLU-945 specific mutations included K714R, K716T, L718V, T725M, K728E, K754E/N, N771S/T, T783I, Q791L/K, G863S, S895N, K929I, and M971L. A secondary DMS screen combining osimertinib and BLU-945, exclusively enriched for L718X mutations. Clinically, L718X mutations emerged in two patients treated with BLU-945. One patient with baseline EGFR L858R and L718Q mutations experienced early progression. Another with baselineEGFRL858R, T790M, and C797S acquired an L718V mutation at progression. This study demonstrate how comprehensive resistance profiling of targeted therapies can predict clinically relevant mutations and guide rational combinations to delay or prevent resistance.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for ~40% of primary lung cancer1, with most patients presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease2,3. Molecular profiling of LUAD has identified driver mutations in over 80% of cases3, with mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) among the most common4. Incidence in patients with Asian ancestry is 40–55%, notably higher than the 5–15% frequency observed in Caucasians5. The majority of EGFR mutations occur in the kinase domain and manifest as short 3–7 amino acid deletions in exon 19 (ex19del) or as an L858R (p.Leu858Arg) missense mutation encoded in exon 216,7. Less common mutations such as G719X (p.Gly719X) and small insertions in exon 20 account for the remainder6. These mutations cause constitutive activation of EGFR, leading to unchecked cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and the promotion of metastasis8.

Targeting mutant EGFR with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has proven to be an effective therapeutic strategy in EGFR mutant LUAD, leading to multiple FDA approvals9–12. The first- generation TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib target the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain, effectively inhibiting downstream signaling13. Both gefitinib and erlotinib demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with tumors harboring EGFR L858R and ex19del alterations11. Despite initial clinical responses, acquired resistance frequently developed within one year14. A dominant mechanism of resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs is the T790M (p.Thr790Met) Gatekeeper mutation, which abolishes TKI binding while retaining kinase activity15,16.

One current standard of care for treatment-naïve EGFR mutant LUAD is osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, that was developed to overcome the T790M Gatekeeper mutation17. Osimertinib covalently target C797, inhibiting EGFR ex19del and L858R irrespective of the presence of T790M while sparing wild type EGFR18. Despite initial efficacy, 7–26% of patients develop resistance to osimertinib by acquiring additional second-site mutations that are enriched in an allele specific manner19,20. EGFR L858R typically escapes osimertinib through L718Q/V (p.Leu718Gln/Val) mutations while ex19del tends to escapeviaC797S (p.Cys797Ser), which destroys the cystine nucleophile required for covalent binding of osimertinib21.

A diverse range of resistance mechanisms not attributable to second site mutations have also been described. These include activation of bypass signaling pathways, such as MET amplification-medicated resistance, which occurs in 7–15% following first-line osimertinib therapy22, as well as histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC)23,24. Other identified mechanisms include EGFR amplification and mutations in downstream effectors such asKRAS, BRAF, andPIK3CA19. Notably, these aberrations can co-occur within the same tumor and co-exist with on target EGFR mutations, underlying the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor evolution and the emergence of resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy19.

For C797S -trans T790M mutations, where C797S and T790M are encoded on different alleles, combinations of first- and third-generation TKIs have shown some efficacy in preclinical models18. Conversely, in C797S -cis T790M mutations, where C797S and T790M are on the same allele, combination of first-generation TKIs with osimertinib are ineffective18. These data suggest that suppression of allelic diversity within cells or tumor cell populations may be an important consideration in the development of novel EGFR TKIs.

Fourth-generation ATP competitive EGFR TKIs are designed to retain efficacy in the context of C797S25–27mutations; however, the landscape of potential second-site mutation liabilities associated with these inhibitors remains unknown28,29. BLU-945 is an investigational fourth-generation EGFR TKI designed to target EGFR T790M and EGFR T790M/C797S mutations that confer resistance to first-, second- and third-generation TKIs30. Unlike osimertinib which binds covalently to the C797 residue, the scaffold of BLU-945 allows it to adopt a conformation that fits within the ATP binding pocket of EGFR in the presence of the C797S mutation while sparing wild-type EGFR30. BLU-945 has been evaluated clinically as a monotherapy and in combination with osimertinib in previously treated patients with EGFR driven LUAD31.

In this study, we aimed to identify potential mutational resistance mechanisms to BLU-945 using deep mutational scanning to assess the functional impact of thousands of EGFR mutations in parallel. We screened a DMS library of mutant cDNAs covering the EGFR L858R kinase domain to saturation in the context of a panel of EGFR TKIs to systematically profile all possible amino acid substitutions and their downstream effects.

We generated a DMS library encompassing the EGFR L858R kinase domain encoded by a lentiviral transfer vector that co-expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP)viainternal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (Fig.1A). The library was generated using a mutagenic PCR approach, which relies on oligonucleotide primer pools encoding degenerate codons32–34. Each codon in the 804 bp target region can be mutated to one of 63 possible codons, including stop codons, resulting in a library of 16,884 potential variants (268 amino acids × 63 possible codons). The library consists of over 1 × 107primary clones, which corresponds to >500× representation over the theoretical number of variants. Sanger sequencing of individual clones indicated an average of 1.14 mutations per cDNA (Fig.1B). The plasmid library was sequenced using barcoded error correction and showed negligible mutational bias in transitions and transversions (Fig.1C). 16,882 unique variants were recovered, corresponding to >99.9% saturation with >99% of variants observed >10 times (Fig.1D). The abundance of codon variants was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 168 unique observations (Fig.1E). The EGFR L858R DMS library was packaged in VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus at large scale and concentrated by centrifugation. The titer of the lentiviral library was 2 × 107transduction units (TU) as determined by detection of GFP expression by flow cytometry. The total TU corresponded to ~1185 × representation.

We conducted all screens in Ba/F3 cells, a murine pro-B cell line dependent on extracellular interleukin-3 (IL-3) for survival. Upon transduction with potent oncogenes, these cells become dependent on the introduced oncogene for mitogenic signaling35. Ba/F3 cells were transduced at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI ~ 0.1) to bias toward single integrations while achieving >1000-fold representation of the library33,36. After allowing 7 days for provirus integration and EGFR L858R mutant protein expression, IL-3 was withdrawn from the culture media. This established a selective pressure under which Ba/F3 cell survival depended on the signaling activity of transduced EGFR mutants37. Cells expressing viable EGFR variants were expected to survive without IL-3, while those harboring non-functional or deleterious mutations, or that were not transduced, were outcompeted and depleted from the population. After 14 days of IL-3 withdrawal, over 95% of the surviving Ba/F3 cells were GFP positive, consistent with positive selection of the transduced pool (Fig.1F)36,38,39. The resulting EGFR L858R DMS library-expressing Ba/F3 cells were subsequently challenged with various EGFR inhibitors or DMSO for 14 days, with regular replenishment of compounds to maintain consistent drug pressure. At the end of the treatment period, gDNA was harvested and subjected to deep sequencing with error correction as previously described36to identify outgrowing clones. These enriched variants were interpreted as candidate resistance mutations (Fig.1G).

To address whether known resistance mutations could be recovered from the previously introduced Ba/F3 DMS pool, we exposed the EGFR L858R DMS library-expressing Ba/F3 cells to osimertinib at 100 nM (>EC90of osimertinib) over a 14-day period with regular replenishment of drug to maintain consistent pressure Independent biological replicates demonstrated high concordance in the enriched variant profiles, supporting the reproducibility of the results. Among the osimertinib-treated samples, L718X (p. Leu718X) mutations were enriched compared to control (Supplementary1A, B). As L718X is the dominant resistance mutation to osimertinib in the context of EGFR L858R oncogenic driver mutation, these results validate the validity of our screening approach.

We next employed the same screening workflow in the context of BLU-945 at 100 nM (>EC90) for 14 days with regular drug replenishment. Endpoint samples were harvested, gDNA was extracted, and deep sequencing was performed as above. In contrast to the osimertinib screen, we identified numerous potential resistance mutations for BLU-945 (Fig.2A). Candidate resistance mutations clustered in the hinge region amino acids Q791 and M793, which form hydrogen bonds with the adenosine ring of ATP40. Q791L/K and M793X mutations are supported as likely resistance mutations by structural evidence of a previously published co-crystal structure of the BLU-945 analog ‘compound 24’ and EGFR kinase domain (PDB:8D76)30. The amino-naphthyridine NH group of BLU-945 forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Q791, while the naphthyridine N2 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of M793, stabilizing the inhibitor-kinase complex. We conclude that the results of the screen are consistent with the binding mode of BLU-945.

DMS screens explore all potential mutations at each amino acid position that are compatible with sustained EGFR L858R signaling, including complex codon changes that are less likely to occur in patients. We focused on amino acid changes that could arise from a single nucleotide substitution (Hamming distance = 1) from the wild-type codon. After filtering, Q791L/K mutations remain while M793X are removed, suggesting that mutations to M793 would be a less likely escape mechanism (Fig.2B). We identified the following mutations as resistance mutations that can arise through single base mutations: K714R (p.Lys714Arg), K716T (p.Lys716Thr), L718V (p.Leu718Val), T725M (p.Thr725Met), K728E (p.Lys728Glu), K754E/N (p.Lys754Glu/Asn), N771S/T (p.Asn771Ser/Thr), T783I (p.Thr783Ile), Q791L/K (p.Gln791Leu/Lys), G863S (p.Gly863Ser), S895N (p.Ser895Asn), K929I (p.Lys929Ile), and M971L (p.Met971Leu). Several of these mutations have been observed clinically, such as K714R41, L718V42, T725M43, K728E44, T751P45,46, K754E/N47,48, and N771S49.

When viewing BLU-945 mutations in the context of kinase domain structure, several patterns become apparent (Fig.2C). First, mutations tend to be clustered in the N lobe and hinge regions of the kinase domain, which play a comparatively larger role in the catalytic activity of EGFR than the C lobe. Second, we observed frequent mutations in lysine residues in the β1-3 strands of the N lobe. Third, we see a cluster of mutations in the region between the αC-helix and β4-5 strands involving N771 and P772, two residues involved in ex20ins variants50. We suspect that these point mutations in this region might distort P-loop and αC-helix conformation in a manner that indirectly affects BLU-945 binding.

Many of the mutations highlighted here involve contact residues that are affinity determinants of BLU-945 (Fig.2D). Notably, Q791 and M793 hinge contact points were present in compound 7, an early lead compound in the BLU-945 discovery campaign30, while other mutations such as K716T and K728E involve residues engaged by the sulfone group characteristic of compound 24 and eventually BLU-945, developed late in the medicinal chemistry program. The large number of potential mutational escape routes for BLU-945 relative to osimertinib may be due to a greater number of required binding affinity determinants. Importantly, residues most critical for BLU945 binding, and therefore most vulnerable to resistance mutations, tend to cluster around the ATP binding pocket occupied by the inhibitor. These include contact residues such as K716, K728, L718, and Q791.

Not observed in the screen were mutations to the back pocket residue K745, which forms a hydrogen bond with the piperidinol ring of BLU-94530. Molecular interactions with K745 are a common and distinct feature of reversible, fourth-generation ATP-competitive EGFR kinase inhibitors40. We suspect that K745 mutations are not observed since this residue is the conserved “catalytic lysine” which is necessary to form a salt bridge with E762 in the kinase active state that is essential for phosphoryl transfer activity51.

In addition to mutations of key contact point residues, DMS identified L718V as a key resistance mutation to BLU-945, like the osimertinib screen. Structurally, L718 is positioned in the first β-strand (β1) of the N-lobe near the ATP-binding site. Given the higher clinical prevalence of L718Q over L718V in patients with L858R-mutant EGFR, we sought to further characterize the structural impact of the L718Q variant. To this end, we conducted all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and absolute binding free energy perturbation (ABFEP) calculations, using structures modeled on PDB: 8D76. We hypothesized that isoform-specific dynamics in the apo state modulate the architecture of the binding pocket and influence BLU-945 affinity.

Our 100 ns MD simulations showed that the L718Q mutation induces the greatest conformational perturbation in the binding site, particularly within the P-loop, as quantified by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analyses (Supplementary1C, D). Overlay of the most populated MD conformers with the ligand-bound structure revealed a steric clash between the Q718 side chain and BLU-945, suggesting impaired binding compatibility (Fig.2E, F).

To test whether any resistance mutations identified in the primary screen were sufficient to confer resistance to BLU-945, we chose to focus on the Q791L hinge mutation given its importance in the primary screen for BLU-945 and the relative ease of mutation at that site as well as L718Q, since this mutation is most frequently identified as a resistance mutation in patients with L858R mutations30,52. We generated individual Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing candidate resistance mutations in the context of L858R and exon 19 deletion (Del19) mutations (delE746-A750), which represent the most common EGFR-activating mutations in LUAD. Additionally, we introduced co-mutations of T790M and C797S to model clinically relevant resistance scenarios. Although T790M clones may be suppressed when osimertinib is used in the first-line setting, not all fourth-generation EGFR TKIs are designed to against this mutation (e.g., BDTX-1535). Therefore, we included T790M to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of resistance mechanisms. All mutant constructs conferred growth factor independence in Ba/F3 cells apart from del19/L718Q, consistent with published reports in patients and mouse model systems suggesting that this co-mutation is non-functional53,54.

We observed that Ba/F3 cells in L858R or del19 context, in conjunction with T790M/C797S mutations, displayed increased resistance to BLU-945 when either L718Q or Q791L mutations were present. The EC50values for L858R/T790M/C797S and del19/T790M/C797S were 1.71 nM (1.26 nM–2.40 nM 95%CI) and 7.81 nM (6.09 nM–9.96 nM 95%CI) respectively; however, the EC50was >100 nM with the addition of L718Q or Q791L resistance mutations. (Fig.3A–D).

Both short exposure (S.E.) and long exposure (L.E.) images are shown to capture signal intensity differences.

Western blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylation levels of EGFR in L858R/T790M/C797S and del19/T790M/C797S mutant cells were markedly reduced following treatment with 100 nM BLU-945. However, no significant reduction in phosphorylation was observed in cells harboring L718Q or Q791L cDNAs, indicating that these second-site mutations confer resistance to BLU-945 by escaping EGFR inhibition (Fig.3E).

To further dissect the biophysical mechanisms underlying resistance, we performed ABFEP calculations using representative structures from MD simulations. Starting from the BLU-945 bound crystal structure (PDB: 8D76), we aligned and equilibrated ligand–protein complexes and calculated ΔG values for various EGFR isoforms. The predicted binding affinities closely mirrored experimental trends: L858R, L858R/T790M, and L858R/T790M/C797S all showed strong binding to BLU-945, consistent with low EC50values. L858R/C797S also retained favorable binding, though with a modest reduction.

In contrast, the L858R/T790M/Q791L mutant exhibited weaker binding affinity, with a ΔG shift consistent with the observed >2.5 kcal/mol drop in binding affinity. This change likely stems from a subtle entropic gain, as the hydrophobic leucine substitution at Q791 exposed to solvent and not directly involved in hydrogen bonding which may increase local flexibility relative to the more constrained wild-type hinge. The L858R/L718Q variant showed the most substantial loss in binding, with a calculated ΔG nearly 10 kcal/mol less favorable than L858R/T790M, reinforcing its role as a potent resistance mutation (Supplementary Fig.1E; Table1).

In the first-in-human Phase I/II SYMPHONY trial, patients were treated with BLU-945 in combination with osimertinib31. To explore the potential of overcoming resistance to BLU-945 through combination therapy, we tested whether the resistance profiles of individual compounds, in this case BLU-945 and osimertinib, could predict the resistance profile for the combination treatment. Pairwise comparison of single agent resistance profiles suggested that osimertinib could effectively inhibit most resistance mutations observed with BLU-945 monotherapy, with the notable exception of mutations at position L718 (Fig.4A).

To test our hypothesis, we performed a DMS experiment using BLU-945 and osimertinib in combination. The enrichment plot generated from these co-treatment endpoint samples indicated that resistance to both agents exclusively occurs at the L718 position where only proline (L718P) is enriched after filtering for Hamming distance >1 (Fig.4B), illustrating a common resistance liability at this position.

While osimertinib and BLU-945 share a common resistance liability at position L718, we were encouraged that all other second-site mutations from the BLU-945 screen were effectively suppressed. We tested the resistance profiles of 9 distinct EGFR inhibitors to determine to what extent they shared resistance mechanisms with BLU-945 (Fig.4C). Notably, BLU-945 suppressed T790M/C797S in both L858R and Del19 contexts. Mutations conferring resistance to BLU-945 such as Q791L were sensitive to all drugs tested in the context of either L858R or ex19del. However, rescue by osimertinib, sunvozertinib, lazertinib, or zipalertinib was all abolished by the C797S co-mutation. Examination of cross-resistance patterns of these drugs suggests that the combination of BLU-945 with one of the several EGFR TKIs with activity against Q791X or L718X might be an attractive strategy in contexts where the two mutations do not occurin cis.

Our institution participated in the SYMPHONY clinical trial evaluating BLU-945, both as monotherapy and in combination with osimertinib, for patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant LUAD. We identified two patients harboring L718X EGFR mutations.

Patient A (Fig.5A) harbored an EGFR L858R mutation and was previously treated with osimertinib. The patient had a liquid biopsy obtained on day –659 which identified the presence ofEGFRL858R and L718Q mutations. Baseline imaging on day 0 revealed two nodules in the right lung, measuring 1.2 × 0.7 cm (middle lobe) and 2.7 × 2.2 cm (lower lobe). The patient started BLU-945 on day 12. Although initial follow-up imaging demonstrated stable disease, evaluations on day 37 and day 40 revealed disease progression with new bone metastases and spinal cord compression, necessitating surgical intervention. Post-surgery imaging on day 68 showed stable lung lesions, but further scans on day 121 demonstrated continued disease progression (+20% from nadir) along with new brain metastases. Additional progression in the spine was confirmed on day 177 and day 181.

Patient B (Fig.5B) presented withEGFRL858R and developed on-treatment resistance mutations (EGFRT790M and C797S) following multiple prior treatments including osimertinib. A pre-treatment liquid biopsy performed on day-34 revealedEGFRL858R (34.7% VAF), T790M (13.7% VAF), and C797S (14.2% VAF). Baseline imaging on day 0 showed a right middle lobe lung nodule measuring 1.0 × 0.8 cm (TL1) as well as a liver lesion measuring 1.5 × 1.1 cm (TL2). BLU-945 therapy commenced on day 6. Follow-up imaging on day 33 demonstrated stable disease, with the sum of the target lesions decreasing by −1.7% overall from baseline. However, by day 61, the sum of target lesions increased by 3.3%. On day 117, imaging demonstrated progression due to new liver lesions, prompting a BLU-945 dose escalation to 400 mg.

On day 173, CT imaging indicated an overall growth of the target lesions by > 41%. Although the patient initially exhibited stable disease, therapy was ultimately discontinued due to rapid disease progression.

Four liquid biopsies were obtained from Patient A at day −659, −413, −51, and 180 relative to day 0 (Fig.5C). During this interval, theEGFRL858R mutation rose from 15.8% to 80.0% VAF. Two distinct L718Q variants were also detected: L718Q (2151_2153GCT > ACA) was first measurable at 0.62% on day -51 and increased to 2.29% by day 180. L718Q (2153 T > A) was detected at 2.4% on day -659, fluctuating thereafter and ultimately reaching 12.11% on day 180.

Two on-treatment liquid biopsies were obtained from Patient B on days 119 and 147. The first confirmedEGFRL718V (0.15% VAF) in addition to L858R (39.69% VAF), T790M (17.19% VAF), and C797S (17.01% VAF) (Fig.5D). Liquid biopsy on day 147 coincided with an increase in L718V to 0.2% VAF, with reduced levels of L858R (13.9% VAF), T790M (6% VAF), and C797S (6% VAF).

In this study, we employed deep mutational scanning to systematically map amino acid substitutions in the EGFR L858R kinase domain that confer resistance to BLU-945, a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor. We validated Q791L and L718Q mutations, which emerged as crucial resistance determinants in L858R and ex19del contexts, irrespective of T790M or C797S co-mutations. L718X mutations are notable as a singular shared liability between BLU-945 and osimertinib, highlighting the challenge of covering all potential mutational escape routes even in the case of structurally distinct inhibitors.

DMS has the potential to provide comprehensive foreknowledge of on-target resistance liabilities not previously possible by methods such as long-term drug treatment or chemical mutagenesis. This approach can be integrated into early drug development pipelines to refine chemical scaffolds against known escape mutations. We show that forward genetics can complement structural information by highlighting constrained contact points such as M793 and K745, while minimizing the vulnerability at sites like Q791 and L718. These positions in the EGFR kinase domain may be more “mutationally pliable” than others, enabling multiple potential substitutions that preserve kinase function and reduce inhibitor efficacy. Defining these mutationally permissive hotspots could support the development of inhibitors with increased robustness to mutational mechanisms of acquired resistance.

Anticipating drug resistance mutations early in drug development could also inform rational design of combination or sequential regimens in the clinic. For example, if preclinical data predict that L718X and Q791L/K will arise under selective pressure from BLU-945, treatment strategies could include pairing BLU-945 with a complementary inhibitor with orthogonal resistance liabilities to diminish the potential for outgrowth of resistant clones. From the perspective of clinical trial design, comprehensive resistance profiles could be used to further stratify patients to enhance response rates, increasing the probability of successful trial. This approach would also respect ethical considerations by providing the necessary information to direct patients away from therapies that have reduced potential for efficacy. It is worth noting that while BLU-945 is no longer in active clinical development, this example highlights the value of such preclinical knowledge for guiding strategy of future drug candidates.

Our study is not without limitations. Our screen focuses entirely on the EGFR kinase domain in the context of a single L858R mutant allele. Mutations outside the kinase domain or that require different allelic context would be missed. On target mutations represent only one facet of clinical resistance, whereas real-world tumors can escapeviaother genetic processes such as gene amplification, bypass signaling, or histological transformations55. The Ba/F3 system, while well-established for oncogene screening, may not fully capture the complexities of human lung adenocarcinoma, and in some cases, there was variability in total EGFR protein expression level between cell lines, limiting interpretation of pharmacodynamic experiments to comparisons that can be made within cell lines. Screening at a single high-dose condition ( > EC90) could potentially miss subtle resistance phenotypes that might emerge with lower drug concentrations. Finally, while our analysis tested candidate mutations in ex19del and L858R, our primary screen focused on the L858R context, whereas exon ex19del, ex20ins, or comparatively less common point mutations such as G719X or L861Q might yield distinct allele-specific resistance mutations.

While the clinical development of BLU-945 has since been discontinued, our results overall illustrate the power of systematic mutational scanning to identify resistance liabilities for emerging EGFR TKIs. Future studies could build upon these findings by exploring combination strategies, building prospective surveillance of likely resistance mutations into early phase clinical trials, and designing novel EGFR TKIs that target common resistance escape routes.

Plasmids were transformed and propagated in NEB Stable CompetentE.coli (New England Biolabs #C3040H). To prepare the plasmid template for DMS library construction, the plasmid was linearized using the restriction enzyme BSU36I (New England Biolabs #R0524S), which recognizes distinct sequences flanking the region of interest. The digestion reaction was prepared in a final volume of 50 µL, consisting of 1 µg of plasmid DNA, 5 µL of 10× rCutSmart Buffer (New England Biolabs #B6004S), 1 µL of BSU36I, and nuclease-free water (New England Biolabs #B1500S) to bring the reaction to final volume. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to ensure complete digestion. Following digestion, the reaction products were resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel to confirm successful cleavage. The linear fragment encompassing the EGFR kinase domain was excised and purified using a gel extraction kit.

To introduce mutations into the EGFR L858R kinase domain, we employed separate forward and reverse mutagenesis PCRs. Forward and reverse mutagenic primer were designed using the CodonTilingPrimers python script with minimum length set to 32 bp and synthesized as two separate oligonucleotide pools (Integrated DNA Technologies)33. In the forward reaction, 50 ng of linearized EGFR L858R template was combined with Q5 Master Mix (2×, New England Biolabs #M0491S), a 1 µL of a 10 µM forward oligo primer pool, and 1 µL of a 10 µM fixed reverse primer (5’-GCTCCAATAAATTCACTGCTTTG-3’) in a total volume of 50 µL. The PCR protocol was carried out for 7 cycles using standard Q5 cycling conditions, and the resultant product was purified with a PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen #28506). The reverse mutagenesis PCR was set up similarly using a fixed forward primer (5’-GCATACAGTGCCACCCAGAG-3’). The PCR protocol was also carried out for 7 cycles using standard Q5 cycling conditions, and the resultant product was purified with the PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen 28506). Each of the purified forward and reverse products was then treated with Exonuclease I (NEB M0293S) to remove any residual mutagenic primers. DNA concentrations were adjusted to approximately 140 ng/µL, and each product was further diluted by adding 60 µL of nuclease-free water to reach a final volume of 90 µL.

The forward and reverse products were joined to produce the full-length, mutated insert. Each 30 µL joining PCR reaction consisted of 15 µL of Q5 Master Mix (2×), 4 µL of the diluted forward PCR product, 4 µL of the diluted reverse PCR product, 1 µL of a 10 µM fixed forward primer, 1 µL of 10 µM fixed reverse primer, and 5 µL of nuclease-free water. Six parallel joining PCRs were carried out to ensure sufficient product yield, using the same Q5 cycling conditions for 20 cycles. The products were then purified by PCR cleanup.

The mutagenized kinase domain was cloned into pHAGE-EGFR-L858R using restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. 1.6 µg of pHAGE-EGFR-L858R and 1 µg of the insert were digested with BSU36I and cleaned up by gel extraction. The digestion products were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs #M0202S) in a 20 µL reaction containing 166 ng of vector DNA, 100 ng of insert DNA, and 1 µL of T4 DNA ligase. The reaction was incubated at 16 °C overnight. A portion of the ligation mixture was tested by chemical transformation to confirm successful ligation prior to proceeding with large-scale transformation.

Electrotransformation was performed following the Endura™ Competent Cells (COMCEL-002) protocol. Briefly, 25 µL of electrocompetent cells were mixed with up to 5 µL of ligated DNA (final DNA concentration ~55 ng/µL) in each electroporation cuvette. The SOC buffer was warmed to 37 °C, and 5 mL culture tubes were prepared in advance. After electroporation, 970 µL of prewarmed SOC buffer was immediately added to each cuvette, and the cells were transferred to 5 mL tubes and recovered at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking at 250 rpm.

For library expansion, 1 mL of the recovered culture was plated on each Square BioAssay LB agar plate. To determine transformation efficiency by titration, ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the resulting colony counts were used to calculate transformation efficiencies and ensure sufficient library complexity.

After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the colonies on the large LB plate were harvested by gently scraping the plate surface with an appropriate volume of LB medium. The collected cells were transferred to a fresh tube, and plasmid DNA was extracted using a standard midi-prep protocol. This pooled plasmid DNA represented the final EGFR L858R DMS library. Individual colonies from the titration plates were selected for Sanger sequencing to determine the presence and frequency of intended mutations.

On Day 0, HEK293T cells were seeded in a 15 cm dish to reach ~70% confluence on Day 1. On Day 1, cells were transfected with 6 µg total DNA (EGFR L858R DMS library plasmid 3 µg, pSPAX 2 µg, pMD2.G 1 µg) in 200 µL Opti-MEM (Gibco #31985062), using a 2:1 ratio of linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Polysciences #23966) to total DNA. The DNA–PEI mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min before adding dropwise to the cells. On Day 2, the medium was refreshed. On Day 4, viral supernatants were collected, spun at 300 rcf for 5 min, and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter.

Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from ~1.5 × 107cells using salt precipitation56. Cells were resuspended in 200 µL of DPBS in a 15 mL tube. Lysis was achieved by adding 3 mL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, pH 8.0) containing RNase A (10 mg/mL), followed by vortexing and incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, then cooling on ice for 3 min. Protein contaminants were removed by adding 1 mL of protein precipitation solution (7.5 M ammonium acetate), vortexing, and centrifuging at 2000 ×gfor 10 min.

The supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 3 mL of isopropanol to precipitate DNA, and the mixture was gently inverted 50 times. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 ×gfor 3 min, washed with 3 mL of 70% ethanol, and air-dried for 5–10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 400 µL of hydration buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0), incubated at 65 °C for 1 h, and hydrated overnight at room temperature with shaking at 600 rpm.

cDNAs were sequenced using a two-step, barcoded subamplicon PCR strategy based on the method described as previously described33,36. In the first step (PCR1), the EGFR kinase domain was divided into two equal subamplicons, and each half was amplified in a separate reaction. Amplicon 1 used primers 5’-CTCTTGAGGATCTTGAAGGAAACTGAA-3’ and 5’-CTTGACATGCTGCGGTGTTTT-3’. Amplicon 2 used primers 5’-CTTGACATGCTGCGGTGTTTT-3’ and 5’-ATGCATTCTTTCATCCCCCTGAATGAC-3’. Approximately 5 µg of the DMS library DNA was split between these two reactions, each containing primers encoding 8 degenerate nucleotides to introduce unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Following amplification, PCR1 products were purified by isopropanol precipitation to remove residual primers and short fragments, and the concentration of each purified product was determined using the PicoGreen method (Invitrogen #P11496).

For the second PCR step (PCR2), 500 fg of the purified PCR1 product was used as the template for each subamplicon. This PCR step incorporated Illumina sequencing adapters and sample-specific indexes for multiplexed sequencing. The resulting indexed libraries were then purified using SPRI beads.

Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq SP (500 cycles) platform using paired end reads configured to capture the UMI, barcode, and subamplicon regions.

All systems were prepared using the EGFR T790M_L858R_V948R mutant crystal structure (PDB: 8D76 chain A). Respective reverse or forward mutations were performed to design each isoform for simulations using open source PyMOL version 3.0.0. The bound ligand in the structure was edited to BLU-945. For holo isoform simulations, the ligand was removed. The resulting complex was solvated in a rectangular periodic box with a 1.2 nm buffer of explicit water molecules on all sides.

Simulations were carried out using the Deep Origin Simulation Suite. The protein was parameterized with the AMBER FF14SB force field57, while the ligand was assigned parameters using the GAFF2 small molecule force field, with atomic charges derived via the AM1-BCC method58. Solvation employed the TIP3P water model59and a physiological ionic strength of 0.15 M was maintained by converting water molecules to Na+and Cl−ions to achieve both electroneutrality and the desired salt concentration.

To enhance simulation efficiency, hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR)60was applied by increasing the hydrogen mass to 2 Da, enabling the use of extended integration timesteps. All simulations were conducted in the NPT ensemble at 298.15 K and 1 bar, using a BAOAB Langevin integrator and a Monte Carlo barostat61,62.

To assess structural dynamics and system equilibration, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in duplicate for both the holo (ligand-bound) and apo (ligand-free) systems. The resulting trajectories were subjected to cluster analysis, and the two most populated conformations were selected for subsequent free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. Prior to FEP, each of these cluster-derived structures was equilibrated with 10 ns of MD using a 4 fs timestep to enable the derivation of Boresch-style restraint parameters63.

In-house Python scripts leveraging MDTraj v1.10.364were used to analyze MD trajectories and compute root-mean-square deviations (RMSD). For each isoform, RMSD was calculated for the binding site backbone atoms, defined as all residues within 4 Å of BLU-945 in the reference structure (PDB: 8D76 chain A). The selected residues included: K716, L718, F723, V726, K728, A743, K745, E762, M766, C775, M790, Q791, L792, M793, P794, G796, L844, T854, D855, and D1006.

Absolute binding free energy perturbation (ABFEP) simulations were conducted using a standard ligand annihilation approach. For the binding leg of the calculations, 37 intermediate λ windows were employed, while 31 windows were used for the solvation leg. Each simulation was independently run in triplicate to ensure reproducibility and to estimate statistical uncertainty.

For the binding simulations, each window included 3 ns of equilibration followed by 5 ns of production dynamics, using a 4 fs timestep. In the solvation simulations, each window consisted of 0.2 ns of equilibration and 2.5 ns of production, run with a 5 fs timestep.

Free energy differences were estimated using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) method. Convergence was assessed based on time-series stability of the free energy estimates, the standard deviation across the triplicate runs, and overlap matrices to confirm sufficient phase space sampling between adjacent windows.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher #89900) supplemented with 1× Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher #78437) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher #78420). Total protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). For each sample, 25 µg of total protein was mixed with 6× Laemmli SDS sample buffer (VWR, AAJ61337-AC) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then separated on 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris gel and transferred onto PVDF membranes.

Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk or 3% BSA (for phospho-specific detection) in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against total EGFR (Cell Signaling Technology #2232S), phospho-EGFR (CST #3777S), total ERK (CST #9102S), phospho-ERK (CST #9101S), and cyclophilin B (CST #43603S), following the manufacturers’ recommended dilutions. After three washes in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen #31460) at 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Following three additional TBS-T washes, protein bands were visualized using the chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher #34577) and detected by the Invitrogen iBright imaging system.

Ba/F3 cells were counted, adjusted to 20,000 cells/mL, and 25 µL (500 cells) was seeded into each well of a half-area 96-well plate (Corning #3688). Drug stocks were prepared at 2× concentrations using a 4-fold serial dilution (100 nM down to 0.0244 nM) in medium containing DMSO. Each drug concentration (including the DMSO-only control) was tested in triplicate by dispensing 25 µL of the 2× dilution into separate wells, yielding a final well volume of 50 µL at the 1× drug concentration. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2for 72 h, after which 25 µL of CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega #G9242) was added per well. Following a 10-minute incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking, luminescence endpoint was measured on a microplate reader. Viability values were normalized to the DMSO control and used to generate dose–response curves for IC50determination using GraphPad Prism (Dotmatics).

Peripheral blood was drawn at the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center with the approval of the institutional review board (NYU IRB#S18-00980) and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Blood was collected in Streck Cell-Free DNA blood collection tubes, and samples were mixed gently per manufacturer's instructions, transported at 4 °C, processed to aliquot serum, and subsequently stored at −80 °C. Circulating tumor DNA sequencing was performed using the FoundationOne® Monitor (F1M) assay (Foundation Medicine, Inc.), a tissue-naïve method designed to monitor therapy response by quantifying ctDNA tumor fraction and variant allele frequency (VAF).
