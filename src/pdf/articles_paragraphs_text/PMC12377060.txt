This study presents the synthesis of a strontium-based metal–organic framework (Sr–BDC) through a solvothermal method, employing strontium chloride and terephthalic acid as primary precursors. The as-prepared Sr–BDC was subsequently functionalized with terbium ions (Tb3+) to yield a Tb3+@Sr–BDC composite. Extensive structural characterization, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and the scanning electron microscope (SEM), confirmed that the Tb3+incorporation preserved the integrity of the Sr-MOF framework without inducing structural degradation. Photoluminescence analysis demonstrated that Tb3+@Sr–BDC exhibits distinct Tb3+emission peaks at 545 nm upon excitation at 294 nm, showcasing exceptional selectivity and sensitivity toward Fe3+ions. Stern–Volmer quenching analysis revealed a remarkably low detection limit of 7.3 × 10−6mol L−1for Fe3+, with a linear response range spanning from 5 × 10−6to 1 × 10−4mol L−1. The potential mechanisms responsible for Fe3+-induced fluorescence quenching in Tb3+@Sr–BDC was also analysised in the study. These results underscore the potential of Tb3+@Sr–BDC as a highly efficient fluorescent probe for applications in environmental monitoring and biomedical sensing.

A Tb3+-functionalized Sr–BDC MOF synthesized solvothermally, emits bright green light (λem= 545 nm) and selectively detects Fe3+(LOD 7.3 μM, 5–100 μM), serving as a reliable probe for environmental and biomedical monitoring.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) possess tunable porosity and abundant active sites, and have demonstrated great potential in electronics,16photocatalysis,17,18and other fields. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) strategies19–25further extend their application in highly sensitive detection. Embedding photo-active Ln3+ions into MOF lattices offers significant advantages: the intrinsic porosity of the MOF is preserved, while characteristic lanthanide emission—long fluorescence lifetimes, narrow emission bands, and large Stokes shifts—is introduced. Compared with conventional luminescent probes, this approach markedly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thus detection sensitivity, especially in biological systems with endogenous organic fluorescence. However, the high and variable coordination numbers of rare-earth ions26render the direct synthesis of targeted Ln-MOFs challenging. Terbium(iii), with its unique electronic configuration and excellent luminescence properties, has been widely used to construct high-performance fluorescent probes. In this work, we employed a post-synthetic modification strategy to embed Tb3+into the Sr–BDC framework, yielding a novel fluorescent probe for the efficient detection of Fe3+.

Among rare-earth ions, terbium (Tb3+) is widely utilized for constructing high-performance fluorescent probes due to its unique electronic configuration and luminescent properties. In this study, we employed a post-synthetic modification strategy to incorporate Tb3+into the Sr–BDC framework, successfully developing a novel fluorescent probe for the highly efficient detection of Fe3+.

Strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl2·6H2O), terephthalic acid (H2BDC),N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), terbium(iii) nitrate hexahydrate (Tb(NO3)3·6H2O), copper(ii) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), chromium(iii) nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O), nickel(ii) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), iron(iii) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), potassium nitrate (KNO3), sodium chloride (NaCl), cobalt(ii) nitrate (Co(NO3)2), cadmium(ii) nitrate (Cd(NO3)2), silver nitrate (AgNO3), zinc(ii) nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), lead(ii) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), and absolute ethanol were purchased as analytical-grade reagents and further purified prior to use. All the reagents above were purchased from Macklin.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Netzsch STA 449F3 instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere, with a temperature range of 30–700 °C and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at room temperature using a Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ= 1.5418 Å). Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Horiba-HR320 fluorescence spectrophotometer.

The microstructural characterization of the specimens was performed using a Hitachi SU-5000 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi High-Tech, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 5–10 kV under high-vacuum conditions. Elemental distribution analysis was conductedviaenergy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) utilizing a Bruker Quantax system (Bruker, Germany).

The systhesis methods and technique were similar with that provided in the previous studies.27A mixture of strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl2·6H2O, 0.1 mmol, 26.6 mg) and terephthalic acid (H2BDC, 0.1 mmol, 16.6 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL ofN,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA). The solution was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave lined with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) inner tube and heated at 80 °C for 72 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. The resulting colorless block crystals were collected by filtration, washed thoroughly, and dried in air. The final product was weighed for further use.

To prepare Tb3+@Sr-BDC, the as-synthesized Sr–BDC powder (100 mg) was immersed in 50 mL of an ethanolic solution of terbium(iii) nitrate hexahydrate (Tb(NO3)3·6H2O), with a Tb(NO3)3concentration of 10−2mol L−1, for 24 h. The powder was then separated by centrifugation, washed three times with ethanol, and dried in air for 24 h.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of Sr–BDC and Tb3+@Sr–BDC were recorded at room temperature (Fig. 1). The experimental diffraction peaks of Sr–BDC align well with the simulated pattern (CCDC: 1551141), confirming the synthesis of the Sr–BDC framework. Notably, the diffraction peak positions remain unchanged after Tb3+doping, suggesting that Tb3+ions partially substitute Sr2+sites within the original framework while preserving its structural integrity. This observation indicates that Tb3+@Sr–BDC retains the same crystallographic structure as the parent Sr–BDC.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of Tb3+@Sr–BDC was conducted in the temperature range of 30–700 °C (Fig. 2). The initial weight loss (150–320 °C) corresponds to the removal of free and coordinated DMA solvent molecules. The Sr–BDC complex (chemical formula: C12H15NO6Sr) exhibited an experimental weight loss of 24.54% within the temperature range of 150–320 °C, demonstrating close agreement with the theoretical mass percentage (24.41%) calculated for the coordinated dimethylacetamide molecule (C4H9NO) in its crystal structure. At approximately 505 °C, a structural collapse of the Sr–BDC framework occurs.

Microstructural characterization revealed that Tb3+@Sr–BDC crystals (Fig. 3c and d) exhibited well-faceted short-rod or plate-like morphologies, in contrast to the irregular granular particles observed in undoped Sr–BDC (Fig. 3a and b). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of trace Tb (0.90 wt%,Fig. 3d) in Tb3+@Sr–BDC, while no detectable terbium signal was observed in Sr–BDC. These results demonstrate successful Tb3+incorporation into the crystal lattice, which significantly modified the crystallization kinetics and consequently altered the morphological evolution of the crystals.

As illustrated inFig. 4, the Tb3+@Sr–BDC material exhibits characteristic emission peaks of Tb3+ions at 489 nm, 545 nm, and 583 nm under 294 nm excitation. These peaks are attributed to the electronic transitions of5D4→7FJ (J= 6, 5, 4) within Tb3+ions. Notably, the intense green emission at 545 nm suggests that this material can serve as an efficient luminescent sensor.

To evaluate the fluorescence sensing capability of Tb3+@Sr–BDC, its luminescent properties were investigated in the presence of various metal cations. The Tb3+@Sr–BDC powder was finely ground and dispersed in ethanol to form a 5 mg mL−1suspension. Subsequently, 200 μL of the suspension was uniformly mixed with 3.8 mL of ethanol solutions containing 0.001 mol L−1of M(NO3)x(M = Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Ag+, Co2+, and Fe3+). The luminescence spectra were recorded and are presented inFig. 5. The results reveal that the luminescence intensity of Tb3+ions is significantly influenced by the presence of different metal ions. The ratio (I/I0) of the fluorescence intensity at 545 nm for the sample after metal ion introduction (I) to the Tb3+@Sr–BDC sample (I0) was shown inFig. 5b. The results suggests that Fe3+induces pronounced luminescence quenching of Tb3+@Sr–BDC, indicating its selective response to Fe3+.

To further investigate the selectivity of Tb3+@Sr–BDC for Fe3+, the material was dispersed in ethanol solutions containing Fe3+alongside other metal ions (Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Ag+, and Co2+). Under 294 nm excitation, the luminescence intensity of Tb3+@Sr–BDC in the presence of individual metal ions (blue bars inFig. 6) differs significantly from that in mixed-ion solutions containing Fe3+(green bars inFig. 6). When Tb3+@Sr–BDC is immersed in ethanol solutions containing a mixture of 1 × 10−3mol L−1of other metal ions and 1 × 10−3mol L−1of Fe3+, complete luminescence quenching is observed, demonstrating the material's selective detection capability for Fe3+in complex environments.

To quantify the Fe3+detection performance, a concentration gradient of Fe3+solutions was prepared (1 × 10−4mol L−1, 2 × 10−5mol L−1, 2.5 × 10−5mol L−1, 5 × 10−5mol L−1, 8 × 10−5mol L−1, and 5 × 10−6mol L−1). A 0.2 mL aliquot of the 5 mg per mL Tb3+@Sr–BDC–DMA suspension was mixed with 3.8 mL of each Fe3+solution, and the luminescence intensity was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fig. 7). The results demonstrate a well-defined linear relationship between Fe3+concentration and the luminescence intensity of Tb@Sr-BDC, with the emission intensity decreasing progressively as Fe3+concentration increases from 5 × 10−6to 1 × 10−4mol L−1. Stern–Volmer analysis of the Tb@Sr-BDC + Fe3+system reveals a strong quenching effect, exhibiting a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9947. The limit of detection (LOD = 3δ/S,δrepresents the blank solution was measured ten times, andSstands for the slope of the calibration curve) was about 7.3 × 10−6mol L−1.28Compared with the reported literature (Table 1), the Tb3+@Sr-BDC sensor exhibits a markedly lower detection limit. These findings confirm that Tb@Sr-BDC not only enables qualitative identification but also facilitates quantitative detection of Fe3+ions.

The luminescence quenching mechanisms of cations can be attributed to four primary factors:33,34(1) interactions between target metal ions and MOFs; (2) exchange between lanthanide ions in MOFs and central metal ions; (3) collapse of the crystalline structure; (4) energy competition between linkers and cations. To elucidate the potential sensing mechanism of Fe3+-induced quenching in Tb3+@Sr–BDC, comprehensive characterization was performed using XRD, SEM, and EDS before and after Fe3+treatment. XRD patterns (Fig. 8) revealed distinct differences between Fe3+-treated and untreated Tb3+@Sr–BDC, indicating framework modification. SEM showed significant morphological alterations in the powdered samples (Fig. 3and9). EDS data (Table 2) confirmed the replacement of Tb3+by Fe3+in the framework. The quenching effect is likely caused by displacement of luminescent Tb3+ions by Fe3+and the concurrent framework collapse. This aligns with known cation-MOF interaction paradigms, where heavy metal ions disrupt lanthanide-centered emission through structural and electronic perturbations.

A strontium-based metal–organic framework (Sr-MOF) was synthesizedviaa solvothermal reaction using terephthalic acid (H2BDC) and strontium chloride (SrCl2) as precursors. The as-prepared Sr-BDC was further functionalized with terbium ions (Tb3+) to yield Tb3+@Sr–BDC, which exhibited excellent luminescent properties. Fluorescence sensing studies revealed that Tb3+@Sr–BDC demonstrates high sensitivity and selectivity toward Fe3+ions, with a distinct linear correlation (R2> 0.99) between fluorescence intensity and Fe3+concentration. The detection limit was determined to be approximately 7.3 × 10−6mol L−1. These findings highlight the potential of rare-earth-functionalized Sr–BDC materials as efficient fluorescent probes for the detection and quantification of Fe3+in environmental and biomedical applications.
