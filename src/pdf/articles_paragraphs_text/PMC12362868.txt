Osteosarcoma is one of the malignant tumors in children and adolescents patients. Uncontrolled and unlimited proliferation and metastasis lead to poor overall survival. CAFs play a pivotal role in the osteosarcoma tumor microenvironment, exerting significant influence on prognosis and treatment outcomes. However, there remains a need for further exploration into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying CAFs.

Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to characterize the microenvironment of osteosarcoma. Tissue exosomal miRNA sequencing was conducted on tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues to screen for abnormal expression of exosomal miRNAs. WGCNA analysis was used to identify target exosomal miRNAs. The relative expression of miR-21-5p was analyzed using qRT-PCR. The proliferation rate and migration ability of tumor cells were assessed using the CCK8 and Transwell method, respectively. Exosomes derived from cells were extracted and characterized via transmission electron microscopy and NTA analysis. siRNA interference was utilized to disrupt the expression of miR-21-5p in CAFs. Experiments in vivo validated the role of exosomal miR-21-5p in promoting malignant characteristics in osteosarcoma.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis ofGSE162454revealed the crucial role of CAFs in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. Tissue exosomal miRNA sequencing unveiled significant differential expression of miR-21-5p. Subsequently, aberrant upregulation of exosomal miR-21-5p exhibited a strong correlation with advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis in osteosarcoma. Further experiments in vitro indicated that elevated levels of miR-21-5p significantly enhanced proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells by suppressing ferroptosis. Moreover, experiments in vivo validated the capacity of CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p to promote tumor growth and weight, thereby demonstrating their ability to deliver miR-21-5p to osteosarcoma cells and induce proliferation and migration through inhibition of ferroptosis.

Our findings indicate that exosomal miR-21-5p could potentially serve as a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, providing initial evidence for further clinical investigation.

Osteosarcoma is a common primary bone tissue malignant tumor, accounting for about 60% of all primary bone tumor [1,2]. It commonly manifests in the growth plates adjacent to long bones and metaphyseal of the extremities in children and adolescents, accounting for about 5% of all childhood cancer and ranking as the third most common cancer [3,4]. Osteosarcoma is characterized by rapid growth, strong invasiveness, high malignancy, propensity for pulmonary metastasis and low survival rate [5,6]. The emergence of pre-operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy [7] has improved the overall 5-year survival rate to approximately 60–70% [8]. However, recent studies have revealed that there has been no further improvement in the survival rates of patients with osteosarcoma. Moreover, after tumor recurrence or metastasis, the survival rate drops to 20–30% [9,10]. Therefore, it is crucial to gain profound insights into fundamental processes underlying malignant osteosarcoma in order to enhance overall survival.

The initiation and progression of tumor metastasis involve a complex interplay between multiple cells and factors, influenced by both tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment [11]. Surrounding blood vessels, fibroblasts, immune cells, inflammatory cells, various cytokines and chemokines [12], play crucial roles in the regulating the occurrence, development and metastasis of malignant tumors. In osteosarcoma, fibroblasts are key stromal cell constituents within the tumor microenvironment that can modulate tumor progression including migration, invasion proliferation and metastasis [13,14]. Fibroblasts and tumor cells communicate with each other in a variety of ways, not only through classical paracrine signaling pathways, including chemokines, cytokines and growth factors, but also through the secretion of exosomes to exchange biological information [15,16]. Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles enclosed by lipid bilayer membranes with sizes ranging from 30 to 150 nm. Almost all cell types including tumor cells have been found to secrete exosomes [17]. Recent studies have revealed that fibroblast-derived exosomes promote tumorigenesis by influencing the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanisms underlying how fibroblasts and these derived exosomes contribute to malignant proliferation and metastasis in osteosarcoma have not been fully elucidated.

miRNA, a highly conserved class of non-coding single-stranded RNA with a length ranging from 18 to 22 nucleotides, represents only 1% of the human genome [18]. However, it exerts regulatory control over approximately 30% of genes [19], forming a complex regulatory network. Moreover, miRNAs play a crucial role in governing various biological processes in tumor cells such as proliferation, migration and invasion, and differentiation [20].

In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing, tissue exosomal miRNA sequencing and WGCNA to elucidate the potential regulatory mechanisms underlying the modulation of proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma by CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p. Our findings propose an innovative biomarker that mediates the malignant characteristics of osteosarcoma cells.

The scRNA-seq dataGSE162454was obtained from the GEO database, targeting 6 osteosarcoma tissues using the 10X Genomics technology. Subsequently, online data analysis (https://www.aclbi.com/static/index.html#/single_cell_analysis) was performed on the four tissues exhibiting the highest cell count.

A total of 19 osteosarcoma tissues and 4 normal tissues were collected from Henan cancer hospital for tissue exosomal RNA sequencing. The sample type corresponds to surgically resected tissue collected after chemotherapy. The tissue suspension was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and centrifuged at 300gat 4 ℃ for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was transferred to another fresh EP tube and further centrifuged at 2000 g at 4 ℃ for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by filtration using a 0.22 µm filter. Subsequently, the suspension was subjected to additional centrifugation at 150,000gfor 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting precipitation was resuspended in 1 ml of 1*PBS and purified using Exosupur®columns. In collaboration with ECHO AIOTECH company, an input of RNA ranging from 250 pg to 10 ng per sample was used for sequencing library preparation, with an index code added to the attribute sequence of each sample. Library quality evaluation was performed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer platform. Finally, the prepared libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform generating paired end reads after cluster generation. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee (Approval No. 2022–200-001).

WGCNA module was utilized for the examination of pre-processed data and identification of highly interconnected exosomal miRNAs. A total of 220 exosomal miRNAs were analyzed. During network construction, the soft threshold was determined, resulting in four modules being obtained. Then a dynamic shear tree was generated, followed by grouping together modules containing highly similar feature genes using a gene cluster dendrogram map. Heatmaps were employed to assess statistical correlations between different modules.

143B cells were purchased from KeyGEN BioTECH (KG232, China) with short tandem repeat DNA profiling analysis and cultured for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation. CAFs were purchased from Cell Resource Center of Peking Union Medical College with short tandem repeat DNA profiling analysis and cultured for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation.

143B were cultured in RPIM MEM high-glucose medium (KGL1602-500, KeyGene Biotech), CAFs were cultured in RPIM DMEM medium (KGL1211-500, KeyGene Biotech) and NFs were cultured in RPIM DMEM/F12K medium (KGL1205-500, KeyGene Biotech) containing 10% FBS (KGL3006-500, KeyGene Biotech), 80 U/ml penicillin and 0.08 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 ℃.

CAFs and NFs were obtained from tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues surgically resected from osteosarcoma patients, respectively. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Following blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: α-SMA (ab7817, Abcam), fibronectin (ab2413, Abcam), and E-cadherin (#3195, Cell Signaling Technology). Subsequently, after washing, the cells were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (KGA1807-100, KeyGene Biotech) for 10 min. Fluorescent images were acquired using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope at *600 magnification.

The relative expression of exosome miR-21-5p was detected in another 17 osteosarcoma tissues and 17 paracancer normal tissues obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection at Henan Cancer Hospital. A total of 500 μl RNAiso Plus (9109, Takara) were added to fully digest tissues. And cells were removed to a new 1.5 ml RNase-free centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 12,000gat 4 ℃ for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to the new RNase-free centrifuge tube with 500 μl isopropyl alcohol to stand at room temperature for 10 min, centrifuge 12,000gat 4 ℃ for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded. Each tube was added 500 μl 75% ethanol, slowly mixed up and down, centrifuged 7500gat 4 ℃ for 5 min. Finally, the supernatant was dropped and dried RNA at room temperature and precipitate. The RNA precipitation was dissolved with RNase-free water.

The qRT-PCR was carried out as described in our previous paper[21]. 2−ΔΔCtmethod was used to calculate the relative expression levels of miRNAs. The primer sequences of miR-21-5p were designed and synthesized by RIOBIO company (F: TAGCTTATCAGACTGATGTTGA, R: TGCGTGTCGTGGAGT). U6 (F: CAGCACATATACTAAAATTGGAACG, R: ACGAATTTGCGTGTCATCC) was used as the internal reference.

CAFs, NFs and 143B were co-cultured in Transwell chamber for 24 h. CAFs and NFs were inoculated in the upper chamber with 1.5*105cells/200 μl, and 143B were seeded in the lower chamber with 1–1.5*105cells/500 μl.

The complete medium and 50 μl exosome extract were added to each well when the cells confluency reached 60–70%, and the follow-up experiment was carried out after 24 h of co-culture.

Exosomes were labeled with PKH26 (KGE2210-1, KeyGene Biotech) at room temperature for 30 s. The labeled EV suspensions were filtered using exosome spin columns to remove any unbound free dyes. The 143B cells were inoculated in a 6-well confocal dish and incubated with PKH26-labeled exosomes at a concentration of 1 × 109/ml, maintained at a temperature of 37 °C for a duration of 12 h. The nuclei were stained with DAPI, and cells were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope.

CCK8 kit (KGA9305-1000, KeyGene Biotech) was selected to detect cell proliferation. A total of 1000–2000 cells were added to each well of the 96-well plates, and 3–5 complete culture medium controls were set up in each well, and 3–5 parallel multiple pores were set up in each well. A total of 10 μl CCK8 was added to incubate in the incubator for 2 h at 37 ℃. And the absorbance at 450 nm at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h was detected. Graphpad Prism software was applied to make cell proliferation line maps.

The treated cells were prepared into suspension and diluted to 1–1.5*105cells / ml. A total of 200 μl suspension was added into the upper chamber and 500 μl of complete culture solution was added into the lower chamber. The upper chamber was carefully placed into the lower chamber and cultured in a constant temperature and humidity incubator at 37 ℃ for 24 h. Then the suspension in the upper chamber was discarded, cleaned with 1*PBS buffer, and stained with methanol 15–20 min. Next, the upper chamber was placed in crystal violet solution and stained for 10 min. After dyeing, wash with 1*PBS, the upper chamber was dried. The stained cells were observed under the microscope, and 3–5 different fields of view were taken. The Image J software was performed to count the number of cells.

The culture medium was replaced without PBS when the fusion rate reached 90% for 36 h. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 7000gat 4 ℃ for 80 min to discard cell debris. Then supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000gat 4 ℃ for 70 min to discard the supernatant. To suspend precipitation with 1 ml PBS per tube and continuedly centrifuge 100,000gat 4 ℃ for 70 min. Once again to discard the supernatant, the sediments were re-suspended with1*PBS.

TEM and NTA were utilized to identify exosomes. First, a total of 10 μl of the exosome sample was carefully deposited it onto the surface of the sealing film.The copper grid film was placed gently with its surface facing the exosome droplet, and filter paper was used to absorb any excess liquid. The samples were dried at room temperature. Subsequently, 10 μL of uranium dioxyethylene was added onto the copper grid for precipitation for 1 min. Again, filter paper was used to remove floating liquid and dried at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, transmission electron microscopy imaging at 80 kV was performed to observe the morphology of the exosomes and capture images. In addition, exosome samples were injected into nano particle size analyzer to detect the particle size distribution.

The 143B cells after different treatments were lysed with RIPA buffer (KGA5203-100, KeyGEN BioTECH) to extract total protein. The protein concentration was quantified by a BCA protein assay kit (KGA2101-250, KeyGEN BioTECH). Then, the total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with skim milk powder at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies: ACSL4 protein (ab155282, abcam), FTH1 (ab75973, abcam) and β-actin (66,009–1-Ig, Proteintech). After overnight incubation, the membrane was incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody (SA00001-1, Proteintech) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Finally, the protein bands were detected using the SuperSignal ECL kit (KGC4602-200, KeyGEN BioTECH) and visualized.

The siRNA of miR-21-5p (sense: 5′-UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA-3′, antisense 5′-AACAUCAGUCUGAUAAGCUAUU-3′) were designed and synthesized by RIOBIO company. JetPrime transfection reagent was selected for siRNAs transfection. 1.5*105–2.0*105cells/ml were cultured in six-well plates at 37 ℃ for 24 h. According to the instructions, 2 μl working concentration siRNAs was added to 200 μl buffer first, and then 4 μl jetPrime transfection reagent was added after full mixing. Then transfection medium was incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min, and 1.2 ml transfection medium was added to each well, and the subsequent experiment was carried out after incubation in the incubator for 24–48 h.

The MDA (KGA7101-100, KeyGene Biotech), Fe2+(ml691108, mlbio), GSH (KGA7310-25, KeyGene Biotech) and ROS levels (KGAF018, KeyGene Biotech) were measured using corresponding commercial kits, respectively. 143B cells were collected from distinct treatment groups, fixed in 2.5% glutaradehyde overnight at 4 °C, subsequently washed with 1 * PBS, and fixed at room temperature using 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Following ethanol dehydration, cells were embedded in epoxy resin, stained with uranium acetate and led citrate, and analyzed under an 80 kV transmission electron microscope.

The 4-week-old nude mice were obtained from Shanghai Lingchang Biotechnology, and randomly assigned to four groups: (A) NC group, (B) CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p group, (C) CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p + Erastin group, (D) CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p knockdown group. Subcutaneous injection of 143B cells (1 × 107) was performed in the nude mice. Once the tumor size reached approximately > 100 mm3, appropriate treatments were administered to groups B, C, and D. In these groups, exosomes were administered at a volume of 150 μL every four days, while Erastin was given at a dosage of 15 mg/ kg every four days in group C. Simultaneously, tumor formation was monitored and tumor size was calculated using the formula V = 0.5 × L × W2(L: length; W: width). At the end of the experiment, euthanasia was performed on the mice and tumor tissues were isolated for further analysis.

All analyses were two-sided tests,P≤ 0.05 was defined as a statistically significant difference. Student t test was used to analyze two groups of continuous quantitative data. Chi-square test is used to analyze categorical variable data. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 20.0 software.

We obtainedGSE162454for single-cell sequencing in order to analyze the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (Fig.1A). Sample quality control was shown in Fig.1B. After undergoing rigorous quality control and meticulous batch calibration, a total of 38,280 cells were acquired for subsequent comprehensive analysis. Following dimensionization, the application of UMAP-based cell clustering delineated distinct cellular subpopulations encompassing macrophages (0), proliferating osteoblasts (1), osteoclasts (2), B cells (3), T cells (4), endothelial cells (5), fibroblasts (6), osteoblasts (7), dendritic cells (8), eosinophils (9), and chondrocytes (10) (Fig.1C). By leveraging lineage markers, we observed a clear incremental increase in the proportion of fibroblasts correlated with advancing pathological stages of osteosarcoma, suggesting a trend of fibroblast enrichment associated with tumor progression (Fig.1D). Our forthcoming investigations would be dedicated to unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning the malignant phenotypes exhibited by fibroblasts in osteosarcoma.

We performed tissue exosomal miRNA sequencing from 4 paracancer normal tissues and 19 osteosarcoma tissues. A total of 80 down-regulated exosomal miRNAs and 140 high-regualted exosomal miRNAs were identified (Fig.2A and B). In order to identify target exosomal miRNAs, WGCNA analysis was conducted on the differentially expressed exosome miRNAs. With soft power as 16 (Fig.2C), the significant expressed miRNAs were divided into four models, turquoise model, brown model, blue model and yellow model (Fig.2D and E). By integrating the results from the volcano plot, we observed a significant upregulation of exosomal miR-21-5p expression in osteosarcoma (Fig.2F:P< 0.001). Furthermore, as presented in Table1, exosomal miR-21-5p exhibited a significant correlation with clinicopathological classification (P= 0.030) and malignant prognosis (P= 0.008) among osteosarcoma patients. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that miR-21-5p may be involved in osteosarcoma through ferroptosis (Fig.2G). Combined with single cell analysis results, we propose the following scientific hypotheses: CAFs exosomal miR-21-5p was involved in malignant growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma by ferroptosis.

To elucidate whether miR-21-5p function as tumor oncogene, we separated and characterized the cells from tumor tissues and normal tissues. The CAFs and NFs were isolated from tumor tissues and normal tissues and characterized, revealing distinct α-SMA, E-cadherin and fibronectin expression in CAFs while NFs exhibited negligible expression (Fig.3A). These findings suggested that the isolated CAFs and NFs were suitable for subsequent experimental investigations.

Compared with 143B, the expression of miR-21-5p in CAFs and NFs was significantly up-regulated, with the highest level observed in CAFs (Fig.3B,P< 0.001). Then we established a co-culture model of CAFs and 143B (Fig.3C), which revealed that the expression of miR-21-5p in 143B was significantly upregulated after co-culture with CAFs compared to those with NFs (Fig.3D:P< 0.001).

Subsequently, the cellular activity was assessed using CCK8, revealing a significant enhancement in the proliferation capacity of 143B after co-culture with CAFs for 24 h. However, when co-cultured with CAFs and Erastin (ferroptosis activator), the proliferation ability of 143B cells was significantly inhibited (Fig.3E:P< 0.001), indicating that CAFs suppressed iron death and promoted malignant proliferation by upregulating miR-21-5p expression in 143B. The same trend was observed for migration. After a 24-h co-culture with CAFs, there was a notable increase in the migratory capability of 143B (Fig.3F and SI 5:P< 0.001).

We further investigated the relevant indicators associated with ferroptosis. Compared to NFs, the accumulation of Fe2+in 143B cells co-cultured with CAFs was significantly reduced (Fig.3G:P< 0.001), as well as MDA (Fig.3H:P< 0.001) and ROS (Fig.3I:P< 0.001). In the CAFs co-culture group, the synthesis of GSH in 143B cells was markedly increased (Fig.3J:P< 0.001). The results of mitochondrial morphological characteristics revealed that mitochondrial shrinkage and increased membrane density were observed in 143B cells co-cultured with NFs (Fig.3K). In contrast, these phenomena were absent in 143B cells co-cultured with CAFs. The results of protein-related expression detection indicated that, compared with the NFs co-culture group, the expression level of ACSL4 protein in 143B after co-cultured with CAFs was reduced, while the expression of FTH1 protein was elevated (SI 8:P< 0.001), suggesting that miR-21-5p derived from CAFs plays a role in inhibiting ferroptosis in 143B cells.

Exosomes are effective signal bridge between cells, thus we hypothesized that exosomes from CAFs induced the higher expression levels of miR-21-5p in osteosarcoma cells to induce proliferation and migration. Firstly, exosomes were extracted through ultra-high speed centrifugation. As depicted in Fig.4A and B, the cup-shaped morphology was distinctly visible with particle sizes ranging mainly from 50 to 120 nm, indicating that the extracellular vesicles obtained were exosomes suitable for subsequent experiments.

Subsequently, we established co-culture models of CAFs-derived exosomes and NFs-derived exosomes with 143B cells separately. After co-culture 24 h, exosomes were absorbed in 143B (Fig.4C).

The qRT-PCR results revealed the up-regulation in miR-21-5p expression within the 143B cells upon co-culturing with CAFs-derived exosomes (Fig.4D:P< 0.001). Furthermore, proliferation assays using CCK8 demonstrated a significant enhancement in the proliferative capacity of 143B cells after co-culture with CAFs-derived exosomes (Fig.4E:P< 0.001). Similarly, migration activity was also significantly enhanced (Fig.4F and SI 6:P< 0.001).

Compared to cells co-culture with exosomes from NFs, there was reduced accumulation of Fe2+in those co-culture with CAFs-derived exosomes (Fig.4G:P< 0.001), along with decreased MDA (Fig.4H:P< 0.001), ROS accumulation (Fig.4I:P< 0.001), increased GSH synthesis (Fig.4J:P< 0.001), and un-shriveled mitochondria and unincreased membrane density (Fig.4K). The results of western blot indicated that, compared with the NFs exosomes co-culture group, the expression level of ACSL4 protein in 143B after co-cultured with CAFs exosomes was decreased, while the expression of FTH1 protein was increased (SI 9:P< 0.001), suggesting that CAFs could impede ferroptosis in 143B by delivering miR-21-5p through exosomes, thereby promoting the malignant proliferation and migration of endogenous osteosarcoma.

By silencing the expression of miR-21-5p in CAFs using siRNA, it was observed that the levels of miR-21-5p in CAFs-derived exosomes were significantly decreased (Fig.5A:P< 0.001). These exosomes were then co-cultured with 143B cells and engulfed after 24 h (Fig.5B). The results from the CCK8 assay demonstrated that downregulation of miR-21-5p suppressed the proliferative capacity of 143B (Fig.5C:P< 0.001), while their migratory ability remained impaired (Fig.5D and SI 7:P< 0.001). Additionally, there was an elevation in intracellular Fe2+accumulation (Fig.5E:P< 0.001), MDA levels (Fig.5F:P< 0.001), ROS production (Fig.5G:P< 0.001), GSH consumption (Fig.5H:P< 0.001), and shrunken mitochondria and increased membrane density (Fig.5I) upon downregulation of miR-21-5p. The results of SI 10 indicated that, compared with the CAFs NC exosomes co-culture group, the expression level of ACSL4 protein in 143B after co-cultured with CAFs kd exosomes was reduced, while the expression of FTH1 protein was elevated (P< 0.001), indicating a promotion of ferroptosis in 143B.

The experiments in vivo were categorized into four groups: NC group, intratumoral injection of CAFs-derived exosomes group, intratumoral injection of CAFs-derived exosomes and Erastin group, and intratumoral injection of CAFs-derived exosomes miR-21-5p knockdown group. The results demonstrated that exosomes derived from CAFs significantly augmented the volume (Fig.5J and K) and weight (Fig.5L) in vivo. Conversely, both CAFs exosome and Erastin group exhibited a significant reduction in the volume (Fig.5J) and weight (Fig.5K). Furthermore, there was also a decrease in the volume (Fig.5J) and weight (Fig.5K) observed in the CAFs exosome miR-21-5p knockdown group. These findings suggested that CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p played an oncogenic role by promoting malignant proliferation of osteosarcoma through inhibition of ferroptosis.

The recent studies consistently demonstrate that CAFs play a crucial role in promoting tumor cells metastasis by creating a favorable microenvironment. However, the precise mechanisms through which CAFs mediate tumor progression remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the active involvement of miR-21-5p in driving malignant characteristics of osteosarcoma using single-cell RNA sequencing and tissue exosomal miRNA sequencing, as well as conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments.

The tumor microenvironment encompasses a diverse array of mesenchymal cell populations, including fibroblasts, pericytes, immune cells, local or bone marrow-derived histone and stromal stem cells, as well as the surrounding extracellular matrix [22]. The intricate interplay between CAFs and tumor cells within this microenvironment significantly contributes to the acquisition of malignant characteristics through epigenetic alterations in tumor cells [23,24]. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying CAFs involvement in osteosarcoma remain elusive. In our study, we have demonstrated that the exosomal miR-21-5p secreted by CAFs promoted proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE162454) revealed that the proportion of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cells significantly increased with the progression of the histopathological grade and clinical stage of osteosarcoma. This finding suggests a potential correlation between the increase in CAF cells and the heightened malignancy of osteosarcoma tissue. These results further corroborate the observations made in this study. The data suggest that CAFs-derived exosomes containing miR-21-5p significantly promote tumor growth in vivo, while silencing miR-21-5p within these exosomes can effectively inhibit uncontrolled tumor growth. However, further mechanistic experiments are required to fully explore the potential benefits of targeting CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p for improving clinical therapeutic efficacy.

Previous research has shown that M2 Macrophages-derived exosomal miR-21-5p drived aggression via PTEN/Akt Signaling in renal cell carcinoma [25]. In addition, BMSC-derived exosomal miR-21-5p could promote osteosarcoma cells proliferation and invasion by targeting PIK3R1 [25], indicating the oncogene role of miR-21-5p from tumor microenvironment. Our study suggests an association between elevated expression of CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p and osteosarcoma aggressiveness, warranting additional clinical validation. Furthermore, the results from CCK8 and Transwell assays further support the stimulary effects of upregulating miR-21-5p on proliferation and migration. Overall, our findings provide evidence supporting the role of miR-21-5p as a potential accelerator of osteosarcoma metastasis.

To further investigate the regulatory network mechanisms of exosomal miR-21-5p between CAFs and osteosarcoma cells, we initially employed bioinformatics to predict the potential involvement of miR-21-5p in ferroptosis. It has been reported that tumor cells exhibit an increased demand for iron to sustain the malignant growth, rendering more susceptible to ferroptotic cell death [26]. Recent studies have revealed various strategies employed by tumor cells to negatively regulate ferroptosis, including upregulation of GSH content, reduced Fe2+storage or efflux, and augmented oxidative stress defense mediated by ROS [27]. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in ferroptosis in osteosarcoma remain unclear. In this study, utilizing co-culture models of CAFs and osteosarcoma cells as well as experiments in nude mice, we firstly demonstrated that exosomal miR-21-5p derived from CAFs exosomes promoted malignant proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells through downregulating ferroptosis. Furthermore, our findings underscored the crucial role played by ferroptosis in driving the malignant characteristics of osteosarcoma.

Importantly, our findings have significant translational implications. Clinically, elevated levels of exosomal miR-21-5p in patient tissues were significantly associated with advanced disease stages and unfavorable prognosis, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, considering that CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p suppresses ferroptosis, targeting this pathway may offer therapeutic advantages, particularly in aggressive or chemo-resistant osteosarcoma cases. Emerging strategies, such as the application of miRNA inhibitors or exosome-targeting interventions, could provide viable approaches to inhibit miR-21-5p signaling within the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, our results not only elucidate a novel mechanistic connection but also suggest a promising avenue for clinical intervention in osteosarcoma.

Nevertheless, our research possesses certain limitations. Although our study provided functional evidence that CAFs-derived exosomal miR-21-5p suppressed ferroptosis and promoted malignant behaviors in osteosarcoma cells, it did not experimentally validate the specific downstream target genes of miR-21-5p responsible for this effect. Further mechanistic investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise signaling pathways through which miR-21-5p modulates ferroptosis in osteosarcoma, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets for future research. Additionally, the sample size included in this study was relatively limited. In subsequent investigations, we aim to further collect tissue samples and clinical data to comprehensively analyze the correlation between exosome miR-21-5p expression and prognosis within the same clinical stage. Looking forward, our future research endeavors will focus on unraveling these molecular mechanisms in greater detail, thereby enhancing our understanding of the intricate network governing uncontrolled migration and malignant proliferation in osteosarcoma.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that CAFs effectively inhibit iron death through the exosome miR-21-5p and promote the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma, thus playing a role in promoting cancer. Therefore, our findings suggest that silencing exosome miR-21-5p holds great promise as a therapeutic strategy to impede the progression of osteosarcoma.
