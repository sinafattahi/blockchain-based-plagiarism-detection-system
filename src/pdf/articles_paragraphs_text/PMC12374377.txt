The prolonged recovery and heightened discomfort associated with delayed fracture healing present substantial clinical challenges. Investigations into lncRNA-mediated pathways may provide novel biological targets for enhancing osseous regeneration and improving clinical outcomes.

The focus of this study is to elucidate the role and molecular mechanism of lncRNA LINC01123 (LINC01123) dysregulation in the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) determined LINC01123, miR-134-5p and XIAP levels in samples, alongside an assessment of osteogenic marker mRNA expression. The targeting relationships were verified by luciferase activity assay. The biological behavioural competence of the cells was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, alizarin red staining assay, and western blot assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to analyse the potential of LINC01123 in the diagnosis of delayed fracture healing.

LINC01123 was overexpressed in patients experiencing delayed fractures and was sensitive in predicting the occurrence of delayed healing. As osteoblast differentiation progressed, the expression of LINC01123 and XIAP diminished, while the levels of miR-134-5p and ALP, OCN, RUNX2 mRNA were notably upregulated. Upregulation of LINC01123 reduced the levels of osteogenic biomarkers while suppressing cell viability and accelerating apoptosis, while miR-134-5p mimic partially reversed the inhibitory effect of LINC01123. Knockdown of XIAP partially mitigated the negative impact of silencing miR-134-5p on osteoblast differentiation and proliferation.

Elevated LINC01123 expression promotes delayed fracture healing through the miR-134-5p/XIAP pathway, positioning it as a candidate prognostic marker for progression of fracture healing response.

Fractures signify a structural disruption in bone tissue, typically resulting from mechanical trauma or pathological weakening, and represent one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries [1]. The escalating fracture burden associated with population aging includes a 5–10% delayed healing [2]. Recent advancements in medical technology have significantly expanded the therapeutic repertoire for fracture management. Notably, pharmacological interventions such as calcitonin have demonstrated efficacy in enhancing osseous regeneration, while biomechanical modalities including intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) have shown measurable improvements in both fracture and concomitant soft tissue repair [3–5]. Currently, surgical fixation remains the cornerstone of fracture management, including in the case of tibial fractures [6], however, postoperative complications persist a significant and unresolved challenge. Defined as impaired osseous consolidation beyond expected timelines, delayed fracture healing increases both clinical suffering and socioeconomic costs [7]. Additionally, prolonged periods of bed rest lead to a reduction in bone mineral density, potentially accelerating the progression of osteoporosis and further compromising skeletal integrity [8]. Consequently, there remains a critical need for the development of a safe and effective non-invasive treatment to address the issue of delayed fracture healing.

Extensive research has firmly established long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial modulators of disease development, regulating disease pathogenesis through their role in core cellular activities [9,10]. For instance, lncRNA HAGLR, HOTAIR and CASC11 have all been revealed to mediate fracture healing [11–13]. Existing literature demonstrates LINC01123’s multifaceted involvement in tumorigenesis and cancer cell functions. LINC01123 targets miR-34a-5p to regulate the malignant behavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and predicts the prognostic outcome of patients [14]. Moreover, enrichment of LINC01123 was elaborated to identify patients with acute cerebral infarction in combination with fibrinogen index [15]. A separate study has suggested a potential mechanistic pathway involving the LINC01123/miR-516b-5p/Gli1 network in osteosarcoma [16]. However, despite these findings, no conclusive evidence has yet been presented regarding the role of LINC01123 in fracture healing.

Osteoblast proliferation and activity constitute the fundamental determinant of fracture callus formation, with their dysfunction being a primary etiology underlying impaired bone healing [17]. Accordingly, we employed the mouse osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which LINC01123 influences fracture healing subsequent to the induction of differentiation.

In this study, we sought to explore the function of LINC01123 in delayed fracture healing, a novel area of investigation. To this end, we assessed serum LINC01123 levels in recruited fracture patients. Meanwhile, downstream targets of LINC01123 were predicted by cellular experiments to understand the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and viability by dysregulated LINC01123. This research promises to deepen our understanding of delayed fracture healing and may offer new avenues for therapeutic interventions in affected patients.

This study included tibial fracture patients (n= 140) admitted to The People’s Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, classifying them into normal healing group (n= 80) and delayed healing group (n= 60), according to their recovery progression at the 4-month follow-up. Inclusion criteria: entailed radiologically confirmed tibial fractures; Initial fracture episode managed at our institution; Normal healing patients had bone scab formation, while patients with delayed healing exhibited a lack of continuous bone scab, and there were obvious fracture lines on X-ray, or signs of bone atrophy at the fracture site. Exclusion criteria: History of malignant tumors or pre-existing orthopedic disorders; Diagnosed osteoporosis; Use of medications known to interfere with bone metabolism prior to the assays. This research was conducted under the auspices of the Ethics Committee of our hospital and all patients were duly informed regarding the study procedures.

Blood samples were meticulously collected from each fracture patient, and serum samples were carefully isolated for further analysis.

Mouse osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, USA) and seeded in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were maintained under standard conditions at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator.

MC3T3-E1 cells were subjected to osteogenic induction medium for a duration of two weeks, with samples being collected at various time points (0, 7, 14 days). The induction medium was meticulously formulated using dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and L-glycerophosphate.

Transfection experiments were performed in 6-well plates. The vector fragments were transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells after 14 days of osteogenic differentiation. The transfection process utilized Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, USA). The vector fragments encompassed various constructs, including the overexpression of LINC01123 (ov-LINC01123), silencing agent for miR-134-5p (miR-134-5p inhibitor), overexpression of miR-134-5p (miR-134-5p mimic), silencing of XIAP (si-XIAP), along with their respective negative control plasmids (ov-NC, si-NC, NC inhibitor, NC mimic), all of which were provided by GenePharma (Shanghai, China).

MC3T3-E1 cells were resuspended in 96-well plates, and following a 48-hour incubation period, 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (Beyotime, China) was added. After 2 h, the optical density (OD) values were measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).

Trypsin-treated MC3T3-E1 cells were washed by PBS and then incubated for 10 min away from light after adding 10 µL Annexin-FITC and 5 µL of propidium iodide (PI). The apoptosis rate of these cells was then evaluated using flow cytometry. The Annexin V-EGFP/PI Kit utilized in this study was supplied by Solepol (Beijing, China).

Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by cDNA synthesis was performed with the Precision nanoScript2 Reverse Transcription Kit (Primerdesign). Subsequently, RT-qPCR amplification was conducted employing ChamQ SYBR qPCR Green Master Mix (Vazyme) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and small nuclear RNA (U6) served as endogenous controls. The levels of LINC01123, miR-134-5p, XIAP, and ALP, OCN, RUNX2 mRNA were quantified via the 2−ΔΔCtmethod.

The ENCORI online database predicts the binding interactions between LINC01123 and miR-134-5p (XIAP and miR-134-5p). Following this prediction, the corresponding sequences were amplified to produce wild plasmid (wt) containing the predicted binding site and mutant plasmid (mut) lacking this site. The above plasmids and miR-134-5p mimic (NC mimic) were co-transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent, respectively. The luciferase activity was finally determined after 48 h.

After osteogenic induction of MC3T3-E1 cells, ALP activity was determined by ALP kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK).

The cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 30 min. After removal of PFA, the cells were treated with 1% alizarin red staining solution for 10 min, and the staining was observed under a microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK).

Cells were lysed by RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China), and proteins were quantified by BCA Protein Assay kit (Beyotime, China). Proteins were separated using SDS⁃PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking PVDF membranes with 5% skim milk powder, primary antibodies to IL-1β and TGF-β were added and the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Next, HRP-labeled secondary antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, Image J software was used for analysis.

Graphpad 9.0 software was applied to process the data. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the Student’st-test (two groups) or one-way ANOVA (multiple groups). To assess the relationships between LINC01123 and miR-134-5p (XIAP and miR-134-5p), Pearson correlation analysis was performed. The diagnostic performance of LINC01123 in relation to delayed fracture healing was revealed by ROC curve. All experiments were independently repeated ≥ 3 times, and statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.

The general data of patients with normal and delayed healing were compared and presented in Table1. Statistically significant differences between the groups were observed for 25-(OH) Vitamin D levels and T-scores (p< 0.001), while age, gender, and BMI were similar between the groups.

The delayed group exhibited a noteworthy elevation in serum LINC01123 expression, as illustrated in Fig.1A. Furthermore, ROC analysis stated the better diagnostic potential of LINC01123 with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.846 for identifying patients with delayed healing fractures (Fig.1B). These results underscore that elevated LINC01123 effectively discriminate delayed fracture healing.

The online database predicted a potential between LINC01123 and miR-134-5p through complementary binding sites (Fig.2A). This targeting relationship was confirmed by luciferase activity assay, which revealed a notable decrease in luciferase activity following the co-transfection of LINC01123-wt and the miR-134-5p mimic (Fig.2B). Fig.2C andDstate that serum miR-134-5p expression was markedly downregulated in the delayed healing group, demonstrating a strong inverse correlation with LINC01123 levels (r= -0.669,p<0.001). These findings collectively support the hypothesis that miR-134-5p is a downstream target of LINC01123.

Upon the induction of osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells, a time-dependent decrease in LINC01123 levels was observed, while miR-134-5p progressively accumulated (Fig.3A andB). Meanwhile, the content of osteogenic markers in the cells was upregulated, indicating successful differentiation (Fig.3C). Following this, the differentiated osteoblasts were harvested, and the LINC01123 and miR-134-5p levels were upregulated through transfection assay. Significant upregulation of LINC01123 with concomitant miR-134-5p downregulation following ov-LINC01123 transfection. Partial restoration of miR-134-5p expression was achieved upon co-transfection with the ov-LINC01123 + miR-134-5p mimic (Fig.3D andE).

Overexpression of LINC01123 suppressed ALP, OCN and RUNX2 mRNA levels, while intervention with miR-134-5p mimic alleviated this inhibitory effect (Fig.3F). In addition, functional assays reflected that high LINC01123 expression was detrimental to cell proliferation, but co-transfection with the miR-134-5p mimic attenuated apoptosis (Fig.3G andH). Furthermore, ALP activity was significantly reduced in ov-LINC01123 group, which was partially restored by miR-134-5p upregulation (Fig.4A). Meanwhile, when LINC01123 levels were increased, OD values were down-regulated, but co-transfection of miR-134-5p mimic promoted the formation of mineralized nodules (Fig.4B). Notably, overexpression of LINC01123 activated the inflammatory factors and suppressed the transforming growth factors in the cells, which was reversed by the intervention of miR-134-5p mimic in Fig.4C andD. These results suggest that increased LINC01123 impeded osteoblast differentiation and activity, and affects the formation of mineralized nodules, whereas miR-134-5p had a relatively counteracting effect on the inhibitory function of LINC01123.

The presence of binding sites between XIAP-wt and miR-134-5p underscores a significant interaction, which is further substantiated by luciferase assays further that elucidate the targeting relationship of miR-134-5p towards XIAP. Transfection of miR-134-5p mimic and XIAP-wt downregulated the luciferase activity (Fig.5A andB). Quantitative assessment of XIAP expression in the serum of fracture patients revealed that XIAP mRNA expression was elevated in the delayed group (Fig.5C). A noteworthy negative correlation was identified between serum XIAP and miR-134-5p level (r= -0.662,p<0.001; Fig.5D).

XIAP mRNA levels exhibited a notable decline with the advancement of osteoblast differentiation (Fig.6A). XIAP mRNA levels were upregulated after transfection of miR-134-5p inhibitor in MC3T3-E1 cells of osteogenic differentiation induction, and their levels were partially restored after knockdown of XIAP (Fig.6B).

Moreover, silencing miR-134-5p suppressed the content of osteogenic markers in the cells, an effect that was reversed following after co-transfection with si-XIAP (Fig.6C). miR-134-5p inhibitor inhibited and accelerated osteoblast viability and apoptosis, respectively, but knockdown of XIAP counteracted these effects (Fig.6D andE). Additionally, miR-134-5p inhibitor had a negative significance on cellular ALP viability and mineralized nodule formation, which was largely eliminated by interference with si-XIAP (Fig.7A andB). Knockdown of miR-134-5 stimulated IL-1β and suppressed TGF-β, while silencing of XIAP ameliorated these effects (Fig.7C andD). This implies that poor expression of miR-134-5p affects the biological behaviors of osteoblasts by targeting XIAP.

Fracture healing encompasses a complex biological cascade characterized by inflammatory, chondrogenic, and remodeling phases [18]. However, mechanistic complexity frequently leads to delayed healing, which imposes considerable physical, psychological, and socioeconomic burdens, ultimately hindering patient recovery [19]. Therefore, the identification of reliable predictors for delayed fracture healing is paramount, allowing for timely clinical interventions that can optimize patient outcomes.

The study of lncRNA in human diseases has been the subject of extensive research, with fractures being no exception [20,21]. Recent investigations have suggested that lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 could serve as a promising diagnostic marker for delayed fracture healing, potentially mediated via miR-223-3p [22]. LncRNA SNHG1 was proposed to suppress fracture repair by targeting the miR-181a-5p/PTEN axis in the report by Guo and colleagues [23]. As a regulatory lncRNA, LINC01123 modulates multiple cellular pathways, particularly in cancer progression. For instance, LINC01123 was prominently expressed in colon adenocarcinoma and functionally regulates tumorigenesis, with similar upregulation also observed in colorectal and ovarian cancers [24–26]. Remarkably, LINC01123 also upregulated in lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LEDVT) rats [27]. We detected positive level of LINC01123 in the serum of patients with delayed fracture healing in the present study, and high levels of LINC01123 had predictive potential for delayed healing. These results underscore the clinical promise of LINC01123 as a key regulator in enhancing fracture repair processes. Complementing our findings, Xiang et al. identified hyperglycemic parameters and inflammatory indicators as sensitive predictors of delayed healing [28].

Osteoblasts are key executors of bone formation, with their functional state being a key determinant of fracture healing outcomes [17]. During the process of fracture repair, osteoblasts facilitate bone regeneration through precisely regulated osteogenic differentiation. This process is integral to fracture healing and can influence the efficiency and quality of bone regeneration through a variety of multidimensional mechanisms [29]. The mouse osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell lines were selected for this study. Luciferase activity assay confirmed the binding relationship between LINC01123 and miR-134-5p. Serum miR-134-5p was poorly expressed in patients with delayed fractures and was negatively regulated by LINC01123. Similarly, reduced expression of miR-134-5p was observed in the tissues of osteoporosis patients [30]. To further understand the effects of dysregulated LINC01123 and miR-134-5p on osteoblasts biological behavior, we induced differentiation of these cells, which showed that the LINC01123 level was downregulated while the miR-134-5p was upregulated as time progressed. Meanwhile, the levels of osteogenic markers, including ALP, OCN, and RUNX2 mRNA, were enhanced, confirming the successful induction of osteoblast differentiation to simulate in vitro fracture healing. In addition, overexpression of LINC01123 inhibited osteoblast differentiation and suppressed cell viability function and inflammatory responses, while the increase of miR-134-5p counteracted the adverse effects of LINC01123 on the cells. We realized that upregulation of LINC01123 may impair osteoblast differentiation and proliferation by directly targeting miR-134-5p, thereby potentially delaying fracture healing in patients.

Mechanistically, it has been postulated that XIAP serves as a downstream target of miR-134-5p, exhibiting a significant expression profile in the delayed group. XIAP protein is an anti-apoptotic molecule that protects osteoblasts and reduces apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 [31,32]. In the report by Yin et al., XIAP was identified as a downstream site of miR-215-5p, was upregulated in osteoporosis patients. miR-215-5p mediated XIAP to facilitate the differentiation of stem cells, imparting a protective effect on these patients [33]. As a pivotal modulator of apoptosis and inflammatory signaling networks, XIAP orchestrates diverse pathophysiological events ranging from metastasis to intracellular communication [34]. Functional analysis revealed that miR-134-5p depletion suppressed osteogenic marker expression, compromised osteoblast viability, andaffected ALP activity and mineralized nodule formation. Importantly, the concomitant knockdown of XIAP was able to reverse these adverse phenotypic changes, thereby establishing a negative regulatory relationship between miR-134-5p and XIAP within the context of fracture repair. However, this is in contradiction with the anti-apoptotic property of XIAP, which may be because in the pathological background of high LINC01123-low miR-134-5p expression, the high expression of XIAP has deviated from its physiological anti-apoptotic function and promoted apoptosis through “non-classical pathway”. This requires us to further explore the complex mechanism of LINC01123-miR-134-5p-XIAP pathway in future studies.

Our study identified the LINC01123/miR-134-5p/XIAP axis as a novel and pivotal regulatory network in fracture healing, providing valuable mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of delayed healing. However, several limitations warrant consideration: (1) the relatively small and geographically restricted patient cohort, (2) the lack of in vivo validation, owing to technical constraints, (3) the exclusive reliance on a single osteoblast model without broader cellular characterization, and (4) the exact role of XIAP in delayed fracture healing needs further investigation.

In conclusion, the upregulation of LINC01123 emerges as a clinically relevant biomarker and a mechanistic regulator of compromised fracture healing, functioning through the precise modulation of osteoblast differentiation via the miR-134-5p/XIAP signaling axis. Consequently, LINC01123 may be a candidate prognostic marker for the progression of fracture healing response, offering a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of delayed healing and poor healing outcomes.
