We report a case of chromoblastomycosis presenting with osteolytic lesions in the foot of a 32-year-old man from Madagascar. Bone involvement occurred through contiguous spread several years after traumatic inoculation. The initial clinical course was favorable following antifungal treatment with itraconazole. Bone involvement in chromoblastomycosis is uncommon and may initially be misdiagnosed. The lesion’s appearance, the history of traumatic inoculation, and the geographic origin must all be taken into account. Diagnosis is established through histopathological examination and fungal culture.

Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic fungal infection primarily affecting the subcutaneous tissue. It progresses slowly and may eventually lead to lymphedema. Although rare, bone involvement is a recognized complication that should not be overlooked [1].

A 32-year-old farmer from Madagascar presented with a lesion on his left foot. His history dated back 20 years, when he sustained a splinter injury to his left heel. A few weeks later, a nodular lesion appeared at the inoculation site and gradually enlarged over the years. Clinical examination revealed a cauliflower-like, foul-smelling, and painful lesion on the left heel (Fig. 1a). Laboratory tests showed no notable abnormalities. Radiographs of the left foot revealed osteolytic lesions of the talus and calcaneus (Fig. 1b). Biopsies were obtained from the subcutaneous lesions. Histopathological analysis showed nonspecific chronic granulomatous inflammation with the presence of Medlar bodies, using periodic acid–Schiff staining. Fungal culture identifiedFonsecaea pedrosoi. Tuberculosis testing was negative. A diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis with bone involvement was established. After five months of itraconazole therapy, the cutaneous lesions regressed.

CBM is a chronic fungal infection caused by melanized, or brown-pigmented, fungi. The most common species belong to the generaFonsecaeaandCladophialophora. It typically results from traumatic inoculation of environmental sources, leading to an initial cutaneous lesion at the site of inoculation, followed by progressive damage to the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. CBM is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions and frequently affects rural workers [1]. The clinical presentation of CBM is highly variable, ranging from nodular to verrucous and plaque-like forms. Extra-cutaneous manifestations have been reported, including involvement of the brain, pleuropulmonary system, tracheobronchial tree, and lymph nodes. Although uncommon, bone involvement has been described in a few cases [2,3]. This is thought to occur through contiguous or hematogenous dissemination. Traumatic inoculation is often overlooked, and bone complications typically manifest several years later in the form of osteolysis [2]. Our patient presented with osteolytic lesions in the underlying bones, suggesting contiguous dissemination. Bone involvement in CBM can pose a significant diagnostic challenge, as it may mimic other diseases. Diagnosis is confirmed through histopathological examination and fungal culture. If left untreated, CBM can lead to severe bone destruction and even pathologic fractures. Itraconazole is the standard long-term treatment; however, surgical interventions, such as excision or amputation, may be necessary in certain cases [1].
