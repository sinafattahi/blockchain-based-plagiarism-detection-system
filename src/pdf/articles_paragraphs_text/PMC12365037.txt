Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to insulin deficiency or resistance. While conventional treatments are effective, integrating nutraceuticals that aid in blood sugar control is crucial for patients with low compliance or prediabetes. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of kefir-derived exopolysaccharides (KEPS) in ameliorating type 2 DM in rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-fat diet.

Eight-week-old male SD rats were fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks and subsequently administered STZ (35 mg/kg body weight) via intraperitoneal injection to induce type 2 diabetes. Diabetic rats were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated diabetes (mock), diabetic rats + high-dose KEPS (STZ-KEPSH), and diabetic rats + low-dose KEPS (STZ-KEPSL), and treated for an additional 4 weeks. An age-matched SD rat group without STZ induction was used as a control. Our findings demonstrate that high-dose KEPS administration in diabetic rats enhances hepatic glucose uptake and stabilizes blood glucose levels by upregulating GLUT2 protein expression and PI3k phosphorylation in liver cells. KEPS mitigates lipid production, reduces β cell damage, and preserves islet cell integrity, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and alleviating diabetes symptoms. High-dose KEPS treatment also exhibits less renal enlargement and lower kidney-to-body weight ratio than the diabetic group.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most prevalent chronic disease worldwide [1]. It primarily arises from a metabolic disorder of glucose, resulting in excessive blood glucose levels due to decreased insulin production [2,3]. This condition is further exacerbated by tissues’ inability to effectively metabolize glucose, leading to insulin resistance that is attributable to diminished responsiveness to glucoregulatory hormones, including insulin, amylin, and GLP-1 [4,5]. DM is also associated with obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia due to disordered energy metabolism, which can progress to cardiovascular disease [6]. The challenge of islet cell regeneration, coupled with glucose toxicity from persistent hyperglycemia, causes further damage to β cells and exacerbates diabetes [7,8]. Consequently, diabetic patients require lifelong medication to manage blood sugar levels and prevent severe complications such as diabetic nephropathy.

In this study, we utilized high-fat diet (HFD) administration and streptozotocin (STZ) injections in rats to impair islet function and reduce insulin secretion, mimicking the pathological mechanisms of diabetes [17]. We then extracted small molecular weight of KEPS from kefir-fermented products and administered them to diabetic rats to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of KEPS on blood sugar control and diabetic organ protection. The objective of our experiment was to elucidate the impact of KEPS on blood sugar reduction and the preservation of organ function, including liver, kidney and pancreas, in diabetic conditions.

Eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were obtained from BioLASCO (Taipei, Taiwan). During the experiments, all rats (2 per cage) were housed in an SPF-grade animal facility under conditions of 24 ± 2°C, 50–60% humidity, and a 12 h cycle of light and darkness, with unrestricted access to both food and water. After a four-week period of being fed an HFD (catalog no. D12492, Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA), the rats were fasted for 16 h and induced with diabetes via an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a dose of 35 mg/kg body weight. Three days post-induction, blood glucose levels were measured after a 12 h fast. Rats exhibiting a blood glucose concentration exceeding 200 mg/dl were classified as having successfully induced diabetes [18].

Following successful induction, a four-week experimental period was conducted. During this time, the rats were divided into four groups (eachn= 6) and continuously fed a high-fat diet: (1) control group: rats lacking STZ induction with administration of water; (2) STZ-mock group: diabetic rats with administration of water; (3) STZ + KEPSL group: diabetic rats with administration of low-dose KEPS at 50 mg/kg/day; and (4) STZ + KEPSH group: diabetic rats with administration of high-dose KEPS at 100 mg/kg/day. The administration of water and KEPS was conducted via oral gavage. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Chung Hsing University (IACUC NCHU-107-042).

The preparation protocol for small molecular weight KEPS was adapted from previous studies [16]. Briefly, 300 grams of kefir powder (Pharmpep Co., Taichung, Taiwan) were dissolved in 1 L of water, heated at 95oC for 4 h, and subsequently centrifuged to obtain the supernatant. An equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the mixture was placed on ice for 30 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged and filtered. Three times the volume of 95% alcohol was added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 48 h before centrifugation. After removing the supernatant, 70% alcohol was added to collect the precipitate by centrifugation. The final KEPS extract was obtained through lyophilization over 48 h. The molecular weight and constitution are illustrated in Supplementary Fig.S1.

All feeding methods utilized a high-fat diet, wherein rats underwent daily oral administration of 3 ml of their specific KEPS solution for a total of four weeks. Blood glucose levels were measured post a 12 h fasting period. Weekly urine and water intake were recorded consistently throughout the study duration. An IDEXX biochemical analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA) was employed to analyze triglycerides, phosphorus, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Blood insulin levels were quantified using a rat insulin ELISA kit (catalog no. ERINS-96T; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [19]. The serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein/very-low-density lipoprotein (LDL/VLDL) cholesterol were assessed by HDL and LDL/VLDL cholesterol quantification kits (catalog no. K613-100; BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) and read on a multiplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).

At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed; their pancreas and kidneys were excised and fixed in formalin for three days to fix the tissue morphology. Following paraffin embedding, tissue sections of 5 μm thickness underwent H&E staining as well as IHC to assess morphological changes [23]. Grading of tissue lesions in both pancreatic and renal tissue sections was conducted by two independent pathologists. Degree of lesions was graded from 0 to 4 depending on severity: 0 = minimal (< 1%); 1 = slight (1–25%); 2 = moderate (26–50%); 3 = moderate/severe (51–75%); 4 = severe/high (76–100%). For kidney pathologic assessment, scoring of proximal tubular hydropic degeneration was examined by the same way. Rabbit anti-rat insulin monoclonal antibody (catalog no. ab6995, K36aC10 clone; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for IHC staining. The relative positive-stained areas among the groups were determined by ImageJ software.

Frozen rat liver tissue was ground to extract proteins for analysis via Western blotting to detect specific proteins using primary antibodies against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (catalog no. 4257S; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K) (catalog no. 4228S; Cell Signaling Technology), GLUT2 (catalog no. 45050; Signalway Antibody, College Park, MD, USA), and GAPDH (catalog no. ab8245; Abcam) in conjunction with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (catalog no. ab97051; Abcam) to elucidate KEPS’s impact on protein expression in liver tissues. The western blot analysis was conducted in accordance with the methodologies outlined in our previous study [23]. The original images of western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig,S2.

All data are expressed as mean and standard error of the mean (mean ± SEM). Statistical evaluations were conducted by one-way ANOVA and Duncan’s post hoc test using IBM SPSS Statistics version 30 software. Outcomes exhibiting statistically significant differences (p< 0.05) were labeled with distinct letters.

The body weight of the STZ-induced diabetic rats was significantly lower than that of the control group (Fig.1A). The percentage change in body weight post-induction was calculated, showing a slower rate of weight gain in the diabetic groups compared to the control group. Figure1Billustrates the body weight changes over the four-week treatment period, demonstrating a gradual increase in body weight in the high-dose KEPS (STZ-KEPSH) group, contrasting with the STZ-mock group, which exhibited minimal weight gain throughout the study. Water intake was generally increased in the STZ-mock group compared to the normal control group throughout the entire experimental process after STZ induction, whereas the STZ-KEPSH group revealed a marked reduction in water intake relative to the STZ-mock group (Fig.1C). Additionally, the enhanced diuresis observed in diabetic rats was significantly reduced in the STZ-KEPSH group compared to the STZ-mock group (Fig.1D).

Before the administration of KEPS (W0), fasting blood glucose levels were markedly elevated in all STZ-treated groups compared to the control group (Fig.2A), signifying the effective induction of diabetes via STZ injection. It is essential to note that no significant difference was found between the STZ-mock group and the STZ-KEPSH group at the first two weeks (p> 0.05); however, after the following weeks, the STZ-KEPSH group showed significantly lower blood glucose levels than the STZ-mock diabetic group (p< 0.05), with levels comparable to those of the control group (Fig.2A).

OGTT revealed that the blood glucose value and the area under the curve (AUC) at 120 min for the STZ induction groups were significantly higher than those for the control group (p< 0.001) (Fig.2B, C). Notably, at the 120 min mark of OGTT, blood glucose levels in the fourth-week STZ-KEPSH group were significantly lower than those in the STZ-mock group (p< 0.05) (Fig.2C). The AUC for the STZ induction groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (p< 0.001), with a significant difference between the high-dose KEPS-treated and STZ-mock groups (p< 0.05) (Fig.2D).

The HOMA-IR index was markedly increased by STZ injection before KEPS administration (p< 0.01; Fig.3A), indicating the resultant insulin resistance in all STZ-treated rats. After four weeks of KEPS administration, both KEPS-treated groups exhibited significantly lower HOMA-IR indices than the STZ-mock group (p< 0.01 andp< 0.001, respectively), aligning their indices with the control group (Fig.3A), suggesting an improvement of insulin sensitivity.

In contrast to HOMA-IR index, the HOMA-β cell function index markedly decreased after STZ induction (Fig.3B). Following four-week administration of KEPS, the index of HOMA-β cell function slightly increased in the KEPS-treated groups; nevertheless, the impact of KEPS on this index was not significant. Similarly, the effects of KEPS administration were not reflected in the significant changes in blood insulin in STZ-treated groups, even though there were higher insulin levels detected in the STZ-KEPSH group (Fig.3C).

The serum concentrations of LDL/VLDL-cholesterol in the STZ-mock diabetic group were significantly higher than the control group (p< 0.05; Fig.4A). Importantly, both of the STZ-KEPSL and STZ-KEPSH groups exhibited significantly lower LDL/VLDL-cholesterol concentrations than the STZ-mock group (p< 0.05; Fig.4A). There was no statistical difference in HDL-cholesterol levels among all groups; however, a slight increase in HDL was observed in the STZ-KEPSH group (Fig.4B). Additionally, the serum triglyceride values were significantly higher in the STZ-induced groups compared to the control group (p< 0.01; Fig.4C). The STZ-KEPSH group had a lower mean triglyceride value than the STZ-mock group, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig.4C).

Compared to the control group, the pancreatic islets exhibited a pronounced atrophic feature, demonstrating a substantial decrease in β cell population in the STZ-mock group (Fig.5A). Data showed that the grade of atrophy observed in the pancreatic islets exhibited a significant reduction in the STZ-KEPSL and STZ-KEPSH groups compared to the STZ-mock group (p< 0.01 andp< 0.001, respectively) (Fig.5B). As noted in Table1, STZ-induced lesions in individual pancreatic tissue sections were assessed at either grade 3 or 4 in the STZ-mock group, which was worse than those in the STZ-KEPSL group (grade 2 or 3) and the STZ-KEPSH group (grade 0 to 3). The average numbers of pancreatic islets were found to be increased in both KEPS-treated groups compared to the STZ-mock group, but the differences were statistically insignificant. Furthermore, insulin-stained areas of the islets were significantly decreased in the STZ-mock group but increased in both KEPS treatment groups, with the STZ-KEPSH group reaching levels comparable to the control group (p> 0.05) (Fig.5C).

Histological examination of kidney tissues revealed multiple proximal convoluted tubule water degeneration and lumen enlargement across all STZ-induced groups, with significant differences observed between these groups and the control group (p< 0.01) (Fig.6A, B). Additionally, the STZ-KEPSH group showed less renal enlargement and a lower kidney-to-body weight ratio compared to the STZ-mock group (p< 0.05) (Fig.6C). We also assessed changes in capsular space but found no significant alterations noted in this study.

The expression level of GLUT2 in the liver tissue was significantly lower in the STZ-mock group compared to the control group (p< 0.01) (Fig.7A). However, GLUT2 expression was restored to levels not statistically different from controls in the STZ-KEPSL group (p> 0.05), while the STZ-KEPSH group exhibited significantly higher GLUT2 expression than the STZ-mock group (p< 0.05) (Fig.7B).

Western blot analysis indicated that total PI3K protein expression was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic rats compared to control rats (Fig.7C). The total PI3K protein expression in the STZ-KEPSH group was significantly higher than that of the STZ-mock group (p< 0.05) (Fig.7D). Furthermore, phosphorylation levels of PI3K (p-PI3K) were significantly reduced in the STZ-mock group compared to the control group (p< 0.001) (Fig.7E, F), while all KEPS treatment groups exhibited significantly increased phosphorylation levels, even exceeding those of controls (p< 0.05) (Fig.7G).

Our experiment utilized STZ to partially destroy islet tissue in rats, reducing insulin secretion. The rats were then fed an HFD to produce lipotoxicity and glucose toxicity, further damaging the pancreatic β cells and creating a type 2 DM-like pathological state [24,25].

After HFD and STZ induction, the diabetic rats exhibited the hallmark symptoms of diabetes, including reduced weight gain, increased water intake, and elevated urine output [26,27]. These symptoms are primarily due to the inability of tissues to metabolize glucose, leading to hyperglycemia and the associated physiological consequences. Importantly, the rats treated with KEPS showed improvements in these diabetic symptoms, with higher body weight, less water intake, and reduced urine output compared to the STZ-mock diabetic group. This suggests that KEPS supplementation may ameliorate diabetic symptoms in STZ-treated rats, possibly through its beneficial effects on blood glucose control [28].

The effects of KEPS on glucose regulation were further confirmed by the findings that STZ-treated rats receiving high-dose KEPS exhibited a remarkable reduction in blood glucose in comparison with the mock STZ-treated rats starting from the third week post-STZ induction. The differences in blood glucose may be attributed to improvements in insulin resistance rather than increased insulin secretion. In DM, glucose toxicity occurs due to persistent hyperglycemia, leading to decreased islet cell proliferation [29]. Our findings suggest that KEPS may have the ability to improve blood glucose regulation, potentially by reducing insulin resistance and preventing the detrimental effects of glucose toxicity and oxidative stress [25].

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed that the 120-min blood glucose value and the area under the glucose curve were smaller in the high-dose KEPS-treated rats compared to the mock group. This indicates that KEPS supplementation enhanced the ability of peripheral tissues, such as muscle, fat, and liver cells, to clear glucose during periods of hyperglycemia [30,31].

After four weeks of high-fat diet feeding, the HOMA-IR values increased in the STZ-mock group, indicating the development of insulin resistance. This phenomenon, known as lipotoxicity, is characterized by diminished responsiveness to glucoregulatory hormones, including insulin, amylin, and GLP-1 [4,32]. Interestingly, the HOMA-IR value in the 4-week KEPS-treated group was similar to the control group, suggesting that KEPS supplementation may have altered fat metabolism and reduced lipotoxicity, thereby improving glucose utilization by peripheral tissues.

The HOMA-β cell function assessment revealed that the value was lower in the STZ-induced diabetic rats compared to the HFD-fed control group, indicating more extensive β cell destruction. Even in the control group, the HOMA-β cell function value decreased after the four-week high-fat diet, as high-fat diets can also disrupt β cell function [29]. While KEPS supplementation could not fully restore the β cell function destroyed by STZ to normal levels, it was able to protect β cells from further damage caused by HFD or hyperglycemia [33].

Diabetic patients often exhibit dyslipidemia, with higher triglycerides and LDL/VLDL-cholesterol levels due to insufficient insulin and increased hepatic triglyceride secretion [34,35]. The same phenomenon was found in our experiment, the KEPS-treated rats had lower serum contents of triglycerides and LDL/VLDL-cholesterol compared to the mock group, potentially due to improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced cellular glucose utilization [36].

In contrast to the control rats, the STZ-treated rats exhibited a pronounced atrophy in their pancreatic islets, indicating a substantial reduction in the population of β cells. Diabetes is known to impair pancreatic islet regeneration due to glucose toxicity. Interestingly, the KEPS-fed group showed less damage to the islet tissue compared to the mock group. This mechanism may be attributed to KEPS’s ability to enhance cellular glucose utilization and reduce further damage to β cells caused by HFD and hyperglycemia [37]. The improved insulin immunostaining in the low-dose and high-dose KEPS-fed groups suggest that β cell function was better preserved, likely due to lower insulin resistance and more stable blood glucose levels, which prevent further hyperglycemia-induced damage to the β cells [33].

Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by renal hypertrophy, primarily due to glomerular damage. However, recent studies have shown that impaired glucose reabsorption and proximal convoluted tubule degeneration are also key contributors to diabetic kidney disease in STZ-induced models. Our study found similar degrees of tubular degeneration between the KEPS-fed and mock groups, indicating that the STZ-induced damage was irreversible. Nevertheless, the KEPS-treated group exhibited less renal hypertrophy compared to the mock group, suggesting that the improvements in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia may have attenuated the degree of kidney enlargement.

GLUT2 protein has high capacity but low affinity for glucose and is mainly distributed in the liver and pancreas. It acts as a “glucose sensor” in pancreatic β cells. Upon a rise in blood glucose levels, glucose diffuses through GLUT2 into islet cells and undergoes metabolic transformation to increase the ATP/ADP ratio in the cytoplasm of β cells. This biochemical change results in the closure of K+-ATP channels and the concomitant opening of Ca2+channels, which together initiate the process that triggers β cells to secrete insulin through exocytosis [38]. If the expression of GLUT2 protein is high in the liver, the response of cells to suppression of glucagon secretion, feeding termination and stimulation of glucose uptake by some muscles and brown fat [39]. The decreased expression of the GLUT2 glucose transporter in the livers of STZ-induced diabetic rats indicates reduced glucose sensing and utilization, contributing to insulin resistance. KEPS supplementation increased GLUT2 expression, potentially enhancing hepatic glucose uptake and storage, and improving insulin sensitivity [40].

Insulin signaling in the liver, mediated by the phosphorylation of PI3K, promotes hepatic glucose synthesis and increases the ability of hepatocytes to utilize glucose [41–43]. Previous studies have also pointed out that altered glucose metabolism in the liver regulates beta cell proliferation in the pancreas via neuronal signal [44,45]. In this study, the decreased PI3K phosphorylation observed in the diabetic rats suggests impaired insulin signaling and reduced hepatic glucose metabolism. Interestingly, KEPS-fed rats exhibited higher PI3K phosphorylation compared to the mock group, indicating that KEPS can promote the conversion of glucose to glycogen in the liver, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that KEPS supplementation in diabetic rats can improve glucose homeostasis and alleviate the symptoms of type 2 DM. The proposed mechanisms include enhancing hepatic glucose uptake and utilization, increasing insulin sensitivity, protecting pancreatic β cell islet integrity and function, and modulating lipid metabolism. These multifaceted effects of kefir-derived exopolysaccharide contribute to the amelioration of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and diabetic complications in this STZ-induced diabetic rat model.
