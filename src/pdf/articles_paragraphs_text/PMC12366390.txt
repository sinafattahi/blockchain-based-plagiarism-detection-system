Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the major cause of vision decline in adults worldwide. Photoreceptor loss is considered a main pathogenesis of retinal dysfunction in DR. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) treatment has been considered a promising cell-free approach for retinal disorders. However, the role and mechanism of MEVs in alleviating photoreceptor injury in DR remain unclear. In this study, MEV treatment improved retinal function and inhibited photoreceptor apoptosis in db/db mice. Mechanistically, the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 25 (USP25) in MEVs was responsible for the MEV-mediated photoreceptor therapy by inhibiting hyperglycemia-induced αA-crystallin (CRYAA) ubiquitination. Moreover, USP25-enriched MEVs modified with the photoreceptor-targeting peptide MH42 (MEVsMH42-USP25) were prepared by genetic engineering and surface conjugation. MEVsMH42-USP25 exhibited elevated repairing efficiency to attenuate retinal dysfunction and photoreceptor loss in db/db mice. Our study develops an MEV-based nanocarrier for photoreceptor-targeted delivery and highlights the effectiveness of MEVsMH42-USP25 as novel therapeutics for DR.

As a prevalent complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual impairment in adults worldwide [1]. Hyperglycemia-induced photoreceptor loss is recognized as a key contributor to retinal dysfunction in DR [2]. Although current treatment options, such as laser therapy, antiangiogenic drug injection, and vitrectomy, have achieved encouraging progress, limited visual improvement and unfavorable side effects remain [3,4]. Thus, the pathophysiology clarification of photoreceptor injury in DR and the development of effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a type of nanoscale particles secreted by living cells [5]. By participating in intercellular communication, EVs are involved in various biological processes, including retinal homeostasis regulation [6,7]. Increasing studies have suggested that the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation are largely mediated by EV release [8,9]. Recently, MSC-derived EVs (MEVs) have emerged as a novel approach for retinal disease therapy by delivering proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids [10]. For instance, MEVs exhibit neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles in retinal ischemic disorders [11]. Our previous study reveals that MEV-delivered NEDD4 mitigates hyperglycemia-induced retinal oxidative damage by regulating the PTEN/AKT/NRF2 axis [12]. However, whether MEVs can improve photoreceptor injury-induced retinal dysfunction in DR remains unclear.

Accumulating studies have demonstrated the potential of EVs as promising and secure carriers in tissue regeneration [13,14]. Relative to synthetic nanotools, EVs exhibit many favorable characteristics, such as biocompatibility, stability, low immunogenicity, and biological barrier permeability [15,16]. Owing to their natural origin, EVs can escape phagocytosis and exhibit an extended half-life [17]. For instance, EV-based inhalable vaccines show broader distribution and extended retention on the respiratory mucosa [18]. Moreover, the conjugation of membrane structures with functional ligands or peptides enables EVs with cell-specific targeting [19]. Through bioengineering, the characteristics of EVs can be optimized to enhance their therapeutic efficiency [20]. Nevertheless, the MEV-based strategy for photoreceptor-targeted therapy in DR has not yet been established.

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic role of MEVs in retinal dysfunction in db/db mice. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gene knockout mice were used to explore the potential mechanism of MEV-mediated photoreceptor therapy. We found that MEVs alleviated photoreceptor injury by ubiquitin-specific peptidase 25 (USP25)-mediated αA-crystallin (CRYAA) deubiquitination. Based on lentivirus-mediated genetic manipulation and CP05 peptide-induced combination with the EV membrane, USP25-enriched MEVs modified with photoreceptor-targeting peptide MH42 (MEVsMH42-USP25) were constructed. MEVsMH42-USP25 allowed the efficient delivery of USP25 to photoreceptors, thereby ameliorating diabetic retinal dysfunction. Our findings establish an MEVsMH42-USP25-based photoreceptor-targeted strategy for DR therapy.

MSCs were separated from fresh umbilical cords as previously described [21]. After osteogenic and adipogenic inductions, MSCs were treated with Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O to evaluate their multiple differentiation ability. The MSC markers such as CD11b, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD105, and CD166 were determined by flow cytometry.

MEVs were extracted from the supernatants of MSCs maintained in serum-free medium (CM-SC01, Pricella, China) by ultracentrifugation as previously described [22]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle flow cytometry (NanoFCM) were used to detect the structure and particle size of MEVs. Western blot was applied to determine the EV markers including CD9, CD63, HSP90, TSG101, and calnexin.

In vitro, 661 W cells were maintained in low glucose (LG) medium. To mimic diabetic damage, 661 W cells were seeded in each plate at a density of 5 × 104cells/mL and stimulated with high glucose (HG) medium (30 mM), followed by the treatment with MEVs (1 × 106, 1 × 107, or 1 × 108particles/mL) for 24 h.

One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to compare the conjugation efficiency among groups. The final solution was collected and analyzed by flow cytometry.

To evaluate the distribution of MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, and MEVsMH42-USP25 in retinal tissues, peptides were labeled with FITC and EVs were labeled with PKH26. Following intravitreal injection, db/db mice were treated with MH42-CP05 fusion peptides, MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, and MEVsMH42-USP25, respectively. After 24 h, the retinal tissues were snap-frozen, cut into 10 μm sections, incubated with anti-rhodopsin or anti-s-opsin antibody overnight, counterstained with DAPI solution for 15 min, and observed using a confocal microscope.

db/db and db/m mice were purchased from Cavens Laboratory (Changzhou, China). To evaluate the retinal therapeutic effects of MEVs, db/db mice were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of MEVs (1 × 106, 1 × 107, or 1 × 108particles) every 4 weeks. To investigate whether MEVs alleviate photoreceptor injury by delivering USP25, db/db mice were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of MEVs (1 × 107particles) and 1 µL of MEVsshUSP25(1 × 107particles) every 4 weeks, respectively. To explore the proper intervention dose of MEVsMH42-USP25, db/db mice were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of MEVsMH42-USP25 (1 × 106, 1 × 107, or 1 × 108particles) every 4 weeks. To evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of MEVsMH42-USP25, db/db mice were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, MEVsMH42-USP25, and MEVsScrbl-USP25 (1 × 107particles) every 4 weeks, respectively. To compare the therapeutic effects of MEVs-USP25 and MEVsMH42-USP25 containing equal USP25 protein content, db/db mice were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of MEVs-USP25 and MEVsMH42-USP25 (100 pg of USP25 protein level) every 4 weeks, respectively. At week 24, all mice were sacrificed using 4% isoflurane, and retinal tissues were isolated.

Wild type (WT) and CRYAA knockout (CRYAAKO) mice were purchased from Cyagen Bioscience (Suzhou, China) and induced to diabetic model by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding plus injection with streptozotocin (STZ; 30 mg/kg per day; Sigma-Aldrich, MO) intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days, as in previous studies [23]. Two weeks after STZ injection, CRYAAKOmice were treated with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying CRYAA (AAV9-CRYAA) or AAV9-null via subretinal injection. Subsequently, WT and CRYAAKOmice were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of MEVs (1 × 107particles) every 4 weeks. Twenty-four weeks after STZ administration, all mice were sacrificed with 4% isoflurane, and retinal tissues were isolated.

After dark-adaption overnight, db/m and db/db mice were intraperitoneally injected with ketamine (85 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) under dim red light. The corneas were treated with 0.5% proxymetacaine. The ground electrode was placed on the tail. The recording electrode was placed on the cornea. The reference electrode was placed on the mouth. A white flash (3.0 cd.s/m2) was applied for inducing this experiment.

After enucleation, the eyeballs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. The retinas were cut into 4 μm sections and treated with HE staining to detect retinal structure and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness.

The apoptotic cells in retinal tissues were detected using the TUNEL Kit (C1089, Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Following counterstaining with DAPI solution for 15 min, the retinal tissues were observed under a confocal microscope.

After deparaffinization and antigen retrieval, the retinal sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 30 min and stained with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Following the treatment with FITC/Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h and DAPI solution for 20 min, the retinal tissues were photographed using a confocal microscope.

The protein samples were isolated from the 661 W cells after MEV treatment, subjected to digestion and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In addition, 661 W cells after MEV treatment were incubated with co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) solution and treated with CRYAA antibody (1:200, c-69687, SANTA CRUZ, USA), followed by the LC-MS/MS to detect the proteins interacted with CRYAA. The detailed LC-MS/MS analysis is described in Supplementary Methods.

The proteins were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (EA0002, SparkJade, China), exposed to SDS/PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 h and then treated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Following the incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (ab6721/ab6728, Abcam, USA) for 1 h, the bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent.

After Co-IP solution (P0013, Beyotime, China) incubation, cells were treated with the CRYAA antibody (1:200, c-69687, SANTA CRUZ, USA) and IgG (negative control) with rotation for 24 h, respectively. After the combination with magnetic beads for 6 h, the samples were determined by Western blot.

661 W cells were maintained in fresh medium supplemented with EdU working reagent for 3 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, 661 W cells were treated with the EdU Assay Kit (ab219801, Abcam, USA) for 30 min, incubated with DAPI buffer for 15 min and photographed using a microscope.

661 W cells were plated in 96-well plates (1500 cells/well) and incubated with 20 µL of CCK8 solution (ab228554, Abcam, USA) for 1 h. The absorbance was determined at 450 nm by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent plate assay reader every 24 h.

Aqueous humor and serum samples were collected from db/db mice at weeks 24 and 48. ELISA kits were applied to determine cytokine levels in the aqueous humor and serum, including IL-1β (E-EL-M0037, Elabscience, China), IL-6 (E-EL-M0044, Elabscience, China), IL-8 (SEKM-0046, Solarbio, China), and TNF-α (E-EL-M3063, Elabscience, China). The intraocular pressure of db/db mice at weeks 24 and 48 was measured using tonometers. Blood cell counts of db/db mice at weeks 24 and 48 were determined using hemocytometers. The histological characteristics of the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were assessed after HE staining. MH42 peptides, commercial human CD63 protein (Ag19690, Proteintech, China), and human CD9 protein (ab152263, Abcam, USA) were diluted with coating solution, coated in 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Coning) overnight at 4 °C, and blocked with 200 µL of blocking solution for 2 h. Subsequently, serum samples were diluted 1:100 with 0.1% BSA, added into each well, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBST, the samples were treated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:2000). TMB substrate was used for color development, which was then terminated using a termination solution. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader. Serum samples from untreated db/m mice were used as negative controls.

The statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, USA). The results were shown as mean ± SEM. The two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was performed for comparison between two groups. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed to determine the significance among multiple groups.Pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

MSCs were isolated from human umbilical cords using an established separation method. Microscopic images demonstrated the spindle-like morphology of MSCs (Supplementary Figure S1 A and B). After osteogenic and adipogenic medium induction, Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining confirmed the multiple differentiation potential of MSCs (Supplementary Figure S1 C and D). Flow cytometric analysis showed that MSCs were positive for the expression of CD73, CD105, and CD166, and negative for the expression of CD11b, CD34, and CD45 (Supplementary Figure S1 E). Subsequently, MEVs were extracted from the supernatant of MSCs by ultracentrifugation. TEM and NanoFCM results indicated that MEVs displayed a cup-shaped structure with an average particle size of 79.2 nm (Fig.1A and B). Western blot demonstrated the presence of EV markers including CD9, CD63, HSP90, and TSG101 in MEVs (Fig.1C). We then evaluated the distribution of MEVs after intravitreal injection. Biodistribution analysis revealed the localization of PKH26-labeled MEVs in various retinal layers for up to 3 weeks (Supplementary Figure S2), which was consistent with the previous study [24]. These results confirm the successful extraction of MEVs.

To investigate the role of MEVs in retinal dysfunction, db/db mice were treated with MEVs by intravitreal injection (Fig.1D). ERG analysis was performed to detect retinal electrophysiological functions, including photopic and scotopic responses. Compared with db/m mice, db/db mice displayed impaired retinal function, as evidenced by the reduced amplitudes of photopic b-waves and scotopic a/b-waves. Notably, MEV treatment recovered the photoreceptor function of db/db mice (Fig.1E-I). Histological analysis demonstrated that long-term hyperglycemia led to retinal degeneration and photoreceptor-nuclei-residing ONL loss, while MEVs preserved retinal integrity and improved ONL thickness (Fig.1J and K). TUNEL staining revealed that MEVs significantly reduced photoreceptor apoptosis rates in the ONL (Fig.1L and M). Consistently, immunofluorescence staining showed the loss of rhodopsin+rods and s-opsin+cones in db/db mice, whereas MEVs increased the number of rod and cone photoreceptors (Fig.1N-Q). Notably, the retinal therapeutic efficiency of MEVs with 1 × 107particles was markedly higher than that of MEVs with 1 × 106particles, whereas no significant improvement was observed in photoreceptor therapy when the dose of MEVs was increased to 1 × 108particles, implying that 1 × 107particles is the optimal dose of MEVs. These results indicate that MEVs alleviate retinal dysfunction by inhibiting photoreceptor loss in DR.

Next, we assessed the role of MEVs in HG medium-treated 661 W cells. In vitro tracing experiments confirmed the internalization of PKH26-labeled MEVs by 661 W cells (Fig.2A). CCK8 assay and EdU staining presented that the HG medium inhibited the proliferative ability of 661 W cells, whereas MEV treatment promoted the proliferation of 661 W cells (Fig.2B-D). TUNEL staining demonstrated that MEVs effectively reduced the apoptotic rate of 661 W cells under HG conditions (Fig.2E and F). Western blot analysis also indicated that MEVs upregulated PCNA and Bcl-2 expressions and downregulated Bax protein level in 661 W cells cultured in HG medium (Fig.2G and H). These findings reveal that MEVs protect 661 W cells from HG stimulation.

To explore the therapeutic mechanism of MEVs, we detected the differentially expressed proteins in untreated and MEV-treated 661 W cells under HG conditions using LC-MS/MS. The results indicated that MEV treatment markedly elevated CRYAA protein level (Fig.3A). Previous studies have reported the retinal therapeutic role of CRYAA in experimental uveitis, DR, and retinal stress responses [25–27]. Therefore, we hypothesized that MEVs attenuate photoreceptor injury in DR by upregulating CRYAA expression. Immunostaining and Western blot confirmed that MEVs promoted CRYAA expression in 661 W cells (Fig.3B-E). In vivo experiments further verified that MEV injection caused the upregulation of CRYAA in the ONL (Fig.3F-I), suggesting that MEVs reverse the hyperglycemia-induced CRYAA inhibition in photoreceptors.

To evaluate the role of CRYAA in photoreceptor damage in DR, 661 W cells were exposed to HG medium and treated with CRYAA-overexpressing plasmids. Western blot confirmed that CRYAA expression was markedly upregulated in 661 W cells after transfection (Supplementary Figure S3A). CCK8 assay and EdU staining demonstrated that CRYAA overexpression markedly elevated the proliferative ability of 661 W cells (Supplementary Figure S3B-D). Compared with the control group, transfection with CRYAA overexpression plasmids reduced the apoptotic rate of 661 W cells under HG condition (Supplementary Figure S3E and F). Previous studies have indicated that CRYAA can prevent cell death by inhibiting oxidative stress [28,29]. Therefore, we evaluated retinal oxidative markers following CRYAA-overexpressing plasmid transfection and found that CRYAA overexpression efficiently reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and elevated the levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in 661 W cells (Supplementary Figure S4A-E). These results indicate that CRYAA is an essential therapeutic target for photoreceptor injury in DR.

Subsequently, CRYAAKOmice were used to determine whether MEVs alleviate photoreceptor damage through CRYAA upregulation. WT and CRYAAKOmice were fed with HFD and intraperitoneally injected with STZ, followed by the intravitreal injection with MEVs (Fig.3J). Western blot confirmed CRYAA knockout in the retinas of CRYAAKOmice (Fig.3K). Continuous blood glucose tests showed that WT and CRYAAKOmice remained hyperglycemic throughout the experiment (Fig.3L). HE staining images presented that MEVs alleviated hyperglycemia-induced retinal degeneration and elevated ONL thickness. In contrast, MEVs did not significantly increase ONL thickness in CRYAAKOmice (Fig.3M and N). TUNEL staining further demonstrated that CRYAA knockout impaired the anti-apoptotic effects of MEVs on photoreceptors (Fig.3O and P). Moreover, MEVs exerted limited effects to upregulate the expression of rhodopsin and s-opsin in STZ-treated CRYAAKOmice (Fig.3Q-T). To further confirm the essential role of CRYAA in MEV-mediated photoreceptor therapy, we used AAV9-CRYAA to induce CRYAA re-expression in STZ-treated CRYAAKOmice by subretinal injection, followed by MEV administration (Supplementary Figure S5A). Western blot confirmed CRYAA re-expression in the retinal tissues of CRYAAKOmice after AAV9-CRYAA injection (Supplementary Figure S5B). We found that CRYAA re-expression restored MEV-mediated retinal therapeutic roles in DR, including ONL thickness enhancement and photoreceptor apoptosis inhibition, whereas AAV9-null injection had limited effects on the functional recovery of MEVs (Supplementary Figure S5C-K). These findings indicate that MEVs alleviate photoreceptor injury in DR by upregulating CRYAA expression.

Next, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying MEV-mediated CRYAA upregulation in photoreceptors. We incubated 661 W cells with cycloheximide, a protein translation inhibitor, and measured CRYAA protein levels. Compared with the HG group, MEV treatment remarkably enhanced the half-life of CRYAA (Fig.4A). Co-IP assay also presented that MEVs reversed HG-induced CRYAA ubiquitination (Fig.4B), indicating that MEVs promote CRYAA expression through a ubiquitin proteasome mechanism. Subsequently, we conducted immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses to detect potential interacting proteins and obtained 66 candidate proteins. Compared with the HG group, CRYAA protein combined more deubiquitinating enzyme USP25 in 661 W cells after MEV treatment (Fig.4C and D). Therefore, we detected USP25 expression in MEVs. Western bolt confirmed that USP25 was enriched in MEVs and MEVs upregulated USP25 expression in 661 W cells under HG condition (Fig.4E and F). Moreover, intravitreal MEV injection promoted USP25 expression in the ONL of db/db mice (Fig.4G and H). To explore whether USP25 deubiquitinates and stabilizes CRYAA, we evaluated CRYAA ubiquitination in 661 W cells treated with USP25 overexpression plasmids or siRNAs. The Co-IP assay confirmed that CRYAA was the partner of USP25 (Fig.4I). Moreover, CRYAA ubiquitination was markedly downregulated in USP25-overexpressing cells (Fig.4J). In contrast, USP25 knockdown promoted CRYAA ubiquitination in 661 W cells (Fig.4K). Rescuing USP25 knockdown cells with USP25WTreduced CRYAA ubiquitination, whereas treatment with the USP25C178Smutant, which lacks USP25 deubiquitinating enzyme activity, exerted no significant effect (Supplementary Figure S6A and B). To explore the lysine site on CRYAA involved in USP25 deubiquitination regulation, we constructed single-site mutants at all CRYAA lysine sites and observed that K86R abolished USP25 knockdown-induced CRYAA ubiquitination (Supplementary Figure S7A and B), indicating that K86 is the key site for USP25-mediated CRYAA deubiquitination. Furthermore, we inhibited USP25 expression in MSCs after shRNA transfection and purified MEVsshUSP25from the conditioned medium of MSCsshUSP25. Western blot confirmed the inhibition of USP25 in MSCsshUSP25and MEVsshUSP25compared with the control groups (Fig.4L and M). USP25 knockdown significantly abolished the MEV-mediated CRYAA deubiquitination in 661 W cells (Fig.4N). Taken together, these results indicate that MEVs transfer USP25 to deubiquitinate and stabilize CRYAA.

To verify the key role of USP25 in MEV-induced photoreceptor therapy, db/db mice were treated with MEVs and MEVsshUSP25by intravitreal injection, respectively (Fig.5A). ERG analysis showed that USP25 knockdown abolished the MEV-induced improvement in retinal function, as evidenced by reduced amplitudes of scotopic a/b-waves and photopic b-waves compared with the MEVs group (Fig.5B-F). Retinal HE staining images presented that MEVsshUSP25displayed a limited ability to preserve retinal structure and increase ONL thickness (Fig.5G and H). TUNEL staining further indicated that reduced USP25 level in MEVs remarkably impaired the anti-apoptotic effects of MEVs, as evidenced by the increased number of TUNEL+cells in the ONL of db/db mice treated with MEVsshUSP25relative to the MEV-treated group (Fig.5I and J). In addition, USP25 knockdown reversed PCNA and Bcl-2 upregulation and Bax downregulation in the retinas of db/db mice after MEV injection (Fig.5K and L). Moreover, immunostaining presented that MEVs, but not MEVsshUSP25, upregulated the retinal expression of rhodopsin and s-opsin in db/db mice (Fig.5M-P). These findings suggest that USP25 is required for the MEV-induced therapeutic potential in hyperglycemia-triggered photoreceptor damage.

To further enhance the therapeutic efficiency of MEVs against retinal dysfunction in DR, we intended to construct engineered MEVs with increased photoreceptor targeting and USP25 expression. As shown in Fig.6A, we transfected MSCs with USP25 lentivirus, isolated MEVs-USP25 from the supernatant of MSCs-USP25, and conjugated MH42 onto the membrane of MEVs-USP25 using the CP05 peptide. TEM demonstrated that MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, and MEVsMH42-USP25 displayed typical cup-shaped morphologies (Fig.6B). NanoFCM results presented that the average size of MEVsMH42-USP25 was slightly larger than that of MEVs (Fig.6C). The EV markers such as CD9, CD63, HSP90, and TSG101 were expressed in MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, and MEVsMH42-USP25 (Fig.6D). Moreover, we detected USP25 expression in six batches of MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, and MEVsMH42-USP25, and found that USP25 protein level was significantly increased in MEVs-USP25 and MEVsMH42-USP25 compared with the MEVs and MEVsMH42groups (Fig.6E, F and Supplementary Figure S8A, B). After lysis, USP25 was quantified to be 173 ± 15 pg per 108particles in MEVsMH42-USP25 (Supplementary Figure S8C). Subsequently, we measured the conjugation efficacy of MH42 peptide and MH42-CP05 fusion peptide. The results showed that the conjugation efficiency of MH42-CP05 fusion peptide was significantly higher than that of MH42 peptide (Fig.6G). Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed the effective binding of the MH42-CP05 fusion peptide to the surface of MEVsMH42and MEVsMH42-USP25 (Supplementary Figure S8D). Biodistribution analysis verified that MEVs and MEVs-USP25 were located in the GCL, INL, and ONL after intravitreal injection, whereas conjugation of the MH42-CP05 fusion peptide contributed to the location of MEVsMH42and MEVsMH42-USP25 in the ONL (Fig.6H and Supplementary Figure S8E). In addition, immunofluorescence staining results showed that MEVsMH42and MEVsMH42-USP25 displayed significantly increased co-localization with rhodopsin+rods and s-opsin+cones after intravitreal injection (Supplementary Figure S9A-D). The above results suggest that the MH42 peptide enables MEVsMH42-USP25 to target photoreceptors for USP25 delivery.

We then explored the optimal in vivo dose of MEVsMH42-USP25. As shown in Supplementary Figure S10A-N, MEVsMH42-USP25 at a dose of 1 × 107particles significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia-induced retinal dysfunction and photoreceptor damage compared with the 1 × 106particle group. Notably, no significant difference in therapeutic efficacy was observed between the 1 × 107particle and 1 × 108particle groups. Therefore, we selected 1 × 107particles as the dose for comparing the therapeutic potential of MEVs, MEVs-USP25, MEVsMH42, and MEVsMH42-USP25 in DR (Fig.7A). The results of Western blot demonstrated that MH42 conjugation and USP25 loading enhanced the ability of MEVs to upregulate retinal USP25 expression in db/db mice (Figure S11A and B). Photopic and scotopic ERG analyses indicated that intravitreal delivery of MEVsMH42-USP25 more effectively alleviated retinal dysfunction in db/db mice compared to MEVs, MEVs-USP25, and MEVsMH42, as evidenced by the higher amplitudes of photopic b-waves and scotopic a/b-waves (Fig.7B-F). Retinal HE staining demonstrated that MEV-treated db/db mice exhibited improved retinal structure and increased ONL thickness, while MEVsMH42-USP25 further mitigated diabetes-induced retinal degeneration and photoreceptor loss (Fig.7G and H). Consistently, TUNEL staining presented that MEVsMH42-USP25 treatment resulted in a lower rate of photoreceptor apoptosis in the ONL compared with MEVs, MEVs-USP25, and MEVsMH42groups (Fig.7I and J). As verified by rhodopsin and s-opsin staining, the hyperglycemia-induced loss of rods and cones was further reversed by MEVsMH42-USP25 treatment (Fig.7K-N).

In addition, MEVsMH42-USP25 and MEVs-USP25 were normalized to equal USP25 protein concentrations and intravitreally injected into db/db mice (Supplementary Figure S12A). Compared with the MEVs-USP25 group, MEVsMH42-USP25 with the same USP25 protein level displayed superior therapeutic effects to improve retinal function, maintain ONL thickness, inhibit photoreceptor apoptosis, and upregulate rhodopsin and s-opsin expression (Supplementary Figure S12B-N). Moreover, a comparison between the retinal therapeutic effects of MEVsMH42-USP25 and MEVsScrbl-USP25 revealed that MEVsMH42-USP25 more effectively alleviated hyperglycemia-induced retinal dysfunction and photoreceptor loss in db/db mice compared with the MEVsScrbl-USP25 group (Supplementary Figure S13A-P). These findings suggest that both MH42 peptide conjugation and USP25 protein loading synergistically contribute to MEVsMH42-USP25-mediated effective therapy for photoreceptors in DR.

In addition to the retinal therapeutic outcomes, MEVsMH42-USP25 treatment also displayed biosafety profiles. Few abnormalities were observed in ocular inflammation, intraocular pressure, serum cytokine levels, anti-MH42 and anti-MEV antibody production, blood cell counts, and histological features of the heart, liver, lung, spleen, and kidney in MEVsMH42-USP25-treated db/db mice at weeks 24 and 48 (Supplementary Figure S14A-G and Supplementary Figure S15A-G). Collectively, these findings suggest that MEVsMH42-USP25 exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy and good safety profiles in alleviating diabetic retinal dysfunction and photoreceptor damage.

Photoreceptor loss is an essential cause of retinal dysfunction in DR [30]. In this study, we demonstrated that MEVs improved retinal function in db/db mice by delivering USP25 to inhibit CRYAA ubiquitination and degradation in photoreceptors. Importantly, we developed a novel MEV-based therapeutic system conjugated with the photoreceptor-targeting peptide MH42 and enriched with USP25 protein to achieve a targeted therapy for photoreceptors in DR.

It is recognized that MSCs transplantation maintains tissue homeostasis and repairs injured cells mainly through the paracrine pathway [31]. As a major cargo of paracrine effect, MEVs contribute to tissue regeneration by delivering proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids [32]. Recently, MEVs have emerged as a novel strategy for the treatment of ocular diseases [33]. Kaur et al. have revealed the immunomodulatory potency of MEVs in inhibiting the infiltration of retinal reactive T cells into the eyes, thus alleviating autoimmune uveitis progression [34]. In dry age-related macular degeneration, MEVs prevent oxidative damage in retinal pigment epithelium cells by regulating the Nrf2/Kepa1 pathway [35]. Notably, several studies have reported the therapeutic potential of MEVs in DR. Chen et al. have shown that MEVs suppress Müller gliosis by activating NRF2-mediated antioxidant effects in DR [36]. Furthermore, Sun et al. have revealed that MEVs inhibit diabetic retinal neovascularization [37]. However, whether and how MEVs protect photoreceptors against hyperglycemic injury remain unclear. In this study, intravitreal MEV administration restored retinal function by alleviating photoreceptor loss in db/db mice. In vitro results also verified that MEVs alleviated HG-induced apoptosis of 661 W cell apoptosis, providing a foundation for establishing novel therapies for retinal dysfunction in DR.

CRYAA is a member of the small shock protein family and serves as a molecular chaperone [38]. Recent studies have mainly focused on the benefits of CRYAA in protecting eye lens function and transparency. Zhou et al. have reported that CRYAA is epigenetically suppressed in the lens epithelium of age-related nuclear cataracts [39]. Here, we performed LC-MS/MS to investigate the differentially expressed proteins in 661 W cells following MEV treatment. MEV-mediated CRYAA protein upregulation in photoreceptors was observed both in vivo and in vitro. Under chronic stress, CRYAA serves as an essential photoreceptor regulator [40]. Ruebsam et al. have demonstrated the retinal neuroprotective potential of CRYAA in diabetes [26]. However, the role of CRYAA in hyperglycemia-induced photoreceptor loss remains unclear. Here, we transfected 661 W cells with CRYAA overexpression plasmids and observed that CRYAA activation markedly inhibited the apoptosis of 661 W cells under HG stimulation. Moreover, the genetic loss of CRYAA in diabetic mice abolished the therapeutic effects of MEVs to improve retinal function and inhibit photoreceptor apoptosis. AAV9-CRYAA-mediated CRYAA re-expression could recover the role of MEVs to alleviate photoreceptor injury, suggesting that MEVs protect photoreceptors by upregulating CRYAA expression.

MEVs transport various cargos to regulate the recipient cell functions. Shuttling of proteins is considered the major mechanism underlying MEV-mediated therapeutic effects in retinal disorders. Sun et al. have reported that hypoxia-preconditioned MEVs ameliorate retinal degeneration by delivering GAP43 [41]. BDNF-enriched MEVs accelerate Müller cell survival by regulating Wnt signaling [42]. In this study, we revealed that MEVs upregulated CRYAA protein level by delivering USP25 to inhibit CRYAA ubiquitination and degradation. Although CRYAA has been demonstrated as a substrate of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway [43], the interaction between the deubiquitinating enzyme USP25 and CRYAA remains unclear. Hence, these results provide novel insights into MEV-induced photoreceptor therapy for DR.

Over the last few years, EVs have gained increasing attention as promising nanocarriers for therapeutic cargo [44]. The membrane structure and nanoscale size of EVs can protect encapsulated contents from degradation and allow them to cross impermeable biological barriers [45]. Due to their retinal therapeutic effects, good biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity, we selected MEVs as the delivery platform in this study. Considering that MEVs inhibit hyperglycemia-induced photoreceptor loss by USP25-induced CRYAA deubiquitination, we introduced USP25 protein into MSCs by lentiviral transfection, followed by the release of MEVs-USP25. Recent evidence has revealed that MEVs exhibit low retinal cell targeting after intravitreal injection, resulting in reduced repairing efficacy [46]. The non-specific MEV distribution in retinal cells is a significant challenge in MEV-mediated DR therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that functionalizing the membrane structures of MEVs can enhance their targeting potential [47]. Strategies involving minimal procedures to modify MEVs are highly desirable for clinical applications [48]. Recently, Gao et al. have revealed that CP05 anchor peptides specifically bind to CD63 on EV membranes [49]. Xu et al. have modified EVs with TBP-CP05 fusion peptides to transfer miR-214 to osteoclasts [50]. Thus, the use of CP05 peptides to engineer MEVs may be a promising strategy for DR-targeted therapy. The MH42 peptide was recently identified as a photoreceptor-targeting ligand [51]. MH42 peptide modification may promote MEV accumulation in photoreceptors. In this study, we conjugated the MH42-CP05 fusion peptide to the surface of MEVs-USP25 based on the interaction between the CP05 peptide and the EV marker CD63. After intravitreal injection, MEVsMH42-USP25 were predominantly localized in the photoreceptors and further improved retinal function in db/db mice compared with natural MEVs, suggesting that MEVsMH42-USP25 are effective nanotherapeutics for photoreceptor injury in DR.

However, the utilization of rodent models for DR study has potential limitations in the replication of chronic neurovascular damage and immune involvement in patients with DR. Thus, primate DR models are needed to investigate the intervention dosage and timing of MEVsMH42-USP25. Although MH42 peptides have been shown to guide lipid nanoparticles to photoreceptors for mRNA delivery in mice and rhesus macaques [51], whether MH42 peptides can effectively target human photoreceptors requires further investigation. Moreover, as a tetraspanin enriched on the surface of EVs, CD63 is considered an EV marker. The CP05 peptide has recently been found to specifically bind to the second extracellular loop of CD63, a structure is highly conserved across species [52]. Increasing studies have shown that EVs from various human, mouse and rat cells can be directly modified via CP05 conjugation [53–55], indicating that the CP05-CD63 interaction remains stable across species. Therefore, coupling MH42 peptides to EVs derived from different species sources using CP05 as an anchor peptide is a feasible strategy. In addition, the scalability of lentiviral modification and MEV purification under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions is essential for clinical translation. Optimizing the design of lentiviral vectors is crucial to achieve stable gene integration into MSCs. Recent advancements in 3D culture technology have facilitated the large-scale cultivation of MSCs transfected with lentiviruses to increase the production of engineered MEVs [56]. However, traditional EV separation techniques such as ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, immune-affinity capture, and polymer precipitation often fail to simultaneously ensure both high purity and yield. Moreover, some of these methods are time-consuming and lack reproducibility, limiting their suitability for clinical application [57]. Future studies should consider novel purification strategies, such as tangential flow filtration, affinity chromatography, and microfluidic technology, for efficient and automated purification of engineered MEVs with high purity [58]. Finally, the characteristics, safety, batch consistency, and stability of engineered MEVs should be further tested to meet the GMP requirements for their clinical applicability.

In conclusion, we have established a photoreceptor-targeted transportation system as a novel therapeutic approach for DR by delivering USP25 protein. The findings of this study demonstrated that MEVs ameliorated long-term hyperglycemia-induced retinal dysfunction and photoreceptor loss by USP25-mediated CRYAA deubiquitination. MEVsMH42-USP25 decorated with MH42 peptides efficiently delivered the deubiquitinating enzyme USP25 to the photoreceptors. Consequently, increased USP25 protein level further prevented photoreceptors from diabetic stimulation in db/db mice. Our study reveals the effectiveness and biosafety of MEVsMH42-USP25 in photoreceptor therapy and provides a promising cell-free therapeutic strategy for DR.
