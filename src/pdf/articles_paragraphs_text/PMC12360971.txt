β-Aminodehydroalanine, ΔAla(β-NH), (2,3-diaminoprop-2-enoic acid), is a unique dehydroamino acid and a central component of Callyaerins A-M and Callynormine A. The presence of this unusual structural element containing an enamine functional group may be related to the antitubercular activity of Callyaerins. According to The WHO Global Tuberculosis Report tuberculosis is the second leading cause of death worldwide caused by a single infectious agent. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular structure of these peptides in more detail. To investigate the conformational properties of the ΔAla(β-NH) residue, a series of model compounds: Ac-(Z/E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe, Ac-(Z/E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NMe2, Boc-Gly-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-OMe, and Boc-Gly-(Z)-ΔAla(β-Leu-OMe)-OMe, were selected for quantum chemical calculations and/or synthesized. Two conformations, β2 (φ,ψ ~ − 120°, 20°) and α (φ,ψ ~ − 70°, − 15°) are predicted as the most preferable, regardless of the geometry of isomer (Z/E), polarity of environment, and order (2°/3°) of C-terminal amide group. The N–H⋯O hydrogen bond involving the N–H group in the β position of the side chain as a donor is a significant stabilizing factor. The Z isomer is predicted to be the most stable and has been synthesized. The following synthesis method is proposed: Ser → ΔAla → ΔAla(β-Br) → ΔAla(β-NH). The advantages of the proposed method are: (i) serine as the starting substrate, (ii) mild alkaline conditions, (iii) avoidance of the reactive intermediate α-formylglycine.

Callynormine A isolated from the Kenyan marine spongeCallyspongia abnormis(Berer et al.2004) together with Callyaerins A-M isolated from the Indonesian marine spongeCallyspongia aerizusa(Ibrahim et al.2008,2010; Daletos et al.2015) belong to a family of naturally occurring peptides, containing atypical amino acid residue, β-aminodehydroalanine, ΔAla(β-NH). Callyaerins have been tested on various cancer cell lines (Ibrahim et al.2008,2010). However, the most promising is their antituberculosis activity, especially Callyaerins A and B (Daletos et al.2015; Podlesainski et al.2024), which show the strongest antiTB activity and do not show cytotoxic activity against THP-1 and MRC-5 cell lines. According to The WHO Global Tuberculosis Report tuberculosis is the second leading cause of death worldwide caused by a single infectious agent (WHO2023). Therefore, it is essential to better understand the molecular structure of these peptides in order to obtain further information on the relationship between structure and biological activity.

The molecular structure of Callyaerins and Callynormine A consists of a cyclic backbone (6–8 amino acid residues) and a shorter side chain (2–5 amino acid residues) (Fig.1, Table1). The shorter, linear peptide chain consists only of standard amino acid residues. The larger cyclic chain may also contain the non-standard γ-hydroxyproline (HYP) and 2-amino-3-(5-methoxy-2-oxoimidazolidin-4-ylidene)propionic acid (AMOIPA) (Callyaerin M). In the middle of the structure there is a unique structural element that forms a link between the cyclic and linear parts of the molecule. It is called α-amido-β-aminoacrylamide (Berer et al.2004; Ibrahim et al.2008) or (Z)-2,3-diaminoacrylic acid (DAA) (Ibrahim et al.2010; Daletos et al.2015). In this work, this unique structural element is considered as a separate amino acid residue, (Z)-2,3-diaminoprop-2-enoic acid. According to amino acid nomenclature and symbolism (Moss1984), 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid can be considered as 3-aminoalanine. Because of the unsaturation between the α and β carbon atoms, it is abbreviated as β-aminodehydroalanine, ΔAla(β-NH2), and will be referred to as such in this publication.

It is worth noting that a similar structural element, the C=C double bond and N–H group in the side chain ureido group, occurs in another well-known family of natural antitubercular peptides, tuberactinomycins (Laughlin and Conn2022). This is an important premise that links this unusual structural element, the dehydroamino acid enamine system, with biological (antitubercular) activity.

The aim of this work is to describe the conformational properties of the β-aminodehydroalanine ΔAla(β-NH2) residue. To our knowledge, they have not been described so far. The presence of the Cα=Cβ double bond causes the loss of optical activity of the studied residue. On the other hand, the lack of rotation around the Cα=Cβ double bond causes a rigid position of the β-amino group and the appearance of the geometrical isomers Z and E. This rigidity should have a significant effect on the peptide conformation. The presence of an additional amine group at the β-carbon atom together with amide groups at the α-carbon atom may create a delocalized cross-conjugated electron system that may stabilize the structure and/or may be a specific pharmacophore responsible for the biological activity.

Dehydroamino acids having a heteroatom (Cl, O) in the β position of the side chain can be found in naturally occurring peptides such as victorin (Kessler et al.2020) or cyrmenins (Chakor et al.2012). They have specific conformational properties (Banaś et al.2023,2025), mainly due to the presence of the electron pairs that allow conjugation with the Cα=Cβ double bond and can serve as an acceptor for hydrogen bond interactions. However, the case of the β-aminodehydroalanine may be different, because the nitrogen atom can also act as a hydrogen bond donor.

In addition to the description of ΔAla(β-NH2) residue conformational properties, in this research another approach to the synthesis of β-aminodehydroalanine has been proposed. Relatively short models, analyzed and/or synthesized in this work, are presented in Fig.2.

A commonly used method for obtaining conformational properties of amino acid residues is the analysis of short model compounds (Head-Gordon et al.1991). Calculations were made for the following model compounds: Ac-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe (1) and Ac-(E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe (2), like also Ac-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NMe2(3) and Ac-(E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NMe2(4). In the first step, Ramachandran diagrams of the model compounds1–4were created, which describe the relationship between the values of torsion angles φ and ψ and the potential energy of the molecules (Figs.3,4,5and6). The trans configuration (ω ≈ 180°) of the amide group was set as the more stable. The torsion angle, which defines the position of the delta methyl group, was not constrained during geometry optimization. This position was set as the default in the initial structures. Initial structures were prepared in which the dihedral angles φ and ψ were constrained and their values were changed in steps of 30°. Since the studied dehydroamino acid residue is achiral, each structure in the map has its mirror counterpart with the same energy but opposite torsion angles (φ, ψ = − φ, − ψ). This reduces the number of grid point structures necessary to create each map to 91. In this way, potential energy surfaces E = f(φ,ψ) were obtained. DFT method was applied at the M06-2X/6–31 + G(d,p) level of theory (Zhao and Truhlar2008), first in the gas phase, and then in chloroform and water to generate a total of 3 maps for each molecule (constrained optimization). The solvent effect was simulated by a self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). The potential energy minima located on the maps were fully optimized using a larger basis set, 6–311 + G(d,p). After these unconstrained optimizations, vibrational analysis was performed to ensure that the resulting structures were true energy minima and to obtain the zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs) and Gibbs energies (298.15 K, 1.0 atm). The conformation population (p) was calculated at 300 K, where RT = 0.595 kcal/mol according to the following equations:prel= 100% exp(− ΔG/RT),p=prel/∑conformersprel × 100% (Hruby et al.1997; Hudáky & Perczel2008). The conformation names are based on the Scarsdale nomenclature (Scarsdale et al.1983). The Gaussian 16 package (Frisch, et al.2016) with GaussView5 (Dennington, et al.2008) was used. To estimate the internal stabilizing forces, both hydrogen bonds and dipole interactions were analyzed. In the tables and figures, data are presented only for X–H···A (X = N, C; A = O, N) hydrogen bonds, where r H···X ≤ 2.7 Å and ∠X–H···A > 90° (Vargas et al.2002). For the dipole interactions, data are presented only for C = O ◄···► O = C contacts, where r C···O < 3.6 Å (N, C denote the N-terminal or the C-terminal amide group) (Allen et al.1998).

To obtain a general view of the conformational properties of the β-aminodehydroalanine residue, conformational analysis was performed on simple diamide models, withN-terminal secondary and C-terminal secondary or tertiary amides with a methyl group limiting β-amino function. The following model compounds, Ac-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe (1) and Ac-(E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe (2), like also Ac-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NMe2(3) and Ac-(E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NMe2(4), were chosen for quantum chemical calculations. The potential energy surfaces E = (φ,ψ) together with the conformations are shown in Figs.3,4,5and6. Selected parameters, including the torsion angles φ and ψ, as well as the energy and population of the conformations (p) are presented in Tables2,3,4and5. The lack of chirality results in mirror conformations with the same energy but opposite sign of the torsion angles values. The conformations on the left side of the maps are discussed, for clarity.

The conformational map calculatedin vacuo, i.e. for an isolated molecule, primarily shows the restriction of rotation around torsion angles φ and ψ caused by steric hindrance between atoms. In addition, it is possible to estimate the strength of internal interactions created by the residues studied, without the influence of the environment. Figure3shows four conformations, found from the conformational mapsin vacuo,: C5, β2, C7, and β. Analysis of internal interactions (Table1S) shows that the lowest energy is possessed by the extended C5 conformation (φ, ψ = − 146°, 166°), stabilized by two N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds: one C5-membered bond characteristic for this conformation and the other involving the N–H group of the side chain as a donor. The second in energetic order is the semi-extended β2 conformation (φ, ψ = − 137°, 12°), which results from the rotation of the C-terminal amide group. This conformation is stabilized by an N–H⋯O hydrogen bond involving the side chain amino group, as well as by a weaker C-H⋯O hydrogen bond between the vinyl hydrogen of the side chain and the oxygen atom of the C-terminal amide group. The remaining conformations have much higher energy. The C7 conformation (φ, ψ = − 67°, 20°) is stabilized by a 7-membered N–H⋯O hydrogen bond between the amide groups, a C-H⋯O hydrogen bond, and electrostatic dipole–dipole interactions between the carbonyl groups. The β conformation (φ, ψ = − 61°, 157°) of the polyproline II helix is stabilized only by electrostatic dipole–dipole interactions.

The conformational map calculated in chloroform, simulating a weakly polar environment, i.e. the protein interior, shows only three conformations in the following energy order: β2 (φ, ψ = − 123°, 9°), C5 (φ, ψ = − 142°, 166°), and β (φ, ψ = − 59°, 158°). The β2 conformation becomes the lowest in energy. It also undergoes the largest geometric change, the N-terminal part becomes more perpendicular to the side chain (Fig.1S). In contrast, for the C5 and β conformations, the values of the torsion angles φ and ψ remain almost unchanged.

The conformational map calculated in water, simulating a polar environment and an obvious biological solvent, also shows three conformations in the following order: α (φ, ψ = − 89°, 2°), β (φ, ψ = − 60°, 159°), and C5 (φ, ψ = − 141°, 166°). The lowest energy conformation is α, which results from a further perpendicular rotation of the N-terminal amide group, while the side chain with the C-terminal part becomes planar. The internal interactions are the C-H⋯O hydrogen bond at the C-terminal part and electrostatic dipole–dipole interactions between the carbonyl groups of amides. The N-terminal part does not form any internal interactions, and therefore both the amide and the amino group of the side chain can form interactions with the polar environment. The energy difference between the α conformation and the remaining β and C5 conformations increases and is estimated to be 3 kcal/mol. This results in a relatively large population of the lowest energy state (estimated 99%).

For the E geometrical isomer, Ac-(E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe (2), the conformational pattern is shown in Table3and Fig.4. For the isolated molecule (in vacuo), four conformations occur: β2, C7, C5, and β. The lowest energy is found in conformations with a low torsion angle ψ: the β2 conformation (φ, ψ = − 105°, 2°), followed by the C7 conformation (φ, ψ = − 68°, 14°). This can be explained by the presence of an N–H⋯O hydrogen bond between the N–H group of the side chain and the oxygen atom of the C-terminal amide (Table2S). Moreover, in the case of the β2 conformation, the low value of the torsion angle ψ also indicates that the side chain and the C-terminal part are planar, and thus a conjugated π-cross system is formed (supported by an internal N–H⋯O hydrogen bond). For the C7 conformation, a C7-type N–H⋯O hydrogen bond can be found, as well as a carbonyl-carbonyl dipole interaction. The remaining conformations, C5 and β, have much higher energy, and the estimated population indicates that they are almost inaccessible. The C5 conformation (φ, ψ = − 178°, 165°) has N–H⋯O as well as C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, the repulsion between the side chain N–H groups and the C-terminal amide seems to play a significant role. This is also seen for the β conformation (φ, ψ = − 61°, 152°), stabilized only by electrostatic dipole–dipole interactions.

In a weakly polar environment, mimicked by chloroform, three conformations can be observed in the following energetic order: α, C5, and β. The α conformation (φ, ψ = − 91°, 0°) is the result of the combination of the β2 and C7 conformations (Fig.2S), with the same main stabilizing N–H⋯O hydrogen bond formed by the N–H group of the side chain. The geometry of the C5 (φ, ψ = − 174°, 163°) and β (φ, ψ = − 61°, 152°) conformation is almost unchanged compared to the conformations of the isolated molecule. Their relative energy increases further, so the α conformation becomes the only choice in a weakly polar environment.

In a polar environment, simulated by water as a solvent, four conformations are predicted: α (φ, ψ = − 87°, − 2°), β (φ, ψ = − 60°, 156°), β’ (φ, ψ = − 93°, 160°), and C5 (φ, ψ = − 171°, 162°). The α conformation has the lowest energy by far. The geometry and energy of the conformations are quite similar to those in a weakly polar environment. The influence of the polar environment causes the appearance of the β’ conformation, which differs in the sign of the torsion angle ψ.

The aim of the analysis ofN’,N’-dimethylamides (3) and (4) is to determine the conformational properties of the β-aminodehydroalanine residue with a C-terminal tertiary amide group, as in the case of the naturally occurring peptides, Callynormine A and Callyaerins A-M.

For the geometric isomer Z, calculations performed for the isolated molecule (in vacuo) indicate five conformations: C5, β2, C5’, β, and α (Table4, Fig.5). The lowest in energy is the extended C5 conformation (φ, ψ = − 148°, 162°), which has very similar geometry compared to the analogous one (1). It is also stabilized by two N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds: of the C5 type in the main chain and another one involving the N–H group of the side chain as a donor. The second in energy order is the semi-extended β2 conformation (φ, ψ = − 135°, 29°), stabilized by N–H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, both involving the side chain. The torsion angle ψ is more distorted compared to analogous conformation in (1). This is due to the steric hindrance imposed by the C-terminal tertiary amide. The steric crowding that hinders the rotation of the C-terminal amide is also responsible for the appearance of a new conformation C5’ (φ, ψ = − 144°, − 160°) (Fig.3S), which is also stabilized by two N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, but with worse geometric parameters (Table3S). The remaining conformations, β (φ, ψ = − 64°, 150°) and α (φ, ψ = − 49°, − 27°), are stabilized by the carbonyl-carbonyl interactions, and their relative energy is much higher. The α conformation is also stabilized by a C-H⋯O hydrogen bond between the vinyl hydrogen of the side chain and the C-terminal oxygen atom.

In the weakly polar environment, mimicked by chloroform, also the same five conformations can be seen. Nevertheless, the environment changes the energy order. The conformation β2 (φ, ψ = − 128°, 31°) becomes the lowest in energy, with the estimated population over 83%. The second is the conformation C5 (φ, ψ = − 145°, 161°), and then the conformation α (φ, ψ = − 55°, − 28°), β (φ, ψ = − 58°, 151°), and C5’ (φ, ψ = − 130°, − 155°). The changes in torsion angles φ, ψ in comparison to isolated molecules does not exceed ± 7°, except the conformation C5’.

In the polar environment of water, the number and type of conformations also do not change. The β2 conformation (φ, ψ = − 125°, 31°) maintains the lowest energy, although the α conformation (φ, ψ = − 57°, − 29°) is almost equally occupied. The β conformation (φ, ψ = − 96°, 158°) is next in energetic order, followed by the extended C5 (φ, ψ = − 144°, 161°) and C5’ (φ, ψ = − 123°, − 153°) conformations. In general, increasing the polarity of the environment reduces the energy gap between the conformations. The geometry of the torsion angles φ and ψ also changes, more in the N-terminal part (φ), which becomes more perpendicular to the side chain and opens the N-terminal amide group to intermolecular interactions.

In the case of the E geometric isomer, Ac-(E)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NMe2(4), there are four conformations for the isolated molecule (in vacuo): β2, α, C5, and β (Table5, Fig.6). The lowest energy conformation is β2 (φ, ψ = − 114°, 21°) followed by α (φ, ψ = − 60°, − 17°). The energy difference is relatively small and together these two conformations occupy almost the entire population of molecules. Moreover, both conformations are stabilized by a N–H⋯O hydrogen bond between the N–H group of the side chain and the oxygen atom of the C-terminal amide (Table4S). The remaining conformations, C5 and β, have much higher energies and the estimated population indicates that they are almost inaccessible. The C5 conformation (φ, ψ = − 171°, 159°) has N–H⋯O as well as C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The β conformation (φ, ψ = − 61°, 152°) is stabilized only by electrostatic dipole- dipole interactions.

In a weakly polar environment, mimicked by chloroform, five conformations can be observed in the following energy order: α, β2, β, C5, and β’. Conformations α (φ, ψ = − 91°, 0°) and β2 (φ, ψ = − 114°, 21°) remain the lowest energies, with the same main stabilizing N–H⋯O hydrogen bond formed using the side chain N–H group and almost the same population. Nevertheless, conformation α is predicted as a global minimum. Conformations C5 (φ, ψ = − 154°, 155°) and β (φ, ψ = − 58°, 147°) have higher energies, similar to those of the isolated molecule. Additionally, due to the influence of the environment, as in the case of the C-terminal secondary amide analogue (2), the β’ conformation appears (φ, ψ = − 99°, 157°).

Further increase in the polarity of the environment, as mimicked by water, does not seem to have a significant effect on the number and type of conformations, as well as on their energetic order. The conformations α (φ, ψ = − 62°, − 22°) and β2 (φ, ψ = − 113°, 21°) have the lowest energy, although the α conformation is more occupied. The remaining conformations have higher energies and the energetic order is as follows: β (φ, ψ = − 57°, 148°), β’ (φ, ψ = − 93°, 155°), and C5 (φ, ψ = − 139°, 155°).

The presented results obtained using quantum chemical calculations show that the studied β-aminodehydroalanine residue, regardless of the Z/E isomer or the C-terminal 2°/3° amide, tends to adopt mainly two conformations, α and β2. The β2 conformation is rather preferred in low polarity environments, while increasing polarity favors the α conformation.

The low energies of the α and β2 conformations of the studied ΔAla(β-NH) residue are due to the presence of an internal N–H⋯O hydrogen bond, which is formed in the residue between the N–H group of the side chain, which acts as a hydrogen bond donor, and the oxygen atom of the adjacent N- or C-terminal amide group, which acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor. This is particularly evident in the case of the E isomers (2) and (4). In the case of the Z isomer, the β2 conformation has an N–H⋯O hydrogen bond and therefore predominates in a low-polarity environment. In a more polar environment, intermolecular interactions are energetically more favorable, which results in the opening of the N–H group and a perpendicular position of the N-terminal part. However, an internal Cβ-H⋯O hydrogen bond is present, which stabilizes the α conformation. It should also be noted that in the α and β2 conformations, the side chain and the C-terminal amide bond tend to be in the plane, which can be observed by the torsion angle ψ close to 0° with a deviation not exceeding ± 30°. Therefore, a delocalized system of cross-conjugated π electrons is formed in this part, which additionally stabilizes the conformations.

The formation of the β-aminodehydroalanine structural element is a key step to access the natural compounds described above and is problematic in terms of synthesis. A review of the literature shows the following synthetic approaches (Fig.7a–c).

The first approach is based on acetal-protected precursors. In this case, 2-amino-3,3-diethoxypropionic acid ((R)-α-formylglycine diethylacetal) is introduced into the peptide chain (DeMong and Williams2002,2003). Then, by acid hydrolysis, it is converted into α-formylglycine (fGly), which in the next step reacts with the amino group to obtain the desired product (Zhang et al.2018). Although the reaction progresses efficiently (yield over 80%), it was observed that the fGly-containing peptide was unstable under the acidic conditions used for peptide cleavage. Protonation of the aldehyde group of fGly increases its electrophilic character, which paves the way for nucleophilic attack by the adjacent N-terminal amide group oxygen atom, forming an oxazoline ring, which further undergoes acid hydrolysis via an acyl-type substitution at the oxazoline C2 carbon atom and ultimately leads to cleavage of the peptide chain.

Another approach with acetal protection involves introducing 1,2-diol-functionalized (acetalprotected) 4-hydroxy-L-threonine (hThr) into the peptide chain Yates et al.2023). This is then converted to a vicinal diol by acidic cleavage. In the next step, sodium periodate is used, and oxidative cleavage produces α-formylglycine, which then reacts with the amine under acidic conditions.

In the third approach, alternatively, a standard serine residue is used as a precursor. Then, in a one-pot oxidation using Dess-Martin periodinane, α-formylglycine is formed. Simultaneous cyclization leads to the final product (Podlesainski et al.2024).

As can be seen, the procedures presented in the literature always involve the formation of α-formylglycine, which is probably the mechanism of formation of this type of compounds in biological systems (Krüger et al.2019). Then fGly reacts with an amine, forming first an imine and then an enamine (a functional structural element of an β-aminodehydroamino acid). Acidic conditions are required to remove the oxygen atom in the form of a water molecule. However, fGly is susceptible to these conditions. Furthermore, in the first two methods (Fig.7a and b), an appropriately protected, specifically synthesized α-formylglycine building block must be incorporated into the peptide chain. The third method starts directly from a serine residue, which is advantageous, but the yield is not high.

In this work, we propose a different approach to the synthesis of the target structural element, β-aminodehydroalanine, which proceeds via dehydration of serine, followed by bromination in the β-position and finally by substitution of bromine as a leaving group by an amine (Fig.7d). The dehydration reaction gives high yields and there are examples of its application in peptide synthesis (Slootweg et al.2015). The β-bromination reaction proceeds via the addition of two bromine atoms in the vicinal position, followed by a dehydrohalogenation reaction using a tertiary amine (Bull et al.2007; Kishi1975). In our hands, the use of bromine works (Lenartowicz et al.2017). It should be noted, however, that a variant of this method using NBS has been described in the literature (Ferreira and Monteiro2006; Ferreira et al.2007) and higher yields have been reported. In the final step, the β-bromodehydroamino acid residue undergoes a Michael addition reaction with an amine, followed by a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which regenerates the C=C double bond.

A simple diamide model, Ac-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-NHMe was synthesized starting from Ac-Ser-NHMe, because it corresponds to the models used in quantum chemical calculations. In this case, methylamine was used in the final steps. To show the wider application of this method, the dipeptide model Boc-Gly-(Z)-ΔAla(β-NHMe)-OMe was obtained. The reaction yield is rather low, mainly due to the volatility of the methylamine reagent. Better results were obtained for Boc-Gly-(Z)-ΔAla(β-LeuOMe)-OMe using a leucine derivative (H-Leu-OMe), which is an amino acid at this site in Callyaerins. Unfortunately, all products was obtained as a frost (a solid resembling frost on glass) and therefore unsuitable for X-ray analysis of single crystals. In our hands, the total yield of these 3 steps (27%) estimated for Boc-Gly-(Z)-ΔAla(β-LeuOMe)-OMe is comparable to the results known from the literature (Podlesainski et al.2024).

In summary, the starting substrate is a serine residue, a standard amino acid, which is incorporated into the peptide chain under well-developed conditions. The intermediate α-formylglycine is avoided. Moderately basic conditions are also used instead of acidic ones.

β-Aminodehydroalanine is a unique naturally occurring dehydroamino acid residue that has been found to date in Callynormine A as well as in Callyaerins A-M, revealing potential antitubercular activity. A closely related dehydroamino acid, β-ureidodehydroalanine, occurs in Capreomycin and Tuberactinomycin, which are known for their antitubercular activity. The similar structural element found in peptides with similar activity indicates that, in general, the enamine functional group in the side chain of the amino acid residue is inherently associated with the biological properties of these peptides.

The presented studies show that the N–H group in the β position influences the conformation of the β-aminodehydroalanine residue by forming internal N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the flanking amide groups. As a result, the global minimum of the potential energy is located in the region for torsion angles φ and ψ between − 137° to − 55° and 30° to − 30°, respectively. This region is occupied by two conformations designated as β2 (φ,ψ ~ − 120°, 20°) and α (φ,ψ ~ − 70°, − 15°).

Regardless of the geometric type of the Z/E isomer and the C-terminal amide (secondary/tertiary), there is a tendency that the β2 conformation is rather favored in a lower polar environment, while an increase in the polarity of the environment favors the α conformation, which is more open to intermolecular interactions. The C-terminal tertiary amide decreases the relative energy between conformations, mainly due to steric crowding. In general, the Z isomer is more stable. The X-ray structure of Callynormin A (Berer et al.2004) with the Z isomer and α conformations (φ,ψ = − 49.39°, − 32.73°) confirms these predictions.

Literature reports on the synthesis of β-aminodehydroalanine units show a pathway via an α-formylglycine residue and acidic conditions. Here we present an alternative 3-step synthetic route, starting from a serine residue that undergoes dehydration using EDC/CuCl, followed by subsequent bromination at the β-position and finally substitution with an amine, using mild basic conditions. In this way, a method is proposed to avoid the step of forming an α-formylglycine residue.

We believe that the presented results extend both the knowledge of the structural properties of this unique dehydroamino acid and the range of available synthetic methods.
