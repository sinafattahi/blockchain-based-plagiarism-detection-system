Pet bird rearing has been increasing over the last decade in Bangladesh. These pet bird species suffer from diverse diseases that are treated with different antimicrobials, contributing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the country.

The current study aimed to determine the occurrence of multidrug‐resistant (MDR) Extended‐Spectrum Beta‐Lactamase (ESBL)‐producingEscherichia colifrom cloacal samples of pet birds. This study also explored the phenotypic antimicrobial resistance profile of ESBL‐E. coliagainst a range of antibiotics, followed by molecular identification of selected ESBL genes (TEM, SHV, CTX‐M) in isolated bacteria.

A total of 150 cloacal swab samples of pet birds were purposively collected from the Chattogram metropolitan area of the country. Identification and confirmation ofE. coliwere performed following microbiological and molecular techniques. All the confirmedE. coliisolates were further screened using the combination disk method for validation of phenotypic ESBL producers. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed for selected antibiotics using the disk diffusion technique followed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.

The overall detection rate ofE. colifrom cloacal swabs was 48.7% [n= 73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 40.4–57], and out of 73 confirmed isolates, 32 (43.83%) were ESBL‐E. coli. Surprisingly, all the 32 ESBL isolates were multidrug‐resistant. All the ESBL isolates were susceptible to meropenem and resistant to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Molecular identification of the ESBL genes showed that TEM was the most prevalent group of target genes.

The data generated in this study are the first of its kind and would be beneficial to veterinary practices, aviculturists and pet bird breeders in Bangladesh. The current research suggests that pet birds are a source of MDR ESBL‐E. coli, which may pose a potential threat to public health.

An alarming 43.83% of cloacal samples revealed multidrug‐resistant ESBL‐E. coli, with TEM being the most frequently detected resistance gene.

These results underscore pet birds as hidden reservoirs of MDR pathogens, posing a potential threat to public health in Bangladesh.

Routine surveillance and responsible antimicrobial use are crucial to mitigating this emerging risk.

Birds are reared and bred in a controlled way under human supervision for exclusively ornamental purposes are termed as pet birds. These categories include mainly Psittaciformes (e.g. parrots, parakeets, budgerigars, lovebirds, etc.), Galliformes (e.g., kadaknath) and Columbiformes (e.g., pigeon) (Mitchell and Tully,2009). The pet bird business is considered a significant emerging sector in Bangladesh. This trendy pastime has already become a large commercial endeavour among the youth and also contributes to the national economy of the country. There is no data available about the number of exotic and pet bird species in the country, but the number might be more than thirty. Maximum species were imported from overseas and bred afterwards to fulfil the demand of pet lovers and aviculturists (Bayzid et al.2023).

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue that affects both animals and humans. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in bacterial antimicrobial resistance and the discovery of resistance genes in various bird species. In addition, commensal bacteria are spreading and acquiring resistant at a rate comparable to that of pathogenic bacteria (Dionisio et al.2023). Further, frequent bacterial infections in poultry and pet bird species have a negative impact on human health due to the development of multidrug‐resistant (MDR), drug allergies and other factors (Garcês et al.2024). Furthermore, the commensal bacteria in pet birds along with pathogenic bacteria, are also developing resistant and acting as a reservoir of infection, posing a threat to human health (Masud et al.2024).

Escherichia coli(E. coli) are gram‐negative, facultative anaerobic bacteria, which belong to the family ‘Enterobacteriaceae’. These bacteria are responsible for causing some more common diseases in pet birds such as colibacillosis. They are capable of surviving in the environment including propagating in water and soil. In Bangladesh, MDRE. coliwas found in pigeons and chicken (Hasan et al.2014; Sarker et al.2019; Karim et al.2020). Pet birds are considered one of the potential reservoirs of virulent and antimicrobial‐resistant zoonoticE. coli, posing an inherent threat to public health (Ahmed et al.2021). Extended‐spectrum beta‐lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes produced by some bacteria includingE. colithat confer resistance to certain antibiotics, particularly those in the beta‐lactam class, such as penicillin and cephalosporins. As a result of chromosomal mutation, resistance to various antimicrobials in different bacteria has also been recorded. ESBL‐E. colipose a significant challenge in both human and veterinary medicine due to their ability to transfer resistance genes horizontally, often via plasmids and their potential to spread these genes to the environment (Benz et al.2021). ESBL‐E. coliisolates have become resistant to many antimicrobials reported by different parts of the world (Gholami‐Ahangaran et al.2021; A. Rahman et al.2024). Various resistant genes such as TEM, SHV and CTX‐M were important genotypes responsible for showing MDR characteristics for ESBL‐E. coli.

In Bangladesh, pet birds are frequently exposed to antimicrobials due to their widespread use in treatment. Ahmed et al. (2021) reported that a broad range of antimicrobials, including colistin sulphate, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, streptomycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, are commonly administered (Ahmed et al.2021). While veterinarians prescribe both narrow‐ and broad‐spectrum antimicrobials for disease management in pet birds, breeders and aviculturists often use various antimicrobial combinations without adhering to proper guidelines. This indiscriminate use contributes to antimicrobial resistance, posing significant risks to both animal and public health. The extensive and unregulated use of antimicrobials, coupled with a weak healthcare system, may facilitate the emergence of resistant genes in both commensal and pathogenic bacteria, warranting further investigation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Bangladesh to determine the prevalence of ESBL‐producingE. coliin pet birds and to characterize its antimicrobial resistance patterns and associated resistance genes. Therefore, this study aims to assess the antimicrobial resistance profiles of ESBL‐producingE. coliisolated from cloacal swabs of pet birds, followed by genotypic characterization of the resistant strains.

This study was carried out over a period of 12 months (June 2019 to May 2020) in Chattogram metropolitan areas (CMA) of Bangladesh. A cross‐sectional study was outlined to collect the cloacal swab samples of different species of psittacine pet birds. The selection of the samples was performed through a purposive sampling strategy after consulting with local avian veterinary practitioners. Apparently healthy pet birds, with no known antimicrobial usage in the past two months were considered individual sampling units. Regular feeding and no complaints from the owners regarding the birds' health were also considered indicators of good health. Among the bird species, the majority of the samples were collected from budgerigars followed by other psittacine species (Horned Parakeet, Rose‐ringed Parakeet, Parrot, Lovebird, Eastern Rosella, Finch, White Cockatoo and Galah).

A total of 150 individual cloacal swab samples were collected from the cloaca of pet bird species. Sterile swab sticks were used to collect samples for bacterial isolation and subsequent phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling. After collection, the swabs were placed in Falcon tubes containing 4 mL of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth and preserved at 4°C for transportation to the laboratory.

For initial detection ofE. colifrom a sample, it was first incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, one loopful of enriched broth was inoculated onto MacConkey agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The agar plates were checked for the presence of characteristic ‘bright pink’ colonies. The suspected bacterial colonies were further streaked onto the EMB agar and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The characteristic ‘metallic sheen’ indicated the potential presence ofE. coli. The suspected single isolated bacterial colonies were further grown on the blood agar and the cultures were then preserved appropriately with 15% glycerol at −80°C until further use (Clontz2008). Molecular confirmation ofE. coliwas performed for the 16S rRNA with the primer sets (Forward: GACCTCGGTTTAGTTCACAGA and Reverse: CACACGCTGACGCTGACCA) following published literature (Parvin et al.2020).

ESBL‐producingE. coliwere confirmed through a phenotypic method named as combination disc diffusion (CDT) test. In summary, Cefotaxime (30 µg) ± clavulanic acid (10 µg) discs were placed in the Mueller‐Hinton Agar (MHA). The enhancement of the zone of inhibition ≥ 5 mm increase in inhibition zone suggested the presence of ESBL (EUCAST2017).

To identify the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility of the phenotypically confirmed ESBL‐E. coliisolates, the disc diffusion method was performed on MHA plates as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI2021). TheE. coliisolates were tested against some commonly available antimicrobials used in the country. The following antimicrobial classes and their corresponding antibiotics were used for the phenotypic resistance of the isolates. Using antimicrobial disks including β‐lactam [meropenem (10 µg), ampicillin (10 µg)], third‐generation cephalosporin [ceftriaxone (30 µg)], aminoglycosides [gentamicin (10 µg)], Tetracyclines [tetracycline (30 µg)], Fluoroquinolones [ciprofloxacin (5 µg)] and Folate pathway inhibitors [sulfamethoxazole‐trimethoprim (25 µg)]. The standard strainEscherichia coliATCC 25922 was used as a control for validation of the results.

Genomic DNA of ESBL‐E. coliisolates were extracted according to the simple boiling method with slight modifications. Briefly, 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube containing 200 µL deionized water was mixed with 3 to 4 isolated colonies using a vortex, subjected to boiling at 99.9°C for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 2 min (Nath et al.2023). Then, 50 µL of supernatant containing DNA was collected and stored at −20°C until further analyses.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done for all the phenotypically resistant ESBL‐E. coliisolates and their different resistant genes TEM, SHV and CTX‐M (Table1). The final volume of the PCR mixture was 25 µL consisting of 12.5 µL of master mix, 0.5 µL of each primer, 1 µL of template DNA and 10.5 µL of nuclease free water. 5 µL of the amplified product were taken and it was visualized with 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/mL) (Hasib et al.2024).

The data were collected, checked, coded and transferred to Microsoft Office Excel 2016. The data were analysed using the statistical tool STATA/IC‐13.0 (StataCorp, 4905, Lake Way Drive, College Station, TX, USA), and graphs were prepared using the GraphPad Prism 8. Descriptive statistics were calculated forE. coliisolates with respective antimicrobial patterns. The resistance genes of specific antimicrobials were expressed as frequencies and percentages with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

The overall detection rate ofE. colifrom cloacal swabs was 48.7% [n= 73, 95% (CI) = 40.4–57], and out of 73 confirmed isolates, 32 (43.83%) were identified as ESBL‐ producingE. coli. Among the 32 ESBL‐ positive bacterial isolates, 28 were isolated from the budgerigar and 2 from the lovebird, and the remaining 2 from the white Cockatoo (Figure1).

Prevalence ofE. coliand ESBL‐E. coliisolated from cloacal swab samples of pet birds.

Among the 32 ESBL‐E. coliisolates, all were found resistant to different antibiotics used for this study (Figure2). Ampicillin and ceftriaxone exhibit 100% resistant to ESBL‐positiveE. colifollowed by 90.6% by sulphamethoxazole‐trimethoprim and 87.5% by tetracycline (Figure3). Gentamycin and ciprofloxacin resistance were observed in 53.1% and 37.5% of isolates, respectively. Only meropenem was found sensitive to the ESBL‐positiveE. colifrom pet birds. (Figure3).

Among the ESBL‐E. colipositive isolates TEM, were found 100% positive and 34.375% were positive for CTX‐M (Figure4) Additionally, co‐occurrence of TEM and CTX‐M genotypes was observed in 34.375% (11/32) of the isolates (Figure4).

Occurrence of target genes on the ESBL‐E. coliisolates.

ESBL‐producingE. coliin pet animals is a significant public health concern, as these resistant strains can spread to humans through direct contact or environmental contamination. The emergence of ESBL‐E. coliin pet birds underscores the need for responsible antimicrobial use and enhanced surveillance to mitigate the risks of antimicrobial resistance.

The current study found a prevalence ofE. coliin pet birds at 48.7%, which was consistent with previous reports: 50% in captive birds in Trinidad (Gopee et al.2000), 48% in parrots in Brazil (Corrêa et al.2013), 46.7% in Psittaciformes in Brazil (Lopes et al.2018) and 52.5% in pigeons in Bangladesh (Karim et al.2020). However, our findings were lower than those of Dey et al. (2013), who reported a 77.5% prevalence ofE. coliin pigeons in Bangladesh. Conversely, Hasan et al. (2014) reported a lower prevalence of 24% in pigeons from Chattogram (Hasan et al.2014). Although several studies have identifiedE. coliin pet birds, information on ESBL‐producingE. coliin pet birds remains limited. One study from Iran identified ESBL‐producingE. coliin both healthy (5.6%) and diseased birds (6%) (Miranzadeh Mahabadi and Gholami‐Ahangaran2024). These variations in prevalence may be attributed to differences in targeted bird species, detection methods, hygiene management, feeding practices and biosecurity measures during pet bird rearing.

Furthermore, all isolates in this study exhibited MDR, surpassing the 67% MDR prevalence reported Diren Sigirci et al.2020. The prevalence of MDRE. coliin our study was also higher than previously reported rates in cockatiels (59%) from Brazil, pet birds (67%) from Turkey and captive pigeons (72.7%) from Brazil (Pontes et al.2018; Crecencio et al.2020; Diren Sigirci et al.2020). However, some studies have reported 100% MDR in poultry isolates (S. Rahman et al.2011; Sarker et al.2019). The widespread and unregulated use of broad‐spectrum antimicrobials likely plays a critical role in the emergence of MDR bacteria. In our study, the higher prevalence of MDRE. coliin pet birds compared to previous reports may be linked to variations in antimicrobial usage patterns, inadequate veterinary oversight and differences in hygiene and biosecurity measures. Additionally, prolonged exposure to antimicrobials in pet birds may exert selective pressure, facilitating the acquisition and persistence of multiple resistance genes through cross‐transmission, genetic mutations, or environmental contamination (Magiorakos et al.2012; Ahaduzzaman et al.2014). These findings highlight the urgent need for stricter antimicrobial stewardship and enhanced surveillance to mitigate the spread of MDR pathogens in pet birds, which could pose significant risks to both animal and public health.

Our study also observed a higher rate of ampicillin resistance compared to that reported by Borges et al. (2017), who found 72.7% resistance rate in captive pigeons. Similarly, high ampicillin resistance rates have been reported in captive cockatiels (82%) (Pontes et al.2018), psittacine birds (87.5%) (Varriale et al.2020) and pigeons (70%) (Dey et al.2013). Notably, Yılmaz and Dolar (2017) reported 100% ampicillin resistance in cage birds from Turkey (Yılmaz and Dolar2017). Interestingly, our study found no isolates resistant to meropenem, aligning with previous research (Diren Sigirci et al.2020).

Additionally, this study did not detect SHV genes among ESBL‐producingE. coliisolates, similar to findings by Diren Sigirci et al.2020. However, our results identified TEM as the most prevalent genotype in pet birds, in contrast to another study where CTX‐M was the dominant genotype (Miranzadeh Mahabadi and Gholami‐Ahangaran2024). This suggests a potentially higher selective pressure for narrow‐spectrum antimicrobials in the specific rearing environments or management practices of our study. Furthermore, the observed 100% prevalence of TEM genotypes in our isolates was higher than the 52% reported in cage birds from Turkey (Yılmaz and Dolar2017).

Our findings emphasize the potential role of pet birds as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance, posing a significant concern for both public and animal health. The high prevalence of antimicrobial‐resistant and MDRE. colihighlights the urgent need to address this issue within the One Health framework. Further research investigating a broader range of antimicrobials, as well as the virulence factors and resistance genes ofE. coliin pet birds, could provide valuable insights into their transmission dynamics and potential public health implications. Understanding the role of pet birds in the spread of antimicrobial resistance is crucial for assessing associated risks to humans. This study serves as a valuable baseline for future research and underscores the importance of promoting responsible antimicrobial use in pet bird management to safeguard both human and animal health.
