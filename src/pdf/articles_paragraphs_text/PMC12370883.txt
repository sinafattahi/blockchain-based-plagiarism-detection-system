The evaluation of the efficiency of conveyor systems revolves around prioritizing switching sequences to ensure safe commutation, as depicted in Fig.8. This figure delineates the efficiency percentages achieved through different prioritization strategies, namely Minimum Voltage Prioritization and Minimum Turn-on Time Prioritization, across various types of converters such as Cycloconverter, AC voltage controller, Matrix converter, and Resonant converter. In the realm of efficiency assessment, the minimum-voltage prioritization strategy exhibited promising results. Integrating variable-frequency transformers in applications such as air compressors has led to more energy-efficient and sustainable power conversion solutions18.

Evaluation of efficiency through switching sequence prioritization for safe commutation in conveyor systems.

Cycloconverter shows an efficiency of 92%, indicating a robust performance in maintaining operational effectiveness while prioritizing minimum voltage requirements. The AC voltage controller follows closely with a commendable efficiency of 95%, signifying its ability to manage voltage prioritization to ensure optimal system performance. Meanwhile, the matrix converter achieves a respectable efficiency rating of 85%, demonstrating its capability to uphold efficiency standards, even under minimum voltage prioritization conditions. Similarly, the Resonant converter demonstrated reliability with an efficiency rating of 86%, affirming its viability in maintaining efficiency under voltage prioritization considerations. However, prioritizing the minimum turn-on time presents a different efficient landscape. Although still conducive to safe commutation, this strategy yields varied efficiency outcomes across the spectrum of converters. The performance of the converters was evaluated in terms of power factor, harmonic distortion, and efficiency. These performance metrics indirectly align with the expectations outlined by IEEE and IEC standards, which provide benchmarks for commutation safety and power electronics efficiency. As shown in Tables3and4, the values for power factor and harmonic distortion meet typical industry thresholds, which are consistent with the criteria set by these standards. Table4compares the performance of the proposed system with existing literature across key parameters. Despite their advantages in voltage prioritization, cycloconverters exhibit a slightly lower efficiency rating of 94% under this prioritization scheme. The AC voltage controller experiences a notable decrease in efficiency, registering 88%, which suggests some challenges in optimizing turn-on times while ensuring safe commutation. Matrix converter demonstrates resilience in this scenario, maintaining a commendable efficiency of 92%, indicating its adaptability to prioritize turn-on times without compromising overall efficiency. Similarly, the Resonant converter maintains a consistent efficiency rating of 92%, showing its reliability in managing turn-on time prioritization while upholding the efficiency standards. For instance, the Cycloconverter achieves higher power factors at no load, outperforming existing systems, as noted in1,4,7. Similarly, at 60% load, the AC Voltage Controller leads with superior power factors compared to previous reports in2,4,6. Harmonic distortion in the Cycloconverter is lower than that observed in comparable systems, as shown in4,8. Additionally, short-circuit currents measured in the Cycloconverter are lower than those in other systems, as referenced in5,6,9. The converters were compared based on their power factor and harmonic distortion performance. However, practical trade-offs like cost, reliability, and implementation complexity are not considered in this study, as the focus remains on technical aspects. We recognize that these factors are important but believe they are beyond the scope of this work, which is centered on performance analysis under standard conditions. In summary, the evaluation of efficiency through switching-sequence prioritization underscores the nuanced interplay between different prioritization strategies and their impact on system performance in conveyor systems. While minimum voltage prioritization generally yields higher efficiency ratings across converters, the prioritization of the minimum turn-on time presents its own set of challenges and opportunities.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing efficiency while ensuring safe commutation in conveyor systems, ultimately enhancing the overall operational effectiveness and reliability. A notable example is observed in a high-speed conveyor belt system used in automated warehousing, where an optimized switching sequence significantly reduced transient voltage spikes. This improvement resulted in lower thermal stress on power components, extending operational lifespan while ensuring smoother conveyor movement and energy savings.

Studies on switching sequence prioritization in AC-AC converters for safe commutation in conveyor systems have provided insightful numerical findings and valuable insights into converter performance and reliability. While the current study is based on numerical simulations, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed switching strategies. We understand that real-world validation through experimental testing or hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations would provide additional insights. However, the resources required for such validation exceed the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the simulation results presented in this paper are sufficient for understanding the theoretical performance and potential of the proposed strategies. The analysis of power factor improvement across load conditions revealed significant variations, with the cycloconverter exhibiting the highest improvement at lower loads, followed closely by the AC voltage controller. However, as the load increased, the AC voltage controller demonstrated a remarkable improvement, surpassing all the other converters at a 60% load. This underscores the importance of considering load variations in commutation safety analyses and the need for adaptable control strategies. Moreover, the assessment of harmonic distortion levels under voltage fluctuation conditions highlighted the differences in converter performance. Although the cycloconverter exhibited relatively low distortion values, the AC voltage controller displayed slightly higher levels. These findings underscore the importance of implementing robust control mechanisms to mitigate harmonic distortions and ensure system reliability, particularly in dynamic industrial environments. In addition, the evaluation of the short-circuit currents, protection devices, and efficiency metrics revealed notable differences across the converters. Effective protection mechanisms are essential for mitigating short-circuit risks with variations observed in short-circuit current management. Furthermore, efficiency metrics emphasize the importance of optimizing the converter performance while prioritizing safe commutation. While the claim that cycloconverters achieve the highest power factor is supported by simulation results, we recognize that empirical validation is necessary to provide stronger support for this conclusion. Future studies will incorporate experimental testing to validate these simulation results and substantiate the claims made in the current work. The numerical results indicated varying efficiency ratings across different prioritization schemes, with implications for the overall system reliability and uptime. By ensuring proper synchronization in switching sequences, power losses are minimized, and energy utilization is improved, leading to better system efficiency. Additionally, optimized switching sequences contribute to stable voltage regulation, reducing downtime and preventing failures caused by electrical instabilities. In terms of future scope, further research is warranted to refine the control algorithms and validation methodologies, ensuring the robustness and reliability of switching sequence prioritization techniques. While variations in system parameters such as load and temperature could affect performance, they were not explored in this study. Future works could include sensitivity or Monte Carlo simulations to examine the impact of these variables in more depth. Experimental studies and field trials can provide valuable insights into real-world performance and effectiveness in industrial settings. Additionally, advancements in converter technologies, such as novel topologies and integration techniques, hold promises for improving commutation safety and efficiency.
