This retrospective study investigated the waiting time for surgery in patients with severe subaxial cervical fractures at Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo, as well as identifying the main causes of surgical delays.

The research was quantitative and retrospective, utilizing medical records of patients operated on between January 2015 and June 2023. Variables analyzed included age, gender, trauma mechanism, fracture classification, neurological status, waiting time until surgery, and causes of delay. Data were initially collected using physical forms and then migrated to electronic platforms (SurveyMonkey®and Red Cap®) for detailed statistical analysis.

The study included 36 patients, with a significant predominance of men (86.1%) and an average age of 44.97 years. Falls were the most common trauma mechanism (44.4%), followed by automobile accidents (27.8%). Most fractures occurred at the C4/C5 (16.7%) and C5/C6 (13.9%) levels. The most frequent AO type classification was type C (47.2%). The average waiting time for surgery was 9.28 days, with the main cause of delay being the availability of the operating room (66.7%).

The results indicate that cervical fractures have a significant impact on young adults, predominantly men, often associated with falls and automobile accidents. Early identification and timely surgical intervention are crucial to minimize complications and improve neurological outcomes. Strategies to reduce surgical waiting times, such as improvements in hospital resource management, are essential to optimize the treatment of these injuries.Level of Evidence III; Retrospective Cohort Study.

Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) compromises the bone, ligament, joint, muscular, vascular or neural structures of the spine as a result of a direct or indirect physical event.4Accurate information on the prevalence and incidence of SCI at national level is scarce.

Subaxial cervical trauma is evaluated independently from other regions of the spine. Vaccaro et al.6developed the classification system SLICS (Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System), which considers three main aspects: fracture morphology, integrity of the posterior ligament complex and the patient's neurological status.9The overall score is obtained by summing the individual scores of each aspect. The higher the score, the more severe the injury, according to the SLICS system.

The posterior ligamentous complex encompasses structures at the back of the vertebral column, including the zygapophyseal joints, ligamentum flavum, and interspinous ligaments. Injuries to this complex indicate spinal instability and may result in subluxations or dislocations of the facet joints.10Injuries with less than 4 points are considered mechanically stable and generally do not require surgical intervention, while injuries with more than 4 points are considered unstable and require surgery.

Factors associated with surgical delay include the availability of hospital resources, the clinical stability of the patient, the need for additional diagnostic investigations and the complexity of the case. Rapid identification and treatment of lesions in the subaxial cervical spine is crucial for maximizing chances of recovery and reducing complications.

This study aims to describe the waiting time for surgery in patients with cervical fractures type A3, A4, B and C at the largest philanthropic hospital in Latin America located in the city of São Paulo and identify the main causes of delays in surgeries.

This retrospective study is a quantitative research focused on the analysis of epidemiological data extracted from medical records and the comparison with current literature.

Inclusion criteria: A3 and A4, B or C fractures according to AO Spine classification; Patients operated between January 2015 and June 2023 in the department of orthopaedia and traumatology or neurosurgery of the largest philanthropic hospital in Latin America located in the city of São Paulo; Ages between 18 and 80; Availability of detailed clinical history in the medical record.

Exclusion criteria: Fractures type A0, A1, A2; fractures type B and C not surgically treated; incomplete data.

The study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Arnaldo Vieira de Carvalho Foundation (CAAE: 76159023.4.0000.5479).

The patients of the institution are sorted in the Red Room (trauma room) by the General Surgery team, following the Spinal Cord Injury – SCI algorithm (Figure 1). This screening process aims to determine, in collaboration with the specialties of neurosurgery and orthopedics, which one will be responsible for the clinical and/or surgical follow-up of the patient.

The data collection was carried out in three stages. The first step involved extracting information from medical records using a physical form (Appendix 1), including details such as age, gender, mechanism of trauma, comorbidities, hospitalization time, level of injury, fracture classification, neurological status, American Spinal Injury Association score, number of instrumented levels, and details of surgical intervention.

In the second step, the data was converted to electronic format using the SurveyMonkey®and Red Cap®platforms. SurveyMonkey®facilitated the inclusion of data in the multicenter study promoted by AO Spine, while Red Cap®was used to organize and process the data, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in the analysis.

In the third step, the statistical analysis was carried out with the Statistica®software. Various statistical tests were applied, including t-Student, Pearson correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U, qui-square, Spearman correlation, Shapiro-Wilk normality test, variance analysis (ANOVA) and Levene, to evaluate the collected data and identify significant patterns.

Table 1presents the results of the variables observed in the study. The gender distribution revealed a significant majority of men, totaling 31 participants, which represents approximately 86.1% of the sample. In contrast, the female presence in the sample was substantially lower, with only 5 female participants, corresponding to about 13.9% of the total. The standard gender deviation was estimated at approximately 0.349.

The general average of ages is approximately 44.97 years and the standard deviation is approximately 18.7 years.

We observed that most were treated by orthopaedics, representing approximately 61.1% of the cases (22 patients). On the other hand, neurosurgery provided assistance to about 38.9% of the cases (14 patients).

Of the 36 participants included in the study, the majority (22) did not report any registered morbidity, representing 61.1% of the total, the distribution of these comorbidities is represented inFigure 2.

Various types of trauma as represented inFigure 3have been described. Falls were the most common cause, affecting 16 participants.

Several cervical fractures have been recorded. The most common level of fracture was C4/C5 affecting 6 patients.Figure 4shows this distribution.

The fractures were classified according to the AO Spine Classification. The most common classification was type C, identified in 17 participants, which corresponds to approximately 47.2% of the total. The distribution of the classification is shown inFigure 5.

The injuries were classified according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Medular Injury Scale. The most frequent category was A, identified in 10 participants, representing 27.78% of the total. Category C followed with 9 participants (25.00%), while category D was observed in 7 participants (19.44%). Categories B and E were less common, with 5 participants each (13.89%).

At admission, patients are sorted by the Glasgow Scale. The most frequent score was 15, recorded in 28 participants (77.78%). Score 14 appeared in 5 participants (13.89%). Scores 3 and 12 were less common, with 2 participants (5.56%) and 1 participant (2.78%), respectively.

Analysis of the interval between admission and surgical procedure revealed an average of approximately 9.28 days, with a standard deviation of 9.58 days. About 61.11% of patients were operated in less than 9.28 days after admission. Approximately 30.56% underwent the procedure between 9.28 and 18.86 days, while 8.33% were operated after 18.86 days.

As for the level of instrumentation, most of the 36 participants received instrumentation at levels C3-C6 and C3-C4 (5 patients each, 13.89% each). C5-C7 and C4-C5 levels were frequent, with 4 patients each (11.11% each). Other significant levels were C4-C7, C6-C7, C3-T1, C4-C6 and C3-C7 (3 patients each, 8.33%). Levels such as C4-T1, C6-T2, C5-C6-T1-T2, C6-T1, C5-T1 and C7-T1 were less common, with 1 patient each (2.78%).

Figure 6represents the complications found in the hospitalizations of study participants. The majority of participants 22 (61.1%) did not experience any complications during their hospitalization.

The analysis of hospitalization data revealed an average of approximately 45.33 days, with a standard deviation of 54.38 days. Dividing patients into three hospitalization time ranges, it was observed that none of the participants had a stay below the average minus a standard deviation.

Among the patients, 30 (83.33%) were hospitalized for a period between the average minus one standard deviation and the average plus one standard deviation. Finally, 6 patients (16.67%) remained hospitalized for longer than the average plus a standard deviation.

Figure 7provides information on the reason for the surgical delay, the main one being the availability of a surgical room, present in 24 cases, which is equivalent to 66.7%.

Table 2presents the results of the statistical analyses and their relevance to this study.

The analysis of the age profile of patients revealed that cervical fractures are more common in adults under 50 years of age, with 61.1% of the 36 patients analyzed belonging to this age group. These data corroborate the findings of Gaia et al.15who observed 68.7% of the 264 patients in São Paulo aged between 20 and 50, with car accidents being the main cause of injuries. In addition, the study of Tavares et al.16identified a predominance of male patients in the age group of 20 to 40 years and a lower average age among women. This indicates consistency in the demographic characteristics and risk factors associated with cervical fractures.

Regional variations in trauma mechanisms, such as falls and strokes, indicate that local factors influence the prevalence of cervical fractures. These findings highlight the need for preventive strategies adapted to regional specificities to reduce the incidence of cervical fractures.

Regarding the type and severity of cervical fractures, the use of AO Classification for categorization revealed consistency in the distribution of types A, B and C, despite variations in proportions. These variations can be attributed to the demographic characteristics of the samples and the different trauma patterns observed. Both our study and Gaia et al.15showed a significant proportion of patients with neurological deficits, varying depending on the type of fracture.

The study by Tavares et al.16revealed that approximately 54.1% of patients had neurological deficits during hospitalization, with AO type B fracture, commonly associated with cervical vertebra C5, being the most prevalent.

The study by Khanna et al.14provides a detailed view of the physiological parameters and the preoperative neurological state. The preoperative evaluation using the ASIA scale revealed variations in the patients’ neurological status, reflecting the severity of the spinal cord injuries. Most of the lesions occurred at C5-C6, followed by C4-C5, C6-C7 and C3-C4.

Regarding treatment, the literature emphasizes the importance of surgical intervention for patients with fractal instability and neurological deficits. Khanna et al.14discuss the controversy over the timing of surgical intervention in subaxial traumatic lesions of the cervical spine, a question also addressed in our study. While Khanna et al.14focus on preoperative physiological parameters and at the time of surgery as predictive factors of outcomes, our study highlights that patients with incomplete lesions and stable physiological parameters tend to have better outcomes, regardless of the time of surgery.

The main problems associated with surgical delay include worsening of the injury due to vertebral instability or prolonged spinal cord compression, irreversible neurological damage, and an increased risk of medical complications such as respiratory infections, deep vein thrombosis, and urinary tract infections resulting from prolonged immobilization. In addition, the delay in surgery leads to high costs with hospitalization and rehabilitation. In our study, the costs associated with hospitalization in intensive therapy units (ITI) were analyzed, showing a significant variation between the values of SUS17and SUS Paulista.18Considering an average of R$ 700.00 per day for SUS and R$ 1,500.00 for SUS Paulista, the estimated total cost was R$ 1,162,700,00 and R$ 2,491,500,00, respectively.

These data underline the importance of early interventions to reduce hospital costs and improve the efficiency of the healthcare system.

The results highlight the urgency of addressing the challenges faced by healthcare systems, especially in complex urban contexts such as São Paulo, where efficient management of surgical waiting time can significantly influence clinical outcomes and hospital costs. Implementing strategies to reduce surgical delay will not only promote faster and more effective recovery for patients, but will also optimize the use of hospital resources, reinforcing the continuous need for improvements in the planning and delivery of specialist medical care.
