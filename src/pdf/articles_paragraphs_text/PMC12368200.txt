In this study, the effects of Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), the primary bioactive constituent ofPanax ginsengroots, on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) were examined using a zebrafish model, with a focus on elucidating its underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that Rg1 treatment inhibited osteoporosis induced by methylprednisolone (PN), as evidenced by increased mineralisation area and integrated optical density in the spine and skull of zebrafish larvae. Rg1 reduced the expression ofbglap(an osteogenic marker gene) and increased the expression oftraf(an osteoclast marker gene) compared with the PN group. Behavioural analysis revealed that Rg1 alleviated PN-induced hypoactivity, resulting in enhanced motion speed. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis identified 383 genes reversed by Rg1 treatment, with significant enrichment in skeletal system development. KEGG analysis indicated that Rg1 influenced several signalling pathways primarily involved in retinol, fat, protein and lipid metabolism. Several genes related to skeletal system development and retinol metabolism were validated by qRT-PCR. In summary, this study provides scientific evidence for the potential mechanisms of Rg1 in the therapeutic intervention of GIOP, highlighting its promise as a potential pharmacological agent for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a crucial class of pharmacological agents that play an essential role in treating various diseases such as osteoarthritis, pneumonia, and autoimmune disorders, owing to their potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties1. However, long-term use of GCs is associated with several adverse effects, with GC-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) being one of the most significant2. Current studies highlighted that the primary characteristics of GIOP include a metabolic imbalance marked by excessive bone resorption and suppressed bone formation3–6, which manifest as reduced bone mass, increased fragility, and a heightened risk of fractures in affected patients7,8. Additionally, previous research has demonstrated that GCs can induce oxidative stress by inhibiting antioxidant activity or promoting excessive production of reactive oxygen species, which impairs osteoblastic differentiation and hinders bone formation9,10. A recent study revealed that GC exposure induces osteocyte ferroptosis through limiting deubiquitinase PSMD14 binding, which exacerbates GIOP11. As a result, preventing and treating GIOP is crucial when administering GCs.

Current clinical treatments for GIOP mainly rely on medications such as bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy12,13. However, growing evidence has raised concerns about their safety, including risks such as tidal fever, gastrointestinal reactions, and an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular events14. One study showed that bisphosphonate accumulation in bone tissue causes apoptosis in resident osteoclasts, disrupting normal bone turnover15,16. Furthermore, exposure to zoledronic acid and ibandronate in rats has been shown to cause significant kidney tubular toxicity17. Additionally, parathyroid hormone use is a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and hypocalcaemia18. Given these drawbacks, there is an urgent need to identify safer and more effective alternatives for GIOP treatment.

Ginsenoside Rg1, a triterpenoid saponin compound extracted from the root of Panax ginseng, possesses various biological activities, including immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects19. Multiple studies have highlighted the beneficial role of Rg1 in promoting osteogenic differentiation. For example, one study demonstrated that Rg1 enhances differentiation by inhibiting senescence in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells20. In vivo, Rg1 has been shown to accelerate the transformation of fibrous callus into osteogenic callus, promoting fracture healing in rats with tibial fractures16. Moreover, several studies have suggested that Rg1 may play a role in alleviating diabetic osteoporosis by facilitating the formation of type H blood vessels and strengthening the interplay between angiogenesis and osteogenesis21. These findings suggest that Rg1 has strong potential as a safe and effective candidate for the prevention and treatment of GIOP. However, the mechanisms underlying Rg1’s role in GIOP remain largely unknown.

Zebrafish, due to their small size, transparent larval stage, rapid development, and high reproductive capacity, have emerged as an excellent model for studying orthopaedic disorders. Zebrafish larvae constitute a complete system containing all the cells required for bone resorption and formation22, and their bone structure, metabolism, and genetic characteristics closely resemble those of humans23. With the ongoing development and refinement of research methods, zebrafish bone has become widely used in studies on bone development and protection. As a result, drug screening and toxicity assessments using the zebrafish model have gained acceptance and widespread use.

In this study, we developed an osteoporosis model using 25 μM methylprednisolone (PN) in zebrafish larvae24–28and examined the therapeutic effects of Rg1 on the osteogenic phenotype. Furthermore, we employed transcriptome sequencing to investigate the osteoprotective mechanisms of Rg1 in the PN-induced zebrafish GIOP model. Our findings demonstrate that Rg1 exhibits anti-osteoporotic effects in zebrafish larvae by modulating several genes associated with skeletal system development and various metabolic pathways. This research aims to enhance the theoretical understanding of the anti-GIOP mechanisms of Rg1 at the transcriptomic level and to support the development of Rg1 as a prospective therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (CAS No. 22427–39–0, 99% purity) was purchased from TargetMol (TargetMol, USA). PN (CAS No. 83–43–2), etidronate disodium (ED) (CAS No. 7414–83–7), and calcein (CAS No. 154071–48–4) were obtained from Aladdin Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Alizarin red (CAS No. 130–22–3), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate) were sourced from Beyotime Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), while glycerol and methylcellulose were acquired from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was purchased from Tianli (Tianjin, China).

AB wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) were obtained from the Key Laboratory of Zebrafish Modeling and Drug Screening for Human Diseases in Xiangyang City. The zebrafish were maintained in a flow-through aquarium system under a 14/10-h light/dark cycle with a pH of 7.0 ± 1.0 and temperature of 28℃ ± 0.5℃, and they were fed live brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii) twice daily as previously described2,24. Male and female zebrafish (aged 3–4 months) were housed separately in glass tanks for 10 days to allow for acclimation. To obtain embryos for the experiments, the zebrafish were placed in a specialised breeding tank at a female:male ratio of 1:2 and kept isolated overnight29. The following day, the dividers were removed to induce spawning. Fertilised eggs collected within 30 min were placed in 10-mm petri dishes containing 50 mL of ultrapure water and incubated at 28℃30. Zebrafish larvae in each group were cultured until 8 days post-fertilisation (dpf), with the solutions refreshed daily. All experimental protocols and procedures involving zebrafish were approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of Xiangyang No.1 People’s Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine (No. XYYYE20210005) and this study were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All methods in the study are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org).

PN was dissolved at 25 mM in pure DMSO to create a stock solution, which was then diluted in ultrapure water to obtain a 25-μM PN solution. Simultaneously, specific amount of Rg1 and ED were dissolved in 25-μM PN solution to prepare 25, 50, and 100-μM Rg131and 15-μg/mL ED solution24. The final concentration of DMSO in experimental solutions did not exceed 0.1%. Zebrafish larvae during 4 dpf and 8 dpf were randomly selected and placed into 6-well plates (n = 20 larvae/well/group) with 8 mL of control (0.1% DMSO), model (25-μM PN), positive control (25-μM PN + 15-μg/mL ED) or treatment solution (25- μM PN + 25, 50, or 100-μM Rg1). The medium was refreshed daily by replacing half of the volume. At the end of the experiments, zebrafish larvae were euthanized by the 168-mg/L MS-222, followed by chilling on ice. Upon euthanasia, zebrafish carcasses were disposed of as biological waste.

Calcein, a calcium-specific fluorescent dye, has been widely used to evaluate osteogenic levels. Zebrafish larvae at 8 dpf from different groups were stained with calcein as described in a previous study24with slight modifications. First, the larvae at 8 dpf from each group were washed twice with ultrapure water and then immersed in a 0.2% calcein solution for 3 min. They were then rinsed three times with ultrapure water and anaesthetised with 0.01% MS-222. The zebrafish larvae were subsequently immobilised with 3% methylcellulose in a lateral position and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Guangzhou, China). The integrated optical density (IOD) and staining area (n = 10) of 1–3 vertebral segments per zebrafish were quantified using ImageJ software 1.8.0 (https://imagej.nih.gov).

The ARS protocol was performed as described in a previous study24. In brief, zebrafish larvae at 8 dpf from different groups were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at room temperature. The following day, the larvae were bleached with a 1% KOH solution containing 1.5% H2O2for 5 h. After bleaching, the zebrafish were immersed in 0.002% alizarin red for 6 h and then cleared using 1% KOH and glycerol at ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 for 10 min each to remove excess stain. Finally, the larvae were immobilised in the prone position and photographed under a bright-field stereo microscope (Olympus, Japan). The staining IOD and the area of the zebrafish skull were quantified using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA) (https://www.mediacy.com/).

Sixteen zebrafish larvae at 8 dpf from each treatment group were placed in separate wells of a 48-well plate, with one larva per well (only larvae with normal morphology were selected) for locomotion quantification, based on previous studies24. The final volume of ultrapure water per well was adjusted to 2 mL. The 48-well plate was then placed in the Zebrafish Tracking System observation room (ViewPoint, France), allowing the larvae at least 5 min to acclimate. The low detection threshold was set at 20 pixels to accurately track the locomotion trajectories of zebrafish, while the light intensity during the bright phase was maintained at 100%. The swimming activity of the larvae was recorded over a consecutive 30-min period (alternating 5-min light and dark intervals) and analysed using ViewPoint Application Manager software 5.15.0.40 (ViewPoint, France).

For RNA extraction, 30 larvae at 8 dpf from each group (n = 4) were randomly collected and placed in centrifuge tubes. The samples were then transported on dry ice to Huada Gene Technology Service Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China) for RNA-seq analysis.

RNA integrity and quality were rigorously assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. All sequencing samples exhibited exceptional quality, with the ratio of RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) to RNA Quality Numbers (RQN) consistently > 9.3 (mean ± SD: 9.69 ± 0.26). This high threshold ensures minimal RNA degradation.

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analysed using the Dr. Tom Multi-omics Data Mining System (https://biosys.bgi.com) and identified based on the criteria of an absolute log2 fold change of > 0 and aPvalue of < 0.05. The biological significance of the DEGs was assessed using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)32–34databases to determine the associated biological processes. APvalue of < 0.05 was used to determine the significance of GO and KEGG pathway enrichment.

To explore the interactions among proteins encoded by the DEGs, a protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) was constructed using the STRING database (https://string-db.org/) and visualised in Cytoscape software 3.10.0 (https://cytoscape.org/).

To determine the transcriptional expression of representative genes, RNA was extracted from 30 zebrafish larvae that were randomly selected at 8 dpf and placed in each group. Total RNA from the larvae was extracted using TRIzol reagent (CWBIO, Jiangsu, China), and RNA purity was assessed via absorbance measurements, with an A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.2 considered acceptable. cDNA was then synthesised using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (+ gDNA wiper) (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China).

qRT-PCR analysis was conducted using Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech), and all primers were designed and supplied by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China, Table1).β-actinwere analysed in each sample for standardised expression. At least three biological replicates and two technical duplicate wells were used for all experiments. The relative quantification of mRNA expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCtmethod.

Data were statistically analysed using SPSS Statistics 26.0 (IBM, USA) (https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics) and visualised using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, USA) (https://www.graphpad.com/). Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc least significant difference multiple comparison test was used to determine statistical significance. APvalue of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A significant decrease in the calcein staining area and fluorescence IOD in vertebral segments 1–3 was observed in the 25-μM PN group compared with the control group (P< 0.05) (Fig.1A–C). By contrast, the staining area and IOD were significantly increased in the 25-, 50-, and 100-μM Rg1 groups and the ED group compared with the PN group. However, we observed a decreasing trend in the calcein staining area and fluorescence IOD in the 100-μM Rg1 group (Fig.1A–C). These results showed that low to moderate concentrations of Rg1 could reverse PN-induced osteoporosis.

Different letters above the bars indicate statistically significant differences (P< 0.05).

Alizarin red is commonly used to evaluate calcium deposition and bone mineral density. Treatment with 25 μM PN resulted in a significant reduction in the mineralisation area and IOD of the zebrafish skull compared with the control group (P< 0.05) (Fig.2A–C). However, this reduction was counteracted by treatment with 25 and 50 μM Rg1 (P< 0.05), with the 50-μM Rg1 treatment showing a more pronounced effect than the 25-μM Rg1 group (Fig.2A–C). These results indicate that 50 μM Rg1 is more effective in treating PN-induced osteoporosis in zebrafish larvae. However, a significant decrease in the calcein staining area and IOD was observed in the 100-μM Rg1 group compared with the 50-μM Rg1 group. Therefore, we selected 50 μM Rg1 for further investigation.

The effect of ARS IOD in different parts of the zebrafish larvae skull for each group is shown in Fig.3A–F. The results demonstrated that the IOD of the mc, cl, and hm regions was significantly lower in the PN group than in the control group (P < 0.05) (Fig.3A–D). Additionally, there was a decreasing trend in the IOD of the ps region in the PN group compared with the control, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05) (Fig.3E). After Rg1 treatment, a significant increase in the IOD of the mc, cl, and hm regions was observed in the Rg1 group compared with the control and ED groups (Fig.3B–D). The ch region was not significantly affected by PN, ED, or Rg1 treatment compared with the control group (P> 0.05) (Fig.3F).

Different letters above the bars indicate statistically significant differences (P< 0.05).

To investigate the effects of Rg1 on bone development, the expression of four genes associated with osteogenesis and osteoclasts was analysed in each group. Rg1 significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of the osteogenic genebglapcompared with the PN group (P< 0.05) (Fig.3G). And the mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related geneop1and osteoclastic generanklshowed no significant difference compared with the PN group (Fig.3H-I) (P> 0.05). Furthermore, a significant decrease in the level of the osteoclast genetrafwas observed in the Rg1 group compared with the PN group (P< 0.05) (Fig.3J). These results suggest that Rg1 alters the expression of key genes associated with bone development in zebrafish larvae.

Zebrafish larvae in the 50-μM Rg1 group exhibited higher activity than those in the PN group (Fig.4A, B). No significant difference in the swimming speed of larvae was observed between the 50-μM Rg1 and PN groups during the first dark and last light periods (Fig.4C). However, in the first light and second dark periods, a significant increase in swimming speeds was observed in the 50-μM Rg1 group (2.01 ± 0.22 mm/s, 1.60 ± 0.16 mm/s) compared with the PN group (1.14 ± 0.11 mm/s, 0.82 ± 0.05 mm/s) (Fig.4C). Additionally, during the second light period and the third dark period, there was an increasing trend in the swimming speeds of larvae in the 50-μM Rg1 group compared with the PN group, but the difference was not significant (P> 0.05) (Fig.4C).

Different letters above the bars indicate statistically significant differences (P< 0.05).

The examination of DEGs through RNA-seq revealed substantial changes in gene expression among the control, 25-μM PN, and 50-μM Rg1 groups. DEG-seq algorithms identified 4278 DEGs (1792 upregulated and 2486 downregulated genes) between the PN and control groups and 579 DEGs (339 upregulated and 240 downregulated genes) between the Rg1 and PN groups, among a total of 26,026 genes identified (see Supplementary Fig.S1online).

Among the 1792 upregulated DEGs identified between the PN and control groups, GO enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment in ion transport and circadian regulation of gene expression. KEGG pathway analysis of the 1792 upregulated DEGs further demonstrated prominent enrichment in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, as well as central nervous system-associated disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis revealed that the 2486 downregulated DEGs identified between the PN and control groups are primarily enriched in skeletal system development and certain metabolic process, while KEGG analysis showed primary involvement in protein digestion-absorption, fatty acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and blie secretion (see Supplementary Fig.S2online).

In addition, 383 DEGs that showed reversal of expression among the Rg1, PN, and control groups were identified (Fig.5A), including 242 upregulated and 141 downregulated genes. Expression heatmaps were used to compare gene expression levels among the Rg1, PN, and control groups (Fig.5B). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of these 383 DEGs were conducted to further characterise the gene expression regulation induced by Rg1 treatment in zebrafish larvae and to identify the biological significance of the DEGs. GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the 383 reversed DEGs were mainly involved in skeletal system development, muscle contraction, and lipoprotein metabolic processes (Fig.5C). KEGG analysis revealed that the reversed DEGs were primarily associated with retinol metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, carbon metabolism, and protein digestion (Fig.5D). The PPIN indicated the interrelations between these DEGs, with genes such as scp2a and apo4b.1 having higher interaction scores (Fig.5E). The PPIN also showed that among the pathways enriched by the 383 reversed genes, those related to protein and fat digestion-absorption and steroid hormone biosynthesis were most relevant to skeletal system development (Fig.5F).

The heatmap of mRNA expression in major pathways related to skeletal development in the RNA-seq showed that these genes were reversed following treatment with Rg1 (Fig.6A). Ten genes characteristic of skeletal system development and retinol metabolism were examined via qRT-PCR to verify the results obtained from the transcriptomic analysis and assess the predictive power of this study. Although there were minor differences in expression levels, the expression patterns detected by qRT-PCR were largely consistent with those identified by high-throughput sequencing (Fig.6B). A significant positive correlation was observed between the expression fold change of these 10 DEGs from RNA-seq and the qRT-PCR results, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.78 determined using linear regression analysis (Fig.6C). The trend observed in the qRT-PCR results was consistent with the transcriptomic analysis (Fig.6D).

GIOP has been identified as the most common type of secondary osteoporosis35, characterised by decreased osteoblast activity and the destruction of bone tissue microstructure, leading to increased bone fragility and fracture risk36. Although several anti-GIOP drugs are widely used in clinical practice, their side effects have been increasingly reported37,38. Therefore, explorations of safer and more effective drugs for GIOP treatment are urgently required. Rg1, the main active component of Panax ginseng, has been shown to have therapeutic potential for GIOP2, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully explored. The results of this study suggest that Rg1 prevents and alleviates GIOP by reversing the expression of genes associated with skeletal system development and regulating pathways involved in fat and protein digestion-absorption retinol metabolism and lipid transport.

The maintenance of bone mass and integrity requires a precise balance between resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts39,40. Typically, low osteogenic capacity, combined with increased osteoclastic bone resorption, leads to a decrease in bone mass and reduced bone strength41,42. A concentration of 25 μM PN is optimal for establishing a bone formation inhibition model in zebrafish larvae because it significantly inhibits bone formation without having a notable effect on larval activity24–26. Therefore, we utilised 25 μM PN to create a stable zebrafish GIOP model. Our phenotypic analysis showed that zebrafish larvae exposed to 25 μM PN exhibited a reduction in calcified bone content, consistent with previous studies24,28,43. Moreover, ED is well-known for regulating bone metabolism by promoting osteoclast apoptosis and osteoblast growth, and is currently used as a long-term, minimally invasive approach to enhancing bone density44. In this study, 15 μg/mL ED was used as the positive control drug24, and we propose that Rg1, like ED, can alleviate PN-induced osteoporosis.

Osteoblast-mediated synthesis of the organic bone matrix and osteoclast-facilitated bone resorption are essential interdependent processes for skeletal system development, modeling, remodeling, and the maintenance of structural integrity, with alterations in underlying gene expression increasing osteoporosis risk. Our findings, derived from GO enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data, demonstrate that PN inhibits genes critical for skeletal system development, thereby impairing bone homeostasis. KEGG analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following PN treatment revealed predominant associations with protein digestion and absorption pathways, suggesting PN exposure elevates protein turnover demand, aligning with the high turnover theory of osteoporosis and corroborating previous studies45–47. Furthermore, our observations indicated significant impacts on pathways involved in fatty acid degradation, lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis, and bile secretion in zebrafish with osteoporosis, highlighting their association with comorbid conditions like obesity and metabolic syndromee48,49. Notably, PN treatment also significantly upregulated gene expression associated with central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including PD and AD, compared to controls. This CNS dysregulation is mechanistically relevant, as prior research links dopaminergic alterations in PD to disrupted skeletal homeostasis50,51, and neurodegeneration in AD, particularly hypothalamic involvement, may interfere with central bone mass regulation and contribute to early-stage bone loss52. These molecular pathway disruptions (metabolic and CNS) align with our behavioral observations in zebrafish larvae, where decreased locomotion speed indicated compromised skeletal health. Collectively, the results indicate that PN exposure induces significant disruptions in critical metabolic and central nervous system pathways, compromising bone structural integrity and elevating osteoporosis risk.

Panax ginseng, as a natural antioxidant, is a key component in many clinical therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, respiratory system diseases, tumours, and osteoporosis53–55. Rg1 is one of the most important active components of Panax ginseng2. In this study, our phenotypic results showed that the presence of Rg1 at low to moderate doses contributed to an increase in the mineralisation area and IOD of the spine and skull, as observed through ARS and calcein staining. However, the highest concentration of Rg1 exerted a toxic effect. Consistent with our findings, Jiang et al.31reported that a high concentration (100 μM) of Rg1 induces developmental toxicity in zebrafish larvae and suppresses the expression of osteogenic-related genes, such asrunx2aandbglap, in comparison to 50 μM Rg1. These results suggest that Rg1 may exhibit a dual nature: while low to medium concentrations promote osteogenesis, the suppression of bone formation at higher concentrations may be attributed to reduced osteoblast activity and decreased expression of osteogenic marker genes. Therefore, we selected the middle concentration of Rg1 for further investigation. We found that Rg1 upregulated the expression ofbglap, which is responsible for the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts during the early stages56,57. Moreover, Rg1 treatment significantly reversed PN-induced upregulation of osteoclast-related genes such astraf.Trafis involved in the differentiation, maturation, and bone resorption activity of osteoclasts58. Previous studies have shown that osteogenesis is closely linked to skeletal system development, and damage to osteogenic genes can eventually lead to osteoporosis59,60. Based on these findings, we suggest that Rg1 plays a crucial role in counteracting GIOP.

In this study, we found that skeletal system development-related genes (col2a1a, col2a1b, and col9a3) were reversed by Rg1 in the GO enrichment analysis, positively affecting the growth of skeletal cells and the maintenance of bone homeostasis61–63. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of these genes was reversed by Rg1. KEGG analysis revealed that Rg1 primarily regulated pathways related to fat and protein digestion-absorption and steroid hormone biosynthesis to promote skeletal system development. Fat metabolism plays a critical role in bone growth and maintenance. Dai et al.60suggested that the fat accelerates the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes at the expense of osteogenic differentiation, ultimately leading to bone loss and a decline in the biomechanical properties of bone. Additionally, Chandra and Rajawat61reported the importance of protein metabolism in bone health, demonstrating that the protein metabolism regulation network is present in both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. A dysfunctional protein metabolism regulation network fails to maintain bone remodelling by regulating the normal activities and functions of these two types of bone cells, leading to osteoporosis64.

Steroid hormone biosynthesis, particularly that of estrogen, is of equal important to bone development. Cheng et al. have underscored the critical function of estrogen in sustaining bone mass homeostasis, illustrating that estrogen deficiency contributes to postmenopausal osteoporosis by disrupting the communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Their research provides mechanistic insights into estrogen’s dual role in inhibiting bone resorption and enhancing bone formation5. In this study, we found that the retinol metabolism process and lipid transport was closely associated with fat and protein digestion-absorption and steroid hormone biosynthesis. A previous study indicated that retinol metabolism plays a crucial role in bone growth and maintenance, and all-trans retinoic acid increases osteoclast numbers by enhancing the number of macrophages in periosteal tissue65. And Meng clarified the function of lipid metabolism in bone health by showing increased LDL levels results in the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species in bone marrow stromal cells, and mediates high-fat diet-induced obesity-related metabolic cellular senescence and bone loss66. Therefore, we speculate that the processes of retinol, fat, protein and lipid metabolism are vital in Rg1’s prevention and alleviation of GIOP.

This study has two main limitations. First, the lack of in vitro validation using osteoblast and osteoclast cultures constitutes a significant gap in our mechanistic understanding. Although the in vivo data and transcriptomic analysis indicate that Rg1 modulates key pathways associated with the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, in vitro models would enable precise manipulation of experimental conditions. This would help differentiate between direct effects on bone cells and indirect effects mediated by other tissues or systemic factors. Moreover, integrating in vitro and in vivo approaches could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), potentially leading to the development o f more effective therapeutic strategies. Second, the study lacks protein-level validation (e.g., Western blot) for key genes (scp2a, apo4b.1) identified in the KEGG analysis. Future research should prioritize mechanistic validation in primary osteoblast and osteoclast cultures to establish direct links between these metabolic pathways and the osteoprotective effects of Rg1. Despite these limitations, this study offers valuable insights into the prevention and treatment of GIOP.

This study shows that Rg1 effectively alleviates GIOP in zebrafish larvae by modulating genes crucial for skeletal development, resulting in improved bone health, enhanced spine and skull mineralization, better locomotor performance, increased expression of the osteogenic markerbglap, and decreased expression of the osteoclast markertraf. KEGG pathway analysis indicates that Rg1 primarily affects metabolic pathways related to nutrient processing and lipid dynamics, including fat and protein digestion and absorption, retinol metabolism, and lipid transport. qRT-PCR validation of key genes supports the molecular mechanisms of Rg1’s protective effects against PN-induced GIOP. These findings highlight Rg1 as a promising therapeutic candidate, warranting further research in complex mammalian models and potential clinical applications.
