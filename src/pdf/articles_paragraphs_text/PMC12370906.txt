Proximity-inducing modalities that co-opt cellular pathways offer new opportunities to regulate oncogenic drivers. Inspired by the success of proximity-based chimeras in both intracellular and extracellular target space, here we describe the development ofLYsosomeMembraneTArgetingChimeras(LYMTACs) as a small molecule-based platform that functions intracellularly to modulate the membrane proteome. Conceptually, LYMTACs are heterobifunctional small molecules that co-opt short-lived lysosomal membrane proteins (LMPs) as effectors to deliver targets for lysosomal degradation. We demonstrate that a promiscuous kinase inhibitor-based LYMTAC selectively targets membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation via RNF152, a short-lived LMP. We extend this concept by showing that oncogenic KRASG12Dsignaling can be potently inhibited by LYMTACs. Mechanistically, LYMTACs display multi-pharmacology and exert their activity through both target relocalization into the lysosome and degradation. We further generalize LYMTACs across various LMPs and thus offer a platform to access challenging membrane proteins through targeted protein relocalization and degradation.

LYMTACs are heterobifunctional small molecules that take advantage of lysosomal membrane proteins to degrade membrane targets via relocalization and lysosomal degradation, offering a modular approach to drug otherwise intractable membrane proteins.

Plasma membrane-bound proteins play a central role in cellular signaling, and their deregulation has been implicated in a wide variety of diseases1,2. While the majority of FDA-approved drugs engage the membrane proteome, a considerable proportion of membrane-bound targets remain undruggable by current targeted approaches, which are largely comprised of antibodies and small molecule inhibitors (SMI)3–5. Despite the potential clinical benefit in modulating membrane proteins, small molecule and antibody-based therapies often suffer from limitations such as stoichiometric target inactivation, challenges in target engagement due to lack of druggable sites, dose-dependent toxicities, and resistance mechanisms6,7. Hence, alternative therapeutic strategies are needed to expand the addressable pool of membrane targets more effectively. Of particular interest, targeted protein degradation (TPD) by proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) has demonstrated several advantages over inhibitor-based therapies8–14. For instance, PROTACs can utilize a broader set of target binding ligands, including silent binders or functional binders. Second, degradation of a target removes the entire protein, including its scaffolding functions, essentially mimicking a genetic knockout. Even though PROTACs have been successful at degrading a wide array of cellular proteins, their utility for degrading membrane proteins has not been fully explored15,16. This is, in part, because membrane proteins are primarily degraded through lysosomal pathways such as receptor-mediated endocytosis and autophagy and may not always be optimally accessible for PROTACs17,18. In recent years, lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs), antibody-based PROTACs (AbTACs), and proteolysis targeting antibodies (PROTABs) have emerged as promising proximity-inducing modalities to target secreted and membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation; however, to date, such approaches have mainly relied on the use of antibodies19–24. Therefore, we anticipate small molecule-based strategies that function intracellularly for the degradation of membrane proteins through lysosomal machineries could expand the scope of TPD modalities.

Lysosomal membrane proteins (LMPs) regulate essential cellular processes such as membrane repair, autophagy, phagocytosis, and viral infection25,26. A recent study has demonstrated that a subset of LMPs, such as RNF152 and LAPTM4a, are short-lived and are internalized into the lysosome for degradation in a ubiquitin- and endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent manner, referred to as lysosomal microautophagy27–29. We hypothesized that the rapid turnover and lysosomal proximity of LMPs could be co-opted to regulate the fate of proteins of interest (POIs) using proximity-inducing small molecules. We turned this concept into practice and have developedLysosomeMembraneTargetingChimeras (LYMTACs), heterobifunctional molecules composed of a POI ligand, a linker, and an LMP ligand (Fig.1A). Mechanistically, a LYMTAC induces the proximity between a POI and a short-lived LMP, thereby inducing relocalization of the target protein to the lysosomal membrane, promoting its internalization and subsequent degradation. By applying this concept to various membrane kinases and oncogenic KRASG12D, we demonstrate the utility of LYMTACs in targeting membrane proteins for lysosomal clearance.

ASchematic of the LYMTAC concept. A LYMTAC is a heterobifunctional molecule composed of a POI ligand, a linker and an LMP ligand. LYMTACs co-opt short-lived lysosomal membrane proteins as effectors to deliver target proteins for lysosomal degradation.BCycloheximide (CHX) assay in FLAG-MTH1-RNF152 stably expressing HCT116 cells.

Quantified data are representative of two independent experiments.

In this work, we demonstrate that LYMTACs are capable of exerting pharmacological activity through substrate relocalization and sequestration at the lysosome even in the absence of extensive degradation. This dual mode of action translated into a deeper suppression of KRASG12Dsignaling and inhibition of cancer cell viability compared to reversible KRAS inhibitors. The scope of this platform is further highlighted by establishing that multiple LMPs, such as RNF152, LAMPT4a, and LAPTM5, can serve as effectors for the LYMTAC technology. We anticipate that the chemical modularity and tunability of small molecule LYMTACs will offer new opportunities to optimize such agents for the efficient degradation of diverse membrane-associated proteins.

To establish the LYMTAC technology, we used RNF152 as our primary LMP effector for proof-of-concept studies. Due to the lack of selective and well-characterized ligands for RNF152, we generated a model system using MTH1-tagged RNF152 (MTH1-RNF152) to allow for induced proximity to the POI using a selective MTH1 binding ligand30. Since MTH1 ligands have been successfully incorporated into heterobifunctional molecules and tested in chemical-induced dimerization studies, we used the MTH1 tag and its ligands to establish the LYMTAC concept31. Importantly, MTH1 tagging did not alter the turnover rate of RNF152 as shown by almost complete degradation of MTH1-RNF152 after only four hours of protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide in HEK293 and HCT116 cells (Fig.1Band Supplementary Fig.1). Furthermore, this rapid turnover of MTH1-RNF152 was both ubiquitin- and lysosome-dependent as evidenced by inhibition by the ubiquitin E1 inhibitor (TAK-243) and lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor (Bafilomycin A1) (Fig.1B).

After establishing the MTH1-RNF152 LMP model cellular system, we probed the impact of LYMTAC on target protein degradation. As such, we devised an untargeted approach using a promiscuous kinase inhibitor as the POI ligand32. We generated a multi-kinase targeting LYMTAC (LYMTAC-1) by linking the promiscuous kinase inhibitor, TL-13-87, to an MTH1-targeting ligand (Fig.1C). This non-selective kinase inhibitor binds to a vast array of membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear protein kinases, thus allowing us to identify the target space that is most readily addressed by LYMTACs. HEK293 cells stably expressing MTH1-RNF152 were treated with LYMTAC-1 and subjected to global proteomics to identify degradable protein targets in an unbiased manner. A total of six protein kinases were significantly downregulated by LYMTAC-1, validating the ability of LYMTACs to drive target protein degradation (Fig.1D). Strikingly, five out of six kinases that were downregulated by LYMTAC-1 were exclusively integral membrane proteins (EPHA2, INSR, EPHB4, ACVR1, TGFBR2)33,34.

To directly compare the degradable protein pool of pan-kinase LYMTAC to a PROTAC functionalized with the same pan-kinase inhibitor, HEK293 cells were treated with previously reported pan-kinase PROTAC (TL-12-186) and subjected to global proteomics. Consistent with previous reports, the pan-kinase PROTAC mostly induced degradation of cytosolic and nuclear kinases (Fig.1E)32,35,36. Even though approximately 300 kinases were detected in both experiments, the PROTAC targeted a small fraction of membrane proteins (6 out of 67 downregulated kinases) for degradation. This is in stark contrast to LYMTAC-1, which mainly induced downregulation of membrane protein kinases (5 out of 6 downregulated kinases were membrane kinases) (Supplementary Fig.2). This includes ACVR1, INSR, and TGFBR2, which are uniquely degraded by LYMTAC-1 and not by TL-12-186. Thus, LYMTACs provide access to a distinct pool of cellular targets. We speculate that the observed substrate selectivity may be due to the distinct pathways co-opted by the two effectors, RNF152 and CRBN, which engage the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways, respectively. By engaging the endo-lysosomal degradation pathway, LYMTACs may be more suitable for degrading membrane proteins, given that membrane proteins are predominantly degraded via the endo-lysosomal pathway.

To corroborate the proteomics results, HEK293 cells stably expressing MTH1-RNF152 were treated with increasing concentrations of LYMTAC-1 and subjected to immunoblotting. Consistent with the proteomics data, LYMTAC-1 induced PTK2 and EPHA2 degradation in a dose-dependent manner, with robust degradation observed at 10 nM (Fig.1F,G). LYMTAC-1 activity was dependent on RNF152, since the addition of excess MTH1 ligand abrogated PTK2 degradation (Supplementary Fig.3). Next, we investigated the route of degradation. Cells were pre-treated with either lysosome (Bafilomycin A1) or proteasome (MG-132) inhibitors, and LYMTAC-1-induced degradation of PTK2 and EPHA2 was assessed. LYMTAC-1-induced PTK2 and EPHA2 degradation was rescued by Bafilomycin A1 but not MG-132, consistent with lysosomal-mediated clearance of these membrane proteins, further confirming the anticipated degradation mechanism of LYMTACs (Fig.1H,I).

Having established the ability of LYMTACs to target membrane proteins for degradation, we sought to further investigate the therapeutic potential of these agents in degrading a historically challenging-to-drug protein, KRASG12D. KRASG12Dis a membrane-anchored protein that has been associated with the tumorigenic capacity of many cancer types37. We first utilized a chemical genetic system by co-expressing MTH1-RNF152 effector and HiBiT-FKBP12F36V-KRASG12DPOI (Fig.2A)38,39. We chose to first establish this system using dimerization tags in cells not dependent on KRAS signaling for survival. Endogenously tagged HCT116 cells were generated by knocking in HiBiT-FKBP12F36Vat the KRAS locus, where gene editing was used to introduce G12D by correcting the G13D mutation that was present naturally in HCT116 cells. For proof of concept, we chose to leverage FKBP12F36V-tagged proteins of interest (POIs) as a suitable target protein given the availability of potent and selective ligands for FKBP12F36V. Additionally, the use of FKBP12F36V-tagging allowed us to quantitatively assess KRASG12Dlevels and ligand engagement without the complications associated with the use of pharmacologically active inhibitors in cells sensitive to KRASG12Ddepletion. Next, we designed LYMTAC-2, comprising an FKBP12F36Vligand, a connecting linker, and an MTH1 ligand to dimerize the target and effector proteins (Fig.2B). In line with our pan-kinase data, RNF152-recruiting LYMTAC-2 induced potent but partial KRASG12Ddegradation in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h (Fig.2C). However, LYMTAC-2-induced KRAS degradation was not observed in the absence of MTH1-RNF152, demonstrating that LYMTAC-induced KRAS degradation is dependent on MTH1-RNF152. To further understand the effect of untagged RNF152 (which mimics the endogenous RNF152) on LYMTAC’s function, we overexpressed varying amounts of untagged RNF152 in HCT116 cells and assessed its impact on LYMTAC-induced KRAS degradation in cells stably expressing MTH1-RNF152. Overexpression of RNF152 did not alter the efficiency of LYMTAC-induced KRAS degradation, even at the highest overexpression level (Supplementary Fig.4).

Quantified data are representative of two independent experiments.EKRASG12Dubiquitylation assay. HA-ubiquitin was transfected into HCT116, pre-treated with 200 nM BafA1 for 30 min, then co-treated with DMSO or 1 µM LYMTAC-2 for 4 h. Next, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HiBiT antibody. Whole cell lysate was used as the input. The respective blots are probed with HA, MTH1, HiBiT, and vinculin antibodies. Data are representative of three independent experiments.

To obtain additional insights on LYMTAC-2-induced KRASG12Ddegradation, HCT116 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors such as Bafilomycin A1, MG-132, or TAK-243, and then co-treated with LYMTAC-2 and subjected to immunoblotting. LYMTAC-2-mediated KRASG12Ddegradation was rescued by both ubiquitin E1 (TAK-243) and lysosomal (Bafilomycin A1) inhibitors (Fig.2D). However, LYMTAC-induced KRASG12Ddegradation was not rescued by proteasome inhibition. These data indicate that LYMTAC-2-mediated KRASG12Ddegradation follows the native ubiquitin- and lysosome-dependent turnover of RNF152. RNF152 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase LMP whose rapid internalization and lysosomal degradation are dependent on its own auto-ubiquitylation27. Thus, we speculated that LYMTAC-2 may drive degradation of KRASG12Dthrough RNF152-dependent ubiquitylation of KRASG12D. To this end, we performed a cellular ubiquitylation assay by transiently expressing HA-ubiquitin in HCT116 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Notably, cells treated with LYMTAC-2 revealed rapid KRASG12Dubiquitylation (Fig.2E). Collectively, our data suggest that LYMTACs can lead to the formation of a productive ternary complex with KRASG12Dand RNF152, promote KRASG12Dubiquitylation, and induce lysosome-dependent clearance of KRASG12D.

Emerging resistance to KRAS inhibitors (KRASi) is a critical challenge in maximizing the clinical potential of these drugs40–43. Degradation strategies that remove rather than inhibit oncogenic proteins offer the potential of addressing a number of such resistance mechanisms, which has encouraged our development of proximity-inducing approaches to degrade membrane-associated oncogenic KRAS. Having established and characterized the biochemical activity of KRASG12DLYMTACs, we next investigated the downstream consequences of lysosomal-mediated degradation of KRASG12D. To target endogenous KRASG12Ddirectly, we generated KRASG12DLYMTACs by replacing the FKBP12F36Vligand with a pan-KRAS inhibitor (pan-KRASi) (Fig.3A,B). Extensive research in the TPD field has defined several common structural features that influence the efficacy of PROTAC design such as exit vector orientation, linker length, linker composition, and E3 ligase ligand44–46. X-ray crystallographic characterization of the binding mode of the pan-KRAS inhibitor has suggested attachment of the effector ligand via the fused bicyclo-pyrollidine ring could yield active PROTACs and LYMTACs.

The respective blots are probed with KRAS, p-ERK, ERK, and tubulin antibodies. Quantified data are representative of two independent experiments.

First, we screened KRAS LYMTACs with two different linker compositions for cellular HiBiT- FKBP12F36V-KRASG12Ddegradation using HCT116 cells and compared their efficacy to that achieved through PROTAC-mediated degradation (Fig.3B,C). While our KRAS PROTAC and two LYMTACs displayed varying levels of KRASG12Ddegradation, rigid linker-based LYMTAC-4 (which also tethered the MTH1 ligand to the pan-KRAS inhibitor via a shorter linker) displayed improved Dmax(61%) and DC50(2 nM) values compared to PEG linker-based LYMTAC-3 [Dmax= 48%, DC50= 25 nM), Fig.3D). Leveraging the more potent LYMTAC-4 in subsequent experiments, we functionally characterized the effect of LYMTAC-induced KRASG12Ddegradation in AsPC-1 cells, a relevant KRASG12Dmutant pancreatic cancer cell line that relies on this oncogene for cell proliferation and survival47. MTH1-RNF152 was stably introduced into AsPC-1 cells to evaluate ternary complex formation (TCF) by various LYMTACs. The data suggest that LYMTAC-4 induced a more productive ternary complex between KRASG12Dand RNF152, compared to LYMTAC-3 (Fig.3E). Experience with this system further supported the selection of LYMTAC-4 as an appropriate tool molecule for subsequent investigation. To evaluate the cellular effect of LYMTAC-4, AsPC-1 cells were treated with pan-KRASi, PROTAC, or LYMTAC-4 for 24 h and probed for pathway activity. LYMTAC-4 induced KRAS degradation and robust pERK downregulation at 24 h, comparable to pan-KRASi and PROTAC (Fig.3F). Additionally, to test the ability of KRAS LYMTACs to degrade other KRAS variants, we tested LYMTAC-4 in HCT116 harboring the KRASG13Dmutation. Consistent with the ability of the KRAS inhibitor to bind G13D, we observed LYMTAC-4 induced KRASG13Ddegradation in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig.5).

We next sought to further elucidate LYMTAC mode of action and its dependence on ternary complex formation (TCF). This was investigated by treating AsPC-1 cells with LYMTAC-4 for 6 h in the absence or presence of excessive competing MTH1-ligand or Bafilomycin A1. Excess MTH1 ligand abrogated LYMTAC-induced KRASG12Ddegradation and p-ERK signaling, demonstrating that TCF is required to induce KRASG12Ddegradation and inhibit downstream signaling (Fig.3G). As expected, Bafilomycin A1 treatment rescued LYMTAC-4-induced KRASG12Ddegradation. Unexpectedly, in Bafilomycin A1-treated cells, LYMTAC-4 still suppressed KRASG12Ddownstream signaling even in the absence of KRASG12Ddegradation. To rule out that p-ERK downregulation was due to the pan-KRASi moiety of LYMTAC-4, we stably co-expressed FKBP12F36V-KRASG12Dand MTH1-RNF152 in HEK293 cells and engaged FKBP12-KRAS with a non-inhibitory FKBP12 ligand containing LYMTAC-2 (FKBP12 ligand-PEG2-MTH1 ligand). Strikingly, FKBP12-targeting LYMTAC-2 also suppressed p-ERK signaling irrespective of KRAS ubiquitylation and degradation (Fig.3H). Collectively, these data provide compelling evidence that pathway inhibition is not due to the inhibitory effect of pan-KRASi-based LYMTACs but could be attributed to the ability of LYMTACs to affect target biology beyond target degradation. Overall, the data indicate that LYMTAC-induced KRAS ubiquitylation and degradation are not uniformly required for downstream signaling inhibition, while TCF is critical to suppress p-ERK signaling.

The observation that signaling downstream of KRASG12Dcan be modulated by LYMTACs even in the absence of KRASG12Ddegradation prompted us to further explore whether quantitative relocalization of KRAS from the plasma membrane to the lysosome could be driving this effect (Fig.4A). To address this hypothesis, we generated mNeonGreen-KRASWTstably expressing HEK293 cells to allow for subcellular KRAS tracking by confocal microscopy. After generating the cell line, we also verified in a CHX assay that addition of the mNeonGreen tag does not significantly alter the half-life of KRAS (Supplementary Fig.6). Pre-treatment of these cells with Bafilomycin A1 followed by LYMTAC-4 revealed rapid and marked KRAS relocalization from the plasma membrane followed by co-localization with RNF152 and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig.4B). This was specific for LYMTACs, as this phenotype was absent in cells treated with pan-KRASi or PROTAC (Supplementary Fig.7). We performed time lapse imaging in HEK293 cells to illustrate the kinetics of LYMTAC-4 induced KRAS relocalization. Internalization was evident as early as 30 min and gradually increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig.4C). We believe that the kinetics of relocalization may depend on several factors, such as the expression levels of MTH1-RNF152 and KRAS in each cell, and the efficiency of ternary complex formation.

KRAS is a plasma membrane-anchored protein that activates oncogenic signaling at the membrane via multiple effector proteins48. Various attempts to block KRAS trafficking to the plasma membrane have been made, yet these approaches have been largely unsuccessful49,50. In addition, membrane-bound KRAS is susceptible to pathway rebound driven by upstream receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, ultimately contributing to therapeutic resistance42,51,52. Given that LYMTACs display dual functionality in the inactivation of membrane proteins (i.e., via intracellular relocalization and via subsequent lysosomal degradation), their distinct mechanism of action may offer multiple advantages in overcoming some of the limitations commonly seen with current therapies. We explored this possibility by measuring pathway rebound upon drug withdrawal. AsPC-1 cells were treated with pan-KRASi or LYMTAC-4 for four hours, excess compound was washed away, and fresh media was added for 48 h before analysis. Consistent with the reported KRASi-induced signaling rebound, we observed a p-ERK signal rebound after 48 h in the pan-KRASi-treated samples (Fig.4D). Strikingly, LYMTAC-4 induced sustained KRASG12Ddegradation and delayed rebound of p-ERK signaling compared to pan-KRASi (Fig.4D). Excess MTH1 ligand rescued KRASG12Ddegradation and p-ERK inhibition, indicating that this effect was on target and dependent on RNF152 (Fig.4D). Notably LYMTAC-4 suppressed downstream p-ERK signaling similarly to a highly optimized clinically used KRASi, MRTX1133, that does not display p-ERK signaling rebound after washout (Supplementary Fig.8). Given that LYMTAC-4 maintained prolonged signaling inhibition, we sought to further monitor the effect of LYMTACs on AsPC-1 cell proliferation. Importantly, the depth of pathway suppression also translated phenotypically as LYMTAC-4 demonstrated improved cell killing compared to both KRASi and PROTAC (Fig.4E). This potent cell killing could be attributed to the multi-pharmacology displayed by LYMTACs via KRAS relocalization, sustained p-ERK inhibition, and lysosomal degradation.

To demonstrate the generality of our platform, we targeted additional LMP effectors beyond RNF152. We focused on LAMPT4a and LAPTM5, two LMPs that associate with the NEDD4-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase at the lysosome membrane through PY motifs (Fig.5A)27,29. After generating cells stably expressing MTH1-tagged LAPTM4a and LAPTM5, we first performed a cycloheximide assay in HEK293 cells to confirm their short-lived nature. The data indicate that both MTH1-LAPTM4a and MTH1-LAPTM5 are rapidly degraded within four hours in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig.9). Similarly to HEK293 cells, HCT116 cells stably expressing MTH1-tagged LAPTM4a or LAPTM5 showed rapid LMP turnover in a ubiquitin and lysosome-dependent manner (Fig.5B,C).

HA-ubiquitin was transfected into HCT116 expressing FLAG-MTH1-LAPTM5, which were pre-treated with 200 nM BafA1 for 30 min, followed by co-treatment with DMSO or 1 µM LYMTAC-2 treatment for 4 h. Next, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HiBiT antibody. Whole cell lysate was used as the input. The respective blots were probed with HA, MTH1, HiBiT, and vinculin antibodies. Data are representative of two independent experiments.GAsPC-1 cells stably expressing FLAG-MTH1-LAPTM4a were pre-treated with either pan-KRAS inhibitor or MTH1 ligand, followed by DMSO or 100 nM LYMTAC-4 treatment for 6 h. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with KRAS, pERK, and tubulin antibodies. Quantified data are representative of two independent experiments.

Having confirmed the fast turnover of MTH1-LAPTM4a and MTH1-LAPTM5, we next asked whether these two LMPs can induce target protein degradation in a LYMTAC-dependent manner. To this end, we utilized HiBit-FKBP12F36V-KRASG12Dknock-in HCT116 cells and stably expressed MTH1-LAPTM4a or MTH1-LAPTM5. Consistent with results seen for MTH1-RNF152, both MTH1-LAPTM4a and MTH1-LAPTM5 induced potent KRASG12Ddegradation in a LYMTAC-2-dependent manner (Fig.5D), validating these two LMPs as effectors for the LYMTAC technology. To verify the mechanism of action for LAPTM5-based LYMTACs, HCT116 cells were treated with lysosomal (Bafilomycin A1), proteasomal (bortezomib), and ubiquitin E1 (TAK-243) inhibitors prior to LYMTAC-2 treatment and subjected to immunoblotting. Consistent with RNF152-recruiting LYMTACs, LAPTM5-induced KRASG12Ddegradation was rescued by both lysosome and ubiquitin E1 inhibitors, but not proteosome inhibitor (Fig.5E). To further understand the ubiquitin-dependent mechanism of action, cellular ubiquitylation assays were performed. As expected, LAPTM5 formed a ternary complex with KRASG12Dand induced KRASG12Dubiquitylation in the presence of LYMTAC-2 (Fig.5F).

Finally, to expand LMPs that can be harnessed for LYMTAC development, we generated MTH1-LAPTM4a expressing AsPC-1 cells and confirmed the rapid degradation of this construct as had been observed with prior LMP (Supplementary Fig.10). We further confirmed that KRASG12Dlevels were unaffected by overexpressing either MTH1-RNF152 or MTH1-LAPTM4a in the absence of LYMTAC molecules (Supplementary Fig.10). Similarly to RNF152, LAPTM4a formed a productive ternary complex with KRASG12Din the presence of LYMTAC-4 (Supplementary Fig.11). Moreover, LAPTM4a-recruiting LYMTAC-4 induced KRASG12Ddegradation and p-ERK inhibition in AsPC-1 cells without affecting the levels of MTH1-LAPTM4a (Fig.5Gand Supplementary Fig.12). To further verify the mechanism of action, cells were treated with either pan-KRASi or MTH1-ligand prior to LYMTAC-4 treatment. The ligand competition data indicate that LYMTAC-induced KRASG12Ddegradation and p-ERK inhibition are LAPTM4a-dependent and require a ternary complex between KRASG12Dand LAPTM4a.

In summary, we describe here a SM-based LYMTAC platform that functions by repurposing short-lived lysosomal membrane protein effectors to induce membrane protein relocalization and subsequent degradation. Using a promiscuous kinase inhibitor-based LYMTAC, we demonstrate that LYMTACs preferentially deliver membrane kinases for lysosomal degradation. The observed substrate selectivity was a differentiating feature of LYMTAC-driven degradation when compared to cytosolic and nuclear protein degradation by a promiscuous kinase inhibitor-based PROTAC. The selectivity of LYMTACs towards membrane-associated proteins is likely explained by their natural turnover in the lysosome and continuous flux in the membrane trafficking pathways that offer opportunities for these membrane proteins to be captured by LMPs. Furthermore, using oncogenic KRASG12Das a therapeutically relevant, membrane-associated target, we demonstrated that LYMTACs induce sustained pathway inhibition and potent cell killing as compared to a KRAS inhibitor. Notably, LYMTAC-induced KRAS relocalization from the plasma membrane to the lysosome is sufficient to suppress downstream signaling. While we observe a lack of complete KRAS degradation (Dmax~50–60%) with LYMTACs, we observe quantitative relocalization of KRAS from plasma membrane to lysosomes, potent inhibition of p-ERK signaling, and cytotoxicity.

Our proof-of-concept results demonstrate that the LYMTAC technology could be an effective strategy to sequester KRAS away from the plasma membrane. This is reminiscent of proximity-inducing modalities that have recently been shown to modulate target protein via non-degradative mechanisms such as relocalization and sequestration53–57. In addition to the in-depth characterization of RNF152, we validated the LYMTAC technology with other LMPs such as LAPTM4a and LAPTM5, clearly demonstrating the potential compatibility of many more LMPs with LYMTAC technology. Overall, LYMTACs are a small molecule proximity-based platform that function intracellularly to inhibit oncogenic signaling through multi-pharmacology, including relocalization (occupancy-driven pharmacology) and lysosomal degradation (event-driven pharmacology) of membrane proteins (Fig.6). Other modalities such as LYTACs, PROTABs, and AbTACs have also emerged as novel platforms to regulate the membrane proteome. A potential advantage of LYMTAC compared to existing antibody-based technologies would be that 1) LYMTAC is a small molecule-based platform with dual mechanism of action and engages membrane targets from the cytosolic side, and 2) has the potential to target both integral membrane and membrane-anchored proteins for relocalization and lysosomal degradation. However, compared to LYTACs, LYMTACs are unable to target extracellular proteins for degradation.

LYMTAC is an SM-based, proximity-inducing modality that functions intracellularly to relocalize and degrade membrane proteins via the lysosome. LYMTACs inhibit POI signaling via relocalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation.

While we introduce LYMTAC as a chemical biology-driven proof-of-concept study, these MTH1-derived LYMTAC tool molecules can be utilized in fundamental research to functionally characterize the effect of target protein relocalization and lysosomal degradation. Identification of potent and selective ligands for short-lived LMPs remains a key challenge to advance the LYMTAC technology beyond the chemical biology concept presented here. We speculate that techniques such as DNA-encoded library screening, chemoproteomics, and fragment-based library screening will facilitate the discovery of ligands for multiple lysosomal membrane proteins in the future. Similarly to the challenges encountered with PROTAC delivery in animal models, extensive optimization will be required to deliver LYMTACs into animal models in the future. Future work should focus on understanding the target scope, LMP space (including cell-type specificity), and ligand discovery for LMPs to enable the LYMTAC technology for therapeutic development.

HCT116 cells have a heterozygous G13D mutation on the endogenous KRAS locus. To generate HCT116 cells with N-terminal HiBiT-FKBP12F36V-KRASG12Dhomozygous clones, a cutting site was designed near the endogenous KRAS G12 locus (guide RNA: 5’-aaacttgtggtagttggagc-3’).

The samples were then subjected to the SP3 protocol for clean-up. Briefly, 30 µg of protein was bound to >300 µg of beads in 80% (v/v) ethanol for 15 min, and then washed three times with 80% ethanol and once with acetonitrile. The protein-bound beads were digested with 1.2 µg of Trypsin/Lys-C mix in 50 mM TEAB buffer for 18 h at 37 °C. The beads were removed, and the peptides were dried to eliminate TEAB. Before LC-MS analysis, the samples were resuspended in 5% formic acid.

Liquid Chromatography (LC) Conditions: The chromatographic separation was performed using a Thermo Scientific Vanquish Neo LC system with a Bruker PepSep C18 analytical column (15 cm × 150 µm, 1.5 µm particle size). The mobile phases were Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water). The flow rate was set to 1.2 µL/min, and the column was equilibrated with 0% Solvent B before sample injection. The gradient elution was programmed as follows: 0% Solvent B from 0 to 1 min, followed by an increase to 2% Solvent B at 1 min. Subsequently, Solvent B was linearly ramped up to 24% over the course of 84 min(1–85 min). After reaching 24%, the percentage of Solvent B was further increased to 40% over the next 14 min (85-99 min). Finally, Solvent B was rapidly increased to 95% from 99 to 100 min to wash the column and held at 95% for 4 min (100–104 min) before the flow was returned to the initial conditions. Column re-equilibration was conducted at 95% Solvent B for an additional 4 min. The total run time for the method was 104 min, including the gradient, column wash, and re-equilibration steps.

After 48 h, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with respective antibodies.

AsPC-1 cells stably expressing RNF152 were seeded at a density of 2000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Next day, cells were treated with DMSO and dose titrations (0.5 nM to 1000 nM) of pan-KRASi, KRAS PROTAC, or LYMTAC-4. After five days of treatment, cell viability was measured using CyQUANT™ direct cell proliferation assay reagents following the manufacturer’s protocol (C35011). The fluorescence readings were recorded using EnVision plate reader (settings: FITC_bottom, Ex: FITC FP 480, Em: FITC 535) and plotted as a four-parameter non-linear regression curve fit using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3.
