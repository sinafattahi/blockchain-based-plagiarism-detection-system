Extensive cell proliferation during embryogenesis often compromises genome integrity, increasing the risk of developmental defects. However, the mechanisms that safeguard genome integrity during this process remain poorly understood. Using early limb development as a model, we identify that DNA damage response factors are up-regulated in proliferating mesenchymal stem cells. Conditional knockout ofRpa1, a representative DNA damage response factor, in early limb bud mesenchyme results in the near-total absence of forelimbs and severely underdeveloped hindlimbs. Mechanistically,Rpa1deletion leads to extensive DNA damage and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, driving transcription ofZbp1.Rpa1deletion also leads to accumulation of Z-DNA bound by ZBP1, triggering the full activation of ZBP1 and subsequent mesenchymal stem cell death through PANoptosis. Our study reveals RPA1 as a vital protector of genomic stability during limb development and underscores ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis as a key pathway for eliminating cells with excessive DNA damage during embryonic development.

Rpa1deletion causes DNA damage–induced PANoptosis in MSCs, leading to limb development defects.

Embryonic development is characterized by massive DNA replication and rapid cell proliferation. During this critical period, cells are susceptible to genome instability from replication errors (1,2). Notably, embryonic cells exhibit genomic instability at levels comparable to those seen in cancer cells (3,4). Replication fork instability and inefficient activation of checkpoints that safeguard genome instability in embryos lead to aneuploidy and cell death (5). Additionally, such a high load of genomic instability strongly affects the use of these cells in regenerative medicine, because they are prone to form tumors once injected into an organism. Studies have shown that the genome surveillance mechanisms, including DNA repair, are superior in embryonic stem cells compared to differentiated cells (6,7). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which rely on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and components of nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination (HR) pathways, exhibit greater resistance to genome instability than their differentiated progeny (8,9). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which these cells maintain their genome stability while still retaining their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types without propagating DNA errors still remain unclear.

Limb development involves a complex interplay of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death, making it an ideal model to investigate the mechanisms that safeguard genome integrity (10). This process begins with the extensive proliferation of MSCs, which form condensations beneath the ectodermal layer (11). At this stage, dysregulated DNA damage response (DDR) leads to limb development defects. For instance, thalidomide, a drug once used to treat morning sickness in pregnant women, causes oxidative DNA damage, leading to Tetra-Amelia syndrome, a condition characterized by the absence of limbs (12,13). Disruption of genes that maintain genome stability, such as Alpha-thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome protein (ATRX) and Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1), also increases cell death and impair limb development (14–16). These observations suggest that excessive genome instability at this stage induces stem cell death (17,18). The decision between cell survival and death following genome instability involves the activation of p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy, and senescence pathways in cancer cells (19,20). However, the detailed mechanisms by which MSCs maintain their genome stability and the cell death pathways in response to genome instability remains unclear.

The replication protein A (RPA) complex is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein complex in eukaryotic cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining genome stability, DNA replication, and transcription (21–23). RPA1, the largest subunit of the RPA complex, is primarily responsible for ssDNA binding and promotes DNA replication (24–26). During DDR, the RPA1 subunit facilitates the binding of RPA complex to ssDNA intermediates generated during various DNA repair processes, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, DNA mismatch repair, and HR (27–32). Once bound, the RPA complex interacts with other DDR factors to coordinate repair processes. Dysregulation of RPA1 is associated with multiple diseases, including cancer, disorders of telomere biology, Huntington’s disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, and fatty liver disease (23,33). Notably, adeno-associated virus–mediated overexpression ofRpa1has been shown to restore Purkinje cell function and alleviate neurological symptoms in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 mice, highlighting the potential forRpa1gene therapy in clinical applications (33). However, the specific role of RPA1 in limb development and its potential contribution to the protection of genome stability in MSCs remain unclear.

In this study, we identify RPA1 as an essential factor for genome stability during limb development. Loss ofRpa1leads to DNA damage, accumulation of Z-DNA, and Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1)–mediated PANoptosis, which ultimately causes limb defects resembling the human Tetra-Amelia syndrome phenotype. This study advances our understanding of developmental limb defects and offers insights into potential therapeutic interventions for DNA damage–related diseases.

To investigate how cells protect genome stability during early limb development, we first tracked the expression levels of key DDR factors (GOBP_DNA_DAMAGE_RESPONSE GO:0006974) in developing limbs. We analyzed single-cell embryonic limb profiles from both mouse embryos (E-MTAB-10514) and human embryonic limb profiles (E-MTAB-8813) (34). Mesenchymal lineages were extracted and subjected to Louvain clustering and uniform manifold approximation and projection visualization, revealing 14 subsets in mice and 16 subsets in humans (Fig. 1Aand fig. S1A). DDR genes were elevated in limb mesenchymal lineages from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E11.5 in mice, during which cells also exhibited higher cell cycle scores, reflecting the proliferative stage of limb development (Fig. 1B). Notably,Rpa1was significantly up-regulated in mesenchymal lineages from E9.5 to E11.5 in mice (Fig. 1, C and D;P< 0.01, compared to E13.5, Wilcoxon test), suggesting an important role for RPA1 during early limb development. In addition, DDR genes andRPA1were also significantly elevated in limb mesenchymal lineages from postconception week 5.4 (PCW5.4) to PCW6.5 in humans, corresponding to the E9.5 to E11.5 stage in mice (Fig. 1Eand fig. S1B;P< 0.01, compared to PCW7.2, Wilcoxon test).

(F) Immunofluorescence staining on murine limbs from E11.5 to E13.5 (n= 3, and representative images are shown). DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

To validate the findings, we performed immunofluorescence staining on murine limbs at different stages (E11.5 to E13.5). Consistent with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, RPA1 was highly expressed in whole limb sections at E11.5 and decreased gradually from embryonic day E12.5 to E13.5 (Fig. 1F). In E12.5 and E13.5, RPA1 expressed at a high level only in distal mesenchymal cells in proliferative regions at the distal periphery of the limb (34).

Next, we sought to investigate the role of RPA1 in limb development by generatingPrrx1-Cre;Rpa1fl/flmice [hereafter, referred to as conditional knockout (CKO)] (35). CKO mice were born in the expected Mendelian ratio but died within the first few days after birth. Genotyping and Western blot analysis confirmed the successful knockout ofRpa1in the limb buds of CKO mice (fig. S2, A and B). CKO mice showed a nearly-total absence of forelimb and incomplete hindlimb at birth (Fig. 2A). Skeletal staining revealed that CKO mice limbs lacked key bones, including the ulna, radius, humerus, scapula, tibia, fibula, and femur (Fig. 2B). Additionally, there was a reduction in the number of phalanges and tarsals, alongside severe underdevelopment of the iliac bone (Fig. 2C). We analyzed CKO mice from E12.5 to E18.5. At E12.5, limb defects were already apparent, with smaller limb buds compared to controls, and these defects became more pronounced over time (Fig. 2, D and E). BecausePrrx1-Cre also targets craniofacial mesenchyme, CKO mice exhibited cranial vault malformations, including significant hematomas and encephalocele at birth (Fig. 2, F and G).

As the limbs of CKO mice were nearly absent, we isolated limb MSCs from E12.5 WT mice and knocked downRpa1using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; fig. S3A). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed thatRpa1knockdown resulted in 161 differentially expressed genes, with 25 down-regulated and 136 up-regulated genes (Fig. 3A). Further characterization of the differentially expressed genes revealed that genes involved in cellular response to virus were increased afterRpa1deletion, while genes involved in cell cycle regulation were decreased (fig. S3, B and C). Notably, numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) were up-regulated inRpa1-deficient cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Key ISGs, such asZbp1,Ddx60,Irf7, andXaf1, were further validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis (Fig. 3C). Among these genes,Zbp1, a factor known to trigger cell death (36), was particularly prominent. This observation led us to investigate whetherRpa1knockdown affect cell viability. Notably, siRNA-mediatedRpa1knockdown impaired cell growth and resulted in extensive cell death (Fig. 3, D to F, and fig. S3, D to H). Furthermore, acridine orange (AO) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining of E12.5 limb buds revealed elevated cell death in CKO mice compared to that in WT littermates (Fig. 3, G to J).

ZBP1 triggers receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)– and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL)–dependent necroptosis (37). Therefore, we examined whether the loss ofRpa1in cells induces necroptosis.Rpa1knockdown increased phosphorylation of MLKL (pMLKL) and RIPK3 (pRIPK3) (fig. S4A). However, treatment with necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a necroptosis inhibitor (38), did not efficiently inhibit the cell death (fig. S4, B and C). Similarly, neither Z-VAD(OH)-FMK (zVAD-FMK), an apoptosis inhibitor (39), nor MCC950, a pyroptosis inhibitor (40), attenuated cell death inRpa1-deficient cells (Fig. 4, A to C; and fig. S4, D and E). A combination of MCC950, Nec-1, and zVAD-FMK treatment effectively inhibited cell death (Fig. 4, A to C; and fig. S4, D and E). This suggests that the loss ofRpa1induces cell death through PANoptosis, a unique inflammatory cell death pathway involving pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (41–46).

To further characterize the activation of PANoptosis, we examined key molecular markers of PANoptosis inRpa1-deficient cells. siRNA-mediatedRpa1knockdown led to increased activation of the pyroptotic molecules caspase-1; caspase-11 and gasdermin E (GSDME); the apoptotic molecules caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-8; and the necroptotic molecules RIPK3 and MLKL (Fig. 4D). Western blot analysis of limb bud tissues from CKO mice confirmed the activation of these PANoptosis markers, corroborating the findings in cells (Fig. 4E).

ZBP1 is a crucial component of the PANoptosome, a multiprotein complex that drives PANoptosis (36,41–43,47). Consistent with the RNA-seq data, ZBP1 protein levels were up-regulated in both CKO limb buds (Fig. 5A) andRpa1-deficient cells (Fig. 5B). ZBP1-mediated antiviral and proinflammatory signaling pathways were also activated (fig. S3B). Notably,Zbp1depletion rescued the cell death ofRpa1-deficient cells (Fig. 5, C and D; and fig. S5, A to D). This was accompanied by a reduction in PANoptosome formation (Fig. 5E) and reduced activation of the PANoptotic molecules (Fig. 5F). To further confirm this, we generatedPrrx1-Cre;Rpa1fl/fl; Zbp1−/−mice [double knockout (DKO)]. At E12.5,Zbp1homozygous knockout significantly reduced cell death of CKO mice limb bud (Fig. 5, G and H). By E16.5, the limb bud malformations in DKO mice were markedly improved, and the abnormal development of the calvaria was restored (Fig. 5I).

RPA1 is critical for maintaining genome stability (22,23,48). Given the up-regulation of ISGs, includingZbp1, and IRFs uponRpa1depletion (Fig. 3, A and B), we hypothesized that ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis inRpa1-deficient cells could be driven by the DNA damage–induced activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway (20,44,49,50).Rpa1knockdown led to increased phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) levels (fig. S6, A and B), elevated micronuclei-positive cells (fig. S6, C and D), and prolonged tail moment in comet assays (fig. S6, E and F). We observed thatRpa1knockdown caused cGAS localized to micronuclei (Fig. 6, A and B). Treatment with RU.521, a cGAS inhibitor (51,52), did not rescue the DNA damage phenotype (Fig. 6, C to H), but blocked cGAS-micronuclei colocalization (Fig. 6, A and B). RU.521 abrogated the activation of STING and the elevated ZBP1 (Fig. 6I), inhibited cell death (fig. S6, G to J), and attenuated the activation of key PANoptotic molecules (Fig. 6J) inRpa1-deficient cells.

Scale bar, 20 μm.

ZBP1 recognizes Z-RNA/DNA and promotes the assembly of RIPK3, caspase-1, and caspase-8 into the ZBP1 PANoptosome complex, driving PANoptosis (42,43). We, therefore, investigated whether the loss ofRpa1leads to the accumulation of Z-RNA/DNA in cells, which, in turn, activates ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis. Compared to WT cells,Rpa1-deficient cells exhibited increased cellular Z-RNA/DNA (Fig. 7, A and B). While ribonuclease A (RNase A) treatment did not affect Z-RNA/DNA staining, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) treatment reduced Z-RNA/DNA staining (Fig. 7, A and B), confirming the predominance of Z-DNA over Z-RNA. ZBP1 was induced and colocalized with Z-DNA inRpa1-deficient cells (Fig. 7A). The colocalization of ZBP1 with Z-DNA was further confirmed by super-resolution microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy–Förster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) (Fig. 7Cand fig. S7, A and B). Both RU.521 treatment and siZbp1 reduced ZBP1 expression without affecting Z-DNA levels (fig. S7, C and D). Thus, we postulate that ZBP1 induced by cGAS-STING pathway remains inactive, whereas Z-DNA binding fully activates ZBP1. Supporting this, 2′3′-cyclic guanosine 5′-monophosphate–adenosine 5′-monophosphate (2′3′-cGAMP), a STING activator (52), activated cGAS-STING pathway and induced ZBP1 expression without Z-DNA accumulation (Fig. 7, D to F), did not result in cell death and the activation of the PANoptotic molecules (Fig. 7, G and H, and fig. S7, E to G). These findings support the model that ZBP1 up-regulation alone is insufficient to induce cell death; rather, the accumulation of Z-DNA, not Z-RNA, caused byRpa1deletion activates up-regulated ZBP1 and cell death through PANoptosis.

In this study, we identified a critical role for RPA1 in safeguarding genome integrity during early limb development and demonstrate that ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis as a previously unrecognized cell death pathway upon extensive DNA damage. This study expands our understanding of how cells respond to DNA damage during critical periods of growth and differentiation.

RPA1, a vital component of the DDR machinery, is known for its role in stabilizing ssDNA during DNA replication and repair. The nearly complete loss of limb structure inRpa1CKO mice underscores the essential role of RPA1 in early limb development. The severity of these phenotypes, which go beyond limb malformations observed in other DDR protein knockouts (53), points to RPA1’s unique importance in managing the heightened genomic stress encountered during rapid cell proliferation. The mechanism linking DNA damage to limb developmental defects in CKO mice is the activation of ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis. While previous studies have implicated apoptosis and necroptosis in development-related cell death (54), our study revealed that PANoptosis was implicated in developmental defects, particularly in limb development. The accumulation of Z-DNA inRpa1-deficient cells serves as a potent trigger for this pathway, as ZBP1 binds Z-DNA to form the PANoptosome complex, leading to the simultaneous activation of PANoptosis.

While RPA1 is essential for DNA replication and its loss is expected to cause severe defects in proliferating tissues,RPA1deficiency may not be universally lethal to all proliferating cells. Notably, homozygousRPA1knockout human cell lines can be viable and clonally expanded (55). Furthermore, despite the liver being an essential organ, liver-specificRpa1knockout mice are viable with normal development (23). This context-dependent outcome may be linked to downstream signaling. Hepatocytes, for instance, lack STING and a functional innate DNA-sensing pathway (56–58), contrasting with limb mesenchyme whereRpa1loss activates the cGAS-STING pathway, robustly up-regulating ZBP1 and triggering PANoptosis. Our data show that ZBP1 acts downstream of the damage; its deletion rescues cell death and development despite persistent DNA damage. We propose that preventing this ZBP1-mediated cell death provides a temporal advantage, allowing cells to survive and contribute to development under replication stress, highlighting this specific death pathway’s critical role in the observed pathology. These findings also raise interesting questions for future investigation. For example, investigating the in vivo developmental consequences of conditional knockout of other replication genes would further solidify the specificity of RPA1’s role in limb development. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms by which some cells can survive and replicate their genome without RPA1 warrants further investigation.

DNA damage activates DDR to promote transient cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (59). Throughout mammalian embryonic development, genomic replication stress persists (60). In response to excessive DNA damage, mammalian cells can activate p53-dependent apoptosis and p53-independent apoptosis through ribosome stalling (19,61). Otherwise, endogenous DNA damage stimulates MRE11-dependent cGAS activation and promotes ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL–mediated necroptosis (20). We found that the accumulation of micronuclei and cytoplasmic DNA activated cGAS, which leads to the production of interferons and up-regulation ofZbp1. However, while ZBP1 up-regulation is necessary, it is insufficient to trigger PANoptosis alone; the presence of Z-DNA is required to fully activate ZBP1. This two-step activation model suggests that the cGAS-STING pathway primes cells for death by increasing ZBP1 expression, while Z-DNA binding serves as the final trigger for PANoptosis. This insight reveals a highly regulated mechanism that integrates DNA damage sensing with an inflammatory cell death response, which may have broader implications beyond limb development. The discovery that Z-DNA, rather than Z-RNA, is the primary activator of ZBP1 in DNA damage introduces a distinct dimension to our understanding of DNA damage sensing. ZBP1 has been primarily studied in the context of viral infections, where it detects Z-RNA from viral genomes. Our findings suggest that endogenous Z-DNA, generated by excessive genomic instability, can activate the same pathways. This raises intriguing possibilities about the role of Z-DNA in other physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, aging, and inflammatory diseases.

While our study clearly establishes that RPA1 loss results in Z-DNA accumulation and this accumulation leads to ZBP1 activation and cell death, the precise molecular mechanism by whichRpa1deficiency causes Z-DNA accumulation remains unclear. Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway results in increased expression of ISGs, includingZbp1, and, as reported in other contexts, cGAS-STING activation can also increase cellular reactive oxygen species levels (62,63). Evidence suggests a link between oxidative damage and Z-DNA formation; for instance, oxidation of guanosine (forming 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine) promotes Z-DNA formation due to altered steric and energetic favorability compared to B-DNA (64). It is plausible that oxidative damage contributes to the accumulation of Z-DNA structures that we observed. Furthermore, during the review of this manuscript, Kleinet al.reported that ZBP1 can stabilize Z-DNA derived from oxidized mitochondrial DNA (65). Extrapolating from this finding, it is intriguing to speculate that, in our model, ZBP1 not only recognizes the accumulated Z-DNA formed due to RPA1 loss and potential oxidative stress but may also bind and stabilize these structures. This stabilization could potentially reinforce ZBP1 activation, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that propagates and sustains the downstream PANoptosis program.

The identification of PANoptosis as a key cell death pathway in response to DNA damage suggests that modulating this pathway could have therapeutic benefits in conditions where excessive DNA damage or inappropriate cell death contributes to disease. For instance, targeting the cGAS-STING pathway or ZBP1 might offer potential therapeutic strategies for preventing or mitigating congenital limb defects, particularly those associated with teratogen exposure or genetic mutations that impair DNA repair. Moreover, given the role of PANoptosis in inflammatory diseases, our findings could inform potential therapeutic approaches for treating inflammatory disorders and cancers characterized by chronic DNA damage and cell death.

In conclusion, our study not only identifies RPA1 as a crucial factor in maintaining genomic integrity during limb development but also uncovers a previously uncharacterized cell death pathway, PANoptosis, triggered by DNA damage. These findings offer important insights into the molecular mechanisms governing embryonic development and have potential implications for preventing developmental defects and treating diseases associated with extensive DNA damage.

TheRpa1fl/flmice were previously reported (23).Zbp1-knockout mice (Zbp1−/−, C57BL/6) were purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms Center Inc.Prrx1-Cremice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (strain no. 005584). Both male and female mice were used in this study. All mice were kept in a specific pathogen–free (SPF) facility with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and were fed standard chow. Animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the Subcommittee on Research and Animal Care (SRAC) of West China School/Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University, Sichuan University (WCHSIRB-D-2023-467). For in vivo limb development experiments, animals were analyzed at E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, and postnatal day 0 (P0), with embryos collected from at least five animals per time point. Tissue collection and subsequent analyses (e.g., AO staining, TUNEL staining, and Western blot) were performed on tissues from at least three animals per condition. ForRpa1CKO mice,Zbp1KO mice, and their respective controls, each group consists of at least three animals per genotype per time point.

The procedure for whole-mount skeletal staining was performed as previously described (66). After removing the eyes, skin, internal organs, muscle and adipose tissue from newborn or fetal mice, the specimens were fixed overnight in 95% ethanol, followed by an overnight incubation in acetone. Skeletons were then stained with 0.03% Alcian Blue and 0.005% Alizarin Red in 1% KOH. The stained specimens were cleared at 4°C in a 1% KOH solution and kept in a mixture of glycerol and potassium hydroxide (66).

Under sterile conditions, harvest limb bud from E12.5 mouse embryos, and cut the limb bud into small pieces. Spread these small pieces evenly across the bottom of a T25 culture flask. Let the flask sit at 37°C for 5 min to allow the tissue to adhere. Gently add 4 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone, USA), ensuring that the tissue is completely submerged. Incubate the flask in a sterile cell culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2for 7 days to obtain the passage 0 cells. Replace the medium every 2 days, and, when the cells reach 80 to 90% confluence, perform a passage. MSCs were used between passages 3 to 4 to ensure the retention of their differentiation and proliferative potential.

Inhibitor concentrations and treatment durations: RU.521 (20 μM, 48 hours) and 2′3′-cGAMP (25 μM, 48 hours).

Total mRNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (15596-026, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (1 μg) was used as input for reverse transcription (RT) to synthesize cDNA. cDNA was synthesized by RT using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (RR037B, Takara Bio, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was then performed using Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (No Rox) (11201ES03, Yeasen Biotechnology, China) on a ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Wilmington, USA) following the cycling conditions: initial denaturation, 95°C for 5 min; amplification cycle (40 cycles), 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s; final melt curve, 60° to 95°C, increasing by 0.5°C increments every 5 s. The relative expression of target genes was normalized toActband calculated using the 2−ΔΔCtmethod. The primers used are listed in table S2.

Cells transfected with siRpa1 or negative control siRNA (siNC) were harvested by adding TRIzol reagent into six-well plates. RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions (15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The RNA integrity and quantity were measured using the Agilent 2100/4200 system. Samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥ 8.5 were used for subsequent library preparation. mRNA was purified from total RNA using polyT and then fragmented into 300– to 350–base pair fragments, the first-strand cDNA was reverse transcribed, and second-strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using Hieff NGS Ultima Dual-mode mRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (12301ES96, Yeasen Biotechnology, China). After adenylation of 3′ ends of DNA fragments, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the cDNA, and the library fragments were purified. The template was enriched by PCR, and the PCR product was purified to obtain the final library. After library preparation and pooling of different samples, the samples were subjected for NGS platform by Berry Genomics Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China;www.berrygenomics.com/). In addition, we sequenced the library to an average more than 6G reads for each sample. We removed the following types of reads: (i) reads with 3-nt unidentified nucleotides (N), (ii) reads aligned to the adaptor, and (iii) reads with ≥20% bases having Phred quality ≤ 5. Clean reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) by HISAT2 (67). Read counts were calculated by featureCounts (68), and differential analysis was performed using R package DESeq2 (69). Genes withPvalue < 0.01 and |log2fold change| > 1 were assigned as differentially expressed. In addition, whole list of genes that are differentially expressed and the GO enrichment results are provided in data S1.
