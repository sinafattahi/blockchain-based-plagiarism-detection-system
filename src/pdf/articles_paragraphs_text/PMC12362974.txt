Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, such as Palbociclib and Ribociclib, have significantly improved outcomes for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Although clinical trials have established the efficacy of these agents globally, real-world data from India is limited. This study compares the clinical effectiveness and safety profiles of Palbociclib and Ribociclib in a cohort of Indian patients.

This prospective study included 60 patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer treated at Army hospitals and research centers in India between 2020 and 2023. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profiles were analyzed to assess the real-world performance of Palbociclib and Ribociclib. Patients were treated with either Palbociclib or Ribociclib in combination with standard endocrine therapy.

Among the 60 patients, the median PFS was 39.40 months for the Palbociclib group and 42.93 months for the Ribociclib group (p= 0.26), indicating no statistically significant difference. The median OS was 41.98 months in the Palbociclib group and 45.51 months in the Ribociclib group (p= 0.15), with Ribociclib showing a slight but non-significant survival advantage. The most common adverse event was neutropenia, which occurred in 26% of patients receiving Palbociclib and 23% of patients on Ribociclib. Deranged liver function tests (LFTs) and fatigue were also reported in both groups.

Palbociclib and Ribociclib demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety profiles in this Indian cohort. While no statistically significant differences in PFS or OS were observed, the data suggest a marginal survival benefit with Ribociclib. These findings underscore the importance of individualized treatment plans in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, taking into consideration patient-specific factors. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to further clarify the nuances between these two agents.

Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide, contributing significantly to global cancer-related morbidity and mortality. According to the GLOBOCAN 2022 report, the incidence of breast cancer in India is approximately 27.6 per 100,000 women, and it continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Approximately 10–15% of breast cancer patients present with de-novo metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, while a larger proportion develop metastases following initial early-stage diagnosis and treatment. The increasing incidence of metastatic breast cancer, particularly hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) subtypes, accounts for approximately 70–80% of all cases, underscores the urgent need for optimizing therapeutic strategies.

While endocrine therapy (ET) has been the mainstay of treatment for HR + breast cancer, many patients eventually develop resistance, particularly in the metastatic setting. This has led to the development of targeted therapies, specifically Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors such as Palbociclib, Ribociclib, and Abemaciclib, which have emerged as pivotal agents in overcoming endocrine resistance and improving clinical outcomes [1–4].

Their introduction marked a paradigm shift in managing HR+/HER2- breast cancer, particularly when combined with endocrine therapy. Clinical trials, such as the PALOMA [5,6], MONALEESA [7,8], and MONARCH [9] series, have demonstrated significant improvements in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors to standard endocrine therapy [10–13].

Despite the well-established efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib and ribociclib, their usage in India remains constrained by high costs and limited access to advanced treatment centers. These therapies, often unaffordable in public health systems, are primarily available in private hospitals, creating a disparity in access [14–17].

CDK4/6 inhibitors are gaining traction in urban oncology centers, but comprehensive Indian data is sparse. The lack of real-world evidence complicates the application of Western trial outcomes to Indian patients.

Indian metastatic breast cancer patients frequently present with more aggressive disease and comorbid conditions, raising concerns about drug interactions and toxicity profiles, potentially differing from Western populations. These include younger age at presentation, higher proportion of triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes, delayed diagnosis, and limited access to healthcare services [16].

This comparative study aims to establish critical data on the efficacy and toxicity of CDK4/6 inhibitors in Indian patients, guiding clinical decision-making and influencing policies for better drug accessibility, potentially including generics or subsidized programs.

This prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care centre of Indian Armed Forces, India between 2020 and 2023. A total of 60 patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer were recruited between 2020 and 2021, and followed up till December 2023. Inclusion criteria included Patients age greater than 18 years with histopathologically proven HR positive and HER2 negative breast cancer who had clinical and/or radiological evidence of distant metastases, were included in the study. Patients with metastatic TNBC or Her2Neu or prior exposure to CDK4/6 inhibitors were excluded from the study.

Patients were allocated to one of two treatment arms based on physician choice. One group received Palbociclib (125 mg/day), while the other received Ribociclib (600 mg/day), both administered for 21 days. In addition, all patients received concurrent endocrine therapy with letrozole (2.5 mg/day).

End points: Primary: Progression free survival defined as the time interval in months between the date of starting CDK 4/6 inhibitor and date of first documented clinical and/or radiological disease progression. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), toxicity profiles, and the impact of biomarkers, such as Ki-67, on treatment outcomes. OS was defined as the time interval in months between the date of starting CDK 4/6 inhibitor and death due to any cause.

Per routine institutional practice, patients underwent laboratory tests, including blood and radiological examination. Patients underwent laboratory tests, including blood tests, and radiological tests as per routine institutional practice. This included complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemistry prior to starting CDK 4/6 inhibitor, CBC prior to starting each subsequent cycle, ECG prior to starting ribociclib and then as clinically indicated. Radiological assessment was done with PET-CT scan prior to starting CDK 4/6 inhibitor and once every 3–6 cycles thereafter.

PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and intergroup comparisons were performed using the log-rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, menopausal status, and biomarker expression. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.

Army Hospital Research and Referral Institutional Ethics Committee approval for the study was obtained. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants, and precautions were taken to maintain confidentiality. The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013.

The cohort comprised of 60 patients, equally divided between the Palbociclib and Ribociclib groups. Notably, no significant differences in demographic or baseline characteristics were observed between the two groups (Table1).

Patients in the Ribociclib arm experienced a median PFS of 42.93 months, compared to 39.40 months in the Palbociclib arm. Although not statistically significant (p= 0.26), this trend in favouring of Ribociclib is consistent with results from the MONALEESA trials, which similarly demonstrated prolonged PFS in combination with letrozole (see Fig.1).

The overall survival was also slightly higher in the Ribociclib group, with a median OS of 45.51 months versus 41.98 months for Palbociclib. Again, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.15), but the marginal improvement in OS supports Ribociclib’s potential benefit in prolonging life in this population (see Fig.2).

Both Palbociclib and Ribociclib were well-tolerated, with the most common adverse event being neutropenia. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 16% of patients receiving Palbociclib and 6% on Ribociclib. The toxicity grading was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Other toxicities, including deranged LFTs and fatigue, were comparable between the two groups (Table2). Dose adjustments were required in 16% of patients in the Palbociclib cohort, compared to 3% in the Ribociclib cohort, in response to adverse events, ensuring optimal management and treatment continuity (see Figs.3,4and Tables3,4).

The advent of CDK4/6 inhibitors has marked a pivotal advancement in the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, revolutionizing endocrine-based therapy by significantly improving progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Palbociclib and Ribociclib, two leading agents in this class, have shown remarkable efficacy in halting disease progression when combined with endocrine therapy [18]. However, while both drugs demonstrate clinical benefit, this study provides a deeper insight into their comparative real-world performance, safety profiles, and economic considerations, which have significant implications for their broader application, especially in resource-limited settings such as India.

These nuanced differences highlight the importance of tailoring CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy based on individual patient profiles and potential adverse effects [19].

In terms of real-world efficacy, the study demonstrates comparable efficacy between Palbociclib and Ribociclib, consistent with findings from the PALOMA and MONALEESA trials. Despite a trend favoring Ribociclib in both PFS (42.93 months vs. 39.40 months for Palbociclib) and OS (45.51 months versus 41.98 months for Palbociclib), these differences did not reach statistical significance. This suggests that both drugs provide substantial benefit when added to endocrine therapy in a real-world cohort, corroborating the results of large randomized trials [20]. The MONALEESA-7 trial, for example, demonstrated an OS benefit of Ribociclib in premenopausal women, while the PALOMA-3 trial established Palbociclib’s efficacy in a more heavily pretreated population.

Interestingly, while previous research has pointed to Ribociclib’s superiority in certain subgroups, such as premenopausal women, our findings showed no significant demographic OS or biomarker-driven distinction in outcomes between the two groups. The comparable PFS and OS rates in both cohorts reinforce the idea that either agent may be equally efficacious in the broader population, although more extensive studies with larger sample sizes may better delineate specific populations that benefit more from one agent over the other.

Safety remains a primary consideration in CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy, particularly hematological adverse events such as neutropenia. Neutropenia occurred in over 30% of patients in both treatment groups, consistent with global data. However, despite the high incidence of neutropenia, it was largely manageable with dose modifications and supportive care, reflecting the growing familiarity with CDK4/6 inhibitor-related toxicities in clinical practice. Notably, while neutropenia remains a class effect, it rarely leads to life-threatening complications when appropriately managed [13,21–23].

A notable finding in this study is the incidence of liver function abnormalities (deranged LFTs) and fatigue, which have been increasingly recognized as significant side effects of both Palbociclib and Ribociclib. In our cohort, 12% of patients on Ribociclib and 10% on Palbociclib experienced elevated LFTs, necessitating dose reductions in some cases. Ribociclib, in particular, has been associated with a higher risk of hepatotoxicity due to its hepatic metabolism. Dose adjustments were required in 16% of patients in the Palbociclib cohort, compared to 3% in the Ribociclib cohort, in response to adverse events, ensuring optimal management and treatment continuity. Dose reductions were implemented in 5 patients on Palbociclib (typically reduced from 125 mg to 100 mg to 75 mg) and in 1 patient on Ribociclib (reduced from 600 mg to 400 mg to 200 mg) due to Grade 3–4 hematologic toxicities.

This is consistent with the findings of the MONALEESA trials, which reported liver enzyme elevations more frequently in the Ribociclib arms compared to Palbociclib in the PALOMA trials. In contrast, fatigue, a common but often underestimated adverse effect, occurred in 20% of patients receiving Ribociclib and 18% of those on Palbociclib. Although generally mild, these symptoms can significantly affect quality of life, underscoring the need for proactive symptom management.

Economic considerations are increasingly influential in clinical decision-making, especially in low- and middle-income countries. While Palbociclib and Ribociclib have similar price points globally, in India, Palbociclib is generally more affordable, with monthly costs ranging from ₹4000 to ₹80,000 ($60 to $950 USD), compared to ₹75,000 to ₹1,10,000 ($900 to $1,320 USD) for Ribociclib. Given India’s predominantly out-of-pocket healthcare model, these costs can pose substantial financial barriers. Assuming a median treatment duration of 20 months, total drug costs range from ₹80,000 to ₹16,00,000 ($950–$19,000 USD) for Palbociclib, and ₹15,00,000 to ₹22,00,000 ($17,800–$26,200 USD) for Ribociclib [14,24–27].

Although formal cost-effectiveness evaluations such as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are scarce in the Indian context, international data suggest that CDK4/6 inhibitors frequently exceed traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds in resource-limited environments. As such, treatment choices are often influenced by drug availability, patient assistance programs, and institutional procurement practices. There is an urgent need to develop localized pharmacoeconomic models, including assessments of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), to guide rational resource allocation and ensure equitable access to these therapies.

In conclusion, the comparable efficacy and safety profiles of Palbociclib and Ribociclib support their interchangeable use in clinical practice, with the choice often dictated by patient-specific factors such as comorbidities, liver function, and economic constraints. The slightly higher risk of hepatotoxicity with Ribociclib may make Palbociclib more favorable in patients with compromised liver function, while Ribociclib’s demonstrated benefit in specific subpopulations in patients with a high-risk or aggressive disease profile.

As the field moves toward personalized oncology, future research should focus on identifying robust biomarkers predictive of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Although our study found no significant associations with Ki-67 or PIK3CA status, larger, prospective trials are essential to refine treatment strategies and enhance therapeutic precision [28–30].

The relatively small sample size, the randomisation, the selection bias, the predominance of postmenopausal patients limits generalizability, particularly regarding younger, premenopausal patients, limited access to subsequent lines of therapy due to suboptimal adherence to treatment, physician discretion or monitoring schedules in real-world settings, differences in patient profiles, loss to follow-up or late-stage presentation impacting OS with limited follow-up duration are limitations of this study, necessitating further research with larger cohorts and longer follow-up to validate these findings.

This study provides valuable real-world evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Palbociclib and Ribociclib in an Indian cohort of patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Both agents demonstrated comparable efficacy, with similar PFS and OS rates. Although Ribociclib exhibited a trend toward improved OS, this difference was not statistically significant. Toxicity profiles were manageable, with neutropenia and liver function abnormalities being the most commonly reported adverse events. Economic considerations remain a considerable challenge in India, where the high cost of these drugs may limit access. Therefore, ongoing research into cost-effective strategies, biomarker-driven treatments, and long-term outcomes is essential to optimize the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in clinical practice.
