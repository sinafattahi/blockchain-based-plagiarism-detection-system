While pervious studies have identified metabolic imbalance as a key driver of intervertebral disc degeneration, few studies explored the relationship between metabolic and low back pain directly. We aimed to explore the relationships between two critical metabolic factors—insulin resistance and obesity—and low back pain (LBP), thereby providing novel insights for the integrated management of patients with LBP.

We enrolled 41663 participants from four NHANES survey cycles (1999–2004 and 2009–2010). The Metabolic Score for Insulin Resistance (METS-IR) and Body Roundness Index (BRI) were utilized to investigate the associations of insulin resistance and visceral obesity with LBP.Weighted logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate associations between MetS-IR/BRI and LBP, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Using Restricted Cubic Splines (RCS) to assess potential nonlinear relationships. ROC curve analysis quantified diagnostic performance through area under the curve (AUC) estimation. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings.

Multivariable regression analysis revealed significant positive associations between MetS-IR/BRI and LBP after adjusting for all potential confounders (MetS-IR: OR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.008–1.018; BRI: OR = 1.072, 95% CI: 1.047–1.098) and these associations remained consistent across all subgroups. RCS analysis revealed no significant nonlinear associations between the METS-IR, BRI and LBP. In the ROC analysis, METS-IR showed the highest area under the ROC curve in females, followed by BRI and BMI.

In conclusion, within a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with low back pain, we identified significant positive correlations between METS-IR/BRI and LBP. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining healthy metabolic status, providing valuable insights for further research.

Low back pain (LBP) refers to pain, muscle tension, or stiffness localized between the costal margins and the inferior gluteal folds, with or without associated leg pain [1]. LBP is a common pain condition worldwide and its prevalence and burden increase annually. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, LBP has been found to be the leading cause of disability globally [2,3], and the number of people affected by LBP is expected to continue rising over the coming decades [4]. Identifying a precise etiology of LBP remains challenging. LBP has multifactorial and complex etiologies, with strong associations identified with genetic factors, sex, lifestyle determinants (e.g., sedentary behavior, obesity, smoking), psychosocial stressors, and maladaptive coping mechanisms [1].

Increasing evidence has focused on the relationship between metabolic dysregulation and intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, providing novel immunometabolic perspective into LBP and IVD degeneration [5–7]. Obesity-associated dysregulation of pro-inflammatory adipokines and elevated circulating lipids promote IVD degeneration. There is increasing evidence of obesity as an independent risk factor for LBP [8,9] and it also plays a role in the transition from acute to chronic LBP [10]. However, recent debates highlight confounding effects from genetic predisposition, sex-specific factors, and limitations of BMI [11,12]. While most of previous studies used BMI to assess obesity [13], there is preliminary evidence that body fat distribution rather than absolute total fat is associated with LBP [14,15]. We will employ the Body Roundness Index (BRI), a metric incorporating fat distribution, to explore the relationship between obesity and LBP.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent metabolic disorder, characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia-driven accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [16]. A recent study indicates obesity-independent mechanisms contribute to T2DM -induced intervertebral IVD degeneration [17]. A retrospective study revealed an association between newly diagnosed T2DM and increased risk of chronic LBP [18]. Insulin resistance (IR) is a key factor in the development of T2DM [19]. However, studies directly investigating the association between IR and LBP remain limited. Consequently, this study aims to explore the relationships between two critical factors—IR and visceral obesity(VO) with LBP, thereby providing information for the early identification and scientific management of LBP.

The data utilized in this study were sourced from the official National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) website. The database is publicly accessible to researchers, requiring no special permissions. NHANES, a nationally representative survey jointly conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), is a large-scale, multistage, ongoing, and nationally representative health survey. This study protocol received ethical approval from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all participants provided written informed consent. A total of 41663 individuals participated across four survey cycles (1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, and 2009–2010). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Participants aged < 20 years (n= 20,113); (2) Missing core metabolic data: age, sex, fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), height, or waist circumference measurements (n= 12,683); (3) Incomplete LBP outcome data (n= 450).After applying exclusion criteria, 8,417 eligible participants were included in the final analysis, comprising 3,048 individuals with LBP symptoms and 5,369 asymptomatic controls(Figure.1).

The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) is widely regarded as the gold standard for assessing peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, its complexity, invasiveness, and time-consuming nature limit its clinical applicability. Recently, a novel metric termed the METS-IR has emerged. Unlike HEC, METS-IR is insulin-independent and has been validated against HEC outcomes [20], providing a simple yet reliable clinical tool for evaluating IR. The METS-IR is calculated using the following formula: METS-IR = Ln [(2 × fasting glucose) + fasting triglycerides) × body mass index] / [Ln (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)].

Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, household income, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease was collected from household interviews using standardized questionnaires. Serum calcium and CRP concentrations were obtained from the laboratory data module. More detailed information about the above covariates was provided in Supplementary Table1.

Due to the complex, multistage sampling design of NHANES, an 8-year composite sample weight was constructed in accordance with NHANES analytic guidelines to ensure national representativeness when combining data from the 1999–2002, 2003–2004, and 2009–2010 survey cycles. Specifically, the 4-year weight was multiplied by 4/8 for participants from the 1999–2002 cycle, while the 2-year weights were each multiplied by 2/8 for participants from the 2003–2004 and 2009–2010 cycles. This 8-year weight was applied to all analyses in combination with stratification variables (SDMVSTRA) and primary sampling units (SDMVPSU), using the R survey package to account for the complex sampling structure.Continuous variables were summarized as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs), and categorical variables as frequencies with percentages. Between-group comparisons were conducted using the survey-weighted Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and the Rao–Scott second-order corrected chi-square test for categorical variables. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the associations between MetS-IR/BRI and LBP, with results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three sequential models were constructed: Model 1 (unadjusted), Model 2 (adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, income, and education), and Model 3 (fully adjusted for all covariates). Linear trends across quartiles of MetS-IR and BRI were tested by modeling the median value of each quartile as a continuous variable. Restricted cubic spline regression with three knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles was used to assess potential nonlinear associations. ROC curves were generated to evaluate discriminative ability, quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed for categories stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Missing data were handled via multiple imputation using the mice package in R. All analyses were performed using R version 4.4.1.

The study included 8,417 participants, with 3,048 individuals reporting low back pain (LBP) and 5,369 without LBP. Baseline characteristics of the two groups are presented in Table1. Compared to the non-LBP group, individuals with LBP were more likely to exhibit the following features: female sex, Non-Hispanic White ethnicity, married status, both higher and lower educational attainment, and household financial hardship (allP< 0.05). Additionally, the LBP group showed significantly higher prevalence of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease compared to the non-LBP group (allP< 0.05).

As shown in Table2, weighted logistic regression analysis revealed significant positive associations between MetS-IR/BRI and LBP after adjusting for all potential confounders (MetS-IR: OR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.008–1.018; BRI: OR = 1.072, 95% CI: 1.047–1.098). To further characterize these relationships, both indices were categorized into quartiles. In Model 3, all MetS-IR quartiles demonstrated significant positive associations with LBP, exhibiting a significant increasing trend across ascending quartiles (P-trend < 0.05). For BRI, no significant difference was observed between Q1 and Q2 (OR = 1.009, 95% CI: 0.882–1.154) using Q1 as reference. However, Q3 and Q4 showed 20.8% and 36.6% increased LBP risk compared to Q1 (Q3: OR = 1.208, 95% CI: 1.054–1.385; Q4: OR = 1.366, 95% CI: 1.184–1.574). Subsequently, these categorical variables were treated as continuous in weighted multivariable logistic regression models. Trend test analysis demonstrated a significant dose-dependent escalation in LBP risk with ascending BRI quartiles (P-trend < 0.05). Figure2presents the results of restricted cubic spline analysis adjusted for covariates and demonstrated that no significant nonlinear associations for MetS-IR (P-overall < 0.001, P-nonlinear = 0.707) and BRI (P-overall < 0.001, P-nonlinear = 0.526).

To further evaluate the robustness of METS-IR/BRI associations with LBP, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted stratified by sex, age, race, educational attainment, household income, smoking status, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Final results are visualized in the forest plot (Fig.3). Significant interaction effects were observed between METS-IR and sex/education/smoking (P-interaction = 0.012, 0.008, and 0.042, respectively). Nonetheless, METS-IR maintained consistent positive associations with LBP risk across all subgroups. Similarly, in subgroup analyses of BRI, a positive association with elevated LBP risk was consistently observed across all subgroups, although the interaction test indicated a potential interaction between BRI and education level (P for interaction = 0.021).Notably, while previous studies exclusively reported sex-specific MetS-LBP associations in females [23], our sex-stratified analyses revealed positive correlations in males for both indexes (METS-IR: OR = 1.011, 95% CI: 1.005–1.017; BRI: OR = 1.068, 95% CI: 1.032–1.105). Although the odds ratios were higher in the female group (METS-IR: OR = 1.022, 95% CI: 1.016–1.028; BRI: OR = 1.096, 95% CI: 1.068–1.1236).

ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of METS-IR and BRI in both genders (Fig.4). The results demonstrated that all indicators exhibited moderate predictive capability, with AUC values below 0.7. Among these, METS-IR showed the highest area under the ROC curve of 0.6199 in females, followed by BRI and BMI. In contrast, BMI demonstrated the lowest AUC in males. The cut-off points for the prediction of prevalent LBP in females with the METS-IR and BRI were 36.77 and 5.12, respectively.

In this study, data from four NHANES (1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004, and 2009–2010) cycles were utilized to assess the associations between METS-IR, BRI, and LBP. We found that METS-IR and BRI were associated with an increased risk of developing LBP. However, the positive associations between LBP and METS-IR or BRI were more significant in female than in male. Previous studies also reported significant gender differences in the associations between T2DM/obesity and LBP [18]. Another notable factor was educational attainment: the association was non-significant among individuals with higher educational attainment, suggesting education may serve as a protective factor [24]. According to the ROC curve results, the optimal threshold in females for METS-IR is 36.77, and we suggest that the patient should take measures to control METS-IR levels likes lifestyle modifications or medications [25,26].

The lifetime prevalence of LBP is nearly 80%, yet in most patients no specific cause can be identified [27]. However, obesity may contribute to LBP through multiple mechanisms. Dysregulated adipokines secreted by adipose tissue in obesity serve as key drivers of systemic low-grade inflammation [5], and a state of inflammation are associated with worsening of LBP [28]. Elevated triglyceride levels exhibit a positive correlation with LBP prevalence [29], while adipokine-mediated aortic atherosclerosis are also associated with LBP [30,31]. Besides, mechanical overload alters IVD biomechanics and thus accelerates IVD degeneration [16]. Increasing evidence indicates obesity accelerates IVD degeneration [32–34], and IVD degeneration is a major contributor to LBP [35,36]. Early systematic reviews reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between weight-related factors and LBP [37]. However, subsequent studies consistently demonstrated that overweight/obesity elevates LBP risk [13]. Some population-based evidence indicates stronger correlations between abdominal obesity and LBP compared to generalized obesity [15,38]. The widely used BMI inadequately evaluates fat distribution, whereas we employed the BRI. Compared with BMI, BRI effectively integrates waist circumference and height to characterize multidimensional body shape, thereby more accurately representing both general and visceral fat distribution [22]. In our analyses, BRI demonstrated comparable predictive value to BMI for LBP in females but superior performance in males.

Multiple pathophysiological features of T2DM may drive IVDD, ultimately resulting in pain and disability. The hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia accelerates degradation of disc components, such as endplate sclerosis [39] and premature senescence in annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus cells [40]. Concurrently, T2DM-associated accumulation of AGEs induces microvascular impairment that limits blood supply to disc cells while reduces clearance of inflammatory mediators and cytotoxic metabolites [41]. Furthermore, individuals with T2DM exhibit accelerated sarcopenic progression compared to non-diabetic counterparts [42] and trunk muscle weakness may favor the occurrence of low back pain [43]. The clinical evidence weakly supports the relationship between DM and IVDD [41]. Nevertheless, a large population-based study revealed higher chronic LBP prevalence among DM patients after adjusting for LBP risk factors [44]. Recent study also found normal weight DM participants had significantly increased odds of reporting LBP with increasing HbA1c levels as independent factors [45]. The mechanisms linking DM to LBP remain unclear, accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) may result in accelerated spinal degeneration [46,47]. IR, a core defect in T2DM [48], has shown potential associations with LBP [49], We used METS-IR to analyze IR. This metric predicts visceral adiposity and diabetes, correlates with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp validation, and reflects peripheral insulin resistance [20]. This study shows it can serve as a predictive biomarker to enhance clinical management of LBP. Ultimately, through METS-IR and BRI—two novel indicators—combined with the large-scale, rigorously collected NHANES database, we demonstrated a positive correlation between IR or VO and low back pain. These findings underscore the potential benefits of lifestyle modifications and weight management in LBP patients, with METS-IR and BRI exhibiting superior predictive validity compared to traditional BMI.

This study has several notable limitations. First, LBP assessment relied on self-reported information, potentially introducing recall bias and classification inaccuracies. Additionally, we have to acknowledge that NHANES data primarily represent the US population, and its generalizability to non-US populations may be limited. Finally, as a cross-sectional study, the causal relationship between IR or VO with LBP remains unestablished. Future research should validate these findings through larger, prospective cohort studies.

In conclusion, within a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with low back pain, we identified significant positive correlations between METS-IR/BRI and LBP. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining healthy metabolic status, providing valuable insights for further research.
