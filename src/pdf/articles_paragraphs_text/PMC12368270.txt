Mathematical models designed for describing, predicting, and controlling states of microbial systems promote progress in solving vital problems at the forefront of microbiology. The paper presents a theoretical justification for the modeling andin silicostudies of the evolution of bacterial communities cultivated in nutrient medium. We propose a coupled approach to formalize the formation of dendrite patterns of bacteria grown in nutrient medium and the corresponding characteristics of bacterial communication. The conceptualization includes the Allen-Cahn-based model of bacterial colony evolution combined with the model of changes in biomass-dependent nutrient concentration and the reaction-diffusion model of bacterial quorum sensing. The bacterial evolution model is associated with the Landau theory within the core framework of the existence of a growth threshold for bacteria during the growth process, known as the Allee effect. The unique solvability of the initial boundary value problem is proved for the mathematical model of nutrient-dependent bacterial growth. The theoretical results are based on the derivation of newa prioriestimates for the solution of the semilinear initial boundary value problem. The general mathematical model was implemented using the finite element method with the COMSOL Multiphysics platform. Various computation experiments attributed toPseudomonasbacterial strains were performed to examine different scenarios of the spatiotemporal dynamics of key substances of the biosystem. The results obtained indicate that the considered approach can be applied to simulate the growth of dendritic bacterial colonies and to control the optimal population size above which survival is possible despite the Allee effect.

Nowadays, such fields as mathematical biology, biophysics, andin silicostudies have gradually broadened to supplement the data ofin vivoandin vitroexperiments in cases where clinical and laboratory trials have relevant ethical or technical restrictions. One of the major strategies used to study microorganisms follows the paradigm of exploring these biological objects from the point of view of complex nonlinear physical systems. In highlighting recent analysis of microbial species based on an interdisciplinary approach, important challenges include revealing and specifying mechanisms of microbial interactions that lead to group behavior and fitness of microbial communities1.

Regarding bacteria, some species exhibit emergent properties of group behavior. Among those the most important ones are the collective reaction to some external action, the formation of antibiotic resistance factors, the formation of biofilms, population density control, etc. Bacterial communities have become vital to the functioning of various ecosystems and play a crucial role in nutrient recycling, in many environments and humans. The ability of these bacterial communities to monitor the environment, alter behavior on a population-wide scale, and form biofilms is in many cases regulated by the process of cell-to-cell communication. Overall, quorum sensing is one of the most important mechanisms of intercellular communication between bacteria. In bacteria, quorum sensing is realized due to a plethora of diffusible organic molecules known as autoinducers. When the population reaches a critical density, autoinducers trigger changes in gene expression in individual cells2. The regulatory principle of quorum sensing involves producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to autoinducers3–6.

One of the common methods of microbiological diagnosis and detection of bacterial species uses the cultivation of bacteria under heterogeneous conditions on solid substrates or culture media. Bacterial cells are inoculated onto a plate with nutrients and start to grow rapidly, forming self-similar structures with complex geometry. Then bacterial species can be recognized by analyzing color and morphogenic structure, resulting in the formation of various spatial patterns. Bacterial patterns do not only allow to get information concerning biological characteristics and reproductive mechanisms, but also to examine their roles within ecosystems7,8. In clinical and medical research, the growth of pure bacterial cultures remains an essential component to analyzing antibiotic susceptibility, developing prevention strategies and approaches to combat diversified bacterial infections9. Besides, the study of patterns of bacterial colonies plays a crucial role in environmental monitoring to effectively evaluate contamination10, in biotechnology and bio-manufacturing to optimize fermentation processes and enhance product yields11,12, in the food industry to provide the quality and safety of food13.

Many microbial communities exhibit density-dependent phenomena when successful dispersion into environments is sufficient for life, but the colonies are not guaranteed to establish14. The possibility of a positive correlation between aspects of growth (fitness) and population size is known in the field of population dynamics as the Allee effect15,16. Many species require a certain level of population density to reach successful reproduction. Below that level, reproduction slows down or the population may even go extinct. Therefore, for a sufficiently small population density, the reproduction rate in such species will be lower than the mortality rate in case of the so-called strong Allee effect.

Although such density-dependent phenomena in microbial populations still remain an open problem, the presence of an Allee effect for many microbial species has been indicated experimentally in recent studies, see14,17,18. The data suggest that the “automatic cooperation” of individuals permits them to achieve higher survival rates during the formation of aggregations. In particular, the study14has reported thatVibrio fischeribacteria show an intrinsic demographic Allee effect as well as the same species subject to predation by the bacterivoreCafeteria roenbergensisdemonstrate both intrinsic and extrinsic demographic Allee effects. In18bacterial community ofEscherichia colihas been engineered with the use of quorum sensing regulation. The study has demonstrated a strong Allee effect and confirmed that if dispersal is too fast or too slow, a population cannot spread.

Different approaches have been designed to formalize and simulate the evolution of bacterial colonies grown in nutrient media and the formation of patterns of various morphological types. Notably, common approaches to modeling bacterial patterns in cultural media include e.g. reaction-diffusion approximation19, genetic mutation theory20, agent-based models21. In the framework of the current study we will apply deterministic approaches using partial differential equations (PDEs) to model and visualize patterns of dendrite morphological types19,22–26. In this context, we can consider a class of nonlinear or semilinear reaction-diffusion models, which allow complex spatial-temporal patterns to be reproduced and analyzed using computational experiments. Some mathematical frameworks have been postulated by the theory proposed by Alan Turing to explain how such stable patterns arise during morphogenesis diffusion-driven. Note also that numerous studies have stressed an analogy of such a class of models with the Ginzburg-Landau thermodynamics model of phase transitions.

To include the above-mentioned Allee effect we can follow classical approaches from mathematical models of population dynamics. A simple approach to modeling the Allee effect assumes that the initial population density below a certain growth threshold results in extinction, whereas the initial population density above this threshold leads to fitness and survival. The approximation curve for the function related to the probability of bacterial establishment has been proposed in14. The models of microbial population growth under the chemostat conditions, which are governed by a system of ordinary differential equations (with incorporated Allee effect) have been reported in27. An agent-based model of bacterial metapopulation dynamics under the Allee effect has been introduced and implemented by28.

In this way, spatial-temporal models of bacterial growth based on PDEs are the extension of the deterministic approach to take into account the Allee effect. Specifically, the bistable Allen-Cahn equation has been previously applied to formalize a positive correlation between population size and population growth rate applied to biofilms29,30. In these terms, the Allen-Cahn equation has been proposed as a continuation of the idea of using the Fisher equation (with a reaction term corresponding to the logistic growth model) to formalize the population dynamics of microorganisms.

In general, the formalization of the Allee effect through the introduction of a nonlinear reaction term into the diffusion equation of population dynamics applied on nutrient-uptake models of microorganisms has been well-studied31.

The deterministic approach to modeling bacterial quorum sensing is also represented in a wide range of directions32. In the current study, we will supplement the model of nutrient-dependent bacterial growth with the previously developed differential model of cell-to-cell bacterial communication33–35. This model concept involves the calculation of the spatial-temporal distribution of the concentration of a chemical substance characterizing the quorum level. The mathematical formalization of the model is based on a system of PDEs, which formalizes the dynamics, diffusion, generation, and reaction components for the concentration of autoinducers. Using this approximation requires specifying the spatiotemporal distribution of biomass. In our past studies33–35, we used simple geometric primitives to initialize locations of bacterial colonies and simulate their dynamics. Here we will include data from modeling bacterial patterns growing in nutrient media.

The key contribution of our study is threefold. We propose formalization, conduct theoretical analysis, and perform numerical implementation of the coupled mathematical model of nutrient-dependent bacterial growth to take into account the Allee effect. The fundamental idea of research is to develop a hybrid deterministic approach forin silicostudies of bacterial communities due to a combination of the Allen-Cahn-based model of bacterial growth, the model of changes in biomass-dependent nutrient concentration, and the reaction-diffusion model of bacterial quorum sensing.

The paper is structured as follows. The biological background, the applied biophysical approach, and the differential equations governing the proposed mathematical model are introduced in Section 2. The theoretical analysis of the Allen-Cahn-based bacterial growth model follows in Section 3. The results of the computational experiments conducted to explore spatial-temporal distributions of focal characteristics of the biosystem are discussed in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper with some remarks in Section 5.

In this section, we introduce some fairly basic biological ideas and biophysical foundations for bacterial growth in nutrient media, the quorum sensing regulation system, and the essence of the population dynamic model with the Allee effect, so that these can then be presupposed in the following. Further, we will formalize a generalized mathematical model as a combination of the following models: the Allen-Cahn model for bacterial colony evolution, the dynamical model for biomass-dependent nutrient concentration, and the differential equation model of bacterial quorum sensing.

To be definite, assume that we will consider the evolution ofPseudomonasbacterial species in a nutrient medium. Mostly, in the practice of biological experiments on the cultivation, detection, isolation, and enumeration of pathogens or microorganisms, usually agar-based enrichment media is used. Here we will focus on aPseudomonasrepresentative, namely, thePseudomonas putida(P. putida) bacterial strain, which is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and aerobic bacterium. Basically,P. putidabacterium is a rather safe strain that lives in soil, water, and plants, particularly polluted sites36. Nevertheless, some studies have noted thatP. putidacan be a human pathogen causing nosocomial infections37or provide an exchange platform for more virulent microbes like the more dangerousP. aeruginosa38. The cultivation in nutrient media, as well as quorum-sensing phenomena inP. putidabacteria, have been examined previously from a biological point of view39–41. This implies that theP. putidabacterial strain represents a relevant model object forin silicostudies.

Experimental data suggest that bacterial patterns related toP. putidaare more consistent with branching-type morphological structures, dendrites, and “flower-like” patterns39. The spatio-temporal distributions of biomass and nutrient concentrations characterize bacterial pattern formation. As far as the evolution of a bacterial population is cultured in a nutrient substrate, we can consider changes in bacterial concentrations and nutrition as a “competing” process for resources. In this case, we can specify the location of the inoculated mother bacterial population and the initial value of the nutrient distribution (for simplicity, we assume a uniform distribution and a constant value for the initial nutrient concentration). The evolution of bacterial growth is only dependent on the available level of nutrients and initial and boundary conditions. For simplicity, a two-dimensional model of bacterial growth in nutrient media will be explored.

In addition, we will focus on quorum sensing as one possible mechanism of cell-to-cell bacterial communication. The general scheme of the quorum sensing regulation process during bacterial growth in a nutrient medium is shown in Fig.1.

The fragment of bacterial evolution during nutrient cultivation and the general scheme of the quorum sensing network.

In many important cases, quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria is realized through secreted signaling molecules (acyl homoserine lactones, short AHL, the most common class of autoinducers in Gram-negative bacteria) due to gene expression42. Also, the AHL synthases and transcription regulators (PpuI and PpuR proteins) are relevant components of the quorum sensing regulating system inP. putida. The AHL diffuses through the cell membrane in and out, and finally leads to an upregulation of the AHL production, thus, to a positive feedback in the system. For certain bacterial species likeP. putidathe specific enzyme lactonase can degrade AHL (i.e., forms a negative feedback as its production is upregulated by quorum sensing, too)43. Besides, abiotic degradation of the AHL and the lactonase are present. It follows that there are two key spatio-temporal distributions of chemical substances that characterize bacterial communication. The AHL concentration is related to the “quorum level” in a bacterial population, while lactonase concentration can be attributed to the “level” of AHL degradation.

Here we assume that the “source” for the AHL spatio-temporal distribution is the location and dynamics of biomass concentration. Note that within the framework of this study, a simplified approach was adopted for the connection between the chemical substance characterizing the quorum sensing (the AHL) and the distribution of biomass.

As argued above, the state of a bacterial community can not be considered just as a result of the superposition of individual bacteria states. Indeed, the nonlinear interactions within and between small communities and the cooperative behavior, bacterial species exhibit diverse spatial self-organization patterns on the surface of nutrient agar media.

Notably, for many types of microorganisms, the Allee effect is associated with the fact that survival and extinction of the population are affected by the initial value of population density14,17,18,27,28,44. The stability of some species in an ecosystem is due to a critical threshold value of population density. If the density is below this threshold, the population shows reduced fitness, whereas when the population size is higher than the threshold, the species reveals better stability and easier reproduction. Figure2shows how the population growth ratedB/dtdepends on population sizeB, for the weak as well as for the strong Allee effect, and compared with the classical logistic growth.

Comparative growth velocities: strong vs. weak Allee effects and logistic growth.

We may assume that bacteria are subject to an intrinsic demographic Allee effect, and the Allee threshold is sensitive with respect to forming spatial bacterial colony patterns. It could be also interpreted as a kind of implicit biofilm effect, which starts growing after some time the colony has been started growing and yields a more protected environment for the bacterial cells. As far as classical mean-field models describing population dynamics (as a time-dependent function of population density) neglect spatial formed structures, to analyze critical phenomena from a macroscopic perspective, we apply the concepts of Landau theory of phase transitions.

Basically, the idea of using a physical analogy to describe dendrite bacterial patterns is very natural, since branching-type structures are formed in condensed matter during the transition to various stable thermodynamic states. The phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory is one of the fundamental approaches, which permits to determine spatial-temporal fluctuations of the order parameter under conditions of the existence of critical values of this quantity. In this case, the formalization of the Allee effect should imply the presence of thresholds for bacterial growth, similar to the visualization presented in Fig.2for the strong Allee effect and the corresponding modification for the weak Allee effect. The strong Allee effect, characterized by negative population growth below a critical threshold, predominantly manifests under external stressors including predator presence (particularly bacteriophages), severe resource limitations such as carbon or oxygen deprivation, and environmental stresses like antibiotic exposure or heavy metal contamination. In contrast, the weak Allee effect, showing reduced but still positive growth at low densities, typically reflects intrinsic demographic behavior emerging under conditions of naturally low initial population density or limited diffusion, particularly in the absence of external stressors. Extensive research has unequivocally demonstrated that bacteria of the genusPseudomonasexhibit well-defined quorum sensing mechanisms and show pronounced density-dependent survival and cooperative behaviors - phenomena functionally equivalent to the Allee effect. Critical experimental evidence reveals thatP. putidapopulations display significantly impaired biofilm formation at low cell densities, as demonstrated by45, where knockout mutations in key quorum-sensing genes completely abolished this collective behavior. Furthermore, under low-density conditions, these bacteria exhibit substantially reduced production of extracellular enzymes, leading to markedly slower population growth, as established in the seminal work of46. These findings collectively illustrate howPseudomonaspopulations, like many organisms exhibiting the Allee effect, depend critically on reaching threshold densities to maintain essential cooperative behaviors and ensure ecological success.

The problem of modeling the spatial-temporal distribution of bacterial biomass can be thought of in terms of the existence of two states. The first state is more suitable for the environment and can be related to the stable state, while the second state can be associated with the metastable state of the bacterial population. We should stress that attempts to apply the results of the Landau theory to biological systems have been actively made based only on the principle of analogy in modeling theories26,47,48.

By assumption, during the evolution of bacterial colonies in the nutrient medium,f(B) defines the local bacterial fitness in the ecosystem, whileF(B) relates to the total fitness of the bacterial community in this domain. This yields a macroscopic description of changes in the state of the bacterial community. The functionf(B) should provide a formalization of the Allee effect in accordance with the graphical representation shown in Fig.229,31.

The function (4) defines the dependence of the Allee threshold on the nutrient concentration. An increase in nutrient concentration results in a decline in the growth threshold. This implies that the local environmental fitness of bacteriafdefined by (3) becomes a function of two variables – biomass concentrationBand nutrient concentrationN. The cubic reaction termf(B,N) explicitly integrates the growth thresholdc(N), which dynamically adapts to nutrient concentration. Belowc(N), growth is negative (strong Allee effect) or reduced (weak Allee effect), while abovec(N), growth becomes positive, driving the population toward the carrying capacity. This property enables the model to reproduce the key feature of the Allee effect - the existence of a critical population density required for survival. The general view of this function is illustrated in Fig.3to indicate the difference between the weak and strong Allee effects.

Graphs of the functionsf(B,N) corresponding to the weak Allee effect—(a) and the strong Allee effect—(b) at certain set of parametersa=1,b=1,d=1,e=5,=0.7..

Here, for simplicity, to formalize the weak Allee effect, we used the same dependence (4), setting the value offto zero ifBis below the growth thresholdc. It should be mentioned here that we consider both types of Allee effects, weak and strong, which allows for a general examination of the potential impacts on colony growth. To observe the extinction of a bacterial colony below a certain threshold, additional external effects are usually assumed, which may be present in a more natural setting. A detailed analysis of such effects is beyond the scope of this article. Therefore, we focus on a general and principled consideration of the effect.

Furthermore, to formalize the model of nutrient consumption by bacteria, we apply the principle of reaction-diffusion modeling commonly used in population dynamics. Also, the diffusion equation for nutrient concentration can be considered as an analog of the equation describing the temperature derived using the conservation law of enthalpy51,52. In these terms, to model the movement process of the boundary of a bacterial colony, we introduce the correlation terminto the governing equation. This term changes only when the colony interface passes through this point, wherehis the nutrient consumption rate balance parameter.

In this case to express the reaction term related to the Allee effect, we set,, wherea,b,d,e,are positive parameters. Note, that usually the growth rate including the weak Allee effect only tends to zero, but does not reach it. We chose a simplified version, which is somehow ‘’between” the weak and the strong Allee effect, assuming zero growth if the concentration of the bacteria is below a certain threshold. Being interested in observing the general effects of a non-constantper capitagrowth rate instead of very precise but only specialized behavior, this represents an adequate choice. We should also stress that the equation (5) formalizes the positive correlation between bacterial biomass and population growth rate, and is more consistent with the form of equation known as the bistable Allen-Cahn equation53.

In this way, the system (5) – (8) can be referred to as an initial-boundary value problem for the Allen-Cahn-based nutrient-dependent bacterial growth model.

Thus, the solution of the coupled problem (6) – (14) includes sequentially finding a solutionof system (5) – (8) for a given time moment and then finding a solutionof system (9) – (14). A local (in the sense of some time interval) existence of a weak solution of problem (11) – (14) has been established in54. A theoretical analysis of the initial-boundary value problem (6) – (9) for the Allen-Cahn-based bacterial growth model is performed in the next section.

In the following section, we state the initial-boundary value problem for the Allen-Cahn-based model of nutrient-dependent growth of bacteria and perform its theoretical analysis, especially with respect to the unique solvability.

By,, we denote a Lebesgue space ofs-integrable functions, bythe Sobolev space,(respectivelyC([0,T];X)) stands for the Lebesgue space of functions of class, defined on (0,T) (respectively continuous on [0,T]) with values in a Banach spaceX.

Here and below. It is well known that, and the first embedding is compact.

The initial-boundary value problem (15) – (18) can be written in a standard way as a Cauchy problem for a system of ordinary differential equations with operator coefficients in the space. To do this, it is enough to multiply in the sense of inner product the equations (15) and (16) byand integrate overusing Green’s formula and boundary and initial conditions.

where, from55, Th. 4.8, p.150, it follows the existence of a unique solutionof problem (20).

The unique solvability of the linear problem (21) is well known56, Th.3.1, p.70.

Let us define the operator, setting. Note that ifNis a fixed point ofFand the inequalitiesare satisfied for, then the pairis a solution to problem (19).

Let conditions (i) and (ii) hold. Then there exists a weak solution of the problem (15) – (18) such that.

Thus, taking into account (24), we obtain that the estimateholds uniform concerning. By virtue of the Leray-Schauder principle, the operatorFhas a fixed pointN, and since the inequalitieshave been proven for, then the pairis a weak solution to problem (19).

Similar to the proof of Theorem 1, it is possible to obtain the estimatefor any weak solution to the problem (15) – (18).

To prove the uniqueness of a weak solution to the problem (15) – (18), we need to establish additional properties of the solution.

whereis a bounded function. Therefore. Then the statement of the lemma follows from the known result for the abstract parabolic problem56, Th.3.3, P.72.

Since, from the resulting inequality it follows that, which means the uniqueness of the solution.

The following section addresses simulation results and discussion. The section comprises several parts, beginning with some comments concerning the model object, simulation parameters, and features of computer implementation, followed by results of simulations of bacterial colony growth in a nutrient medium and characteristics of quorum sensing. Our special focus will be on visualizing patterns and identifying the Allee effect in bacterial communities.

Hence, the implementation of the derived mathematical model requires finding spatio-temporal solutions for two initial boundary value problems formulated for two systems of PDEs (5) – (14). Essential difficulties usually arise in searching for exact solutions to many classes of semilinear reaction-diffusion problems. In the context of numerical solving of PDE problems, we need numerical methods to fulfill stringent requirements related to the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Here, to solve the problem numerically, we apply the finite element method and computer simulation techniques provided by the COMSOL Multiphysics software. Using the COMSOL Multiphysics platform allows us to create a program interface intended to calculate key and estimate additional characteristics of spatial-temporal distributions of concentrations of analyzed substances. The computational blocks, computational processes, direct and feedback connections in the simulation system are reflected in the diagram forin silicostudies displayed in Fig.4.

The functional flowchart of the model implementation in COMSOL.

By construction, in order to perform computational experiments, we need to initialize the simulation parameters for a specified model object and to control the numerical solutions of differential problems using the model parameters. In the framework of the present study, we will consider the simulation of thePseudomonas putidabacterial strain evolution in a nutrient medium. We selectedPseudomonas putidaas our model organism due to its well-characterized AHL-based quorum sensing system, which shares mechanistic similarities withP. aeruginosa2–6and the availability of precisely quantified kinetic parameters from chemostat studies41essential for model parameterization. The characteristic dendritic morphology ofPseudomonas putidacolonies under nutrient-limited conditions39, coupled with its experimentally tractable quorum sensing dynamics, made it a practical choice for ourin silicoinvestigations of pattern formation..

For the nutrient growth model of the bacterial population, we performed a simulation using normalized variables and parameters. However, we set the distance scale in meters and perform simulations for a two-dimensional square areawith a linear sizem. Following comprehensive numerical validation to ensure solution stability, we established an optimal grid resolution of 5m. This spatial discretization adequately resolves both colony morphology features and substance diffusion-induced concentration gradients. That approach enables us to calculate certain saturation characteristics (the biomass and nutrient concentrations) per unit of volume. In addition, we can adjust the simulation results to data from biological experiments, for example, for the colonial pattern ofPseudomonas putidagrows up to 1 cm in linear size in 8 days39. Guided by the same principle, we empirically set the time period for modeling the processT: from several hours to 10 days.

For the bacterial quorum sensing model, we will use parameter values which most of them have been originally estimated from experiments and which have been tested many times in simpler model cases34,35,41. The simulation parameters used for computational experiments are listed in Table1.

whereis the scaling factor in a.u./;qis the parameter related to the initial value of linear size of area occupied by an inoculated colony in.

In our calculations, we specify, the biomass factor is set to, and the scaling factor= 1 a.u./by default. In addition, we comment that at each time layer, the finite element solver is accessed, the concentrations of chemical substances are calculated, and the bacterial biomass calculation data are used to specify the generation terms when calculating the AHL and lactonase concentrations. As a result, we visualize the distributions of bacterial biomass, nutrients, AHL, and lactonase concentrations to define the bacterial species and the initial and external conditions specified.

Hence, we designed a set of computational experiments to visualize the characteristics of bacterial growth ofPseudomonas putidacolonies in nutrient medium. The first simulation focuses on examining the capabilities of the Allen-Cahn model to reproduce bacterial patterns that can be attributed to the bacterial genusPseudomonas. In particular, the substantial interest is to reveal the influence of the Allee effect on modeling of bacterial morphology. The simulation results for the 2D evolution of the biomass concentration and the corresponding nutrient surface distributions are shown in Fig.5for both scenarios: the strong and weak Allee effects. Computations were performed for the constant value of the initial nutrient distributiona.u./.

The frames of bacterial growth and nutrient consumption process during 0–288 hours via the strong and the weak Allee effects.

Our findings indicate that within the initial 20-hour period, we can observe a more uniform circular spread throughout all directions of the bacterial growth for both scenarios. As approximately 20 hours elapsed, irregular growth patterns appeared in the colony and dendritic endings gradually formed. Around 50 hours later, the first set of dendrites started to bifurcate. It has been observed that when the tips of the colony dendrites reach a specific geometric size, they initiate branching. Following this principle, colonies progressively expand across the entire computational domain. It should be noted that the classical spatio-temporal logistic growth model - the Fisher-KPP equation - fails to reproduce naturalistic patterns of bacterial colonies. Instead, it simulates the area occupied by a bacterial colony as a homogeneous structure with smooth boundaries. Although biomass growth rates exhibit similar behavior in both the logistic growth model and the weak Allee effect model (as seen in Fig.2), the Fisher and Allen-Cahn models yield fundamentally different outcomes. This discrepancy arises because the Allen-Cahn model incorporates a growth threshold parameter that is sensitive to nutrient gradients.Furthermore, our simulation results (Fig.5) demonstrate that the strong Allee effect reduces nutrient consumption by approximately 30–40% relative to the weak Allee effect. This reduction occurs because the population threshold inherent to the strong Allee effect constrains colony expansion, resulting in slower bacterial population growth compared to the weak Allee regime.

The simulation results compared to experimental data for the growth of bacterial colonies ofPseudomonas putida39, suggest that the mechanisms underlying the evolution of bacterial patterns are more consistent with the weak Allee effect providing a higher growth rate. In addition to the geometry of the boundary of the bacterial pattern, we can highlight the influence of the Allee effect on the spatial distribution of biomass concentration. In the case of a strong Allee effect, the colony consumes fewer nutrients and has an almost uniform distribution over the occupied area within isolated dendritic boundaries. The influence of the weak Allee effect is expressed in the fact that diffusion processes are more pronounced, the colony consumes nutrients more actively, obtaining a high concentration in the center and occupying possible space, indicating a dendritic structure.

The model is essentially a nutrient-uptake model with an Allee effect. The diffusion of biomass and nutrients in space and time mutually influence each other, leading to periodic oscillations in local regions. Consequently, at specific simulation parameters, certain parts of the population will develop into high-biomass regions while others will correspond to low-biomass regions. Low-biomass regions will experience negative growth under the strong Allee effect until reaching zero. In contrast to the strong Allee effect, the growth rate of low-biomass regions under the weak Allee effect remains at a lower level. Simultaneously, due to the diffusion effects, high biomass and nutrient-rich areas will spread towards low-concentration areas along concentration gradients. Further, we assume here is a hypothetical situation where the environmental conditions provide the existence of a strong Allee effect. In this case, at certain parameters, bacterial concentrations diffusing into low-concentration areas never exceed the Allee threshold value. Thus, in this set of computational experiments, the dendrite interstitial biomass always equals zero.

Under the weak Allee effect and with identical parameters as those for strong Allee effects, bacterial concentrations diffusing into low-concentration areas gradually accumulate. However, due to subsequent nutrient scarcity in these areas, bacterial growth rates consistently lag behind those of original high-concentration areas.

To more clearly describe the role of the Allee effect in the growth model, we further redesigned a set of computational experiments. As we noted earlier, many models with the Allee effect in microbiological applications are formalized based on ODEs, and they do not take into account spatial heterogeneities. To emphasize the influence of the Allee effect when implementing the model, we will reduce the influence of spatial changes to a minimum. Let us conduct a series of experiments with variations in the values of the initial nutrient level,and the initial distribution of biomass. We will varyin the range from 0 to 1 a.u./(setting constant values instead of the expression (30)), choosing 50 values. For the initial nutrient distribution, we seta.u./. Further, we calculate the time derivativefor the momenth from the integral value of biomass over the entire computational domain. The dependencies of the rate of bacterial growth on parameterare shown in Fig.6for the strong Allee and the weak Allee effects.

The rate of bacterial growth as a function of the initial bacterial concentration under variation of initial nutrient concentration for: (a) the strong Allee effect, (b) the weak Allee effect.

The data obtained reveal the specific features of the Allee effect observed in microorganisms. For the strong Allee effect (Fig.6a) we have three zero points corresponding to the Allee thresholds. It is easily seen that with increasing initial nutrient concentration, colony growth occurs faster and the threshold valuedecreases significantly. The latter suggests that even small colonies have a chance to survive when the nutrient concentration is believed to be rather high. The weak Allee effect (Fig.6b) is characterized by the same tendency; only at a low level of nutrient the colony does not die out, but stagnation is observed. With high nutrient levels, small colonies also have a better chance of survival.

By the problem statement, the key control parameters for bacterial growth for the Allen-Cahn-based model are specified by the initial distribution of the bacterial biomass,, as well as the initial concentration of nutrients,. As long as spatial-temporal characteristics of bacterial quorum sensing are directly defined by the location and the population density of bacterial colonies, we will report the simulation results bearing in mind the variation of control parameters of the growth model with the weak Allee effect. Figure7shows the results of the calculation of all substances at a fixed time:h: the concentration of bacterial biomassB(x,y), the distribution of nutrientsN(x,y), the AHL concentrationu(x,y), the concentration of lactonaseL(x,y).

In the case of poor nutrients,a.u./, whena.u./the bacterial colony passes the thresholda.u./and has a chance to grow, although at a very low rate of growth. Consequently, bacterial colonies inoculated with an initial maximum biomass level of less thana.u./under poor nutrient conditions do not have a chance of survival due to the Allee effect.

The simulation results confirm that the production of AHL and lactonase is entirely dependent on the dynamic colony growth process. Rapid colony growth regions consistently showed a high concentration of AHL, while the peak concentration of lactonase lag behind AHL. This effect is caused by the fact that there is only a certain time period between the generation of AHL and the production of the lactonase enzyme, which resulted from the negative feedback starting to degrade AHL. Hence, the highest quorum corresponds to the edges of the colony due to the increased density of bacteria in this zone, as well as the delayed effect of degradation by lactonase. It can be seen that the central part of the bacterial colony with the highest bacterial density is not already characterized by such a high quorum.

To examine the behavior of the solution for various combinations of parameters, we additionally performed simulations considering substances for extended inoculation area and set. Figure8illustrates some results of the computations ofB(x,y),N(x,y),u(x,y), andL(x,y) for different values ofandat the fixed time momenth.

Characteristics of bacterial community dynamics for extended inoculation area.

The data obtained suggest that by occupying more space, the colony inoculated with a lower density (comparing the first series in Figs.7and8) survives and develops with a low velocity, but the level of quorum is lower than the colony with a higher concentration and a smaller area. At the same time, in a rich nutrient medium, even at low density (second series in Fig.8), but occupying a large area, the colony actively feeds and expands in size. Note that maximum quorum detection associated with the AHL concentration is also observed at the borders of the colony. However, the lactonase level remains maximum at the sowing boundaries. This is due to the following. Despite the general geometric shapes of the developing colonies, with a high initial concentration, the colony retains the maximum level of biomass in the center. A low initial concentration results in the occupation by the population of new areas, and in this case the highest concentration of biomass is observed only at the border of an inoculation area and dendritic endings.

The paper summarizes the results of developing the theoretical framework and computational techniques for modeling the evolution patterns of bacterial communities in nutrient media. We have developed a coupled approach that combines an Allen-Cahn equation-based model for bacterial population growth in view of the Allee effect, a biomass-dependent model for changes in nutrient concentration, and a reaction-diffusion model to describe bacterial quorum sensing.

The most important advantage of our study is a new approach that hybridizes the modified Allen-Cahn, nutrient consumption, and bacterial quorum sensing models, fundamentally substantiated and applied to describe the evolution of bacterial communities that experimentally indicate the Allee effect. Based on ideas of the core framework of the existence of a growth threshold for the evolution of a bacterial population, we formalized a deterministic model in the form of an initial boundary-value problem for a system of PDEs and established its unique solvability.

The general mathematical model was implemented using the COMSOL Multiphysics platform by means a finite element method, withPseudomonasstrains as research subjects to calculate the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of key substances in biological systems under different scenarios. The results of computational experiments indicate that our approach can be used to visualize dendritic patterns during the evolution of bacterial colonies in a nutrient medium. A visual comparison of bacterial patterns with experimental data confirms that the threshold growth model with a weak Allee effect is more consistent with the current observed structures. In this way, the proposed model can be used to estimate the characteristics of spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterial patterns, as well as the conditions for optimal population survival under the influence of the Allee effect. We conducted simulations of the evolution of bacterial biomass, nutrients, and characteristics of bacterial communication under a variation of key control model parameters. Our findings demonstrate that the most important parameter that determines the possibility of survival is the concentration of nutrients. When the nutrient level is low, the colony must have high concentrations to survive. In a rich-nutrient medium, a colony that occupies a small area with high density grows actively with a high biomass density in the center, while a colony occupying a large area has a high density only at the borders. The level of bacterial communication is very high only at the borders of the colony.

It was noted that, in the framework of the present study, the proposed model includes estimations of quorum-sensing characteristics for a given spatial distribution of biomass (without considering possible feedback). The mechanism of changes in the bacterial biomass concentration regulated via quorum sensing, i.e. due to the auto-inducer concentration, still requires further investigation in terms of formalization, analysis, and further application.

This study makes an important contribution to mathematical biology by developing a comprehensive framework that formally incorporates the Allee effect - a phenomenon experimentally documented in microorganisms and previously modeled using Allen-Cahn-type approaches - into bacterial population dynamics. The core paradigm of our work was to establish a complete mathematical apparatus for modeling Allee effects during bacterial growth in nutrient media. We achieved this through the novel integration of three key components: the Allen-Cahn model, biomass consumption dynamics, and bacterial quorum sensing, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis of the deterministic system and verification of its mathematical validity. While our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed branching morphological structures, detailed analysis of fractal geometry characteristics under varying nutrient conditions and other factors remains an important direction for future investigation. The presented approach provides a foundation for unifying reaction-diffusion principles with other aspects of microbial nonlinear dynamics, highlighting the essential synergy between computational modeling and biological experimentation in advancing our understanding of complex bacterial ecosystems.
