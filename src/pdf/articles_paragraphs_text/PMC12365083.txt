The Internet of Things (IoT) presents significant advantages to day-to-day life across a wide range of application domains, including healthcare automation, transportation, and smart environments. However, owing to the constraints of limited resources and computation abilities, IoT networks are subject to different cyber-attacks. Incorporating IDS into the cybersecurity-driven IIoT process contains cautious deployment, planning, and progressing management. Cybersecurity is crucial for the protection of sensitive data, safeguarding the privacy of users, and securing important substructures from malicious activities attempting unauthorized access or triggering interferences. Cyberattack detection performs a vital role in this defense scheme, employing advanced technologies like deep learning (DL) for analysing digital activities in real time. With the help of recognizing and responding to possible cyber-attacks quickly, cyberattack detection not only mitigates risks but reinforces the overall flexibility of the digital ecosystem against developing security challenges. This study presents a League Championship Algorithm Feature Selection with Optimal Deep Learning based Cyberattack Detection (CLAFS-ODLCD) technique for securing the digital ecosystem. The CLAFS-ODLCD technique focuses on the recognition and classification of cyberattacks in the IoT infrastructure. To achieve this, the CLAFS-ODLCD method utilizes the linear scaling normalization (LSN) approach for data pre-processing. Furthermore, the CLAFS-ODLCD method employs the CLAFS approach to choose optimal feature subset. Moreover, the detection and classification of the cyberattacks are accomplished by implementing the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) approach. Finally, the hunger games search (HGS) optimizer is employed for optimum hyperparameter selection. The empirical analysis of the CLAFS-ODLCD method is examined under the WSN-DS dataset.

The IoT is a developing paradigm, which allows the relationship of computing capabilities and physical objects to link the Internet. The IoT can aid in to construction of efficient and flexible applications in numerous fields namely environmental monitoring, health care, and industrialized controlled processes1. While IoT can improve efficiency and productivity over intellectual and remote management, additionally it improves the cyber-attack risks. In most sectors, the IIoT can significantly raise operational efficiency, efficacy, and productivity. The IIoT will primarily improve current facilities and processes, then the ultimate goal is to generate unique and enormously improved goods and services. Various concerns identify how and where IIoT inventions and resolutions can lead to administrative changes, new and enhanced goods and services, and completely novel business models. The consideration of a digital ecosystem has a place on products or services about which partners, clients, and providers are gathered and interact2. The collaborations are sustained by a central digital environment and different ecosystem services thereby all companies will perform across businesses. These network impacts must be reinforced in whole industries and confirm more cooperation3. The advantages and connections to a digital ecosystem is individual and dependent upon the necessities of the system. Furthermore, industrial sector, ecosystems are progressively forming themselves along the business’s individual value chain. The attention here is on making a digital space for sharing, like transferring the data in real-time, and also capable of making business important decisions especially rapid and reliant on the evidence. Digital ecosystems are based on the sharing of data4. When implemented both utilization data and individual data is produced that should be protected. Data sovereignty and data security are then a main domain of digital ecosystems. The combination of extensive categories of users, all worked with customized access and IT systems, making a heterogeneous IT platform that provides various attack surfaces for cybercrime5. The IT security technique should be varied and complex as the method of operation of possible attackers. Both cyberattack crime and cyberattack terror have improved exponentially6. To help protect lives and ensure responsible use, it is recommended to establish ethical guidelines for the virtual world that align with real-world standards and values. Additionally, new security measures is needed to protect the private domain in the virtual world. This study presents a review of cyberattack detection. Cyberattacks are activities that effort to avoid security measures of computer systems7. Cyberattack detection is defined as “the difficulty of identifying the persons who will utilize a computer system without authorization and those who have authentic access to the system however, exploiting their privileges. Various techniques could be employed for attack detection that are widely considered into three main types anomaly-, hybrid-, and misuse-based detection. Misuse-based detection must be scanned by predetermined attack signatures and primarily employed for recognizing the known attacks8. This is beneficial to identify the known attacks with decreased false alarms rate (FAR). It needs a particular alteration of the signature and directions of attacks under the dataset. The anomaly-based method is proficient in recognizing both the attack categories such as unknown or known9. It will capture the network and host machine behavior and then find the anomalies as obtained from normal behavior. It is the major prevalent technique as it will identify the zero-day attacks. Several advantages of employing this approach, and among them is the modification of profiling activities because of which attackers become jumbled about which activities they follow to arrive and endure unidentified10. Apart from the advantages, there are also the limitations it assesses with higher FAR and the legitimate activities referred to as an anomaly in rare cases.

This study presents a League Championship Algorithm Feature Selection with Optimal Deep Learning based Cyberattack Detection (CLAFS-ODLCD) technique for securing the digital ecosystem. The CLAFS-ODLCD technique focuses on the recognition and classification of cyberattacks in the IoT infrastructure. To achieve this, the CLAFS-ODLCD method utilizes the linear scaling normalization (LSN) approach for data pre-processing. Furthermore, the CLAFS-ODLCD method employs the CLAFS approach to choose optimal feature subset.

Finally, the hunger games search (HGS) optimizer is employed for optimum hyperparameter selection. The empirical analysis of the CLAFS-ODLCD method is examined under the WSN-DS dataset. The major contribution of the CLAFS-ODLCD method is listed below.

This strategy was dependent upon the edge network of AI-assisted security modules for IoT emergency response. These introduced methods employed the idea of the cyberspace killing chain. Moreover, every challenge in the edge layer was distributed by incorporating AI security components into a distinct layer of AI-SM-IoT provided by services. Rajaee and Mazlumi16examined an innovative robust technique, named as multi-agent distributed DL (MADDL) technique, the protective model with numerous distance relays is mapped into the multi-agent distributed model by applying the graph model. The DNN as a cyberattack detection model was supposed for all the agents. Therefore, the detection models were altered by exploiting trained data, attained by simulating the grid in diverse categories of errors. In17, the multi-step deep q learning network (MSDQN)-based DL method is proposed. The DL technique was implemented in the authentication procedure for identifying authenticated IoT devices and avoiding intermediary attacks among them. Alternatively, the MSDQN was connected to identify and lessen malware attacks and DDoS attacks in data transmission among diverse positions. Sikder et al.18introduced empirical AI-based techniques.

Despite crucial improvements, existing models encounter challenges related to high computational complexity, limited scalability, and insufficient adaptability to dynamic IIoT environments. Various models depend heavily on centralized frameworks, which may introduce latency and single points of failure. Furthermore, the interpretability of DL-based IDS remains limited, mitigating trust in critical applications. IoT device constraints additionally restrict the deployment of complex models, resulting in suboptimal real-time detection. Moreover, few methods comprehensively address multi-layered security risks across heterogeneous IoT networks. The research gap is in developing lightweight, interpretable, and scalable IDS solutions capable of efficient detection under resource constraints while maintaining robustness against evolving cyber threats in diverse IIoT settings. Addressing this research gap requires innovative integration of optimized DL techniques with decentralized frameworks for improving security without compromising the performance or usability of the system.

In this work, a CLAFS-ODLCD model for securing the digital ecosystem is proposed. The CLAFS-ODLCD technique focuses on the recognition and classification of cyberattacks in the IoT infrastructure. To achieve this, the CLAFS-ODLCD technique involves various types of sub-processes namely LSN-based data normalization, CLA-based feature selection subset, SSAE-based classification, and HGS-based hyperparameter tuning. Figure1illustrates the working flow of the CLAFS-ODLCD technique.

Initially, the CLAFS-ODLCD technique utilizes the LSN approach for data pre-processing. LSN is a data normalization method implemented in diverse domains, comprising ML and statistics for scaling and standardizing the numerical values within a particular range. Unlike some normalization techniques that target to center data about the mean or median, LSN linearly scales the input data to a predetermined interval at the range [0, 1] or [− 1, 1]. This procedure supports keeping the original correlation between data points when ensuring that the values are reliable and interpretable level. LSN is mainly beneficial in conditions wherein the absolute magnitude of data will not be important then, maintaining comparative variances is needed, providing more stable and efficient analyses in numerous applications.

The CLAFS-ODLCD technique utilizes the CLAFS technique to choose an optimal subset of features. A new metaheuristic technique for solving continuous optimization problems, the CLA method was introduced by Kashan29. The team (each person) in the swarm ofteams (leagues) has the feasible solution to the problem withplayers equivalent to the amount of variables. Teamtakes playing strength respective to the fitness rate following the construction of fake weekly league schedules. Based on this, the club plays together in pairs forweek wheredenotes the week andindicates the number of seasons. Playing outcomes define who wins and who loses. Based on the outcome of prior weeks, all sides form a new team match to prepare for the upcoming match. Under the direction of team formation, the configuration of the best team is selected with better playing strength and replaced by effective team formation.

The initial phase is to prepare the schedule that involves games for all the seasons. Each team plays together once the season under the round‐robin schedule.competition exists, andmust be the even integer. Then, the competition goes on forseasons. The CLA constructs an 8‐teamsports league.

Based on the standard playing strength, a winner and loser is selected, with playing strengthandand formation, correspondingly,andteams participating atweeks are considered.represents the probability thatteam will outdoteam inweek.

In Eq. (1), the best team global team formation is denoted as. Also, The probability thatteams can overcometeam is simultaneously defined by the random numbers within). If the number is greater thanloses andwins. if the outcome is lesser than or equivalent tothen teamwins, and teamloses.

Based on the league schedule, the club that played withteams inweeks, withteams in week, and, withteams inweeks, correspondingly, are represented by, and. Assume, andas the best team configuration for, andteams atweeks, correspondingly. It can affirm that forteams to overcometeams,teams should come up with a playing style akin to that employed byteams atweeks, based on the strength ofteams, whichrepresents the gap vector amongst the playing strategy ofandteams. Likewise, it steers clear of adopting the playing strategy that is analogous toteams while concentrating on the deficiency of the team. The information of the gap vector is integrated with constant parameters,‐approach, and‐retreat, for generating a new team. The approach parameter is employed onceteam desires to go toward the rival. In contrast, the retreat parameter is employed ifteam distances itself from the competitor.

The swarm‐based technique was used to accomplish a globally optimal solution. The CLA can easily get stuck in local optimal solutions despite its effectiveness and simplicity, resulting in an imbalance in local exploitation and global exploration.

In the CLA model, the objective is combined into single objective thus weight finds the objective importance30.

In Eq. (2),is the fitness value ofsubset, andare the weights of classifier error rate and the reduction ratio,and.indicates the classifier error using the attributes selected in thesubset,andare the amount of attributes selected and the amount of attributes in the original data correspondingly.

In this phase, the detection and classification of the cyberattacks are performed by using the SSAE approach31. This model is chosen for its robust capability in learning deep hierarchical feature representations and detecting subtle and intrinsic attack patterns compared to conventional methods. This model also effectually mitigates noise and irrelevant data, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy and generalization. The technique also utilizes dropout regularization and early stopping strategies for addressing overfitting, ensuring the model does not memorize the training data but generalizes well to unseen samples. Furthermore, class imbalance is handled through techniques such as weighted loss functions or data augmentation, allowing SSAE to maintain robust performance across minority attack classes, which is significant for reliable intrusion detection in cybersecurity environments. Figure2illustrates the infrastructure of SSAE.

An autoencoder (AE) is an unsupervised learning method that mechanically absorbs the raw feature data and contains three layers namely HL, output, and input.

The above-mentioned formula is the SAE loss function. Where the 1st term denotes the function of MSE and the 2nd term refers to the sparse penalty term.

Finally, the HGS optimizer is employed for the optimum hyperparameter selection. HGS is a population-reliant optimizer model that has resolved restricted and free issues while maintaining the feature32. The sub-sections define the numerous steps in an algorithm of HGS.
