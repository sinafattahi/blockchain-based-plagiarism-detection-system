The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) is a novel lipid parameter calculated as the logarithmic ratio of triglycerides (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Initially proposed as a marker for predicting cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerosis, AIP has more recently been found to be closely associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and the development of type 2 diabetes(T2DM). However, its role in women with a history of GDM, a unique high-risk population, remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the AIP and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prevalence in women with a history of GDM.

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 4,690 parous women from the 2007–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), with participants stratified by GDM history. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the association between the AIP and T2DM among women with a history of GDM. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed within the GDM group to explore effect modification. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were used to assess the linearity of the association between the AIP and T2DM prevalence. Mediation analysis was also conducted to examine whether the AIP score mediated the relationship between GDM history and T2DM.

Among women with a history of GDM, higher AIP values were significantly associated with increased T2DM prevalence. A dose-response relationship was observed across AIP quartiles, with women in the highest quartile showing a markedly elevated risk (adjusted OR = 5.01, 95% CI: 1.89, 13.25,p< 0.01). RCS analysis revealed a linear association between AIP and T2DM in this population. Mediation analysis further revealed that the AIP partially mediated the association between GDM and T2DM, accounting for 8.0% of the total effect (95% CI: 5.1–12.5%).

AIP is associated with T2DM prevalence in women with a history of GDM. These findings indicate that the AIP may serve as a potential early indicator for identifying individuals at elevated risk of progressing from GDM to T2DM.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a form of glucose intolerance first identified during pregnancy, is one of the most common metabolic disorders in pregnant women and is typically diagnosed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [1]. Women with GDM often exhibit pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, which limits their ability to compensate for the progressively increasing insulin resistance that occurs during late pregnancy. This dysfunction primarily manifests as postprandial hyperglycemia [2,3]. Impaired β-cell function not only underlies the development of GDM but also significantly contributes to the progression to prediabetes and ultimately T2DM. Although hyperglycemia often resolves after delivery, β-cell function continues to decline, with worsening insulin sensitivity and compensatory capacity. As a result, women with prior GDM are more likely to transition from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and then to T2DM over time [4,5]. Studies have shown that more than half of women with GDM eventually develop T2DM, typically within five years postpartum [6]. Compared with women without GDM, those with a history of GDM have a 7- to 10-fold increased risk of developing T2DM [7,8].

Dyslipidemia is a key metabolic abnormality that contributes to the development and progression of T2DM [9]. Abnormal lipid profiles, including elevated triglycerides (TGs), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increased levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), can exacerbate insulin resistance, impair pancreatic β-cell function, and promote chronic low-grade inflammation [10,11]. These mechanisms collectively drive glucose dysregulation and accelerate the transition from normoglycemia to T2DM. In individuals with a history of GDM, dyslipidemia is often more pronounced due to preexisting metabolic disturbances and postpartum weight retention. Therefore, in women with a history of GDM, identifying and addressing dyslipidemia is essential for the early prevention and precise management of T2DM [12].

The AIP is a novel lipid parameter calculated as the logarithmic ratio of TG to HDL-C levels. Initially proposed as a marker for predicting cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerosis, AIP has more recently been found to be closely associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and the development of T2DM [13]. While the TG/HDL-C ratio provides a straightforward assessment of dyslipidemia, it may fail to accurately reflect lipid profiles in extreme cases, such as with elevated triglycerides or low HDL-C levels. The AIP optimizes this parameter by applying a logarithmic transformation to the TG/HDL-C ratio, potentially offering enhanced sensitivity and accuracy in evaluating the risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes compared to traditional ratios [14]. Recent studies have confirmed the association between AIP and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), diabetes, and prediabetes [15–20]. Although existing studies have confirmed that the AIP has been shown to be associated with GDM in the general population, its role in the unique high-risk population of women with a history of GDM has not yet been explored. This study aimed to investigate the potential association between the AIP and the incidence of T2DM among women with a history of GDM using data from the NHANES.

The NHANES, led by the National Centers for Health Statistics (NCHS), evaluates the health and dietary conditions of different populations in the United States. Its protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the National Centers for Health Statistics and met strict ethical standards and all participants provided informed consent. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines ensure that the NHANES survey weights are used for appropriate statistical analysis to account for its complex sampling design. More details can be found at:https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx.

This research employed NHANES 2007–2018 cycles to identify eligible participants. During this period, a total of 30,213 women were surveyed. The exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnant women with a positive urine pregnancy test; nulliparous women (parity = 0); and individuals with missing data on GDM, T2DM, or AIP. After applying these criteria, 4,690 subjects composed the analytical sample (Fig.1).

AIP was derived by taking the base-10 logarithm of the fasting triglyceride-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, expressed mathematically as AIP = log₁₀(TG/HDL-C) [14]. Following CDC-approved protocols, HDL cholesterol concentrations in serum were determined through either direct immunoassay or precipitation-based analysis. To evaluate triglyceride levels, venous blood samples were drawn from subjects after an overnight fast [15].

The diagnosis of a history of GDM was identified through participants’ responses to the questionnaire item RHQ162 in the reproductive health section. Those who responded affirmatively were categorized as having prior GDM. Although we do not have records of clinician diagnosis of GDM during prior pregnancies in NHANES, published validation studies comparing maternal recall of GDM history 2–10 years post-partum, with chart review, showed 70–100% sensitivity and 90–98% specificity [21–23].

T2DM was assessed using multiple diagnostic indicators: Self-reported questionnaires such as whether a doctor had diagnosed the participant with diabetes (DIQ010), current use of oral diabetes medications (DIQ050), or insulin therapy (DIQ070). The diagnostic criteria from the American Diabetes Association [24] include hemoglobin A1c levels at or above 6.5%, fasting blood glucose levels exceeding 7.0 mmol/L, or oral glucose tolerance test results ≥ 11.1 mmol/L at the two-hour mark. Participants meeting one or more of these criteria were considered to have diabetes.

On the basis of previous research and clinical insights, the following covariates were identified [16,17,25]: age, race (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and other race), education level (less than high school, high school graduate or equivalent, and more than high school education), marital status(married, never married, other), poverty-income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI), smoke (never, former, current), alcohol (never, former, current), hypertension (yes, no), FPG, HbA1c, insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL-C, TC, triglycerides and AIP.

All the statistical analyses were conducted using R software 4.2.2 and EmpowerStats 4.0. To minimize bias from missing data, multiple imputations were performed using the random forest method. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the baseline characteristics. Normally distributed continuous variables are reported as the means ± standard deviations, whereas skewed variables are presented as medians with interquartile ranges. Group differences were assessed using the t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages and were compared using the chi-square test. Univariate logistic regression was employed to examine the associations between individual variables and T2DM among women with and without a history of GDM. The relationship between the AIP and T2DM was assessed using both continuous AIP values and quartiles stratified by GDM status. Associations are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Stratified multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effect of the AIP on T2DM risk using three models: Model 1 (unadjusted); Model 2 (adjusted for age and race); and Model 3 (further adjusted for education, marital status, BMI, PIR, smoking status, alcohol use, hypertension, LDL-C, and TC). Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted to assess heterogeneity across strata. Stratification factors included age (< 35 years and ≥ 35 years), race (Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Other Race), education level (less than high school, high school graduate or equivalent, and more than high school education), marital status (Married, Never married, Other), poverty-income ratio (PIR) (< 1.5, 1.5–3.5, and ≥ 3.5), body mass index (BMI) (< 25, 25–30, and ≥ 30), smoking status (Never、Former、Current), alcohol consumption (Never、Former、Current), hypertension (yes, no). RCS regression was used to evaluate the dose‒response relationship between the AIP and T2DM in women with prior GDM. A two-piecewise linear regression model was applied to explore potential thresholds or nonlinear associations. Finally, causal mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether the AIP mediated the relationship between GDM history and T2DM. A two-sidedpvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the six NHANES cycles, sample weights were calculated by dividing the MEC examination weight (WTMEC2YR) by 6.

The final analysis included 4,690 female participants, with 1,126 (18.7%) diagnosed with T2DM. Baseline characteristics were broken down on the basis of GDM (Table1). Compared with those without a history of GDM, women with a history of GDM had a significantly greater prevalence of T2DM (36.8% vs. 17.4%,P< 0.001), which suggests that a history of GDM might be a risk factor for T2DM, irrespective of other influences. Compared with women who had never experienced GDM, those with a GDM history tended to be younger, were more likely to identify as Mexican American, and were more often married. They also presented higher BMIs, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and triglyceride levels, along with lower levels of HDL-C and AIP (allP< 0.05). However, there were no notable differences between the two groups concerning PIR, educational attainment, smoking habits, alcohol intake, prevalence of hypertension, insulin levels, LDL-C, or TC.

Further stratified analysis of baseline characteristics among women with a history of GDM was conducted according to diabetes status (Table2). Compared with nondiabetic participants, those with T2DM were significantly older (mean age 50.46 vs. 43.39 years,P< 0.001) and had a higher BMI (33.30 vs. 28.91,P< 0.001). The racial distribution differed significantly between the groups (P= 0.001), with a greater proportion of Mexican Americans (17.8% vs. 11.2%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (16.3% vs. 9.2%) in the T2DM group. Participants with T2DM also presented poorer metabolic profiles, including elevated fasting plasma glucose (7.28 vs. 5.45 mmol/L), HbA1c (6.70% vs. 5.50%), and insulin levels (85 vs. 52 pmol/L). Additionally, they had lower HDL-C levels (1.29 vs. 1.40 mmol/L,P= 0.038), higher triglyceride levels (1.47 vs. 1.05 mmol/L,P< 0.001), and significantly higher AIP values (0.10 vs. -0.12,P< 0.001). The prevalence of hypertension was also markedly greater in the T2DM group (61.0% vs. 27.4%,P< 0.001). The alcohol consumption patterns differed significantly between the groups (P= 0.039). However, no significant differences in PIR, education level, marital status, smoking status, LDL-C, or total cholesterol (TC) were detected between the two groups.

This study investigated the link between T2DM and a previous diagnosis of GDM by comparing women with and without a history of GDM (Table3). The analysis revealed that among those who had experienced GDM, several key factors were strongly tied to the onset of T2DM: advanced age, a higher BMI, preexisting hypertension, elevated HbA1c readings, and increased triglyceride levels. Additionally, being Non-Hispanic White and current alcohol consumption were associated with a lower prevalence of T2DM in this group. However, these associations may be confounded by lifestyle and nutritional factors, which warrants further investigation. In females with no prior GDM history, a lower PIR, lower education level, unmarried status, and reduced levels of both LDL-C and HDL-C were significantly associated with a higher T2DM prevalence. Elevated triglyceride levels were also strongly associated with increased T2DM in this population.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant positive association between AIP and T2DM risk in women both with and without a history of GDM (Table4). Among women with a history of GDM, higher AIP levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of T2DM. When treated as a continuous variable, AIP was significantly associated with T2DM across all three models, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 7.47 (3.49–15.98) in Model 1, 9.54 (4.09–22.23) in Model 2, and 8.13 (2.72–24.35) in Model 3 (allP< 0.001), indicating that AIP is a robust predictor of T2DM in this population. Further analysis by AIP quartiles revealed that only participants in the highest quartile (Q4: AIP 0.099–1.787) had a significantly increased risk of T2DM across all the models (OR range: 4.19–5.01, allP< 0.01). In contrast, AIP levels in the second (Q2) and third (Q3) quartiles were not significantly associated with T2DM risk (P> 0.05). Additionally, a significant dose–response trend was observed (Pfor trend < 0.0001), reinforcing the potential role of elevated AIP in promoting the progression from GDM to T2DM. In comparison, among women without a history of GDM, the AIP was also positively associated with T2DM risk, although the increase appeared more gradual. T2DM risk increased progressively across AIP quartiles, and all quartile-based associations remained statistically significant in multivariable models (allP< 0.0001), with a consistent trend observed (Pfor trend < 0.0001). This comparison suggests that elevated AIP may have greater predictive value for T2DM in women with a prior history of GDM, particularly when AIP levels reach the highest quartile.

To evaluate the robustness of our multiple regression findings, we utilized an RCS approach to examine the link between AIP and T2DM in women who had experienced GDM. The analysis revealed a clear, dose-dependent positive correlation between AIP levels and T2DM risk in this cohort (P-overall < 0.001) but showed no indication of a nonlinear association (P-nonlinear = 0.111), as illustrated in Fig.2. This finding aligns with the progressively increasing ORs observed in the logistic regression analysis.

Subgroup analyses and interaction tests revealed variations in the association between AIP and T2DM prevalence among women with a history of GDM (Fig.3). The relationship between elevated AIP and increased T2DM risk was more pronounced in subgroups including participants aged ≥ 35 years, non-Hispanic Black individuals, those with low PIR, high BMI, higher education levels, nonmarried status, current smokers, and alcohol consumers (P< 0.05). However, no significant interaction effects were detected across subgroups (P> 0.05), indicating that the overall trend of the association between higher AIP and increased T2DM risk remained consistent across different strata. These subgroup findings should be interpreted as exploratory and warrant further validation in future studies.

Mediation analysis was performed to investigate whether the AIP mediates the relationship between a history of GDM and the prevalence of T2DM (Fig.4). The total effect of GDM on T2DM was significant (adjustedβ = 0.29573,p< 0.001), as was the direct effect after adjusting for the AIP (adjusted β = 0.27203,p< 0.001). Importantly, the indirect effect mediated through the AIP was also statistically significant (adjusted β = 0.02370,p< 0.001), indicating that the AIP partially mediates the association. The proportion of the total effect mediated by AIP was estimated at 8.0% (95% CI: 5.1–12.5%).

In this large-scale study of 4,690 women, the AIP emerged as an independent predictor of T2DM among those with a history of GDM. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between the AIP and the transition from GDM to T2DM. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant positive association between elevated AIP levels and the prevalence of T2DM in this population, even after adjusting for multiple confounding factors. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests further supported the robustness of the association between the AIP and T2DM among women with a history of GDM. The RCS analysis revealed a positive linear relationship between the AIP score and the risk of T2DM in this population, with no significant evidence of nonlinearity. Moreover, mediation analysis revealed that the AIP partially mediated the association between a history of GDM and the development of T2DM.

GDM is regarded as a temporary manifestation of chronic metabolic dysfunction, with affected individuals frequently exhibiting ongoing disturbances in blood glucose and lipid metabolism even postpartum [26]. Several studies have shown that women with a history of GDM tend to present elevated levels of FPG, TC, LDL-C and TG, along with reduced levels of HDL-C [27–29]. These findings align with our study results. All of these metabolic factors are strongly associated with the development of T2DM [30].

Our study further reinforces this association, demonstrating that women with a history of GDM face a significantly greater risk of developing T2DM than do those without such a history. Although the exact mechanisms by which the AIP influences T2DM prevalence in this population remain unclear, several hypotheses can be drawn from the literature. Women with a history of GDM often experience a persistent decline in pancreatic β-cell function, more rapid deterioration of β-cell compensation and insulin sensitivity, elevated blood glucose and TG levels, and reduced HDL-C levels, all of which place them at high risk of developing T2DM. Dyslipidemia is closely associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Adipose tissue expansion and excessive free fatty acid release contribute to hepatic fat accumulation, particularly increased TC synthesis. The resulting residual cholesterol (RC) can activate macrophages, triggering inflammation and oxidative stress [31–33]. Prolonged inflammation exacerbates insulin resistance and impairs β-cell function [34]. Second, elevated TG levels increase the production of free fatty acids and abnormal lipid signaling molecules, which impair insulin signaling in pancreatic α-cells and result in excessive glucagon secretion [35,36]. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, increasing hepatic glucose output and impairing glucose tolerance [37]. In addition, HDL is essential for reverse cholesterol transport and cellular cholesterol efflux. Reduced HDL levels can impair these processes, leading to cholesterol buildup in pancreatic β-cells, which contributes to β-cell dysfunction, decreased insulin secretion, and increased apoptosis [37–41]. HDL also affects glucose homeostasis by decreasing insulin sensitivity and suppressing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity [42–44], thereby contributing to hyperglycemia. These mechanisms offer a plausible pathophysiological explanation for the association between AIP and the progression from GDM to T2DM.

Subgroup analysis revealed that women with a history of GDM faced a greater risk of developing T2DM if they were aged ≥ 35 years, were non-Hispanic Black, had a low PIR, had an elevated BMI, had higher educational attainment, were unmarried, or reported current smoking or alcohol use. Age-stratified analysis confirmed increased vulnerability among those ≥ 35 years, which is consistent with USPSTF data showing a sharp increase in diabetes and prediabetes in this age group [45]. Aging promotes adipose tissue senescence, lipid redistribution, and chronic inflammation, all of which contribute to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance [46]. The AIP–T2DM association varied by race/ethnicity, with the strongest link observed in Non-Hispanic Black women, aligning with prior reports identifying this group as having the highest post-GDM diabetes risk [47]. Potential contributors include disparities in insulin sensitivity, obesity prevalence, triglyceride levels, and fat distribution patterns [48]. Low PIR was also associated with greater T2DM risk, potentially due to high-carbohydrate diets, limited fat intake, and elevated psychosocial stress, all of which can aggravate insulin resistance and dyslipidemia [49], Notably, both low and high education levels were linked to increased T2DM risk. Lower education is often tied to reduced health literacy and limited access to preventive care [50], whereas the stronger association among highly educated individuals may reflect more accurate self-reports and earlier disease identification, despite non-significant statistical interactions [51]. BMI emerged as a significant modifier: the AIP was most strongly associated with T2DM among obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), emphasizing the role of weight management in T2DM prevention [52]. In individuals with obesity, proinflammatory adipokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 impair insulin sensitivity and stimulate triglyceride production, promoting metabolic dysfunction [53]. Current alcohol consumption and smoking further increase T2DM risk. Although moderate alcohol intake may improve insulin sensitivity [54], its net effect in this context appears harmful. Smoking disrupts lipid metabolism by increasing TG and oxidized LDL-C, while decreasing HDL-C levels [55]. Nicotine-induced sympathetic activation elevates FFA release and hepatic VLDL production, thereby worsening triglyceridemic, impairing insulin signaling, and fostering systemic inflammation [56–59]. These subgroup findings highlight the multifactorial nature of T2DM risk following GDM, and recognizing these heterogeneous risk profiles is essential for targeted prevention strategies and individualized clinical management of women with a history of GDM. Additionally, the results of the mediation analysis indicate that 8% of the effect of GDM on T2DM could be attributed to changes in AIP, reflecting lipid metabolism disturbances. This partial mediation underscores the AIP as a potential intermediate marker in the GDM-T2DM pathway, emphasizing the clinical importance of monitoring atherogenic lipid profiles in women with a history of GDM for postnatal diabetes prevention.

The AIP is a simple and effective biomarker that can be easily calculated from routine lipid profiles, indicating strong clinical utility and applicability. The incorporation of the AIP as a routine screening indicator in the postpartum management of women with a history of GDM may facilitate the early identification of metabolic risk. Regular monitoring of AIP levels in this high-risk population could enable timely intervention, particularly through nonpharmacological approaches such as lifestyle modification, dietary improvements, and increased physical activity. These measures may help improve metabolic health and reduce the risk of progression to T2DM.

This study presents several notable strengths that enhance the validity and impact of its findings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between AIP and the prevalence of T2DM among women with a history of GDM using data from the NHANES database. The application of sampling weights in the statistical analysis enhances the generalizability and national representativeness of the findings. Additionally, we conducted univariate analysis, multivariable logistic regression, RCS curve analysis, subgroup analysis, interaction testing, and mediation analysis, all of which contribute to the robustness and reliability of the results. By adjusting for multiple covariates, we effectively controlled for potential confounding factors, improving the credibility and broader applicability of our findings.

Despite these strengths, several limitations should be acknowledged. As a cross-sectional study, it cannot establish causality but only suggests an association between the AIP and an increased risk of T2DM among women with a history of GDM. Although multiple statistical models and covariate adjustments were implemented, residual confounding due to unmeasured variables may still exist. Additionally, the relatively small sample size of women with prior GDM limits the statistical power and generalizability to this subpopulation. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive assessments of confounders are warranted to validate and expand upon these findings. Another important limitation is that the history of GDM was determined through self-reported questionnaires rather than clinical records or diagnoses, introducing the potential for recall bias or misclassification. This could lead to non-differential misclassification, which may bias the observed associations.

Currently, no biomarker has been established for clinical risk stratification of T2DM following GDM. Our findings demonstrate a significant association between the AIP and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. These findings indicate that the AIP may serve as a potential early indicator for identifying individuals at elevated risk of progressing from gestational diabetes toT2DM. AIP could contribute to future risk prediction models. However, before clinical application, prospective validation in large, diverse cohorts is needed to determine whether elevated AIP levels causally contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in this population. Such studies will not only validate our current findings but also support the development of postpartum health management strategies and personalized therapeutic approaches for women with a history of GDM.

We extend our sincere gratitude to all the dedicated staff and participants involved in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for their invaluable contributions to this research endeavor.
