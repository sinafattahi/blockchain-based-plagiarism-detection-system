To investigate the differential efficacy of various treatment modalities adjunct to surgical excision of keloids and to analyze prognostic factors influencing outcomes.

A retrospective observational study approach was employed. Clinical data from 121 patients with keloids who met the inclusion criteria were collected for analysis of clinical characteristics and evaluation of treatment efficacy. The patients were categorized into three groups based on the adjuvant treatment modalities utilized post-surgical excision of keloids: surgical + radiotherapy group (group A), surgical + radiotherapy + pharmacological injection group (group B), and surgical group (group C). Factors potentially influencing treatment outcomes—such as treatment modality, gender, age, lesion distribution, lesion size, duration of the condition, and prior treatments—were subjected to a statistical analysis. Significant risk factors were identified through univariate analysis.

The efficacy rates for group A, group B, and group C were 93.88%, 87.04%, and 55.56%, respectively. Statistical analysis indicated that age and treatment modality were significant risk factors for recurrence.

The application of radiotherapy post-surgery, or a combination of radiotherapy and pharmacological injections postoperatively, has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the recurrence rate of keloids. Conversely, the efficacy of treatments that solely rely on surgery is comparatively lower. For elderly patients, early intervention upon the manifestation of clinical symptoms is strongly advocated, with a preference for adjunctive postoperative radiotherapy to mitigate the risk of recurrence.

Keloids represent a benign fibroproliferative skin condition characterized by scar-like appearances, which can continuously encroach upon surrounding healthy skin, exhibiting benign tumor-like growth properties. The etiology of most keloids is attributed to dermal injuries stemming from trauma, surgical interventions, and other insults to the skin organ, although a subset of the population may develop keloids spontaneously without any apparent external provocations [1]. Despite being benign, keloids manifest a unique growth pattern akin to tumors, and without intervention, they proliferate incessantly, often leading to localized symptoms such as itching, pain, and infection, significantly impairing quality of life. Historical studies indicate that the recurrence rate post-surgical intervention alone ranges from 45–100% [2], whereas radiotherapy has been acknowledged in multiple reports for its efficacy in reducing keloid recurrence rates [3–5]. Corticosteroids are currently widely utilized in keloid treatment, often regarded as the first-line medication [6]. Other commonly employed injectable agents include 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, verapamil, and botulinum toxin, albeit with varying reported outcomes [7]. Presently, the prevailing clinical treatment strategies encompass local injections, local radiotherapy, and surgical excision to eliminate keloids.With the continuous refinement of keloid treatment plans, combination therapies have become the preferred approach for improving treatment efficacy. Our hospital has transitioned from initial surgical monotherapy to adopting multimodal strategies that integrate adjuvant intralesional injections and/or localized radiotherapy postoperatively to prevent keloid recurrence. Consequently, surgical excision as a standalone treatment is no longer recommended in current clinical practice. Nevertheless, the optimal postoperative adjuvant treatment to minimize recurrence rates remains a matter of debate. This paper reviews the data of keloid patients treated at Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital from November 2012 to March 2024, and analyzed the prognosis of patients treated with surgery alone or multimodal adjuvant therapy, aiming to furnish additional clinical evidence and guidance for the treatment of keloid patients.

Inclusion criteria (Satisfy at the same time): (1) Clinical and (or) pathological diagnosis of keloid: A definite diagnosis of keloid was made by the pathology department and a clinical diagnosis of keloid was made by more than two associate chief physicians; (2) Surgical treatment is required; (3) Age 16–80 years old.

Exclusion criteria (Meet one of them): (1) Pregnancy and lactation; (2) Systemic diseases or tumors;3. patients (male and female) who are ready to have children in the near future; 4. Liver, kidney and other important organ function damage; 5. Patients with existing wound conditions were not available at follow-up; 6.Age 0–15 years old.

From November 2012 to March 2024, 121 patients with keloid treated in Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study.

Patients were stratified into three distinct cohorts based on the therapeutic approaches employed: Group A comprised individuals who underwent surgical treatment in conjunction with radiotherapy; Group B included those subjected to a comprehensive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiotherapy, and pharmacological injections; Group C was treated with surgery alone. The overall experimental flow diagram is shown in Fig.1.

A 2 mm incision was made along the periphery of the keloid, followed by the complete excision of the keloid. In cases with smaller incisions and/or adequate skin tension, free bilateral skin flaps were utilized, and local flap advancement closure was performed, employing interrupted or intradermal suturing to achieve tension-free closure of the surrounding skin. For larger incisions, where direct adjacent flap closure would result in significant tension, various techniques such as pedicled flaps, z-plasty, or skin grafting were employed post-excision, depending on the specific conditions of the incision site, to suture the wound.

Within 24 h after surgery, the patient received the first electron beam irradiation with a dose of 6 MeV. The irradiation field extended 2 cm beyond the surgical margins to safeguard against excessive exposure of normal tissues, and electron lead shields were tailored according to the shape of the wound. A 0.5 cm thick bolus was applied to the surface to enhance the skin dose. The initial irradiation commenced within 24 h postoperatively at a dosage of 5 Gy/day, across four sessions, culminating in a total dosage of 20 Gy; alternatively, a regimen of 4 Gy/day over five sessions was employed to achieve the same total dosage.

Following wound closure during surgery, pharmacotherapy was administered via injections along the periphery of the incision. The injectable agents employed were categorized as follows: 1. Glucocorticoids 2.5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 3. Glucocorticoids and 5FU.

Patients were evaluated for keloid recurrence, as well as symptoms such as itching, pain, and infection, through outpatient follow-up assessments 12 months postoperatively. For those unable to attend clinic visits, telephonic and(or) wechat follow-ups were conducted to assess the emergence of new keloids and the size of existing keloids at the surgical site. After obtaining patient consent, partial treatment photographs are shown in Figs.2and3.

The efficacy evaluation criteria refer to the previous literature [8,9], as detailed in Table1. Total effective rate (%) = (number of cured + number of significantly + number of effectiveness) *100/total number of cases.

Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software, version 27.0. Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and categorical data were presented as n (%). Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, independent sample t-test was used for categorical variables when normal distribution was met, and Mann-Whitney U test was used for categorical variables when normal distribution was not met.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

From November 2012 to March 2024, a total of 141 people with keloid who underwent keloid comprehensive treatment in our hospital. Among them, 20 were excluded because they were not successfully followed up for dropouts after discharge. A total of 121 patients were enrolled after exclusion.

Among the 121 patients, there were 51 (42.15%) male and 70 (57.84%) female participants; ages ranged from 16 to 79 years, with a mean age of 46.38 ± 17.55 years. The duration of keloids formation varied from 0.33 to 40 years, with a mean duration of 9.44 ± 8.32 years. Keloids measuring ≤ 5 cm were observed in 44 cases (36.36%), keloids exceeding >5 cm were noted in 77 cases (63.64%). Keloids located in low-tension areas such as the face, ears, abdomen, and buttocks were observed in 22 cases (18.18%), whereas 99 cases (81.82%) presented keloids in high-tension areas including the anterior chest, shoulders, back, limbs, and perineum. Of all patients, 74 (61.16%) had itching, 72 (59.50%) had pain, 69 (57.02%) had infection. Refer to Table2for details.

The overall efficacy rate among the 121 patients was 85.12%, with Group A exhibiting an efficacy rate of 93.88%, Group B at 87.04%, and Group C at 55.56%. Refer to Table3for details. No long-term complications were observed in any of the patients. To analyze the effect of different treatment regimens on disease prognosis, we used the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test. Since some cells have expected frequencies less than 5, this test is more applicable than the traditional Pearson chi-square test. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the treatment regimen and the prognosis (recurrence and effective) (p< 0.001). Further comparative analyses revealed statistically significant differences between Group A and Group C (P= 0.00067) as well as between Group B and Group C (P= 0.0079), whereas no significant difference was observed between Group A and Group B (P= 0.325). These findings indicate that the recurrence rate was significantly higher in the surgery-alone group compared to the combined treatment group, further supporting the critical role of comprehensive treatment plans in improving clinical outcomes.

The possible risk factors affecting keloid were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U test showed that the age of patients in the recurrence group and the effective group was statistically significant U = 521.000,p= 0.003), which may be a risk factor affecting keloid recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in the duration of disease between the relapsed group and the effective group (U = 863.500,p= 0.642). “Gender, location, previous treatment, and clinical symptoms (pruritus, pain, continuation, infection) were not statistically significant.” See Table4for details.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the treatment plan was an independent risk factor for keloid recurrence (OR = 2.227, 95% CI: 1.266–3.919, *P* = 0.005). Lesion diameter was not identified as an independent influencing factor in the multivariate analysis (OR = 0.573, 95% CI: 0.159–2.056, *P* = 0.393). The effect of age on recurrence risk exhibited borderline significance (OR = 0.960, 95% CI: 0.921–1.000, *P* = 0.051). The model demonstrated good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, *P* = 0.594). See Table5for details.

Keloids represents a distinct pathological state in the scar formation process, primarily characterized by the excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and accumulation of extracellular matrix, leading to abnormal fibrosis of skin tissue. This process culminates in local symptoms such as itching, pain, and infection, significantly impacting the physiological and psychological well-being of patients [10]. In clinical management, the primary objectives in treating keloids are to alleviate local symptoms, enhance aesthetic appearance, prevent recurrence, and improve the quality of life for patients. The therapeutic approaches for keloids are diverse, including but not limited to surgical excision, radiation therapy, pharmacological injections (e.g., bleomycin, verapamil, hyaluronic acid and its enzyme, botulinum toxin, and collagenase), cryotherapy, laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, radiation therapy, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy [11,12]. Despite these options, no single treatment has been found to completely cure keloids, and the treatment paradigm has shifted from a monotherapy approach to a multimodal strategy that combines various therapeutic interventions. For certain persistent or recurrent cases, a multimodal treatment regimen combining surgical excision with adjunctive therapies has proven to be the most effective, maximizing symptom improvement and preventing recurrence [13]. Moreover, the efficacy of various treatment modalities varies across different studies. This study aims to analyze the outcomes of different adjunctive therapies administered post-surgery in patients requiring surgical intervention for keloids, providing a reference for the treatment of similar cases.

The research conducted by our team observed 121 keloid patients who underwent surgical treatment followed by various adjunctive therapies. Over a follow-up period exceeding 12 months, none of the patients exhibited postoperative complications such as incisional ulcers or delayed healing, which underscores the critical importance of maintaining strict asepsis and tension-reducing suturing techniques during surgery. Among the three distinct therapeutic regimens evaluated, Group A and Group B demonstrated efficacy rates of 93.88% and 87.04%, respectively, whereas Group C exhibited a considerably lower efficacy rate of 55.56%.Previous studies have also shown significantly higher rates of treatment with different modalities after surgery [14–16]. This observation necessitates further consideration regarding optimal treatment plans for patients with surgically resected lesions. Specifically, the combination of surgery and radiotherapy alone may achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes, whereas local drug injection therapy might require delayed administration after wound healing to more effectively prevent recurrence.It should be noted that this perspective is currently derived solely from retrospective analysis by our research team. Future prospective studies or ex vivo experiments will be required to validate these findings.

Compared to previous clinical studies that utilized radiotherapy, the cure rates reported herein appear relatively lower, possibly due to the fact that the mean follow-up time in this study was 68 months, which is significantly surpassing the one-year timeframe commonly adopted in most research. Our follow-up investigations revealed that while some patients showed no signs of recurrence within the first postoperative year, relapses began to emerge in the second and third years, with lesions eventually returning to their original size or larger. Consequently, it is advisable for clinical studies pertaining to keloid management to extend follow-up periods to at least three years post-surgery, to more accurately assess the long-term efficacy of the treatment modalities.

Among the various hypotheses proposed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the formation of keloids, factors such as hypoxia [17], autoimmune responses [18], chronic inflammatory reactions [19], and genetic predispositions [20] are universally acknowledged as pivotal. Additionally, mechanical tension has been identified as having a significant influence on the development of keloids [21]. Numerous studies have revealed a propensity for keloids to manifest in areas subject to increased tension, such as the thoracic wall, limbs, and the scapular region [22]. Observations by this research group indicate that keloids located in high-tension areas constitute 81.82% of cases. Although there is no irrefutable evidence to suggest that keloids in high-tension areas have a higher recurrence rate post-treatment compared to those in low-tension areas, research conducted by Liu Chunlei et al. identifies local tension as a critical risk factor influencing the recurrence of keloids [23]. They also noted that age, hypertension, keloids morphology, pain, and itching could potentially elevate the risk of recurrence. Furthermore, studies by Chen B et al. have demonstrated that the use of a skin tension reduction device for a minimum of six months post-surgery in patients treated exclusively via surgical excision could reduce the recurrence rate within 24 months to 7.9% [24]. This finding underscores the significance of sustained postoperative reduction of incisional tension in mitigating the recurrence of keloids. Therefore, it is advised that all patients with keloids routinely employ skin tension reduction devices post-surgery to prevent local recurrence.

Age may also be a significant factor influencing the recurrence and progressive growth of keloids, with patients under 30 years of age being more susceptible to the formation of keloids [25]. Skin regeneration also slows down with age, and the formation of keloids is attributed to an excessive proliferation of fibroblasts leading to an abundant deposition of extracellular matrix [26]. Research by Hasegawa et al. identified a positive correlation between the quantity of senescent dermal cells and increasing age, with a significant proportion of these senescent cells being fibroblasts [27]. This finding indirectly explains why elderly patients have a notably reduced probability of recurrence post-treatment. The excessive extracellular matrix in keloids is primarily composed of collagen, especially type I collagen. With aging, the interaction between fibroblasts and ecm is destroyed due to the breakdown of collagen fibril. This disruption causes loss of fibroblast spreading and mechanical force. Meanwhile, fibroblasts synthesize less ECM proteins and more matrix-degrading metalloproteinases [28]. Therefore, individuals with inhibited pro-collagen type I gene expression, typically older patients, are likely to achieve more satisfactory outcomes with the same treatment regimens. Based on these findings, our team suggests that young patients with keloids, who have yet to exhibit clinical symptoms and whose keloids are relatively small, might not initially prioritize surgical excision. Instead, less invasive treatments such as localized radiotherapy, pharmacological injections, or laser therapy should be considered. For elderly aged patients with clinical symptoms, direct excision of the keloids followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, pharmacological injections, and the use of skin tension reduction devices to prevent recurrence may be considered.

Previous investigations reveal that the prevalence of keloids formation among female patients exceeds that of their male counterparts [29]. However, there is scant research into whether gender also influences the recurrence of keloids following treatment. In this study, the treatment efficacy rates for males and females were 80.39% and 88.57%, respectively. A chi-square (χ²) test did not yield statistical significance (P> 0.05), suggesting that gender may not be a determinant factor in the recurrence of keloids. Nevertheless, research by Wanjala NF et al. [30] observed that among patients undergoing surgical excision followed by radiotherapy for keloids, 5% of male patients versus 2.8% of female patients experienced recurrence after treatment (p< 0.05). Given the larger sample size of Wanjala NF’s study, the findings carry greater representational significance, indicating that males may have a higher propensity for recurrence than females. But their reliability also needs to be further validated in prospective studies.

In this study, it was found that larger scars were associated with a higher cure rate after they were grouped according to keloid size. Interestingly, the results indicated that very large keloids exhibited the highest efficacy in treatment outcomes. This contrasts with findings from Shen J et al. [31], which demonstrated that keloids exceeding 5 cm in size had a higher rate of recurrence compared to those 5 cm or smaller (P< 0.01). As with any retrospective study, there may be inherent selection biases. In this study, a large proportion of patients have keloids caused by thoracotomy, and the diameter of the lesion is long, but the width is not proportional to the increase. At the same time, they are older, and these factors can significantly affect the prognosis. For these patients with older age and larger lesions, comprehensive treatment can better inhibit the recurrence of keloids. Our team plans to conduct a prospective study to further delineate the impact of different adjuvant treatment modalities post-surgery on the recurrence of keloids and to analyze the effect of various risk factors on keloids recurrence.

In conclusion, the results of this study advocate that elderly patients with clinical symptoms of keloid should be preferentially selected for surgical resection, supplemented by postoperative adjuvant therapies such as local radiotherapy and drug injection. Additionally, surgical planning should take into account the impact of tension on postoperative incisions, ensuring meticulous tension-reducing suturing techniques are employed. Patients should also be advised to continuously use skin tension reduction devices post-surgery to alleviate local tension and prevent recurrence.
