This study aimed to investigate the craniometric and topographic measurements of the skull and mandible of British shorthair and Scottish fold cats using computed tomography and 3D software.

For this purpose, in a total of 26 cats, 13 British shorthair (7 males and 6 females) and 13 (7 males and 6 females) Scottish fold cats were used in the study. The skulls were scanned with 64‐detector multislice Siemens computed tomography devices at 80 kV, 200 MA, 639 mGY and 0.625 mm section thickness. The resulting images were saved in DICOM format. They were modelled and measured with 3D slicer software.

In the study, surface area measurements were found to be statistically significant in both cat breeds (British shorthair:p< 0.01; Scottish fold:p< 0.05). However, in mandibular measurements, the CAP parameter was statistically significant only in Scottish fold cats (p< 0.01), whereas no significant difference was observed in British shorthair cats (p> 0.05).

Craniometric and topographical measurements were performed in British shorthair and Scottish fold cats using a 3D model to reveal the differences between male and female. It will also guide the determination of taxonomic locations of these two species and the detection of morphometric differences between the sexes.

This study presents a 3D CT‐based morphometric comparison of the skull and mandible in British Shorthair and Scottish fold cats. Significant sex‐based differences were observed in various cranial, mandibular and topographic measurements. Results contribute to veterinary anatomy, anaesthesia planning and breed‐specific morphological characterization.

British shorthair breed cats are one of the most preferred breeds as pets in homes with their very dense fur and gentle characters (Taylor1989). Scottish fold is a purebred cat. It originates from Scotland. The most prominent feature is the forward‐folded ears (Todds1972). Their skulls have a brachycephalic shape (Demir and Altundağ2020; Gündemir, Szara Yalin, et al.2023).

The skull is a strong structure consisting of many paired and single bones, some of which are centrally located and single. This structure includes the brain, sensory organs such as vision, smell, balance and taste, upper respiratory and digestive tracts. The mandible is the lower jaw bone. It has a movable joint in the skull. The cranial bones are connected to each other by sutures and to the mandibulae and apparatus hyoideus by joints (König and Liebich2009). Cranial morphometry is used in taxonomy, forensic medicine and zooarchaeology because of specific differences between races and sexes (Kobryńczuk et al.2008; Adebisi2009; Onar et al.2015). The phenotypic characteristics of cranial changes may vary according to the growing environment, breed and nutritional status (Elbroch2006).

In recent years, developments in medical imaging systems have led to the replacement of two‐dimensional (2D) anatomical structures with three‐dimensional (3D) models (Rubio et al.2019). In the medical sector, models can be obtained using cross‐sectional imaging methods (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, etc.) and have an important role in the detailed examination of structures, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of diseases (Demircioğlu and Ince2020; Morone et al.2019; Parthasarathy2014).

There are many modelling techniques in recent years. With these techniques, geometric and morphometric measurements of the skull reveal the differences between species and races (Gündemir, Özkan, et al.2020; Jashari et al.2022; Gündemir, Duro, et al.2020). This study is to reveal the 3D modelling and anatomical structures of the skull and lower jaw of British shorthair and Scottish fold cats using computerized tomography. In addition, it was carried out to obtain morphometric measurement values, to reveal topographic measurements and to reveal the differences between genders.

In a total of 26 cats, 13 British shorthair (7 males and 6 females) and 13 (7 males and 6 females) Scottish fold cats were used in the study. The ages of the cats ranged from 1 to 8 years. Computed tomography images of the cats were collected from different animal hospitals in Türkiye. Consent forms were obtained from the owners of the cats.

The skulls of the cats were scanned using a 64‐detector MDCT (General Electric Revolution) device at 80 kV, 200 MA, 639 mGY and 0.625 mm slice thickness. Prokop (2003) was taken as reference for scan dose and protocol. Cat skull CT scans were saved in DICOM format. Reconstructions were performed using 3D Slicer (5.0.2) software. The volume and surface area of the cat skull models were calculated with the segment statics application in the 3D slicer software.

The mean values, standard deviations, coefficient of variations and craniofacial indices were calculated with SPSS (version 22). Independent samplest‐test was used forpvalues.

On the 3D models obtained, 34 parameters and volume–surface area of the skull were measured. On the mandible of cats, 17 measurement parameters and volume–surface area were measured. From the topographic measurements made on the skull and mandible, 20 measurement parameters were measured. Measurements made on the skull were taken (Rooppakhun et al.2011). Measurement parameters on the mandible were taken (Yılmaz and Demircioğlu2019). Topographic measurements on the skull and mandible were taken (Ducic et al.2024). Measurement points of cat skulls are given in Figures1and2. Mandible measurement points are given in Figures3and4. Topographic measurement points are given in Figures5and6.

In this study, 34 parameters of the British and Scottish cat skull were measured. Nineteen parameters of the mandible and 20 topographic parameters of the skull and mandible were measured. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the group averages of morphometric measurement values in terms of continuous variables in males and females and the differences between genders. When the statistical results were analysed, statistically significant differences were found between the skull measurement values (p< 0.05;p< 0.01). Table1shows the measurement values of the skulls of British shorthair cats. Total length of the skull (TLS) of the measurement points indicates that males are larger than females. When condylobasal length (CBL), height of the foramen magnum (HFM) and AREA measurement parameters were analysed statistically, it was found to be highly statistically significant (p< 0.01). Table1shows the measurement values of the skulls of Scottish fold cats. TLS of the measurement points indicates that males are larger than females. When the LHP2 measurement parameter was analysed statistically, it was found to be highly statistically significant (p< 0.01). Facial length (FCL) and AREA measurement parameters were found to be statistically significant (p< 0.05). Table2shows the measurement values of the mandibles of British shorthair cats. TLM from the measurement points shows that males are larger than females. PCD, CBC and PML measurement parameters were found to be statistically significant (p< 0.05). Table2shows the measurement values of the mandibles of Scottish fold cats. TLM from the measurement points shows that males are larger than females. CAP and CML measurement parameters were found to be statistically significant (p< 0.01). PCD and VOLUME measurement parameters were found to be statistically significant (p< 0.05).

The skull indexes of British shorthair and Scottish fold cats are given in Table4. When the skull indices of British shorthair cats were analysed, it was seen that females were larger than males in FMI, FI1, FI2, BI2, PI1 and PI2 indices. In addition, PI2 parameter was statistically significant between male and female cats (p< 0.05). When the head indices of Scottish fold cats were analysed, it was seen that females were larger than males in FMI, FI1, FI2, BI2 and PI2 indices. In addition, FM1 parameter was found to be statistically significant between male and female cats (p< 0.01). When FMI parameter was analysed, it was seen that there was a significant statistic between male and female cats (p< 0.05).

The size and shape of the skull vary more between domestic cats and dogs and wild big cats than in other mammals (Saber and Gummow2015). Onar and Güneş (2003) stated that skull indices and ratios, among the parameters used to characterize the shape of the skull in dogs and cats, effectively distinguish and define morphological types. Measurements were made on skull and mandible bones with various methods to determine morphological variations in domestic and wild animals (Gordon et al.2018; İşbilir et al.2023).

This is the first study to determine the morphometric, volumetric and topographic characteristics of the skull and mandible in adult British shorthair and Scottish fold cats using CT and 3D modelling and to reveal the differences and similarities of these values between sexes.

In our study, the TLS value was determined to be higher in males than females in British shorthair and Scottish fold cats. Although the same value was reported as 8.4 ± 1.5 cm in cats by Saber and Gummow (2015), it was determined as 10.05 ± 0.13 cm in another study conducted on cats (Moselly and Mahdy2019). According to our study results, the values were found to be higher in cats of the same breed after 3D modelling.

FI1 value was found to be higher in both cat breeds and sexes in our study than the FI value determined in a study conducted on cats (Saber and Gummow2015). The FI1 result was expressed as 241.01 ± 33.14 in Van cats (Yılmaz and Demircioğlu2022), and this value was determined to be smaller in all except male Scottish fold cats. In addition, there was no statistical difference between sexes in terms of PI2 value in Van cats (Yılmaz and Demircioğlu2022). The mean PI2 value reported in Van cats was larger than the subject of our study, all male cats, and smaller than all female cats.

FMI parameter was statistically different between sexes (p< 0.05) in Scottish fold cats, as in Van cats (Yılmaz and Demircioğlu2022). In a radiographic study on British shorthair, Scottish fold and Van cats, no statistical difference was reported between the three cat breeds in terms of FMI index value (Gündemir, Akcasiz et al.2023). Our study determined the difference between males and females in Scottish fold cats (p< 0.05).

In a study conducted on Persian cats, the average TLM and RAH parameters were found to be 8.3 ± 1.03 and 3.7 ± 0.59 cm (Monfared2013). Pitakarnnop et al. (2017) expressed the same values about 6.01 and 2.75 cm in male domestic cats, and 5.74 and 2.61 cm in female domestic cats. In civet cats, the same values were determined as 4.8 and 2.3 cm, respectively (Suri et al.2018). In our study, it was determined that the TLM value in British shorthair and Scottish fold cats was higher than that of Misk (Suri et al.2018) and Van cats (Yılmaz and Demircioğlu2022) and lower than that of Persian cats (Monfared2013) and Australian domestic cats (Saber et al.2016). In addition, the RAH parameter was determined to be greater than that of Australian domestic cats (Saber et al.2016) and Misk cats (Suri et al.2018) and smaller than that of Persian cats (Monfared2013) and Eurasian lynx (Dayan et al.2017). In the study conducted on Van cats, the mandibular volume value was determined as 7.39 ± 0.93 cm3in males and 5.40 ± 0.49 cm3in females (Yılmaz and Demircioğlu2022). In our study, the same value was detected as 9.75 ± 1.48 cm3in Scottish fold male cats and 7.83 ± 0.64 cm3in female cats. Similar to Van cats, the volume parameter value had a statistically significant difference between genders in Scottish fold cats (p< 0.01). Although there may be minor differences depending on the age, body weight, height and breed of the cats, the morphometric measurement values obtained were generally determined to be compatible with the literature.

Considering the size of cat skulls, it is a necessity to know the topographic structures of the foramina where local anaesthetic will be applied (Ducic et al.2024). In the literature, it is possible to encounter the morphometric values of these foramina in individual mammals (Ducic et al.2024; Monfared2013; Saber et al.2016; Barroso et al.2009). The four dental nerve blocks reported in cats are infraorbital, maxillary, inferior alveolar (mandibular) and middle mental blocks (Shilo‐Benjamini et al.2022). Morphometric measurements of the foramina, which should be well known for local anaesthesia applications, were examined according to gender in the two cat breeds used in our study.

The infraorbital foramen is an important foramina used to anaesthetize the infraorbital nerve during manipulations of the upper lip, nostril, facial skin, incisors, canines and the first two premolars (İşbilir et al.2023; O'Morrow2010; Choudhary et al.2017). TheT2 parameter was reported as 0.94 ± 0.08 cm in Persian cats (Monfared2013), 0.7 ± 0.2 cm in round‐headed cats, 0.9 ± 0.2 cm in flat‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016) and 0.62 ± 0.03 cm in domestic shorthair cats (Ducic et al.2024).

In inferior alveolar (mandibular) nerve block anaesthesia, the location of the mandibular foramen is very important. It may be difficult to palpate the mental foramen in small cats, so the mandibular block is an alternative in such cases (Rochette2005). In this context, in our study,T9 andT10 parameters were close to the values determined by Barroso et al. (2009) and Ducic et al. (2024) in cats. Although theT9 parameter was found to be close to the values determined in Australian domestic round‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016) in the two cat breeds used in our study, the same parameter was reported to be higher in Persian cats (Monfared2013) and Australian domestic flat‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016). TheT2 parameters in British shorthair and Scottish fold cats were closer to small, flat‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016) and domestic shorthaired cats (Ducic et al.2024), compared to Persian cats (Monfared2013) and round‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016).

Anaesthesia through the mental foramen causes sensory loss of the lower incisors, the first three premolar teeth, adjacent bone tissues and the lower lip (İşbilir et al.2023; Rochette2005). According to our study results, theT15 parameter was smaller than in Australian domestic round‐headed cats. The same value was close to each other in British shorthair and Scottish fold cats and similar to domestic shorthair cats (Ducic et al.2024).

The existence of the mandibular canal requires good knowledge of the diastema length. Additionally, diastema has an important place in mandibular fracture surgery (Orassi et al.2021). In our study, theT16 parameter was determined close to the value presented in domestic shorthair cats (Ducic et al.2024) and Australian domestic round‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016), whereas this value was found to be higher in Australian domestic flat‐headed cats (Saber et al.2016).

Gündemir, Szara Yalin, et al. (2023) reported that British shorthair and Scottish fold cats did not differ in any linear measurement and index parameters in their radiographic studies. In our study results, the differences in different parameters between the sexes in both breeds may be due to the fact that the heads of Scottish fold cats are rounder.

As a result, osteometric values, index parameters and topographic features of the skull and mandible bones of male and female British shorthair and Scottish fold cats were examined using CT and 3D modelling methods. Statistical differences in the data obtained between male and female cats were revealed. The images and data obtained by CT and 3D modelling will be guiding in the diagnosis of various pathological disorders in the skull and mandible bones, in determining the taxonomic location of British shorthair and Scottish fold cats and in detecting morphometric differences between genders. It is also thought that the data will be useful in regional anaesthesia applications in surgery and clinical sciences, veterinary anatomy education and zooarchaeological studies.
