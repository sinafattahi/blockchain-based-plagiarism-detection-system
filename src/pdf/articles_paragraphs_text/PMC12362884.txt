Tissue regeneration remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern medicine, particularly in the treatment of chronic wounds, organ damage, and degenerative diseases. These conditions are characterized by dysregulated healing, irreversible cell loss, and disrupted microenvironments that are resistant to conventional therapy. Traditional approaches, such as surgical grafts and systemic drug delivery, often fall short due to the limitations in specificity, efficacy, and safety. Emerging technologies, especially microneedles (MNs), nanomedicine, and their integration offer an innovative solution by enabling localized, controlled, and minimally invasive interventions. This review explores the challenges and therapeutic strategies associated with MNs and nanomedicine in tissue regeneration and cancer-related treatment. It highlights recent design innovations, functional diversity of bioengineered MNs, and the transformative potential of combining MNs with nanomedicine for precision regenerative therapies in specific tissues. The future perspectives of MNs and nanomedicine suggest promising avenues for smart and personalized regeneration.

Chronic wounds, organ damage, and degenerative diseases represent three major challenges in the field of tissue regeneration, each posing distinct biological and clinical hurdles [1]. Chronic wounds, such as diabetic ulcers and pressure sores, are characterized by persistent inflammation, microbial colonization, and impaired angiogenesis [2]. The hypoxic and acidic microenvironment of these wounds disrupts fibroblast proliferation, in which elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade nascent extracellular matrix (ECM) [3–5]. For instance, MMP-9 levels in diabetic ulcers have been reported to be 14-fold higher than in traumatic wounds [6]. Organ damage, whether resulting from trauma, ischemia, or chronic diseases, often leads to fibrotic scarring instead of functional tissue regeneration [7,8]. For example, myocardial infarction (MI) leads to the replacement of cardiomyocytes with non-contractile fibrotic tissue [9]. Degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA) and Alzheimer’s disease, are marked by progressive loss of specialized cells and ECM. In OA, the degradation of articular cartilage is driven by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) and mechanical stress [10]. Similarly, neurodegenerative diseases involve the accumulation of misfolded proteins (amyloid-β plaques) and widespread synaptic loss [11]. A unifying feature across these conditions is the failure of endogenous repair mechanisms to effectively counteract tissue damage. Fibrotic organs are deprived of stem cells capable of regenerating functional parenchyma, while degenerative tissues are further impaired by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupting cellular homeostasis [12,13]. Compounding these issues are systemic factors such as aging, and immunosuppression, which dysregulate immune responses and ECM remodeling [14]. Traditional regenerative therapies, including grafts, systemic drug delivery, and cell-based therapy may suffer the unpredictable risks of infection, immune rejection, surgical complications and biosafety. Together, these challenges underscore the urgent need for therapeutic strategies that not only deliver bioactive therapeutics but also modulate the pathological microenvironment to enable endogenous repair.

The integration of bioengineered microneedles (MNs) with nanomedicine offers a paradigm-shifting solution to tissue regeneration, combining the spatial precision of MNs with the temporal control of nanoscale drug delivery systems [15]. MNs, fabricated from polymers, metals, or ceramics, can painlessly penetrate the stratum corneum or fibrous scar tissue to create transient microchannels for localized drug delivery [16]. Unlike conventional hypodermic needles, MNs avoid major nerve and vascular networks, enabling self-administerable and minimally invasive therapies [17]. In regenerative medicine, MNs are particularly valuable for bypassing biological barriers—such as scar tissue in chronic wounds in damaged organs—to deliver therapeutic payloads directly to target sites [18,19]. A silk fibroin microsphere (SFM-AgNPs) and antibiotic dissolving microneedle system (MNs) containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been developed for the synergistic treatment of bacterial biofilm infection [20]. These MNs firmly adhere to the infected site and penetrate biofilms to a depth of approximately 150 μm, and deliver both antimicrobial agents and microspheres, achieving effective bacterial clearance. Nanomedicine enhances MN platforms by enabling controlled release, targeted delivery, and improved bioavailability [21]. Nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within MNs can be engineered to respond to microenvironment (light, pH, and enzymes), ensuring spatiotemporal control over drug release [22,24]. In oncology, a carrier-free MN platform loaded with chlorin e6 nanoassemblies (L-Ce6 NAs) and constructed from oligohyaluronic acid demonstrates potent photodynamic immunotherapy. The MN array, consisting of 225 pyramid-shaped MNs with ~ 3 µg Ce6 at the tip, penetrates melanoma tumors in mice and dissolves to release the photosensitizer. Upon laser irradiation, the system generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing in situ tumor ablation, immunogenic cell death (ICD), dendritic cell (DC) maturation in draining lymph nodes, and systemic antitumor immunity, significantly prolonging survival [25]. Collectively, these examples underscore the promise that bioengineered MNs integrated with nanomedicine may be an emerging technology for chronic wounds, organ damage, and degenerative diseases in tissue regeneration.

In recent years, bioengineered MNs combined with nanomedicine have rapidly advanced as a promising strategy for tissue repair and regeneration across diverse applications, including skin regeneration, cardiovascular repair, neural regeneration, cartilage and bone regeneration, and tumor-associated tissue regeneration (Fig.1) [26]. This review highlights key innovations in the design and functional diversity of the bioengineered MNs, such as MN classification, biocompatible materials, and underlying mechanisms of action. Therapeutics can be encapsulated in the bioengineered MNs for controlled drug delivery and nanomedicine therapy is explained from passive carriers to active modulators in tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of MNs with nanomedicine is examined as a multifunctional platform that overcomes biological barriers, enhances cellular uptake, and reduces immunogenicity. This review also explores the specific applications of bioengineered MNs in regenerating various tissues, including skin and chronic wounds, cardiovascular repair, neural regeneration, cartilage and bone regeneration, tumor therapy and tissue regeneration. Benefiting from 3D-printing bioengineered MNs, these platforms are poised to enable a smart and personalized regenerative platform for patient-specific tissue design based on genomic/proteomic profiling.

The advent of bioengineered MNs has revolutionized transdermal and intratissue drug delivery by integrating minimally invasive therapy with precise therapeutic control [27]. MNs can painlessly breach biological barriers, enabling localized delivery of diverse agents including drugs, genes, vaccines, and diagnostic probes [28–30]. The structural diversity of MNs, including spanning dissolving, hydrogel-based, coated, and hollow architectures—meets a broad spectrum of clinical needs, from rapid vaccination to sustained regenerative therapy [31]. Advancements in biocompatible materials, such as hyaluronic acid (HA), silk fibroin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), have further expanded the functionality of MNs, ensuring compatibility with delicate organs and adaptability to dynamic physiological environments (Fig.2a) [32]. The functional groups of the HA chain, including hydroxyl, carboxyl and acetylamino groups can be modified by chemical reagents (photocrosslinking) to form HA hydrogel for MN construction, which determines the mechanical properties of these HA-based MNs. Soluble PVP contains a large number of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, which can be crosslinked to form a network structure. PVP-based MNs are produced through crosslinking polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) or copolymerization with other monomers. In addition, silk fibroin hydrogel can be directly developed into bioengineered MNs based on degumming, dissolution and dialysis of silks, while silk fibroin-based MNs are also prepared by combining silk fibroin and other chemicals (HA, chitosan) by thiol-ene click chemistry. Beyond drug delivery, MNs serve as multifunctional systems capable of modulating release kinetics, providing mechanical support in damaged tissues, and accessing deep anatomical sites with minimal trauma [33]. The classification of bioengineered MNs, material innovations driving their evolution, and their action mechanism, collectively underscore their transformative role in precision medicine.

Bioengineered MNs are broadly categorized into four types (solid, dissolving, hollow and coated MNs), and each type is distinguished by unique structural and functional attributes to dictate their clinical applications (Fig.2b). Solid MNs are typically fabricated from metals or non-degradable materials such as silicon and titanium dioxide, and prepared using techniques like laser micromachining, etching, and microforming [33,35]. Dissolving MNs fabricated from water-soluble polymers (HA, PVP, or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) are designed to encapsulate the therapeutics within their matrix and release NP drugs as the biomaterials dissolve in interstitial fluid [36]. A dissolving microneedle patch (DMNP) loaded with MTX—a first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)—demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo by reducing paw swelling, downregulating inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), and mitigating synovial and cartilage damage in RA models [37]. Hollow MNs, resembling miniature hypodermic needles, contain a central lumen for continuous infusion or extraction of fluids [38]. Inspired by the morphological structure and physiological characteristics of sharp corals, a hollow porous MN patch loaded with intelligent hydrogel is developed by relying on high-precision biological 3D printing technology for rapid indication, intelligent drug delivery, and minimally invasive treatment of subcutaneous infection in chronic wounds [39]. Coated microneedles (CMNs), also known as surface drug-loaded MNs, encapsulate drugs on the surface of the needle. Upon insertion, the coating dissolves into the interstitial fluid, facilitating rapid drug uptake. They are mainly used for the delivery of water-soluble drugs [40,41]. Building on these foundational designs, emerging hybrid microneedle systems are now integrating multiple functional elements—for instance, dissolving tips for immediate payload release coupled with hydrogel matrices for sustained delivery, or hollow MNs functionalized with gold coatings for on-demand therapeutic release [42,43]. This classification framework of MNs is continually redefined by biomaterial breakthroughs that blur traditional boundaries and unlock novel functionalities. Furthermore, the advantages and challenges of the MN platform for nanomedicine delivery and tissue engineering are summarized in Table1.

The performance of bioengineered MNs largely depends on the properties of natural and synthesized biomaterials, particularly their biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and drug safety. HA, a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan, is widely used in dissolving MNs due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and hygroscopicity [44,45]. An innovative technology known as On-patient Medical Record (OPMR) has been developed to store invisible medical records based on transdermal MNs. This technology stores medical information in the patient’s skin in the form of near-infrared fluorescent particles through MN [46]. Silk fibroin is another promising material with superior mechanical properties and programmable degradation [47]. One kind of fluorescent-based biodegradable microneedle sensor array for tether-free continuous glucose monitoring has a simple structure. It consists of a two-layer structure: a silk fibroin needle layer containing glucose-responsive fluorophores, and a PVA backing layer for anchoring and skin insertion [48].

In addition to natural biomaterials, synthetic polymers are widely applied for the design and fabrication of MNs for nanomedicine applications. PVP is particularly valued for its rapid dissolution and excellent film-forming properties, making it ideal for dissolvable MNs [49]. PVP-based MNs can effectively penetrate the stratum corneum and rapidly dissolve to release active agents, enhancing skin absorption. For instance, a dissolvable microneedle patch (DMN) is developed using PVP as the needle matrix and TPI-BOB, a benzoborate-modified photosensitizer targeting gram-positive bacteria, loaded at the tip. Upon light activation, this system eliminates drug-resistant biofilms and promotes angiogenesis and tissue repair in diabetic wounds [50]. To further enhance performance, chitosan-based MNs is often blended with other polymers to improve adhesive and mechanical strength [51,52]. Emerging materials such as conductive polymers (PEDOT: PSS) are enabling the development of smart MNs that integrate with electronic devices for electroresponsive drug release [53]. Moreover, material choice should balance the performance with regulatory considerations. Synthetic polymers require rigorous toxicity profiling, whereas natural materials (HA and silk) generally have more established safety profiles. Future material innovation will focus on multi-functional composites, such as HA-silk hybrids for combined stiffness and biodegradability, enzyme-embedded polymers for self-actuated drug release, and smart materials for AI-derived drug delivery.

The therapeutic efficacy of bioengineered MNs is primarily driven by three mechanisms: controlled drug release kinetics, mechanical support, and minimally invasive access to deep tissues [54]. Drug release profiles can be finely tuned by MN design and material properties. For example, dissolving MNs release therapeutics through matrix erosion, with release rates modulated by the degree of polymer crosslinking [55]. A wearable transdermal drug delivery system has recently been developed, integrating a portable iontophoresis device, electro-responsive hydrogel, and polymer microneedle patches. This system enables on-demand drug release via electrical stimulation and enhances delivery depth through iontophoresis [56]. Similarly, temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogels enable heat-triggered drug release [57]. Coated MNs rely on dissolution or abrasion of the drug layer to achieve near-instantaneous release, while hollow MNs enable continuous infusion, regulated by external pumps or osmotic gradients.

Beyond drug delivery, bioengineered MNs also provide mechanical support to fragile tissue, functioning as temporary scaffolds [58]. A gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel MN patch, designed for myocardial-targeted delivery of galunisertib (MN-Gal patch), is shown to sustain drug release for over two weeks while reinforcing the weakened ventricular wall [58]. Similarly, A three-phase MN scaffold with a tip, stem, and base has been designed for localized delivery of circadian rhythm-regulated small extracellular vesicles (CR-sEVs/MN) at the tendon-bone interface. The base is infused with tendon-derived decellularized extracellular matrix to promote tendon repair. This system reduces inflammation, facilitates fibrocartilage regeneration, and enhances tendon healing. The MN scaffold thus provides both mechanical support and localized bioactive delivery, offering a promising strategy for enhancing tendon-to-bone healing in clinical applications [60]. These dual functions of mechanical stabilization and bioactive delivery are particularly impactful in load-bearing tissues (bone and cartilage).

A defining advantage of MNs is their ability to deliver therapeutics to deep tissues with minimal invasiveness. Bioengineered MNs can effectively penetrate physical barriers (scar tissue, synovial membranes) to localize therapy [61]. Advances in 3D printing have further expanded MN manufacturing capabilities, enabling rapid customization of size and shape with high precision [62]. For example, PLGA microspheres with sustained drug release properties have been integrated into a water-soluble MN patch for long-term treatment of androgenic alopecia. This MN patch is fabricated using a mold processed by PDMS casting based on nanoArch S140 3D printing mold. The resulting system improves drug bioavailability, reduces dosing frequency, and enhances patient safety and compliance [63]. However, precise control of penetration depth remains a challenge. Excessive penetration risks damaging underlying structures, while insufficient penetration limits efficacy. To address this, computational modeling and imaging-guided insertion systems are being developed to optimize placement, particularly in heterogeneous tissues.

Bioengineered MNs epitomize the convergence of biomaterials, pharmacology, and bioengineering, offering innovative designs that overcome long-standing limitations in drug delivery and tissue repair. Dissolving, hydrogel-based, coated, and hollow MNs provide a versatile framework adaptable to specific clinical needs, while the use of biocompatible materials ensures safety and functional versatility. Their mechanisms ranging from controlled drug release to mechanical support and deep tissue access underscore their multifunctionality and broad application potential, from vaccination to chronic disease management. Future directions will focus on intelligent systems that integrate biosensing, adaptive release, and regenerative scaffolding to overcome both manufacturing and regulatory hurdles. As these technologies continue to evolve, bioengineered MNs are poised to become indispensable tools in the area of smart, personalized, and minimally invasive medicine.

Regenerative therapy aims to restore the structure and function of damaged tissues, offering new hope for conditions ranging from chronic wounds to degenerative diseases. However, traditional drug delivery systems often fail due to poor bioavailability, off-target effects, and inability to mimic the dynamic biological processes required for tissue repair. Nanomedicine, an emerging and rapidly evolving field, has evolved from modifying NPs as passive drug carriers to engineering them as active modulators of cellular behaviors [64]. This transformation has been driven by the advances in NP design, surface functionalization, and the discovery of nanomaterials with intrinsic regenerative properties. Herein, this review highlights three pivotal aspects of this evolution, including the role of NPs (liposomes, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs) in enhancing drug stability and bioavailability, targeted delivery strategies through surface functionalization with peptides and antibodies, and the inherent regenerative capability of nanomaterials (Fig.3). Collectively, these innovations demonstrate how nanomedicine is redefining regenerative therapy by bridging the gap between controlled drug delivery and active tissue remodeling.

NPs have revolutionized regenerative therapy by addressing the limitations of conventional drug formulation, particularly poor stability and low bioavailability [65]. Liposomes, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs each offer distinct advantages in protecting therapeutic cargos and enhancing targeted delivery (Fig.3a) [66]. Liposomes-spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers surrounding a hydrophilic core—can encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules [67]. For example, curcumin-loaded liposomes embedded into a 3D-printed calcium phosphate (CaP) scaffold with tailored porosity significantly improve osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, viability, and differentiation in vitro [68]. Nevertheless, liposomes face some challenges, such as rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and instability under physiological conditions [69]. To mitigate this, PEGylated liposomes modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) extend circulation time by forming a hydrophilic barrier that reduces recognition and uptake by macrophages [70]. In a clinical study, PEGylated liposomes loaded with sorafenib demonstrate enhanced cellular uptake and greater cytotoxicity, underscoring their potential in enhancing bioavailability.

These NPs can be applied for cardiovascular repair, bone regeneration and tumor therapy to promote angiogenesis, osteogenesis, and the clearance of apoptotic cancer cells (Fig.3b). Polymeric NPs, particularly those made from biodegradable polymers like poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or chitosan, provide precise control over drug release kinetics [71]. For instance, PLGA NPs undergo hydrolysis in an aqueous environment, enabling sustained or stimuli-responsive drug release [72]. In one study, 3D-printed PLGA frameworks are combined with cartilage-specific matrix hydrogels to investigate how different microenvironments influence cartilage regeneration. The findings reveal that an in-situ auricular microenvironment effectively promotes the maturation and maintenance of regenerative cartilage phenotype. In contrast, an ex-situ subcutaneous microenvironment leads to the loss of the cartilage identity due to pronounced immune responses and increased vascularization. In a cranial bone osteogenic microenvironment, although autologous chondrocytes support robust cartilage regeneration within 12 weeks, the cartilage is gradually replaced by regenerated bone tissue, ultimately achieving successful repair of cranial bone defects [73].

Inorganic NPs, including silica-based NPs (e.g., mesoporous silica, nanosheets, and quantum dot), carbon-based NPs (e.g., graphene, carbon tube), and metal-based NPs (e.g., gold, silver, and iron), present unparalleled stability and multifunctionality [74]. Among them, mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs) with their high surface area and tunable pore size, enable efficient co-loading of poorly water-soluble anticancer drugs and surfactant-based sensitizers. For instance, a nanocomposite system (DOX-CTAB-MSNs) constructed by integrating micelles into MSNs exhibits strong pH-responsive drug release under both in vitro simulated conditions and in vivo tumor models (MCF-7/ADR-bearing mice), ensuring precise intracellular delivery [75]. Metal-based NPs have also been used in photothermal-triggered drug release. Owing to their excellent biocompatibility and photothermal properties, liquid metal (LM) NPs with autophagy-activation capabilities have been developed for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis using mild photothermal therapy (PTT). This study explores the effectiveness of strategies combining autophagy regulation and mild-PTT for the treatment of metastatic bone tumors. LM and autophagy activators (curcumin, Cur) are co-loaded into a zeolite imidazolate framework-8 and functionalized with a dual-targeting ligand (hyaluronic acid/aldopentaphosphate complex) for bone and tumor. The resulting nanodrugs demonstrate good biocompatibility, excellent photothermal performance, and acid/near-infrared light-triggered drug release capability [76]. However, inorganic NPs face concerns regarding long-term distribution and potential toxicity, necessitating surface modification or hybrid design. Nevertheless, these NPs exemplify how engineered nanomaterials can be tailored to overcome biological barriers and precisely deliver regenerative therapeutics to their targets.

The true potential of nanomedicine in regenerative therapy lies in its ability to achieve targeted delivery, thereby minimizing systemic side effects and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Surface functionalization of NPs with peptides, antibodies, or other ligands enables active targeting of specific cells or tissues-representing a paradigm shift from passive accumulation to active regulation [77]. Peptides with small size, low immunogenicity, and easy operation are widely used to home NPs to disease sites [78]. For example, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides, which bind to αvβ3 integrins, have been conjugated into liposomes to enhance the binding ability of the extracellular matrix and cellular membranes. Notably, cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptides exhibit stronger and more stable binding to integrins compared to their linear counterparts [79]. A novel bionic hybrid nanoplatform has been designed, named miR497/TP-HENPs. This platform consists of exosomes derived from SKOV3-CDDP cells and liposomes modified with cRGD peptides. The chemotherapeutic drug TP is used as the core drug, with calcium phosphate (CaP) as a structural medium. MiR497 is adsorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticles through electrostatic adsorption to reduce drug leakage. This hybrid nanoplatform enables dual targeting: homotypic recognition via tumor-derived exosomes and receptor-mediated targeting via cRGD, thus enhancing tumor localization and therapeutic precision. Antibody-mediated targeting leverages antigen-antibody interactions to direct NPs towards diseased cells [80]. For instance, a novel platform known as antibody-linked drug-loaded nanotherapy (ADN), which combines immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. In this system, anti-CD47 and anti–programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies are co-anchored on the NP surface, while PI103—a small-molecule inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway—is encapsulated within MNs. This platform has demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), marking a significant advancement in cancer treatment paradigms [81]. Take an example, anti-EGFR antibody is grafted onto gold NPs and effectively inhibits the proliferation and migration of EGFR-expressing cells such as MDA-MB-468 and HeLa cells, suggesting its potential application in future biomedical research [82]. However, full-length antibodies present certain limitations, including high production costs and potential immunogenicity. To address these problems, antibody fragments (Fab or scFv) are increasingly applied for NP targeting. One study used antibody-conjugated liposomes (Ab-LNPs) to deliver mRNA encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directly to T cells in mice. This enables the generation of functional CAR-T cells within the host, which then targets and eliminates cardiac fibroblasts, effectively reversing fibrosis and restoring cardiac function [83].

Emerging strategies increasingly employ multiple ligands to achieve synergistic targeting. Dual-functionalized PLGA nanoparticles with transferrin receptors (TfR) ligands have been designed to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which not only uses magnetic field tumor localization, but also connects to the ligand that can specifically bind to transferrin receptor (TfR) for active targeting [84]. Despite these advances, several challenges remain, including ligand stability during circulation, limited scalability of functionalization processes, and risks of off-target interactions. Computational modeling and high-throughput AI screening are now being employed to optimize ligand density and orientation, thus ensuring maximal targeting efficiency.

Beyond serving as drug carriers, certain nanomaterials possess inherent biological activity that actively modulates cellular processes, positioning them as standalone regenerative agents [85]. Graphene oxide (GO), a two-dimensional carbon nanomaterial, has gained attention for its unique physicochemical properties, including high surface area, mechanical strength, and tunable surface chemistry [86]. In this study, a novel mineral-organic nanocomposite hydrogel is developed for bone tissue regeneration. GO enriched with naturally occurring copper (PP) is used as the drug delivery system to prepare nano-composite hydrogels composed of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDA). The cellular compatibility and bone immune-regulating properties of these hydrogels are systematically studied in vitro [87]. Additionally, in vitro model of ischemic stroke, the effects of functionalized GO treatment on excitotoxicity are evaluated. Cultured neuron cells are exposed to an oxygen-deprived and glucose-deficient environment for one hour, or to a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity for 30 min, followed by treatment with functional GO. This intervention reduces neuronal cell death and preserves synaptic integrity, likely by mitigating glutamate-induced overactivation. These findings suggest that functional GO may contribute to developing alternative therapeutic strategies for excitotoxicity [88].

Other nanomaterials with intrinsic regenerative properties include bioactive glass NPs and black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets. A recent study demonstrates that doping copper into mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (Cu-MBGNs) enhances bone regeneration by promoting osteoblast mitochondrial autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. This is accompanied by increased amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) release and improves biomineralization, ultimately accelerating mitochondrial-mediated bone repair processes [89]. BP has recently been identified as an effective antibacterial agent. It is the most stable physical form of phosphorus, consisting of two-dimensional layers (known as “phosphene”), similar to how graphite is made up of many layers of graphene. It exhibits potent antibacterial activity by arranging itself in nanoscale thin layers through its unique ability to produce reactive oxygen species. Application of nanoscale black phosphorus sheets to wounds infected with drug-resistant superbugs not only kills pathogens but also promotes wound healing. Unlike conventional surface coatings, BP can be incorporated into common materials such as dressings, gels, and plastics [90]. BP nanosheets (BPNS) have also been shown to promote angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. In a rat wound model, application of a GelMA/BPNS hydrogel significantly reduces inflammation while promoting angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and skin re-epithelialization by releasing BPNS [91].

Nanomaterials also play a critical role in modulating immune responses to improve regenerative outcomes. One example is a multifunctional nanoparticle (TMgP) engineered to simultaneously regulate immune modulation, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. These TMgPs are formed via biomimetic mineralization and subsequently self-assemble into a metal-polyphenol network (MPN) mediated by tannic acid (TA), which can be sustained in gelatin frozen gels. Upon release, TMgP promotes the polarization of macrophages from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the regenerative M2 phenotype, hinders osteoclast maturation, enhances ADSC osteogenic differentiation, and boosts HUVEC angiogenic capacity. Additionally, this material effectively promotes bone repair in mouse cranial defect models. These findings underscore the importance of coordinated regulation among the immune, osteogenic, and angiogenic systems in promoting bone regeneration [92]. Cerium oxide (CeO2) NPs with antioxidant enzyme-mimetic activity can scavenge ROS in ischemic tissues. CeO2NPs can significantly reduce infarct size by neutralizing ROS and preserving mitochondrial function, thereby enhancing endogenous antioxidant defense [93].

Nanomedicine has transcended its origins as a passive drug delivery system to become an active agent in regenerative therapy, capable of stabilizing fragile therapeutics, targeting specific tissues, and directly modulating cellular repair processes. Liposomes, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs have each carved niches in enhancing drug stability and bioavailability, while surface functionalization strategies (peptides, antibodies, and responsive ligands) have ushered in an era of precision targeting. Importantly, many nanomaterials now blur the line between carriers and therapeutics, offering intrinsic properties that synergize with delivered drugs. Nevertheless, the challenges remain in terms of manufacturing scalability, biocompatibility, and clinical translation. Future research must prioritize the intelligent design of NP that can adapt to dynamic physiological microenvironments, the development of a hybrid system combining targeting and intrinsic bioactivity, and rigorous safety assessments to meet regulatory standards. By addressing these challenges, nanomedicine is poised to redefine regenerative therapy, transforming it from a concept to holistic tissue regeneration.

Bioengineered MNs have emerged as a revolutionary platform for transdermal drug delivery, bridging the gap between conventional hypodermic injections and passive topical formulations. Their minimally invasive nature, ability to bypass the stratum corneum, and compatibility with diverse therapeutic cargoes will position them as ideal candidates for advancing nanomedicine. By integrating NPs into MN systems, the resulting NP-MN platforms provide unprecedented opportunities for controlled, targeted, and synergistic delivery of therapeutics. In this review, three critical dimensions of this integration are explored, including the strategies for incorporating NPs into MNs, co-delivery approaches using various types of NPs, and the spatiotemporal control of therapeutic release via stimuli-responsive systems. These include MNs responsive to ROS, pH ultrasound, temperature, near-infrared (NIR) light, magnetic fields, ions, and glucose (Fig.4). In addition, the type and biomaterials of MNs, drug loading carriers, functions and challenges in tissue regeneration are summarized (Table2). Collectively, these advancements highlight the transformative potential of bioengineered MNs as multifunctional platforms for next-generation nanomedicine in tissue engineering and regenerative therapy.

The successful integration of NPs into bioengineered MN systems hinges on the development of robust loading strategies that preserve NP stability, enhance bioavailability, and enable controlled release. Various MN loading methods are used to construct drug-loaded engineered MNs, including solution casting, coating and thermal molding (Fig.5). The primary challenge lies in preserving the structural and functional integrity of NPs during MN fabrication, which often involves harsh conditions such as high temperature, UV crosslinking, or solvent exposure. To address these problems, various physical and chemical loading approaches have been developed to tailor the properties of both the NPs and the MN matrix. Physical encapsulation is the most straightforward approach, wherein NPs are dispersed directly into the polymer precursor solution before MN molding. For instance, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) NPs are first dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mixed with methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA), then cast into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with an ordered conical groove structure. A pure MeHA precursor solution is layered over the mold and crosslinked under violet light to obtain an MN array with a defined Young’s modulus [109]. However, this approach may result in uneven NP distribution or premature leakage, particularly for hydrophilic NPs. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly has been employed to load the biofunctional NPs into MNs. This method involves the alternate deposition of NPs and oppositely charged polymers onto MN surfaces, enhancing loading efficiency and enabling sequential release kinetics [110]. The LbL technique employs alternating electrostatic deposition of NPs and polymers onto MN surfaces. The resulting MNs enable immune activation in human skin ex vivo after just one minute of insertion, as evidenced by rapid uptake of vaccine adjuvants by antigen-presenting cells [111]. Chemical conjugation offers an alternative strategy, wherein NPs are covalently bound or anchored through affinity interactions. Gold NPs functionalized with thiol groups can be tethered to cysteine-rich regions within silk fibroin MNs, ensuring firm attachment and reducing initial burst release [112].

The co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents via bioengineered MNs represents a promising strategy for treating complex diseases, where synergistic interactions between NP-based targeting and MN-mediated delivery significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy [113]. A landmark example is the co-encapsulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) within HA-based dissolving MNs for diabetic wound healing [114]. Individually, VEGF promotes angiogenesis, while FGF stimulates fibroblast proliferation and ECM synthesis. The HA-based MN matrix not only protects these proteins from enzymatic degradation but also provides a sustained release profile through gradual dissolution upon skin insertion. In cancer immunotherapy, exosomes have been co-loaded with siRNA into MN systems to enhance therapeutic synergy. In a melanoma model, MNs are used to co-deliver tumor antigen. This dual-delivery system promotes dendritic cell activation and enhances T-cell cytotoxicity [115]. The MN arrays facilitate intradermal deposition of the exosomes, which then traffic to lymph nodes, while the siRNA silences immune checkpoints, reducing systemic toxicity and improving immune response specificity. Another notable advancement in co-delivery strategies involves the incorporation of pH-responsive NPs into microneedle systems for combinatorial therapy [116]. MNs containing doxorubicin-loaded chitosan NPs (responsive to tumor acidosis) are developed for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer [117]. Upon skin insertion, the MN tips dissolve to release lipid NPs carrying siRNA, thereby suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the chitosan NPs accumulate in the acidic tumor milieu and release doxorubicin to induce tumor cell apoptosis. This spatiotemporally staggered release strategy reduces off-target effects and improves survival outcomes in preclinical trials. However, effective co-delivery remains technical challenges. Key considerations include optimizing the loading ratio of disparate cargoes, preventing intermolecular interaction, and matching release kinetics to therapeutic timeline [118,119]. For example, growth factors requiring early release to prime tissue repair are best loaded in the outer layers of the MN matrix, while exosomes or siRNA with delayed action can be embedded deeper within the matrix. Overall, these examples illustrate that NP–MN co-delivery systems can overcome the limitations of single-agent therapy, offering a powerful and flexible platform for personalized and regenerative medicine.

Achieving spatiotemporal control over drug release is a cornerstone of precision medicine. Stimuli-responsive MN systems have emerged to meet this challenge by leveraging pathological or external triggers [120]. A pH-responsive photodynamic probe is synthesized and assembled with a ROS-reactive carbon monoxide (CO) donor, then encapsulated in HA-based MN patches to create a therapeutic platform. The MNs enhance the mechanical penetration of the molecular probe and CO donor into the biofilm at the wound infection site. The nanoprobes can generate ROS to directly eliminate bacteria through oxidative damage and trigger the release of CO for auxiliary gas therapy [121]. Conversely, in an acidic tumor microenvironment, MNs with poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) coatings degrade rapidly, unleashing chemotherapeutics like paclitaxel [122]. Temperature-responsive MNs, often formulated with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), enable on-demand drug release upon mild external heating [123,124]. Light-activated systems generate heat to melt the surrounding matrix by gold nanorod-embedded MNs to trigger drug release [125]. In addition, other smart MN systems responsive to ROS, mechanical force, magnetic fields, and electrical stimuli are being explored for applications in tissue engineering [126].

Enzyme-responsive MNs leverage the overexpression of disease-associated proteases to achieve targeted drug release in tissue regeneration applications [127]. An enzyme-responsive MN patch is designed for bacterial infection and accelerated healing of diabetic wounds [128]. The multifunctional hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) core-shell MN patch with sodium alginate is developed as a moisture layer to maintain the moisture balance in the wound exudate. The chitosan adhesive layer is coated on MNs. Sufficient strength of MNs promotes the penetration into the biofilm and induces dispersion. The continual release of basic fibroblast growth factor from the CMCS core can accelerate angiogenesis, collagen synthesis and immunity modulation, working synergistically with biodegraded HAMA. Despite these advancements, the hurdles remain in ensuring trigger specificity, avoiding premature activation during storage, and scaling up manufacturing. Additionally, the biocompatibility of stimuli-responsive materials also warrants rigorous evaluation [129]. Nevertheless, these systems epitomize the fusion of nanotechnology and smart biomaterials, paving the way for autonomous drug delivery in bioengineered MNs.

The convergence of MN technology and nanomedicine has catalyzed a new era of transdermal therapeutics, characterized by enhanced precision, versatility, and patient compliance [130]. Loading strategies for NPs have evolved to accommodate a wide range of cargoes while preserving their bioactivity. Co-delivery cases underscore the ability of combining growth factors, exosomes, and siRNA to address diseases through a synergistic mechanism [131]. Meanwhile, stimuli-responsive systems have redefined spatiotemporal control, enabling context-dependent release that aligns with pathological cues. As the field develops, interdisciplinary collaboration will be pivotal in overcoming scalability challenges and translating. By leveraging the modular and minimally invasive nature of bioengineered MNs, this integrated platform is poised to redefine conventional drug delivery and establish a new paradigm in precision regenerative medicine.

The integration of bioengineered MNs with nanomedicine has present transformative potential for targeted therapies. However, successful clinical translation depends on overcoming several persistent biological barriers, including cellular uptake efficiency, immune evasion, and long-term biosafety [132]. Advances in nanoscale engineering—such as PEGylation and biomimetic coatings—have shown promise in reducing immune clearance and enhancing in vivo stability. Moreover, the scalability and reproducibility of hybrid MN-nanomedicine systems remain pivotal for clinical adoption [133]. Challenges remain in minimizing batch-to-batch variability in NP synthesis, ensuring precision in MN fabrication, and maintaining NP stability during MN processing. Advances in microfluidic-based NP synthesis and 3D-printed MN molds have significantly improved uniformity. Additionally, the long-term biosafety and biodegradability of MN-nanomedicine systems must be rigorously addressed for tissue regeneration. Natural polymers (HA and silk fibroin) degrade into non-toxic byproducts, while synthetic materials (PLGA, PVP) require careful evaluation of degradation kinetics and metabolite accumulation [134]. Inorganic NPs, with highly functional properties, raise concerns regarding persistent bioaccumulation. To enhance biodegradability, enzymatically cleavable linkers (matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive peptides) have been incorporated into NPs systems to enable controlled degradation in tissue-specific environments [135].

MNs and nanomedicine are facing many challenges in tissue engineering, including mechanical properties and tissue adaptability, drug loading and release, biocompatibility and safety, manufacturing and cost. MNs should show enough mechanical strength to penetrate skin or other tissues, and at the same time, they should also avoid causing damage to tissues. Coated MNs can only deliver a small amount of drug, and the loss of drug on the skin surface is large. The biocompatibility of MN materials is necessary to ensure that they don’t cause an immune response or inflammation. The manufacturing process of MNs is complex, especially for complex geometries and multifunction. The transformation of micro-needle and nano-medicine from laboratory to clinic also faces many challenges, including quality control, large-scale production and clinical trial design. Overcoming biological barriers in MN-mediated nanomedicine delivery requires a versatile approach that integrates stealth engineering, intracellular targeting, anti-fibrotic strategy, scalable manufacturing, and rigorous safety assessments [136]. Innovations in biomimetic coating, stimuli-responsive systems, and biodegradable materials are bridging the gap between preclinical promise and clinical reality [137]. Future efforts must prioritize closed-loop systems capable of dynamically responding to disease states. Such intelligent and adaptive platforms will be critical to unlocking the full potential of MN–nanomedicine integration, ultimately advancing the frontier of precision regenerative medicine.

Bioengineered MNs have played a crucial role in transdermal drug delivery for wound repair and skin regeneration by enabling direct drug administration to targeted lesion sites, minimizing systemic immune-related side effects, and promoting skin regeneration [137–140]. MN-mediated therapies for superficial disease therapy have been widely studied in bioengineered MNs to improve the penetration ability of biofunctional NPs and facilitate targeted delivery through a minimally invasive manner and reversible microchannels [141]. Bioengineered MNs have been applied for wound repair and skin regeneration, including wound therapy, scar repair, psoriasis treatment, and alopecia management [142]. Notably, MN systems designed to respond to the biofilm microenvironment—such as self-enhancing photodynamic immunomodulatory MNs—have demonstrated significant potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds (Fig.6a) [143].

Antibacterial and angiogenic chitosan MNs array (CSMNA) patches have been developed to promote wound healing [144]. These biomass-derived CSMNA patches are designed to integrate with smart, responsive drug delivery systems for enhanced therapeutic outcomes (Fig.6b). In this MN platform, CS possesses the natural antibacterial property for wound healing, while the microstructure of MNs achieves the effective drug-loaded delivery into the targeting regions. The smart drug release can be controllably delivered based on the temperature-responsive system induced by the inflammation response. In parallel, multifunctional magnesium organic framework (Mg-MOFs)-based MNs have been engineered for the treatment of diabetic wounds [96]. These MNs incorporate poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) hydrogel-encapsulated Mg-MOFs within the needle tips, enabling sustained release of bioactive magnesium ions (Mg²+) and gallic acid directly into the dermis. Mg2+facilitates cell migration and endothelial tubulogenesis, while gallic acid exhibits strong antioxidation effects. In vivo studies, diabetic wound models have confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of Mg-MOF–loaded MNs in promoting tissue repair. Therapeutic applications of MNs and nanomedicine show innovative potential in skin repair. MNs can penetrate the stratum corneum by minimally invasive delivery to improve the transdermal absorption efficiency of drugs. This MN platform can reduce inflammatory reactions and immune responses. In addition, the application of MNs in the skin repair has the characteristics of precise treatment, rapid delivery, economy, wide application range and high safety. Collectively, these examples highlight the crucial role of bioengineered MNs as versatile and multifunctional platforms for regulating wound healing and skin regeneration.

Bioengineered MNs integrated with diverse NPs have shown promising therapeutic efficacy to enhance the penetration depth and structural stability in dynamic tumor treatment while simultaneously supporting tissue regeneration in various tumor models. Wearable flexible ultrasound MN patches are prepared as a drug delivery platform for cancer immunotherapy (Fig.7a) [145]. For superficial skin cancers, MN-assisted nanomedicine platforms have been employed to achieve targeted release of therapeutic agents at tumor sites [146,147]. The natural polymeric tea polyphenols (TP NPs) are designed to self-assemble and load ALA (ALA@TP NPs) as the biofunctional drug NPs to induce apoptosis and necrosis in A375 and A431 cells [148]. When encapsulated into bioengineered MNs (ALA@TP NPs@MNs), the system enhances ALA stability and skin penetration, exhibiting significant antitumor efficacy in vivo. In another example, polypyrrole (PPy) NPs are incorporated into chitosan (CS)-based MNs to enable synergistic photothermal and chemotherapeutic effects for melanoma therapy [149]. The physically cross-linked CS matrix accommodates PPy NPs for photothermal ability and facilitates drug loading and sustained release. The MNs show intrinsic antimelanoma capacity and exhibit increased effectiveness against melanoma. In addition, self-heating multistage MN Patches have been designed for the topical therapy of skin cancer [150]. The dissolvable-based MNs with thymoquinone are prepared for sustained drug release as a degradable tip of MNs, which allows the MN patch for prolonged tumor suppression. The self-heating MNs show great potential for clinical application in skin cancer therapy.

Intelligent MNs have emerged as advanced bioengineered platforms for the precise treatment of skin cancers and wound healing. For instance, an MN-mediated platform has been designed into a human skin-on-a-chip model for efficient skin tumor therapy [151]. This platform incorporates vascular, dermal, and epidermal layers and is prepared in a microfluidic device by bioprinting/bioengineering methods. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded GelMA MNs are detected for localized transdermal delivery, achieving a penetration depth of approximately 600 μm to effectively target melanoma cells. This approach demonstrates enhanced delivery efficiency and confirms the practicality and robustness of the cancer-on-a-chip model for skin tumor therapy. In another approach, a piezoelectric-driven (PD) MN platform has been developed for skin disease treatment by high-efficiency, safe, and non-invasive photodynamic therapy (Fig.7b) [152]. This PDMN platform induces deep tissue cavitation to increase the level of protoporphyrin IX and enhance drug penetration. In a clinical trial involving 25 patients, the PDMN-assisted PDT significantly improves treatment efficacy while reducing the required incubation time and drug concentration. Further, AI-driven hydrogel MN patches have been designed to enhance non-melanoma skin cancer therapy by incorporating 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inclusion complex-loaded PEGylated liposomes [153]. AI algorithms are utilized to design, optimize, and evaluate the NP-loaded MNs by assessing the accuracy. The physicochemical feature, mechanical property, swelling behavior, skin permeation, and safety are investigated to effectively inhibit tumor growth and promote cancer cell apoptosis. These smart NP-loaded MNs may promise new treatment avenues for skin cancers. Compared with traditional cancer therapies, MNs can penetrate deeply into tumor tissues and accurately deliver drugs to tumor sites. This minimally invasive technique will not damage nerves and improve patients’ acceptance and compliance during tumor treatment. Drugs released by MNs can not only kill tumors, but also induce the activation of immune cells and enhance the immune defense. In addition, MNs can be combined with other therapies (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy) to achieve tumor synergistic treatment.

Bioengineered MNs have been effectively utilized to encapsulate bioactive compounds, exosomes, and nucleic acids to treat cardiovascular diseases, including MI, myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis [154,155]. The advantages of bioengineered MNs in the cardiovascular system lie in their minimally invasive, accuracy, and controllability to deliver exogenous NPs into myocardial tissues [156]. Unlike traditional injections, MNs only penetrate the epidermis, avoiding the pain and risk of traditional injections [157]. Cardiac cell-integrated MN patch is used for treating MI to result in cardiac function protection (Fig.8a). This approach reduces systemic drug distribution and mitigates associated cardiac side effects [158]. Additionally, BP-loaded separable MNs have been developed as responsive oxygen delivery systems to promote wound healing in engineered tissues [159]. Another innovative example includes conductive MNs integrated with indu160ced cardiomyocytes and aligned carbon nanotubes, designed to restore cardiac function post-MI by enhancing tissue conductivity and promoting synchronized contraction (Fig.8b) []. By designing MN materials and structures, the drug can be released into damaged cardiac tissues regularly and quantitatively [161].

Cardiovascular ischemic diseases can be efficiently treated by NP-loaded MNs to restore cardiac function [162]. Bioengineered MN-mediated patch is loaded with exosomes containing microRNA-29b (miR-29b) to prevent cardiac fibrosis after MI. The exosome-loaded MNs show antifibrotic activity to alleviate excessive cardiac fibrosis in the MI model [163]. These exosome-loaded MNs improve exosome retention in the infarcted myocardium and exhibit antifibrotic activity by reducing inflammation, limiting infarct size, suppressing fibrosis, and enhancing overall cardiac function [164]. Additionally, SUC-based MNs have been shown to increase the effect of IL-4 by more potent reprogramming of pro-regenerative M2-like macrophages via the JAK-STAT pathway. Specifically, the IL-4/SUC-based MNs accelerate wound healing in diabetic mice wounds and porcine wounds [165]. The detachable therapeutic MNs with the tips of elastin-like polypeptide gel are encapsulated with mesenchymal stromal cell-secreted factors (MSCF)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) NPs (Fig.8c), which is designed for insertion into the infarcted myocardium for efficient NP-controlled release. This approach reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis, restores myocardium volume, and mitigates fibrosis during cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, the ROS and ultrasound dual-responsive bilayer MN array has been designed for in-situ sequential therapy of acute MI [166]. The upper MN layer is fabricated using ROS-sensitive linker crosslinked with polyvinyl alcohol and loaded with cerium dioxide NPs (CeNPs). This dual-responsive platform provides pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic effects, promoting NO-mediated cardiac repair and reducing adverse remodeling. In comparison with intravenous injection and traditional surgery, MNs show the potential of accurate delivery, reducing inflammation, improving drug efficacy and combined treatment for CVD therapy. MNs can deliver cells, regenerative factors and drugs, promote myocardial repair and vascular regeneration, and improve heart function. Collectively, these bioengineered MNs with bioactive NPs play a vital role in the protection of cardiac function in cardiovascular repair and regeneration.

The tip-like microstructures of bioengineered MNs enable their insertion into bone and cartilage tissues, allowing for the direct delivery of drugs and bioactive substances to targeted sites [172,168]. In the context of bone/cartilage repair, MNs have been used for localized drug delivery to promote tissue regeneration. Positioning regulation of organelle network is detected by bioengineered MNs to target the mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) complex, thereby restoring cellular function in diseased chondrocytes (Fig.9a) [169]. Furthermore, self-powered triboelectric-responsive MNs with controllable release of optogenetically engineered extracellular vesicles have been created for intervertebral disc degeneration repair [170]. Optogenetically engineered EVs deliver TRAM1 protein into senescent nucleus pulposus cells to reconstruct the elimination function of TREX1. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) harvests mechanical energy and triggers the controlled release of EVs, offering an MN-based strategy for degenerative disc disease therapy.

The MN-delivered PDA@Exo platform has been investigated for multifaceted osteoarthritis (OA) therapy through modulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (Fig.9b) [171]. These PDA@Exo MNs present strong ROS scavenging ability and excellent biocompatibility, thereby promoting osteogenesis and maintaining anabolic processes in cartilage. This MN system effectively prevents cartilage degradation and halts OA progression, thus highlighting its disease-modifying outcomes [172]. These MN patches exhibit high biocompatibility, excellent antioxidant properties, and adequate mechanical properties, facilitating the delivery of functional NPs to target sites. The therapeutic effect is mediated via the downregulation of inflammatory signaling pathways such as JAK-STAT and NF-κB. Furthermore, HA-based dissolving MN patches with acupoint transdermal delivery of triptolide (TP) have been developed for effective rheumatoid arthritis treatment [173]. These TP-loaded MNs alleviate the inflammatory response in adjuvant-induced arthritis rats, joint swelling, and bone erosion. Bioengineered MNs can overcome the specific challenges of low delivery efficiency, poor treatment effect and inflammatory reaction in bone and cartilage repair. The synergetic therapy of MNs with nanomaterials, electrostimulation and biological factors is employed to realize the innovative output for the efficient bone and cartilage repair. Collectively, the biofunctional MNs can deliver the bioengineered NPs into targeting regions in bone and cartilage for regenerative medicine.

Bioengineered MNs combined with micro-nano manufacturing technology and the characteristics of biomedical materials have a wide application prospect in tissue regeneration. These platforms offer innovative strategies for tissue regeneration and repair [174]. In addition to these applications in cancer therapy, cardiovascular disease management, wound healing, and bone/cartilage regeneration, bioengineered MNs also play an important role in nerve regeneration, adipose tissue restoration, and localized treatment of diabetes through targeted drug delivery [175–177].

Bioengineered MNs have great potential in the construction of tissue engineering scaffolds [178]. MNs can serve as three-dimensional scaffold structures that facilitate cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation due to their small size and high surface-area-to-volume ratio. These scaffolds exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, eliminating the need for secondary removal surgeries. Furthermore, MN technology enables precise control over scaffold pore architecture, allowing for uniformly distributed micropores that support cell migration, nutrient exchange and metabolic waste discharge [179]. By tailoring the pore size and spatial distribution, MN-based scaffolds can be engineered to optimize both physical integrity and biological functionality. Bioengineered MNs can be developed for biosensors and tissue monitoring [180]. These MNs are combined with biosensor technology to monitor the physiological and pathological state of tissues [181]. Through the incorporation of electrodes, optical probes, or other sensing components, MN-based sensors can detect key biochemical parameters—such as glucose levels, pH, and oxygen concentration—within tissues [181]. These sensors are minimally invasive and real-time to provide continuous physiological monitoring data for disease diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, MNs can be used to monitor cellular activity and ECM synthesis during tissue regeneration [183]. By tracking changes in cellular metabolites or ECM components, MNs provide microscopic information in tissue regeneration, thereby supporting optimization of treatment strategies.

There are also many challenges in MNs and nanomedicine for tissue regeneration, such as limited drug loading, weak material strength and poor biocompatibility. To improve the long-term safety and biocompatibility, natural and biomaterials are applied to construct the MNs loaded with biofunctional NPs for excellent degradation and low immune response in vivo. Moreover, these MNs also have many difficulties in clinical application: (1) insufficiently minimal invasion in many MN techniques needs to be implanted through open surgery, which not only increases the surgical risk of patients, but also may lead to postoperative complications; (2) tissue adhesion is poor, and the MN patch has insufficient adhesion on the tissue surface; (3) the controllability of drug release is weak, and MN technology needs to realize accurate drug release, but the current release mechanism is not perfect. Although thermosensitive hydrogel can release drugs in response to body temperature, its release rate and duration need to be further optimized. In addition, there are many problems in the production and quality control of MNs, such as the difficulty of mass production, cost-effectiveness issues, quality standards and supervision, clinical acceptance and supervision of clinical trials. Advanced 3D bioprinting and micromanufacturing are employed to address the challenges for large-scale and cost-effective manufacturing of these complex bioengineered systems. Furthermore, patient compliance and acceptability in MN delivery are considered to enhance patients’ comfort, ease of application and adherence, especially for chronic conditions requiring repeated administration, such as CVDs, dermatosis and cancers. Although MN technology has obvious potential in tissue regeneration therapy, its clinical application still faces many challenges.

This review highlights the design principles, functional innovations, and application potential of bioengineered MNs in tissue regeneration. Bioengineered MNs are classified into dissolving, hydrogel-based, coated, and hollow MNs from the advanced biocompatible materials to reveal their action mechanism of controlled drug release kinetics, provision of mechanical support, and minimally invasive access to deep tissues. The evolution of nanomedicine from passive carriers to active modulators is discussed, emphasizing enhancements in drug stability, bioavailability, targeted delivery strategy, and regenerative ability [184–186]. The synergistic integration of MNs with nanomedicine provides a versatile therapeutic platform, supported by chemical, physical, and biological NP-loading strategies that enable co-delivery and spatiotemporally controlled release. The biological barriers, including cell uptake and immunogenicity, are described in tissue regeneration via force-sensing mechanotransduction [187–190]. Finally, the clinical potential of MN-nanomedicine system is explored across multiple domains, including wound repair, skin cancer treatment, cardiovascular repair, and cartilage/bone repair, with additional prospects in tissue engineering scaffolds, biosensing, and real-time tissue monitoring [191–193].

Currently, various MNs are applied to evaluate their clinical potential through some clinical and preclinical trials. For instance, in a recent phase I/II trial (time period: 2022–2026) with the national clinical trial (NCT) number ofNCT05329532, modi-1/modi-1v vaccine is used as the targeted drug in hollow MNs to treat breast, head, and neck, ovarian, or renal cancers [194]. Microinjection MNs are used to conduct the clinical trials for tissue regeneration. A phase III study (NCT02595398) employs 160 patients to receive triamcinolone acetonide (TA) treatment by microinjection to present the enhancement for best-corrected visual acuity [195,196]. Furthermore, dissolving MNs are evaluated to investigate the acceptability, biosafety and immunogenicity in influenza vaccination by analyzing 100 participants. The water-soluble polymeric platform is encapsulated with three seasonal influenza vaccine strains to prepare the arrays of MNs [197]. MN patches are well tolerated and show consistent antibody responses to intramuscular microinjection in clinical trials. In addition, adverse events are not reported in these trials. Coated MN patches are also used to perform the clinical trials (NCT02459938andNCT02745392) by delivering targeting cargos [194,198]. These clinical trials show that engineered MNs are widely applied in tissue regeneration for potential clinical applications.

The integration of bioengineered MNs with nanomedicine represents a transformative alliance in tissue regeneration, addressing the shortcomings of traditional therapies through localized, controlled, and combinatorial delivery [199]. By circumventing biological barriers and leveraging nanoscale precision, this integration enables targeted modulation of pathological microenvironments in chronic wounds, organ injuries, and degenerative conditions [200–202]. Despite remaining challenges in scalability and regulatory approval, advancements in biomaterials, drug formulation, and biofabrication herald a bright future, where regenerative therapies are effective, precise, and patient-friendly [203]. The emerging technologies and synergistic approaches about engineered MNs and nanomedicine hold significant promise to integrate them with artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning for personalized medicine and complex tissue construction by 3D/4D bioprinting. Furthermore, other challenges for MN and nanomedicine in tissue regeneration refer to drug loading capacity, precise targeting efficiency, stability of loaded therapeutics and potential off-target effects. As the field evolves, the convergence of MNs with emerging technologies, such as wearable sensors, AI-driven dosing algorithms, and CRISPR-based therapeutics, will further solidify their role as cornerstones of next-generation regenerative medicine [204,205].
