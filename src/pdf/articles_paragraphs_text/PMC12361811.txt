The research was designed to explore the causal relationship between the changing landscape of 63 mitochondrial proteins and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by Mendelian randomization.

Use SNPs significantly associated with IBD and their subtypes as instrumental variables. Various methods were utilized to assess the causal relation between mitochondrial function and the onset of IBD and their subtypes.

The results after FDR onpvalues indicated that Peptide chain release factor 1‐like was a causative factor for IBD. NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2, hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase 9, pyruvate carboxylase, apoptosis‐inducing factor 1, and transmembrane protein 70 with inflammatory bowel disease were identified as protective factors. Peptide chain release factor 1‐like and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2 were identified as causal and protective factors for IBD, respectively. In addition, GrpE protein homolog 1, 39S ribosomal protein L33, and tRNA pseudouridine synthase A are pathogenic in Crohn's disease, and Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase and Pyruvate carboxylase are protective factors. The MR‐presso method rejected outlier SNPs. The relative stability of the outcome data was assessed and validated at multiple levels by various statistical tests including pleiotropy test, heterogeneity test, and Steiger test.

This study established a causal relationship between mitochondrial biological function and IBD, including its subtypes.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents the complex, multi‐factorial immunologically mediated inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, typically chronic and prone to relapse [1]. As its etiology and pathogenesis have not been fully clarified, the clinical typology of IBD is mainly based on the site of occurrence as well as the clinical manifestations, of which the prevalent types are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [2]. The CD presents discontinuous transmural inflammation which may spread throughout the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by distinctive histological granulomas. UC, on the other hand, exhibits inflammation localized to the mucosa, often involving the rectum and continuing to extend into the proximal part of the colon [3]. IBD is recognized as a worldwide health concern, experiencing an escalating prevalence in emerging urbanized nations and a stable, but still escalating, increase over westernized nations. Available clinical data show that the maximum incidence of the disease is mainly between the ages of 15 to 30, and that about 10% of cases are identified prior to adulthood [4,5]. Current treatment modalities encompass biologics, immunomodulators, aminosalicylates, and corticosteroids [6,7]. However, treatment outcomes vary significantly due to the heterogeneity of the disease among patients, posing a challenge to therapeutic strategies [8]. Therefore, it is of vital importance to further study the etiology and regulatory processes in IBD to identify novel treatment goals and develop useful intervention strategies. It is worth noting that distinctions among IBD subtypes may also result in variations in potential therapeutic targets.

Mitochondria, as unique double‐membrane organelles containing soluble substrates and distinct gene sets, are the major location where adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is synthesized [9]. In contrast, about 90% of ATP, which is the main energetic flux for cellular physiological and biochemical processes in the human body, is produced by oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. This suggests the importance of mitochondrial structure and function in energy metabolism. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that mitochondrial function in the gastrointestinal epithelium is important for sustaining intestinal health, and that there is a strong link between mitochondrial dysfunction and IBD [10,11]. It is well known that significant shedding of intestinal epithelial cells occurs in IBD. This poses a higher challenge to the renewal function of intestinal stem cells [12]. Whereas mitochondrial respiration and metabolism conversion are critical drivers of the fate of Lgr5+ crypt base columnar stem cells, which are rich in leucine‐rich repeat‐containing G protein‐coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5+) [13,14]. Paneth cells, which are closely related to intestinal immunity, have also been reported to be highly susceptible to CD‐related mitochondrial dysfunction [15]. In addition, the release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial damage‐associated molecular patterns contribute to UC inflammation [16]. Various quality control mechanisms maintain mitochondrial pool health, with mitochondrial autophagy proven to prevent UC [17]. Evidence from these studies suggests that we IBD and development are closely related to changes in mitochondrial function. Targeting the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction may be a novel strategy for treating IBD. Thus, identifying mitochondrial targets that are significantly causally linked to IBD has far‐reaching therapeutic value.

In traditional epidemiological research, associations between exposure and outcomes may be influenced by unmeasured confounders and reverse causation, limiting the ability to draw causal inferences. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies utilize genome‐wide association study (GWAS) data, employing genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) [18]. These models aim to assess the associations between risk factors (exposure) and various outcomes (disease types), mitigating the impact of confounders and reversing the direction of causal inference [19]. This study aims to examine the causal relationship between mitochondrial proteins and inflammatory bowel disease through MR analysis based on GWAS data.

In this study, Mitochondrial GWAS data for 63 mitochondrial proteins were utilized as exposure variables. SNPs significantly linked to IBD and its subtypes (UC and CD) were chosen as IVs, with IBD‐related data as outcome variables [20].

GWAS data related to 63 kinds of mitochondrial proteins were obtained from databases such as UKB. Sixty‐three kinds of mitochondrial proteins include four kinds of GWAS data (TableS1) [21,22,23,24]. GWAS summarized statistics about IBD were obtained from FinnGen + pan‐UKBB meta‐analysis results, which is the largest IBD GWAS data available (all variants recognized: 20 175 454 variants; total sample size: 377 277). Notably, the GWAS data associated with IBD includes statistics for UC and CD (Table1) [25].

MR analyses as a novel statistical method rely on three basic assumptions: (1) the assumption of correlation: the strong correlation is assumed to exist between IVs and exposure factor; (2) independence assumption: the IVs and the outcome variable, that is, IBD and its subtypes, are independent of any other confounders; (3) exclusivity assumption: the IVs can only influence IBD through regulation of mitochondrial activity, without involving any other pathway (Figure1). In order to determine appropriate IVs, we initially chose SNPs that strongly related to IVs as IVs, with a selection criterion ofp< 5e−08. However, when apvalue of 5e−08 was chosen, the number of available SNPswas too limited, with only 10 mitochondrial proteins having multiple SNPs; so we finally chosep< 5e−06 as the criterion [26] (TableS2).

The methods and experimental design of Mendelian randomization.

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the chance that alleles belonging to two or more gene loci will occur together on a chromosome more often than randomly. The selection criteria are the following: (1) kb > 10 000; (2)r2< 0.001. And “kb” represents the range of the regional LD, while “r2” is evaluated from 0 to 1. The closer ther2value is to 0, the more likely it is to be perfectly linked and balanced; the more likely the assignment of two SNPs is to be completely random [27].

MAF represents minor allele frequency, and SNPs refer to mutations that occur in a certain proportion of the population. Typically, when performing SNP filtering, the MAF threshold should be greater than 0.01, meaning that the mutation exists in at least 1% of the population [28].

βrepresents the SNPs' influence size on the exposure factor.

Five approaches (Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW), MR Egger, Weighted Median, Simple Mode and Weighted Mode) have been used in this study to ascertain causality between mitochondrial proteins (exposure factors) and IBD (outcome factors) (TablesS3–S5). Of these, the IVW method was considered to be the primary measure of the reliability of MR analyses with multiple SNPs; whenp< 0.05, it indicates that the causality was judged as a positive result. Moreover, the “TwoSampleMR” R package is used to visualize the outcome, including scatter and forest plots, plus sensitivity analysis maps [29].

The principle of MR does not allow for IVs to directly influence the results without the exposure factor, which would lead to horizontal pleiotropy in the test results. Therefore, we utilized the MR Polytropic Residuals and Outliers (MR‐PRESSO) testing to examine SNPs that brought about horizontal polytropy (Nb Distribution = 1000, Significant Threshold = 0.05), which was performed by the “MR‐PRESSO” software R package. MR‐PRESSO is determined by calculating the IVW result with the removal of the SNP and the residual sum of squares of the effect and IVW result of that SNP to the line of fit calculated with the removal of that SNP, and the sum of squares of the residuals from the IVW result, which ultimately yields the distance from that SNP to the line of fit calculated by removing that SNP. The greater the value of the sum of squared residuals (distance) calculated for each SNP, the more significant the horizontal pleiotropy was indicated. SNPs with horizontal pleiotropy will be removed [30].

Because of variations of the platform, experiments, and populations in GWAS data, instrumental variables may exhibit heterogeneity; thereby affecting the results of MR. This study utilized IVW and MR‐Egger measures for evaluating the heterogeneity of MR, withp< 0.05 indicating the existence of MR heterogeneity.

In addition, if an instrumental variable affects the results via factors outside of the exposure variable, it is indicative of pleiotropy. The presence of polymorphism would break the assumptions of independence and exclusivity. For assessing multiplicity and the robustness of the study results, we conducted the MR‐Egger intercept testing. Apvalue of less than 0.05 indicates that there is pleiotropy within the samples.

The “leave‐one‐out” method was used to perform sensitivity analysis. After systematically eliminating results associated with individual SNPs, they were assessed for being anomalous outliers based on a forest plot, which was also used to observe the stability of the results after the elimination of each SNP. The R programming language for generating funnel plots was also used for the sensitivity assessment, and the symmetry that the SNPs presented in the funnel plots was used to assess the reliability of the results [31].

As a tool used to examine causality between genotype and phenotype in genetics, directional testing is necessary for MR [32]. The Steiger test is a common statistical measure for testing the directionality of correlation coefficients. Its principle is based on conducting a one‐tailed test on the correlation coefficient to determine whether the relationship between two variables is positive or negative. This testing method can help researchers determine whether genotype has a significant impact on phenotype, as well as the direction of this impact.

The false discovery rate (FDR) is the proportion of false positives (rejection of the null hypothesis H0 when it is true) among all significant test results. The classical Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) method is a technique used to control the FDR, ensuring that FDR ≤p. The BH method adjusts the original hypotheses to ensure the maximization of true positive discoveries while controlling the FDR. In the BH method, if there are N hypothesis tests, thepvalue for each test is calculated. The calculatedpvalues are then ranked as an increasing sequence, and starting from the smallestpvalue, they are compared according to the following formula, where K is the ranking. The largestpvalue satisfying the inequality can then be found at the K position, and it can be considered significant, while the remainingpvalues are not significant [33].

We used the R software (version 4.3.2) to assess causality in MR analyses. The threshold of statistical significance waspvalues less than 0.05.

Nine proteins withp< 0.05 for IVW were tentatively considered to be causally associated with IBD: prot‐a‐63 (apoptosis‐inducing factor 1, mitochondria), prot‐a‐1356 (hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthetase, mitochondria), prot‐a‐2026 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2), mitochondria), prot‐a‐2190 (pyruvate carboxylase, mitochondria), prot‐a‐1942 (39S ribosomal protein L33, mitochondria), prot‐a‐1965 (peptide chain release factor 1‐like, mitochondria), prot‐a‐3015 (transmembrane protein 70, mitochondria). Among them, prot‐a‐63 (apoptosis‐inducing factor 1, mitochondria), prot‐a‐1965 (peptide chain release factor 1‐like, mitochondria) and prot‐a‐2026 (NDUFV2, mitochondria) were significantly IVW in UC, prot‐a‐2190 (Pyruvate carboxylase, mitochondrial), prot‐a‐1356 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase, mitochondrial) with prot‐a‐1942 (39S ribosomal protein L33, mitochondria) in the CD was significantly IVW. Notably, prot‐a‐1942 (39S ribosomal protein L33, mitochondria) in the CD was significantly IVW with ebi‐a‐GCST90019467 (GrpE protein homolog 1, mitochondrial measurement) also had significantpvalues for IVW, which was not found in IBD. In the end, we initially screened seven mitochondrial proteins that were significantly associated with IBD, three mitochondrial proteins that were significantly associated with UC, and five mitochondrial proteins that were significantly associated with CD (Figure2and TablesS6–S8). The GWAS‐ID, sample size, and number of SNPs for mitochondrial proteins with positive results are given in the table below (Table2).

Five MR methods screened for significant mitochondrial proteins associated with IBD and its subtypes.

Horizontal pleiotropy of SNPs was examined with the R‐programmed MR‐PRESSO package. In the MR analysis with IBD shown to be result, rs28929474 and rs78745329 were excluded, which were from prot‐a‐1942, and prot‐a‐63. rs78745329 was excluded in the MR analysis with UC as the outcome, which was derived from prot‐a‐63. rs12566888, rs35121814, rs144487948 were excluded in the MR analysis with CD as the outcome, and the first two SNPs were derived from ebi‐a‐GCST90019467 and the latter one from prot‐a‐2190. The number of SNPs used between each exposure and outcome is given in the following table (Table3).

Heterogeneity and pleiotropy were not present in MR analysis with IBD as the outcome, except for prot‐a‐1942, where heterogeneity was present. In MR analysis with UC as the outcome, no multivariate heterogeneity existed. No SNPs were considered to be present with pleiotropy in the MR analysis with CD as the outcome. Regarding this situation of heterogeneity with no pleiotropy in prot‐a‐1942, it is usually assessed using the Weighted Median method or the IVW‐multiplicative random effects model. The results of the Weighted Median method in prot‐a‐1942 remained significant (p< 0.05); meanwhile, in order to avoid the influence caused by heterogeneity, this paper then adopts the following MR analysis using the IVW‐multiplicative random effects model to conduct. Moreover, this paper took to verify the directionality of MR analysis using Steiger's directionality test, and all the results supported the causal relationship of mitochondrial proteins affecting IBD and its subtypes (Tables4andS9–S18). The Mendelian randomization leave‐one‐out sensitivity analysis shows no significant change in causality after removing a particular locus, and the effect remains stable, indicating that the model is relatively robust (Figure3). The funnel plot shows a symmetrical shape, indicating that the distribution of the different genotypes or phenotypes in the experiment is even, in line with Mendel's prediction (Figure4).

Heterogeneity tests, pleiotropy test, and Steiger testpvalues for IBD and its subtypes.

In the MR analysis with IBD as the outcome, prot‐a‐1942 was no longer significant because it was tested using Inverse variance weighted (multiplicative random effects). In the MR analysis with UC as the outcome, this paper utilized the MR‐PRESSO method to exclude the outlier SNP: rs78745329 in prot‐a‐63, which resulted in the IVW result between prot‐a‐63 and UC no longer being significant. Therefore, we visualized the IVW results for the remaining 13 MRs and took the FDR approach to correct thepvalue (TableS19).

The final results showed that in IBD, with the exception of prot‐a‐1965 (peptide chain release factor 1‐like) as a risk factor (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01–1.19), prot‐a‐1356 (hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase) (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.82–0.97), prot‐a‐2026 (NDUFV2) (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.80–0.97), prot‐a‐2190 (pyruvate carboxylase) (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.81–0.96), prot‐a‐3015 (transmembrane protein 70) (OR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.83–0.96), prot‐a‐63 (apoptosis‐ inducing factor 1) (OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.86–1.00) were protective factors. In UC, prot‐a‐1965 (peptide chain release factor 1‐like) (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.03–1.26) was a risk factor and prot‐a‐2026 (NDUFV2) (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.78–0.99) as a protective factor, both in the same direction as in IBD. In CD, ebi‐a‐GCST90019467 (GrpE protein homolog 1) (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.16–1.97), prot‐a‐1942 (pyruvate carboxylase) (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.00–1.20) were associated with prot‐a‐2454 (hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase) (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.02–1.51) as a risk factor and prot‐a‐1356 (39S ribosomal protein L33) (OR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.72–0.99), and prot‐a‐2190 (tRNA pseudouridine synthase A) as a defense elements. Notably, ebi‐a‐GCST90019467 (GrpE protein homolog 1) and prot‐a‐1942 (pyruvate carboxylase) did not show significance in the MR analysis of IBD versus UC (Figure5).

Causality between mitochondrial proteins and IBD and its subtypes. Abbreviations: CD, Crohn's disease; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; UC, ulcerative colitis.

In this paper, nine kinds of mitochondrial proteins causally related to IBD and its subtypes were unearthed by MR analysis. These results help to unearth potential targets for IBD therapy and also reveal the differences that exist at the mitochondrial level for subtypes of IBD. In the future, further mechanistic studies on the unearthed mitochondrial proteins are needed to reveal the pathways that induce IBD and why their proteins differ.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐CoA synthase (HMG‐CoA synthase) is a pivotal enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Its primary function lies in catalyzing the conversion of acetaldehyde and acetyl‐coenzyme A into hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA), which serves as the initiator of cholesterol synthesis. The activity of HMG‐CoA synthase plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cholesterol levels and regulating lipid metabolism. Studies have demonstrated that rosuvastatin, an HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitor, exhibits the ability to mitigate the colitis response in mice induced by sodium dextran sulfate [34]. Furthermore, investigations have revealed a downregulation of HMG‐CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) expression in intestinal epithelial cells under the specific conditions of IBD relating to endoplasmic reticulum stress [35]. These findings align with the conclusions drawn in the present study.

NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2) is encoded by the NDUFV2 gene expressed in human mitochondria. NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2 is a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, which is involved in the oxidative reduction of NADH to NAD+ and electron transmission to coenzyme Q in respiratory chain [36]. This process generates a proton gradient that is used to generate intracellular energy. However, its existence in association with IBD is reported for the first time, according to our limited search results so far.

Apoptosis‐inducing factor 1 is encoded by the AIFM1 gene and plays an important role in apoptosis [37]. A study indicated that AIFM1 is a core gene in ulcerative colitis‐associated colorectal cancer [38]. However, the specific mechanism of AIFM1's role in UC is unclear.

Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme concerned with pyruvate‐to‐pyruvate conversion as part of TCA cycle [39]. GrpE protein homolog 1 is a protein that is encoded by the HSPD1 gene. It plays an important function in the cell, mainly as a molecular chaperone protein, assisting other proteins to fold and assemble correctly. This helps maintain the stability and functionality of proteins in the cell. In addition, GrpE protein homolog 1 is also involved in the degradation and repair processes of intracellular proteins. tRNA pseudouridine synthase A is an enzyme, encoded by the TRUB1 gene. It plays an important cellular feature, primarily in the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine in tRNA molecules. Pseudouridine is a specialized nucleotide that can provide significant contributions to the construction and function of tRNAs [40]. tRNA pseudouridine synthase A activity contributes to the maintenance of the structural stability and biological function of tRNAs, which in turn affects protein synthesis and normal cellular function [41]. However, the mechanism of action of these proteins in UC needs to be further investigated.

MR research is less susceptible to confounding factors than previous observational research. And, it also avoids the large costs that need to be spent on adopting RCTs. The characteristics of this research could be summed up below: (1) The massive scale GWAS data sample ensures that the results of the study have a certain 1 reliability. (2) The methods of LD analysis, strongly correlated IVs, and outlier SNPs exclusion are effective in mitigating potential bias. (3) Both the multiple validity testing and the leave‐one‐out testing revealed relatively stable outcomes. The SNPs were symmetrically distributed in the funnel plot.

However, there are some limitations in this study: (1) The test of heterogeneity adopted in this paper is that both MR‐Egger regression and IVW method results are greater than 0.05. However, it is important to note that variations in analysis platforms, experimental conditions, population characteristics, and other IVs may also contribute to heterogeneity, which could not be avoided computationally in MR analysis. Therefore, the sources and causes of heterogeneity need to be investigated more fully and carefully in future studies. (2) An important limitation of our study is the predominant use of European‐ancestry GWAS data, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other ethnic populations. Genetic architectures and allele frequencies can vary across populations, potentially leading to different causal estimates in non‐European groups. Future studies should aim to incorporate diverse population datasets as they become available to examine whether these mitochondrial‐IBD relationships hold across different ethnicities. (3) The number of IVs screened per exposure in this study was low (no more than 10). This is dictated by the sample size investigated by the mitochondrial protein‐related GWAS, and there is a need to expand the SNPs that can be used as IVs in the future by utilizing larger sample datasets for in‐depth analysis. (4) While our MR approach establishes causal associations, the specific biological mechanisms linking these mitochondrial proteins to IBD pathogenesis warrant further investigation. For example, the protective effect of NDUFV2 may relate to its role in maintaining mitochondrial respiratory chain function and reducing oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells. Similarly, the risk association with Peptide chain release factor 1‐like could reflect impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting epithelial barrier integrity. These hypotheses could be tested in future experimental studies using intestinal organoid models or conditional knockout mice.

In this study, we analyzed GWAS dataset related to mitochondrial proteins and IBD using MR. Thirteen causal associations between mitochondrial proteins and IBD (including its subtypes) were revealed by MR analysis, and the results passed the tests of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and directionality. Moving forward, investigating in greater depth the molecular processes involved in the heightened incidence of IBD related to these elements might contribute to the formulation of therapeutic ideas designed to reduce the risk of IBD incidence by improving mitochondrial function.
