DNA has emerged as a robust platform for engineering molecular circuits with arbitrary logic operations. Nevertheless, implementing DNA circuits for such functions generally relies on the use of dual-rail expression that doubles the number of required gates, constraining the achievable complexity in a single solution. A fundamental limitation is that conventional single-rail circuits cannot support nonfirst-layer NOT operations. Here, we introduce the design of a DNA synchronizer (DSN), a temporal regulation module that enables time-dependent NOT function, to circumvent the fundamental limitation of conventional single-rail designs. Tuning the binding affinity between the DSN strand and an inverter strand allows for regulating the execution time of NOT gates at varying cascade depths. Single-rail NAND and NOR gates are implemented using DSNs, which are Boolean complete. We further demonstrate a 4-bit square root circuit using a minimal set of only five gates. This single-rail architecture holds promise for developing compact yet scalable DNA computing circuits while advancing applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.

A DNA synchronizer enables time-dependent NOT function for implementing compact and Boolean-complete single-rail circuits.

Harnessing the sequence-specific programmability and intrinsic biocompatibility, DNA computing has emerged as an unconventional yet advanced information processing mode. Diverse functions, including arithmetic computing (1–5), neural computing (6–8), cargo sorting (9), and maze solving (10), have been demonstrated. In particular, DNA-based logic circuits use combinations of molecular logic gates to perform digital computation by converting continuous concentration values into discretized binary signals, allowing noise resistance to biochemical perturbations (11). Such robustness enables the implementation of sophisticated functions through molecular interactions, demonstrating transformative potential in biomedical applications, including biosensing (12,13), drug-release regulating (14–16), and disease diagnosis (17–19). Therefore, developing scalable DNA logic circuits capable of arbitrary logic operations, along with the enhancement of their functional complexity, represents a central research imperative in DNA computing.

Programmable DNA logic gates with modular design have been proposed to construct scalable logic circuits capable of arbitrary logic operations. Complex digital functions such as multibit adder (20), multiplexer (4), and function solving (11) have been realized with such programmable architectures. However, most existing architectures adopt dual-rail logic, which encodes each logical variable using two distinct DNA strands representing logical 0 and 1, to circumvent the experimentally challenging nonfirst-layer NOT gate (2,11,21). As increasing system complexity leads to spurious interactions (1) in systems that operate on diffusion-based molecular recognition, such dual-rail expression introduces near-twofold gate redundancy, limiting the circuit complexity that can be achieved in a single solution. A more compact alternative is single-rail logic, which encodes each logical variable using only the presence or absence of a single DNA strand (21). However, the implementation of single-rail architectures remains challenging due to the lack of time-dependent NOT operations.

Electronic circuits use clocks to synchronize signals across multiple logic layers and to ensure that different modules operate in a well-defined temporal order. Similarly, strategies have been proposed to endow computational DNA networks with time-dependent functionalities. For instance, by encoding the timing of signals in the identity of molecular species, temporal logic circuits (22,23) and finite-state machines (24) that act on both current and historical signals have been realized. Enzyme-based strategies have also been used to implement DNA timers (25), generate time pulses (26,27), and record molecular events (28). These temporal regulation methods either require a global redesign of the circuit or rely on the incorporation of non-DNA components. Transient binding between DNA strands has been proven an efficient strategy to regulate the kinetics of DNA reactions (5,29). Nonetheless, using it to synchronize molecular signals to engineer single-rail DNA circuits is yet to be explored.

Here, we develop transient binding–based DNA synchronizers (DSNs) to regulate the execution time of NOT gates, based on which arbitrary logic functions can be implemented within a single-rail architecture. DSN can temporarily occupy the inverter signal for the NOT gate, thereby delaying its execution to synchronize with the corresponding upstream output signal. We established coarse- and fine-tuning strategies based on strand length and concentration, which can be directly applied to circuits containing NOT gates at different cascade depths. We demonstrate a 4-bit square root circuit with a minimal set of five logic gates with this single-rail architecture. Our work provides an effective strategy for engineering single-rail DNA logic circuits to perform arbitrary Boolean functions with minimal computing components, thereby facilitating the scaling up of DNA computing systems.

In our single-rail architecture, the DNA logic circuit is typically composed of three basic logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT. All logic gates transduce input signals into output signals through strand-displacement reactions (SDRs). When positioned at a nonfirst-layer, single-step SDR-based NOT gates exhibited faster reaction kinetics than the upstream circuitry involving multistep SDRs. The inverted signals were prematurely generated before receiving upstream-provided cascade signals (1), which led to false-positive outputs (Fig. 1A). To address this issue, we introduced DSNs designed to interact specifically with NOT gates to delay the generation of the inverted signal until the cascade signal became available (Fig. 1B). Using DSN regulation, the relative order of reaction rate constants between the upstream and downstream parts of the circuit can be altered: The rate constant for transducing the inverted signal into the outputkNOTis reduced below that for transducing the input signal into the cascade signalkUP(Fig. 1C).

As shown inFig. 1D, in a NOT gate, the inverter strand functions analogously to the input strand in other logic gates, displacing the output strand, which serves as the inverted signal. We used an ultrashort single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide as the DSN strand to regulate the kinetics of NOT gates. It transiently hybridizes with the toehold domain and part of the branch migration domain of the inverter strand via the formation of a metastable double-stranded complex. This enables the state of the inverter strand to rapidly switch between occupied and free upon the binding and dissociation of the DSN strand (Fig. 1E). Previous study has shown that hybridization involving fewer than 12 nt exhibited transient and reversible binding behavior, with binding kinetics highly sensitive to the hybridization length (30). Therefore, by rationally tuning the length of the DSN strand, we can achieve precise control over both the transient binding kinetics and the kinetics of the competing reaction pathway that produces the inverted signal. This allows the delayed execution of the NOT gate relative to upstream circuitry, ensuring correct circuit outputs (Fig. 1F).

Having established the design principle of DSNs, we first validated it by constructing a time-dependent nonfirst-layer NOT gate (Fig. 2, A and B), which consists of two parts: a double-stranded gate motif with sticky ends at both termini and a corresponding inverter strand. The chemical reaction network implementation is shown inFig. 2C. In the absence of the input strand, the inverter strand binds to the gate motif via a 6-nt toehold, initiates SDR, and releases the output strand representing logic “1.” This output can subsequently engage in downstream SDR with logic gates or reporters for signal cascading or reporting, respectively. Conversely, in the presence of an upstream-provided input strand, the single-stranded input preferentially hybridizes to the 16-nt single-stranded blocking domain on the gate motif (fig. S1), forming a stable three-stranded complex that prevents the generation of the output strand, thereby yielding logic “0.” Under these two input conditions, the NOT gate exhibited fast activation (fig. S2) or efficient blocking (fig. S3), consistent with the designed logic function. During DSN-based regulation, the binding state between DSN strand and the inverter strand can be tuned from “stable” to “transient” by adjusting the length (fig. S4) and concentration of the DSN strand, thereby enabling control over the computing speed of the NOT gate.

(E)T0.4of NOT gates regulated by DSNs with different lengths and concentrations. (F) On-off ratio of NOT gates regulated by DSNs with different lengths and concentrations.

We verified the temporal execution of the NOT gate using fluorescence kinetic measurements. We used two key parameters (Fig. 2D) to quantify the performance of the NOT gate: the upper bound of the time window during which the inverted signal remains below the 0.4 threshold,t0.4(Fig. 2E), and the fluorescence on-off ratio before and after the reaction (Fig. 2F). Results showed that increasing the DSN concentration notably prolonged the computing delay of the NOT gate. For instance, with a 9-nt DSN, raising the concentration from 0.2× to 10× resulted in an approximately 60-fold increase int0.4. In addition, the variation in DSN length had a wide-range influence on computing speed. A 7-nt DSN led to only a 0.5-fold increase int0.4, whereas an 8-nt DSN produced a ~13-fold increase across the 0.2× to 10× concentration range. Moreover, we found that increased execution time is accompanied with a decreased on-off ratio. When the DSN length reached 10 nt and the concentration exceeded 5×, the inverted signal failed to reach 40% of the expected level within the 1-hour testing window, suggesting that a notable fraction of inverters became kinetically trapped (31). Therefore, in the subsequent DSN setting, we located the appropriate length and concentration from thet0.4and on-off ratio values (tables S1 and S2) according to the required execution time of the NOT gate.

Having validated the temporal regulation of a NOT gate using DSN, we next established a generalizable DSN setting strategy that allows NOT gates at a specific cascade depth to operate under uniform conditions, thereby eliminating the need for individual time optimization (Fig. 3A). We used a simple YES-NOT cascade circuit as proof of concept. Referring to starting switch (32), we designed a YES gate consisting of a duplex formed by two DNA strands, s1 and s2. The input strand first binds to s1 via a toehold and displaces s2, which then serves as a cascade signal for the downstream NOT gate. The released s2 hybridizes with the blocking domain of the NOT gate motif, thereby producing a logic output 0. In the absence of the input, the YES gate remains in its duplex state, and no free s2 is present in the solution. Under DSN regulation, the NOT gate slowly releases its output strand until the accumulated signal surpasses the 0.4 threshold, resulting in a logic output 1 (Fig. 3B). To ensure effective blocking of the downstream NOT by the upstream YES, we shortened the 5′ sticky end of the YES gate motif adjacent to the NOT gate to 6 nt (figs. S5 and S6).

All data values are listed in table S3. The DSN settings used for all tested circuits are listed in fig. S10.

We implemented YES-NOT cascade circuits containing NOT gates at different cascade depths, based on the quantified computing speed of upstream YES gates. Fluorescence kinetic results showed that the minimum time required for the cascade signal from the first-, second-, third-layer YES gates to reach the 0.6 threshold (tUP-0.6) was 3.33, 1.43, and 0.65 min, respectively (Fig. 3C). On the basis of these results andFig. 2D, we selected DSN settings for NOT gates at different cascade depths that satisfied the conditiontNOT-0.4>tUP-0.6(fig. S7). We observed false-positive outputs in all cascade circuits without DSN regulation. In contrast, with appropriate DSN regulation (fig. S8), all input combinations gave correct logic outputs across all tested cascade depths (Fig. 3D).

Having demonstrated multilayer cascading, we further explored whether multiple NOT gates could be executed in parallel within the same solution. To this end, we designed three sets of orthogonal NOT gates, each regulated by a specific DSN and monitored by a specific reporter (Fig. 4A). We first validated the individual functionality of each NOT gate by fluorescence assays (Fig. 4, B, D, and F, left). The fluorescence signals were then converted to concentrations using calibration curves (fig. S9), enabling quantitative comparison of output levels across different NOT gates. Results showed that the kinetics of each NOT were substantially slowed only when the added DSN matched its designated sequence, while the others remained unaffected (Fig. 4, B, D, and F, right). We further confirmed the orthogonality of temporal tuning by using DSNs of different lengths (Fig. 4, C, E, and G). Results showed that thet0.4value and the on-off ratio of each NOT gate were correlated only with the length of its cognate DSN, with no notable correlation observed for others. These findings indicated the feasibility of parallel execution and independent temporal tuning of multiple NOT gates within a single system.

We next designed elementary logic gates NAND and NOR for performing arbitrary logic computation with our single-rail architecture. Both gates have two inputs (I1and I2) and an output (O), where each is encoded by distinct DNA strands. The NAND gate was implemented by cascading an AND module with a NOT module (Fig. 5A). The AND module is a three-stranded complex composed of DNA strands s1, s2, and s3 (Fig. 5B). The cascade signal s2 will be released to the downstream NOT module only when both I1and I2are present (fig. S11). Similarly, the NOR gate was implemented by cascading an OR module with a NOT module (Fig. 5D). The OR module consists of two double-stranded complexes: one formed by s1 and s2 and the other by s3 and s4 (Fig. 5E). Either input can hybridize with its corresponding duplex, leading to the displacement of s2 or s4, respectively. The releases strand then acts as a cascade signal to the downstream NOT module (fig. S12). Under the temporal regulation of DSN, the NOT module gradually produces output molecules until it is either fully blocked by the cascade signal or accumulates sufficient output.

We tested all possible input combinations for the NAND and NOR gates, respectively (Fig. 5, C and F). Results showed that once the upstream gates generated cascade signals, the inverted signals of the NAND and NOR gates were rapidly and completely blocked within 3 and 2 min, respectively. For input combinations corresponding to a logic output of 0, the normalized outputs of NAND and NOR did not exceed 0.31 and 0.18, respectively, both of which were below the 0.4 threshold. The faster computing speed and lower leakage level of the NOR gate can be attributed to the fewer SDR steps required to transduce its input signals into cascade signals. Despite requiring more SDR steps, NAND gates remain fully functional in deep-layered circuits (fig. S13).

To further demonstrate the capability of our single-rail architecture for large-scale arbitrary logic computation, we implemented a 4-bit square root circuit with four inputs and two outputs (Fig. 6Aand fig. S14). With the ability to implement NOT operations, our architecture reduced the number of logic gates to half that of dual-rail counterparts (Fig. 6B). The single-rail circuit used only five logic gates (fig. S15), fewer than those in previously reported designs based on seesaw gates (1), single-stranded gates (3), and switches (Fig. 6C) (32). We tested all 16 possible input combinations with and without DSNs to evaluate the impact of temporal regulation on large-scale circuit performance. The results showed that circuits without DSNs exhibited high false-positive levels on the O1transmission line, all above the 0.4 threshold, whereas circuits regulated by DSNs generated correct outputs (Fig. 6D). This circuit also showed the robustness of DSN-based control over both parallel and cascade NOT gates in a large-scale circuit context.

Red unfilled bars represent input combinations that resulted in false-positive outputs. Measurements were taken 4 hours after the addition of inputs, inverters, and DSNs. The true/false threshold is set at 40 nM, corresponding to 40% of the expected output. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n= 3 independent samples). All data values are listed in table S4.

In summary, we established a general approach to directly implementing single-rail DNA logic circuits through tuning the execution time of NOT gates with DSNs. We showed that single-rail implementation of circuits containing NOT gates at varied cascade layers can be easily realized by embedding DSNs. Furthermore, multiple orthogonal DSNs can operate simultaneously without cross-talk. Assisted by DSNs, a single-rail 4-bit square root circuit is demonstrated with the reduced number of computing components, showing the compactness of DSN-based approach to implementing single-rail complex logic operations.

The modularity of the temporal regulation strategy is enabled by the sequence specificity and tunable binding affinity of DSNs, which allow each NOT gate to be independently and flexibly regulated without the need to redesign other logic gates in the same circuit. It is also noteworthy that this DNA-based regulation not only does not require changes in the operating environment of DNA circuits but also enables higher computational bandwidth compared to enzyme-(3,4) or light-based methods (33). The transient binding, rather than stable hybridization, between DSN and the NOT gate can implement tunable delays of inverted signals, ensuring their synchronized transmission with upstream signals. Such molecular signal synchronization enables a feasible single-rail implementation of NOT operations within DNA logic circuits. The number of DNA logic gates required to implement common Boolean functions is reduced by half (fig. S16), which can notably suppress leaky reactions to improve functional complexity while reducing circuit preparation cost (32).

In circuit tests, we found signal attenuation with increasing cascade depths due to kinetic trapping of inverter strands. Incorporating signal restoration modules, such as thresholding and amplification modules (1,11), can further enhance the performance of large-scale circuits. As our architecture can interface with existing register strategies, the achievable circuit size can be further scaled up by using DNA origami registers (11,34) to execute asynchronous signal transmission between multiple single-rail subcircuits. Different from dual-rail expressions that require irrelevant DNA strands to be defined as input 0, our single-rail implementation can directly take native nucleic acid species as inputs, highlighting its potential in practical diagnostic applications. In combination with DNA origami (35) and synthetic protocells (36), this strategy could further support the construction of time-resolved biosensing platforms and sophisticated intelligent nanomachines.

The DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and modified by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides were purified by ULTRAPAGE. Labeled DNA oligonucleotides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Individual unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides were suspended in 1× Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (nuclease free, pH 8.0, Sigma-Aldrich), quantified by A260 using ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectrometry, and then stored at −20°C. Individual labeled DNA oligonucleotides were suspended in deionized water (Milli-Q), quantified by A260 using UV/Vis spectrometry, and then stored at −20°C.

The single-rail DNA circuit uses the presence or absence of one set of DNA sequences to represent binary numbers 1 or 0, thereby requiring fewer orthogonal sequences compared to dual-rail implementations. To demonstrate the compatibility of DSN-based temporal regulation with existing computing architectures, we used the previously established designs for the AND and OR gates (11). An adapted version of the inverter-based NOT gates proposed by Winfree and colleagues (21) was developed with customized blocking domains (Fig. 2C) to enable their cascade operations. Gate motifs designed to perform the same Boolean function share identical domain-level implementations. Therefore, sequence design was conducted at the domain level. A Python script was written to generate several pools of orthogonal domain sequences with specified lengths according to a series of design criteria (1). To reduce intramolecular secondary structures and synthesis errors, we used a three-letter code (A, T, and C) and no more than three consecutive identical bases. The content of G and C bases in all DNA strands was maintained between 30 and 70% to ensure similar binding stability (fig. S17). In particular, all DNA strands, except DSN strands, were designed such that their complementary domains to inverter strands do not exceed 6 nt, to minimize unwanted transient binding. The DSN strands were designed to hybridize with the inverter strands, with complementary regions ranging from 6 to 11 bp in length. The designed DNA strands were verified by NUPACK to confirm their specificity and correct formation of the desired gate motifs. All the sequences used in this work are listed in tables S5 to S12.

To prepare an AND gate motif, s1, s2, and s3 were mixed at a molar ratio 1.1:1:1.5 in 1× TE buffer with 12.5 mM MgCl2, to final concentrations of 11, 10, and 15 μM, respectively. To prepare an OR/NOT gate motif, s1 and s2 were mixed at a molar ratio 1.1:1 in 1× TE buffer with 12.5 mM MgCl2, to final concentrations of 11 and 10 μM, respectively. All the reaction mixtures were annealed on a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad): heating to 95°C for 5 min, slowly cooling to 25°C at a rate of −0.1°C every 6 s, and then held at 4°C.

Coarse- and fine-tuning of the kinetics of NOT gates was achieved by varying the lengths and concentrations of the DSN strands, respectively. For any given single-rail circuit, we first identified the cascade layer of each NOT gate. We definedtUP-0.6as the minimum time required for the input signal to reach the corresponding layer and cross the 0.6 threshold and definedtNOT-0.4as the upper bound of the time window during which the inverted output of the NOT gate remains below the 0.4 threshold. By referencingFig. 2D, we selected appropriate DSN lengths and concentrations such thattNOT-0.4>tUP-0.6, ensuring correct operation of NOT gates (fig. S7). The DSN settings used for all tested circuits are listed in fig. S10.

Fluorescence kinetic experiments were performed using the Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader (Biotek) and a Corning 96-well black assay plate without lids. For ATTO425 fluorophore, excitation and emission wavelengths were 438 and 485 nm, respectively. For tetrachlorofluorescein fluorophore, excitation and emission wavelengths were 510 and 540 nm, respectively. For ATTO590 fluorophore, excitation and emission wavelengths were 590 and 620 nm, respectively. All the excitation and emission bandwidths were set as 10 nm. All circuit components, except the input(s), the inverter(s), and the DSN(s), were mixed at molar ratios according to the concentration setups in fig. S8, where 1× represents 100 nM. The reaction buffer is 1× TE buffer with 12.5 mM MgCl2. The mixture was added to the 96-well black assay plate, and then the input(s), the inverter(s), and the DSN(s) were added simultaneously (fig. S18), followed by short shaking. Fluorescence signals were recorded with intervals of 10 s or 1 min.

To construct a calibration curve, mixtures containing adequate Reporter molecules (500 nM) were added to a 96-well black assay plate. Then, fixed concentrations (30, 60, 90, and 120 nM) of opening strands complementary to the fluorophore-labeled strands were added, which displaced the quencher-labeled strands and led to fluorescence recovery. The experiments were independently repeated three times to mitigate operation caused fluctuations. The results were linearly fitted, and the correspondingR2values were provided. All fluorescence signals were converted to concentrations according to calibration curves in fig. S9. Concentrations were further normalized by defining the minimum value of all parallel tests as output 0 and the maximum value of all parallel tests as output 1. Thresholds were set at 0.4× and 0.6×: Signals below 0.4× were seen as logic 0, and signals above 0.6× were seen as logic 1.
