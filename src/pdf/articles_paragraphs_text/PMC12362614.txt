To evaluate the benefits and harms of virtual reality (VR)‐based exercise for improving mental health, physical function, and quality of life (QoL), as well as assessing adverse events during dialysis, in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing haemodialysis compared to exercise interventions without VR or standard treatment alone.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition characterised by a decline in kidney function over time, commonly caused by diabetes, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis [1]. Risk factors include older age, cardiovascular disease, and socioeconomic disadvantage [2]. CKD is often asymptomatic in its early stages and is typically diagnosed based on a persistent decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the presence of albuminuria, or both. As CKD progresses, symptoms such as fatigue, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances may develop. In advanced stages, CKD can lead to kidney failure, requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) such as haemodialysis.

People undergoing haemodialysis experience significant decline in physical function, mental health, and quality of life (QoL), alongside a high burden of treatment‐related adverse events [3,4]. Cardiovascular disease and frailty are particularly prevalent in this population and have been identified as key contributors to poorer health outcomes [5,6,7]. In this population, death due to cardiovascular disease is 20 times higher than in the general population, and most people receiving maintenance haemodialysis have cardiovascular disease [8]. These cardiovascular complications contribute to functional decline, increased hospitalisation, and death.

In addition to cardiovascular disease, frailty is a critical concern amongst individuals undergoing haemodialysis, with a reported prevalence of 30% to 80% [5]. Frailty, characterised by reduced physical function and increased vulnerability to stressors, is strongly associated with reduced exercise capacity, increased fall risk, depressive symptoms, and lower QoL [9]. Furthermore, frailty and cardiovascular disease often coexist, forming a cycle that exacerbates functional impairment and worsens clinical outcomes in this population.

People undergoing haemodialysis also experience high rates of depression and anxiety, which are linked to increased hospitalisation, dialysis withdrawal, and death [10,11,12,13,14]. The combination of cardiovascular disease, frailty, and psychological distress further deteriorates QoL and overall well‐being.

Given these challenges, non‐pharmacologic interventions, particularly structured exercise programs, have been proposed to mitigate frailty, improve cardiovascular health, and enhance physical function, mental health, and QoL in individuals undergoing haemodialysis [15]. Exercise‐based interventions may improve muscle strength, increase cardiovascular fitness, and reduce inflammation, thereby addressing both cardiovascular disease and frailty‐related risks [9].

Despite these benefits, there are several barriers to traditional exercise programs for people undergoing haemodialysis, including fatigue, limited accessibility, and lack of motivation [42,43]. People with CKD are also physically restricted to often unstimulating clinical environments when receiving dialysis. To address these barriers, virtual reality (VR)‐based exercise has emerged as an innovative alternative to traditional rehabilitation programs, offering an engaging and interactive environment that enhances motivation, adherence, and psychological well‐being. VR‐based interventions have demonstrated benefits in neurological and cardiovascular rehabilitation, and their integration into haemodialysis care is gaining attention as a means to counteract exercise limitations imposed by treatment‐related fatigue and psychological distress [44,45]. Moreover, VR has been shown to enhance the psychological benefits of exercise and improve long‐term adherence to exercise programs [46]. Given that individuals undergoing haemodialysis are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, frailty, and depression, interventions that combine VR and exercise hold significant promise. Such interventions may also enhance continuity of care, leveraging the structured nature of haemodialysis treatment schedules to facilitate regular participation in rehabilitation programs.

VR‐based exercises can be delivered through various modalities, including desktop VR, immersive VR, augmented reality, and distributed VR [47]. Desktop VR (non‐immersive VR) allows users to interact with virtual environments using standard input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens. Immersive VR provides a fully interactive experience by isolating users from the real world through the use of head‐mounted displays and motion sensors, engaging visual, auditory, and tactile senses. Augmented reality overlays virtual elements onto real‐world environments, enhancing realism and interaction. Distributed VR enables multiple users to interact within the same virtual space via the Internet, supporting remote rehabilitation and collaborative therapy. While standardised protocols for VR‐based exercise in individuals undergoing haemodialysis have not yet been established, existing studies suggest that low‐ to moderate‐intensity aerobic and resistance training, performed for 20 to 30 minutes, two to three times per week, may be beneficial [48,49]. Furthermore, prior systematic reviews have shown potential clinical benefits from VR‐related exercise for people with upper limb weakness following stroke, knee osteoarthritis, and older people, with some potential modification of these effects arising from the type of VR used and intervention duration [50,51,52]. VR‐based exercise programs can be performed either during haemodialysis sessions or on non‐dialysis days, depending on feasibility and participant preference. Although VR‐based exercise is generally well tolerated, potential adverse effects include cybersickness (VR‐induced dizziness, nausea, and motion sickness), visual fatigue, and disorientation, particularly with prolonged use or in individuals with vestibular dysfunction [53]. Adverse events due to exercise during dialysis include cardiovascular disease and abnormalities in the dialysis circuit [48].

This review is needed to answer questions about whether there are benefits for people with CKD from participation in VR‐based exercise when it is delivered around haemodialysis sessions. Previous systematic reviews have shown that general exercise training can improve health outcomes for adults receiving haemodialysis [54], and that VR‐based interventions can be used to improve functional recovery after stroke [55]. However, it is necessary to analyse whether similar health benefits can be achieved for people undergoing haemodialysis. VR‐based exercises may be particularly valuable for people who are on haemodialysis, as they have more limitations in the exercises they can perform compared to those who are not on dialysis. Additionally, with sufficient instruction, people may be able to complete complex exercises at a lower cost than when provided by an occupational therapist or physical therapist, through VR technology alone.

Two similar systematic reviews have been published on the topic of VR‐based interventions for people on haemodialysis. The first is a systematic review of VR‐based interventions for people with any type of health condition, which included 15 studies but only two with people on haemodialysis [56]. This review, updated in April 2020, did not report any quantitative data on measured outcomes arising from the VR‐based interventions (i.e. no reported effect sizes). The second review, updated in May 2022, identified five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) specifically about VR‐based interventions for people on haemodialysis [57]. Since then, additional RCTs using VR have been published, with more RCTs expected to be published in the future [45,58,59].

To evaluate the benefits and harms of virtual reality (VR)‐based exercise for improving mental health, physical function, and quality of life (QoL), as well as assessing adverse events during dialysis, in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing haemodialysis compared to exercise interventions without VR or standard treatment alone.

We will include RCTs, including those with a cluster design, of VR‐based exercise for people receiving haemodialysis. We will consider studies with a randomised cross‐over design if sufficient data are available for the pre‐cross‐over period. We will include studies irrespective of their publication status. We will exclude other study designs, including quasi‐randomised studies, to minimise the risk of bias in estimates of the treatment effect. We will not impose any language or date restrictions on the search strategy. For all potentially relevant studies published in a language other than English, we will attempt to obtain a translation. If a translation is not available prior to submission of the completed review, we will list the studies under 'awaiting classification'.

We will include studies involving people with CKD, as defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guidelines [60], who are receiving maintenance haemodialysis in a hospital, other healthcare service, or at home. We will include both adults and children. We will include studies that recruit a subset of people on haemodialysis if the majority (> 80%) are on haemodialysis. If the proportion of participants on haemodialysis is 80% or less, we will attempt to obtain and analyse data specific to the haemodialysis subgroup. If such subgroup data are not available, we will exclude the study to maintain the specificity of our analysis. We will not impose any additional restrictions based on demographics or settings.

We will exclude studies involving people who were receiving haemodialysis after kidney transplantation or those on peritoneal dialysis.

We will include studies that involve any type of VR‐based exercise intended to improve physical function, health, and well‐being (as defined by the authors) delivered around haemodialysis sessions, compared with exercise interventions without VR or standard treatment alone (i.e. regular haemodialysis without any additional exercise or VR‐related intervention). We will not impose restrictions on the types of VR, type of VR activity, or on the intensity, timing, duration, speed, or frequency of these activities. We will categorise VR‐based interventions as desktop VR, immersive VR, or augmented reality, according to the definitions listed inDescription of the intervention and how it might work. We will also categorise VR‐based interventions as single‐person activities or distributed VR activities (where more than one person engages in a VR activity together).

We have selected critical and important outcomes based on recommendations from the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology‐Haemodialysis core set (SONG‐HD) [61,62]. We will collect data at the following three time points.

Outcome measures will not form part of the eligibility criteria for studies in this review.

If multiple outcome measures are used within a single clinical trial for any of the primary outcomes, we will use the following hierarchy to select one outcome measure per domain from those trials to include in this review.

If we need to calculate a median effect estimate in situations where single studies use multiple outcome measures for any of these primary outcomes and there is an even number of outcomes (n) for one primary outcomes (e.g. data from two different measures of QoL in a single clinical trial), we will include the outcome whose effect estimate is ranked n/2. We will report in our results which outcome we used for each domain in each study. Where possible, we will also verify whether the specified primary outcomes in included studies are consistent with those identified in trial protocols, trial registry entries, or both.

To minimise bias in our search results, we will follow the guidance in Chapter 4 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[81,82], and in PRISMA and PRISMA‐S [83,84], to plan and describe the search process for the review.

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Information Specialist will search the following databases from their inception to the present for RCTs, with no restrictions on language, publication year, or publication status.

Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register via MeerKat (a software application built on Microsoft Access used to manage the database). MeerKat is a study‐based register and is used to store bibliographic and study details, link multiple reports to a single study, link studies to reviews, and track the progress of reviews.

World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (https://trialsearch.who.int), as part of the search of CENTRAL (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/central-creation).

The Information Specialist will model the subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for MEDLINE. Where appropriate, we will combine searches with an adaptation of the Cochrane sensitivity and precision maximising search strategy for identifying RCTs (as described in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of InterventionsVersion 5.1.0 [82]) and updated to account for new MeSH study types and wider use of machine indexing by the National Library of Medicine for identifying RCTs. We present the MEDLINE search strategy inSupplementary material 1.

We will also search reference lists of review articles, relevant studies, and clinical practice guidelines, as well as grey literature sources (e.g. abstracts, dissertations, and theses), in addition to those already included in the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register. We will contact relevant individuals and organisations to seek information about unpublished or incomplete studies.

We will search the Retraction Watch Database, PubMed, and Embase for retractions, expressions of concern, errata, and corrigenda related to included studies [85,86]. If a study has been retracted, we will exclude it from the review. If an expression of concern, erratum, or corrigendum is found, we will assess its relevance to the study’s findings and document it accordingly.

We will conduct the review in accordance with the recommendations of Cochrane [87], and we will perform the data analyses using Review Manager (RevMan) [88].

Records retrieved from different databases will be combined, and the entire screening process will be performed using Covidence software [89]. Covidence can also identify duplicates in the same way as a standard reference manager system. Initially, titles and abstracts of all identified studies will be screened independently by two authors (from HNishiwaki, TS, YW, NT, YH, DL), who will discard studies that are not applicable. If discrepancies in decisions occur, they will be resolved by group discussion. Next, the full text of studies that are potentially eligible for inclusion will be obtained, and their eligibility for inclusion will be assessed again. Again, any discrepancies will be resolved at this stage through group discussion. If necessary, we will contact the authors of the primary studies to request further information to make a decision about the inclusion of individual studies. Finally, duplicate studies (those reporting the same set of people) will be identified and combined under a single study identification.

Data extraction will be carried out independently by two authors (from HNishiwaki, TS, YW, NT, YH, DL) using standard data extraction forms in Covidence [89]. In cases of disagreement between the two authors, we will first attempt to reach consensus through discussion. If consensus cannot be achieved, a third author (TH) will be consulted to resolve the discrepancy. Prior to full data extraction, we will develop and pilot test a data collection form to ensure that we can extract data in the correct format and structure for subsequent analysis. Studies reported in non‐English‐language journals will be translated before assessment. When multiple publications of a study exist, reports will be grouped together, and the publication with the most complete data will be used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are published in earlier versions only, these data will be used. Any discrepancies between published versions will be highlighted.

In the event of disagreements, we will re‐examine the conflicts until a consensus is reached. When data are missing, we will contact the study authors (initially by electronic correspondence and occasionally by phone contact) for additional information.

Two review authors (from HNishiwaki, TS, YW, NT, YH, DL) will independently assess the risk of bias of each critical outcome using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 2) tool [90], according to the recommendations in Chapter 8 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[91] and methodological studies [92,93,94,95,96,97]. Any disagreements between the two authors will first be resolved through discussion. If consensus cannot be reached, a third review author (TH) will be consulted to adjudicate the disagreement. We will not assess the risk of bias for the important outcomes. We will use the RoB 2 Excel tool, available at www.riskofbias.info/welcome/rob‐2‐0‐tool/current‐version‐of‐rob‐2, to facilitate data extraction and systematic analysis of potential biases for primary outcomes in the included studies. Specifically, we will assess the risk of bias around the effect of assignment to the interventions (the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) effect) for the following outcomes.

We will evaluate the risk of bias for these outcomes at the end of the treatment period, as specified by the trial authors.

If multiple outcome measures are used within a single clinical trial for any of these categories of primary outcomes, we will only conduct risk of bias assessments on the outcomes included in the relevant meta‐analysis (seeMeasures of treatment effect). We will resolve any disagreements by consensus. We will assess risk of bias according to the following domains [90,91,98].

For trials that allocated clusters of individuals, we will assess and report on the risk of bias associated with one additional domain, specific to that trial design [99]: bias arising from the timing of identification and recruitment of individual participants in relation to the timing of randomisation.

For cross‐over trials, as described below (seeUnit of analysis issues), we will use the data only from the first period of the cross‐over, and therefore, we will use the standard version of the RoB 2 tool [90].

For signalling questions within each domain for each outcome, we will provide one of the five possible answers in the RoB 2 tool ('Yes', 'Probably yes', 'No', 'Probably no', and 'No information'). After this step, we will make a judgment for each domain according to the algorithm result as 'Low risk of bias', 'Some concerns', or 'High risk of bias' for each outcome. The overall risk of bias judgment for each outcome will be the least favourable assessment across the domains. To uphold the principles of transparency and data accessibility, we will report the detailed RoB 2 data in supplementary files, thereby publicly disclosing the consensus decisions pertaining to RoB 2 signalling questions.

We will use the following three levels of judgement to arrive at an overall rating.

The RoB 2 assessments will feed into each domain of the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome (seeCertainty of the evidence assessment) [100]. We will summarise our findings in the risk of bias tables and figures ('Risk of bias graph' and 'Risk of bias summary').

Four critical outcomes are the focus of this review.

We will prioritise the use of post‐intervention values in our analysis. If a study reports both post‐intervention values and change‐from‐baseline scores, we will extract and analyse the post‐intervention values. In cases where only change‐from‐baseline scores are reported, we will include these in the analysis. We will use ITT data to calculate treatment effects. We will not exclude data from the primary analysis based on the risk of bias assessment. We will use RevMan for all statistical analyses [88]. For dichotomous outcomes, we plan to calculate risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we will measure the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI if all retrieved records provide data on the same scale, and as standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI if different scales are used during reporting. For SMD, we will use the rule of thumb where Cohen's d = 0.2 will be considered a 'small' effect size, 0.5 represents a 'medium' effect size, and 0.8 a 'large' effect size [101]. If data to calculate RRs or MDs are not reported, we will use the most appropriate numerical data available to calculate the actual numbers or means and SDs (e.g. from test statistics and P values) where possible.

For trials using parallel‐group designs, we will assess participants as randomised per intervention group. When more than one intervention group is identified, we will collect data for those intervention groups that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. If we include multi‐arm trials (≥ three arms), we will combine arms where it is clinically sensible to do so or will use multivariate meta‐analysis models to address the within‐study correlations as appropriate [102]. For the analysis of results from cross‐over trials, we will include only the first period results (i.e. use only data from the first treatment period, before the cross‐over) in the overall analysis [98]. We will include data from trials where participants were individually and randomly assigned to an experimental and a control group. In trials with results based on a long follow‐up, we will select only the longest follow‐up from each trial.

For cluster‐RCTs, the unit of analysis will be the cluster. In order to avoid a unit of analysis error, we will re‐analyse the data by taking account of the intra‐cluster correlation (ICC). If these data are not provided, then we will exclude the trial [98].

If needed, we will request further information from the original authors by written correspondence (e.g. emailing the corresponding author), and we will include any relevant information obtained in this manner in the review. Evaluation of important numerical data, such as screened, randomised participants, as well as ITT, as‐treated and per‐protocol populations, will be carefully performed. Attrition rates (e.g. dropouts, losses to follow‐up, and withdrawals) will be investigated. We will critically appraise issues of missing data and imputation methods (e.g. last observation‐carried‐forward) [103]. If a study does not report continuous outcomes as means or standard deviations (SDs), and the authors do not respond to requests for additional information, we will convert medians, quartiles, and ranges to means and SDs using the quantile estimation method proposed by McGrath and colleagues [104]. We will use this approach to minimise selection bias.

We will examine the possibility of within‐study selective outcome reporting for each study included in the review. We will search for trial protocols of included trials on electronic sources such as PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in order to assess whether outcome reporting seems to be sufficiently complete and transparent. We will investigate publication bias by using funnel plots and Egger's test for any meta‐analysis where we are able to include 10 or more clinical trials [105,106].

We will conduct meta‐analyses only if the included studies are sufficiently methodologically and clinically homogeneous. We will perform statistical analysis according to the statistical recommendations described in theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[107]. We will pool data using the random‐effects model, but also examine the influence of the fixed‐effect model to ensure the robustness of the chosen model. We will use an ITT analysis whenever possible. We will analyse data using RevMan [88]. If meta‐analysis is not possible for any of the outcomes, we will present the data in narrative and tabular formats. We will provide the reasons for our decision. The scenarios that may preclude meta‐analysis, with possible solutions, are presented in Table 12.1.a in Chapter 12 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions[108].

If we identify substantial or considerable heterogeneity (I2> 50%), we will report it and explore the possible causes by pre‐specified subgroup analysis. The effect of VR‐based exercise on health outcomes for people on haemodialysis could potentially be influenced by the type of VR used, the level of professional supervision provided, the duration of exercise (seeDescription of the intervention and how it might work) and by socioeconomic status (seeEquity‐related assessment). The reported effect size resulting from VR‐based exercise may also be impacted by the type of alternative interventions provided to the comparison groups. Therefore, when exploring any identified heterogeneity, we will conduct the following subgroup analyses.

To determine whether a statistically significant subgroup difference is detected, we will consider the P value from the test for subgroup differences. We will use this test to assess the difference between the meta‐analysed effect estimates for each subgroup. A P value of less than 0.1 will be considered indicative of a significant subgroup effect.

People on dialysis for CKD who have the lowest education and income levels, lack home ownership, and live in remote areas have poorer access to renal care, worse cardiovascular outcomes, and a higher risk of death [2]. Socioeconomic disadvantage, older age, ethnic minority status, poorer digital literacy, and poorer Internet connectivity have also been associated with poorer access to VR‐based healthcare interventions [114]. We will therefore collect data from all included studies on the age, ethnicity, education level, economic status, home‐ownership status, and place of residence of participants. We anticipate that few studies will have reported separate effect estimates for equity‐related subgroups, and that this assessment will be exploratory. Where possible, we will summarise the equity‐related information narratively. We will, however, aim to collect data and conduct subgroup analysis based on the financial wealth of the countries where each study was conducted, dividing studies into those conducted in high‐income countries versus low‐ to middle‐income countries, using the World Bank Atlas method to classify countries by gross national income. Following Cochrane's guidelines on subgroup analysis to explore equity issues in systematic reviews, we will be open to identifying other factors that make it possible to conduct equity‐related subgroup analyses as the review progresses, and will be explicit in the full review when we have made post hoc decisions in this regard [115].

We plan to conduct the following sensitivity analyses.

Repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies.

Excluding studies at high risk of bias to explore the effect of studies' methodological quality on the overestimation of the treatment effect. We will use the overall risk of bias judgement for this analysis [107].

Repeating the analysis with the fixed‐effect model to explore the presence or absence of statistical heterogeneity in outcome results.

Repeating the analysis excluding any large studies (i.e. more than 1000 participants) to establish how much they dominate the results [92].

We will use the GRADE approach to prepare a summary of findings table, using the GRADEpro GDT software [100,116,117]. We will present findings for mental health, cardiorespiratory fitness, QoL, adverse events during dialysis, and fatigue at the end of the treatment period, as specified by the trial authors (seeOutcome measures). The comparator groups will not be restricted to specific types, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the effects of VR‐related exercise interventions. GRADE uses five factors for assessing the certainty of evidence: 1) risk of bias, 2) heterogeneity, 3) imprecision (we will calculate the optimal information size), 4) indirectness, and 5) publication bias. We will use the overall judgment of risk of bias for each outcome to assess the certainty of the evidence, following the GRADE approach, and to inform our summary of findings tables.

High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.

Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate ‐ the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.

Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited ‐ the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate ‐ the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Two review authors (from HNishiwaki, TS, YW, NT, YH, DL) will independently use the GRADE tool to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for each finding. Disagreement will be resolved by consensus. We will incorporate the GRADE judgements about the certainty of the evidence in our reporting of the results.

Although it is unlikely that the authors of the studies included in this review will be amongst the authors of this review, if this does occur in the future, these authors will not be involved in the data extraction, appraisal of risk of bias, and assessment of confidence in findings from their own studies.

Consumers were not involved in this review protocol due to resource limitations. However, the review authors incorporated outcomes from the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology – Haemodialysis (SONG‐HD) initiative, which were developed with extensive consumer involvement.
