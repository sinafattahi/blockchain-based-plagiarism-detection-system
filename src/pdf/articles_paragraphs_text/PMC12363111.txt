While PM₂.₅ exposure is linked to asthma exacerbations, components-specific effects on healthcare burden remain understudied. Hospital length of stay (LOS), a critical indicator of disease severity and healthcare costs, has received limited attention in black carbon (BC) research.

To quantify the association between short-term exposure to PM₂.₅ components-particularly black carbon (BC)-and LOS among asthma patients, and to identify vulnerable populations and critical exposure windows.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 4,509 asthma patients (ICD-10: J45 ~ J46) hospitalized in Yulin, China (2018 ~ 2023). Daily PM2.5components concentrations (BC, Organic Matter, Sulfates, Nitrates, Ammonium) were derived from 10-km resolution CMAQ model data. General linear models (GLM) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) assessed exposure-response relationships across lag0-lag10, stratified by age groups and seasons. Confounders included meteorological variables, patient demographics, and clinical characteristics.

Each 1.00 µg/m³ increase in BC concentration at lag9 significantly associated with a 0.45-days prolongation in hospital stay (95%CI: 0.12 ~ 0.78). Age-stratified analysis revealed heightened vulnerability in children (effect observed at lag1 ~ 3, lag7 ~ 9) and middle-aged adults (sustained effects lag2 ~ 10), while elderly patients showed no significant associations. Seasonal analysis demonstrated that BC effects were more pronounced during non-pollen season (0.77 additional days per 1.00 µg/m³ increase), with no significant effects during pollen season. Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed dose-response relationships, with effects plateauing at BC concentrations ≥ 1.98 µg/m³.

Short-term BC exposure was significantly associated with extend asthma hospitalization duration, with critical exposure windows at lag9 and pronounced vulnerability in children and middle-aged adults during non-pollen seasons. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting BC-specific emission controls in air quality policies and highlight the need for targeted protection of vulnerable populations, particularly in high-population regions.

Asthma prevalence in China has been increasing annually, reaching 4.2% among individuals over 20 years old, yet control remain suboptimal. Environmental factors, especially air pollutants like PM₂.₅, play a crucial role in asthma onset and progression. However, most studies focus on PM₂.₅ concentrations and outpatient visits, with few examining the association between burden of disease(e.g.: hospital length of stay) and exposure of specific PM₂.₅ components(e.g.: black carbon). Notably, Regions like Yulin exhibit significantly higher asthma risks, highlighting the need to address regional disparities and the impact of specific pollutants.

this study provides evidence that exposure to black carbon (BC), a major component of PM₂.₅, significantly prolongs hospital length of stay in asthma patients, particularly among children and middle-aged individuals in the Yulin region. By focusing on specific PM₂.₅ components and hospitalization duration, it fills a critical gap in understanding how air pollution affects asthma severity across different age groups and regions.

The findings suggest that targeted reducing BC emissions could mitigate health risks associated with air pollution in high-risk areas like Yulin. Policymakers can use this insight to prioritize BC emission controls in air quality management efforts. Future research should focus on large-scale studies with precise individual exposure assessments to further elucidate the impact of specific PM₂.₅ components on asthma, guiding more effective prevention and management strategies.

Asthma represents one of the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases globally, affecting over 339 million people worldwide with substantial geographic and socioeconomic disparities in disease burden. Characterized by chronic airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and episodic symptoms including wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough, asthma imposes significant healthcare burdens and economic costs globally [1–3]. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 identified asthma as a leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), with particularly high burdens in developing countries experiencing rapid industrialization and urbanization [4,5].

In China, the epidemiological landscape of asthma has evolved dramatically alongside economic development and environmental changes. The prevalence has risen annually, reaching 4.2% among adults over 20 years, with control levels remaining suboptimal despite therapeutic advances. In 2019, asthma ranks 8th among 369 diseases in China in terms of age-standardized DALYs, reflecting its substantial public health impact. Regions like Yulin, characterized by intensive coal mining, heavy industry, and vehicular emissions, exhibit significantly elevated asthma risks, highlighting critical regional disparities in environmental health burdens.

The multifactorial etiology of asthma encompasses genetic predisposition, allergen exposure, respiratory infections, and critically, environmental air pollution. Particulate matter with diameters < 2.5µm (PM2.5) has emerged as a primary environmental trigger, capable of penetrating deep into alveolar spaces and potentially entering systemic circulation through the alveolar-capillary barrier [6]. PM2.5promotes asthma pathogenesis through multiple mechanisms: inducing inflammatory responses, generating oxidative stress, facilitating airway remodeling, and increasing bronchial hyperresponsiveness. However, PM2.5represents a complex mixture of water-soluble ions, inorganic elements, organic compounds, and carbonaceous components, with health effects potentially varying by chemical composition [7].

Despite extensive research linking PM2.5exposure to asthma exacerbations, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding component-specific health effects. Black carbon (BC), a major carbonaceous fraction resulting from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, possesses unique physicochemical properties that may confer distinct toxicological profiles [8]. BC particles serve as carriers for toxic organic compounds, demonstrate high surface reactivity, and exhibit prolonged atmospheric residence times. Recent studies have suggested BC may be particularly harmful due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species and penetrate deeply into respiratory tissues [9].

Most epidemiological studies have focused on PM2.5mass concentrations and acute care utilization (emergency department visits, hospital admissions), with limited investigation of component-specific effects on healthcare burden metrics. A systematic review revealed that Only 12% of PM2.5-asthma studies have disaggregated BC effects from bulk PM2.5concentrations [10]. Furthermore, hospital length of stay (LOS)- a critical indicator of disease severity, treatment complexity, and healthcare costs—remains virtually unexplored in BC exposure studies.

Hospital LOS represents a more nuanced outcome measure than simple admission rates, reflecting asthma exacerbation severity, treatment response, and recovery patterns. Extended hospitalizations impose substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems and families while indicating more severe inflammatory responses and potentially worse long-term prognosis. Understanding component-specific effects on LOS could inform targeted emission control strategies and clinical management protocols.

This study addresses these critical gaps by investigating the association between short-term exposure to PM2.5components—particularly black carbon—and hospital LOS among asthma patients in Yulin, China. By integrating high-resolution (10 Km) CMAQ model data with comprehensive electronic health records from 4,509 hospitalized asthma patients (2018 ~ 2023), we quantify BC-specific exposure-response coefficients for LOS and identify critical exposure windows through distributed lag modeling. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the association between BC exposure and hospital LOS in asthma patients, (2) identify vulnerable populations through age-stratified analyses, (3) assess seasonal variations in BC effects, and (4) characterize dose-response relationships using restricted cubic spline methods.

This retrospective cohort study included asthma patients (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes J45-J46) discharged from two tertiary hospitals (Class A and Class B) in Yulin City between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a diagnosis of asthma according to the"Guidelines for bronchial asthma prevent and management(2020 edition)“ [11] and the “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Bronchial Asthma (2016 Edition)“ [12]; (2) a hospital stay of 1 to 30 days. Exclusion criteria included: (1) incomplete clinical data; (2) incorrect disease coding. A total of 4,509 asthma patients were included (FigureS1). Data collected included patient name, sex, age, admission and discharge dates, primary diagnosis and codes, length of hospital stay, hospitalization costs, discharge status, season, and residential address. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First People’s Hospital of Yulin (No. 2024-006).

We collected daily average concentrations of PM2.5and its components—including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), sulfates (SO42−), nitrates (NO3−), and ammonium (NH4+) —in Yulin City from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2023. Data were sourced from the China Atmospheric Pollution Tracking monitoring website (TAP,https://tapdata.org.cn/), which utilizes a two-stage machine learning model with an out-of-bag cross validation R2of 0.80–0.88 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13.9 to 22.1µg/m³ [13]. This model integrates small sample sampling techniques and a tree-based gap-filling method to estimate daily PM2.5mass concentration across China, utilizing multiple data sources such as ground-based observations, satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological field, land use data, population and altitude. Similar approaches for sensor calibration and validation have been successfully implemented in urban monitoring networks, demonstrating the importance of robust quality control procedures for air pollution exposure assessment [14].

Based on the 10 km spatial resolution dataset and using PM2.5mass concentration as a constraint, daily PM2.5chemical component information was derived by applying modified Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model-simulated concentration fractions to partition the total PM2.5mass from TAP (R= 0.64–0.75, RMSE = 2.35–12.67) [15]. The CMAQ approach provides physically-based estimates of component ratios that are then applied to observationally-constrained PM2.5 mass concentrations, offering advantages over purely statistical or observational approaches for component estimation [16]. According to Wang et al. [15] and Fang et al. [17], the effects of PM2.5exposure are observable within 10 days, with different lag effects for various components.

Therefore, we obtained daily PM2.5mass concentration and their chemical constituents corresponding to the grid of participants’ residential addresses, calculating daily average for the day of hospital admission and the preceding 10 days. Exposure assignment was based on patients’ residential addresses at admission, matched to the nearest 10 km×10 km grid cell. To consider the lag effects of pollutants and the influence of meteorological conditions, we also calculated single-day lag values (lag0 to lag10) using a distributed lag non-linear model framework. The impact of pollutant concentrations on health effects is assessed from the current exposure day (lag0) up to 10 days prior (lag10). Lag0 represents the effect on the same day, while lag10 refers to the impact of the pollutant concentration with a single-day lag on the 10th day. Daily average temperature and relative humidity data were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Centre (https://data.cma.cn/en/).

The CMAQ-based component estimation method has been validated against ground-based measurements across multiple locations in China, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.75 for different components [18]. Black carbon concentrations estimated through this approach show good agreement with aethalometer measurements in urban environments, particularly in regions with high fossil fuel combustion activities similar to Yulin [19]. However, we acknowledge that grid-based exposure assessment introduces potential misclassification, particularly for highly spatially variable pollutants like BC, which can exhibit significant gradients near emission sources [20].

Based on previous literatures [21–23], the potential confounders included age, discharge department, sex, season(pollen season and non-pollen season), number of hospitalizations, discharge status, hospitalization costs, average temperature, and relative humidity should be taken into account were considered. Based on data from the National Statistical Office(https://www.stats.gov.cn/) and taking into account that different age groupings reflect diverse needs and applications, Age groups were defined as children (0–14 years), youth (15–35 years), middle-aged adults (36–65 years), and elderly (> 65 years). According to the Government’s report [24], the pollen season is from July to September each year, so we have categorized the season into pollen season (July-September) and non-pollen season (January-June and October-December). Since the higher frequencies were found in the respiratory and pediatric discharge departments, the discharges were divided into respiratory, pediatric, and others departments.

Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentage [n(%)], while continuous variables were presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed data, or median with interquartile range(IQR) for skewed data.

To assess the association between average concentrations of PM2.5and its components and the length of hospital stay among asthma patients, we employed generalized linear model (GLM) with a Gaussian distribution and identity link function. Individual GLMs were fitted for each lag period(lag0-lag10), based on previous literature demonstrating that PM₂.₅ component effects are observable within 10 days, with varying lag structures for different components [25]. The lag structure selection was informed by biological plausibility, as BC-induced inflammatory cascades and oxidative stress responses require several days to fully develop and manifest clinically [26].

Initially, we adjusted for age, discharge department, sex, number of hospitalizations, discharge status, hospitalization costs. Subsequently, to account for seasonal effects and meteorological confounding, we further adjusted for average temperature and relative humidity. Initially, we adjusted for age, discharge department, sex, number of hospitalizations, discharge status, and hospitalization costs. Subsequently, to account for seasonal effects and meteorological confounding, we further adjusted for average temperature and relative humidity. Variable selection was conducted based on a combination of univariate analyses (withp< 0.10 as the threshold for inclusion), clinical relevance, and reference to previous literature [27]. To prevent overfitting and improve model parsimony, stepwise selection was performed.

To examine potential nonlinear relationships between PM2.5components and length of stay, we utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) with four knots [28], estimating beta coefficients with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Knot positions based on quintiles (5%, 35%, 65%, 95) to ensure adequate data distribution across spline segments. The same covariates were included in RCS models as in the forementioned GLMs. Model adequacy was assessed through residual analysis and goodness-of-fit testing.

After adjusting for auxiliary variables, significant interactions with age and pollen season were observed, necessitating subgroup analyses by age groups and seasons. We acknowledge that multiple subgroup and lag-based analyses increase the risk of Type I error, and recommend that future studies consider appropriate multiple testing corrections such as Bonferroni adjustment or False Discovery Rate control.

Model diagnostics included assessment of residual normality through Q-Q plots and Shapiro-Wilk tests (p= 0.31), evaluation of model fit using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC = 213.4), and homoscedasticity examination through residual vs. fitted plots. Influence diagnostics were performed using Cook’s distance calculations. Additionally, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values were computed to assess potential multicollinearity among predictors, with all VIF values below 5, indicating no significant multicollinearity. Potential outliers were identified but retained in analyses, given the clinical nature of the data and the absence of data entry errors.

All statistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.2.2. employing two-sided tests with a significance level set at α = 0.05. The ‘stats’ package was used for GLM analyses, and ‘rms’ package for restricted cubic splines.

The median age of the participants was 57 years (IQR: 39–68 years), with a slight female predominance (53.9% female vs. 46.1% male). The median hospital stay was 8.00 days (IQR: 6.00–10.00 days), and the median hospital cost was 5509.14 Chinese yuan (CNY) (IQR: 3271.40-8773.07 CNY). Most patients were discharged in improved or cured conditions. The majority (62.6%) were admitted during the non-pollen season, and nearly half of patients (48.9%) were treated in the Respiratory Department. Regarding age distribution, 45.9% were middle-aged, followed by elderly patients (32.1%), children (15.5%), and young adults (6.5%)(Table1).

The median daily average PM2.5concentration on the day of admission and the preceding ten days was 23.00µg/m³ (IQR: 15.00–34.00µg/m³). The median daily average concentrations of key components were: BC. 0.94µg/m³ (IQR: 0.54–1.54µg/m³); NO3−, 3.14µg/m³ (IQR: 1.61–6.53µg/m³); NH4+, 2.53µg/m³ (IQR: 1.25–4.74µg/m³); OM, 4.74µg/m³ (IQR: 2.76–7.55µg/m³); SO42−, 3.49µg/m³ (IQR: 1.86–5.95µg/m³). Environmental factors included a median temperature of 15.43 °C (IQR: 3.75–21.24 °C) and median relative humidity of 51.36% (IQR: 39.36–61.09%)(TableS1).

GLM analysis revealed significant associations between PM2.5, its components, and the length of hospital stay (P< 0.05). BC demonstrated the strongest effect, particularly at lag9, where a 1µg/m3increase in BC concentration was associated with a 2.86-day increase in hospital stay. Other components, including PM2.5, OM, NH4+, SO42−, and NO3−, were also significant associations with prolonged hospital stays, although their effect varied by lag times. Notably, PM2.5, NO3⁻, and OM showed peak effects at lag3–lag4 and lag9, while NH4+extended hospital stays primarily at lag3–lag4, and SO42−exhibited effects at lag3–lag5 and lag9. These findings indicate that pollutants influence asthma patients’ health through multiple pathways, with distinct lag effects for each pollutant (Fig.1).

The median BC concentration was 0.94µg/m³ (IQR: 0.01–13.57µg/m³). RCS analysis indicated a statistically significant positive associated between BC concentration and hospital stay length, although the nonlinear fit was not significant (Pnon−linear=0.112). BC concentration below 1.98µg/m³ was associated with increasing hospital stays, whereas concentrations of 1.98µg/m³ or higher led to stabilization at approximately 8.80 days. Each 1.00µg/m3increase in BC concentration was associated with an additional 0.45 days in hospital stay (Fig.2).

Age-based subgroup analysis revealed that BC exposure significantly increased hospital stays for children and middle-aged patients, but had no significant effect on elderly patients. Exposure to OM and SO4²⁻ notably extended hospital stays for children, while SO4²⁻ and NO3⁻ significantly affected middle-aged patients (Fig.3).

Seasonal analysis showed that the effect of PM2.5on length of hospital stay was significantly greater in the non-pollen season compared to the pollen season (P< 0.05). Specifically, BC, OM, NH4⁺, SO4²⁻, and NO3⁻ contributed to increase hospital stays during the non-pollen season, with BC having the strongest effect. In contrast, no significant effects were observed during the pollen season (Figure S2).

Further analysis demonstrated a non-linear positive correlation between BC exposure and hospital stays in children (Pnon−linear<0.01), with hospital stays increasing most sharply when BC concentrations below 0.85µg/m³. In middle-aged patients, BC exposure was also positively associated with prolonged stays, although the nonlinear fit was not significant (Pnon−linear=0.205). In elderly patients, BC exposure had no significant effect (Fig.4).

Seasonal analysis confirmed that BC exposure was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stays during the non-pollen season, particularly when concentrations were below 2.29µg/m³, resulting in a steady increase in hospital stay. Each 1.00µg/m³ increase in BC was associated with up to a 0.77-days increase in hospital stay. During the pollen season, BC had a smaller and statistically insignificant impact (Pnon−linear= 0.557)(Figure S3).

This study provides novel evidence of component-specific PM2.5effects on asthma healthcare burden, identifying BC as a critical driver of extended hospitalization duration. Our findings demonstrate that each 1.00 µg/m³ increase in BC concentration at lag9 was significantly associated with a 0.45-day prolongation in hospital stay, with pronounced vulnerability in children and middle-aged adults during non-pollen seasons. These results contribute important insights to the limited literature on component-specific air pollution health effects and healthcare burden metrics.

The strongest association observed between BC and hospital LOS aligns with emerging evidence of BC’s unique toxicological properties. Unlike other PM₂.₅ components that primarily reflect secondary formation processes, BC represents primary combustion particles with distinct physicochemical characteristics that enhance toxicity. BC particles demonstrate exceptional surface reactivity, serving as condensation nuclei for organic and inorganic compounds, thereby delivering multiple toxic substances simultaneously to respiratory tissues. This multi-pollutant delivery mechanism may explain BC’s outsized impact compared to other components in our analysis.

Based on current evidence, we propose the following mechanistic pathway linking BC exposure to prolonged asthma hospitalizations. Phase 1 (Immediate, lag0-2): BC particle deposition in airways triggers immediate inflammatory responses through toll-like receptor activation and complement cascade stimulation [29]. Initial oxidative stress occurs through direct reactive oxygen species generation and antioxidant depletion. Phase 2 (Early inflammatory, lag3-5): Sustained inflammatory mediator release (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) promotes neutrophil and eosinophil recruitment [26]. Epithelial barrier dysfunction increases allergen penetration and amplifies inflammatory responses. Phase 3 (Peak clinical manifestation, lag6-10): Maximal inflammatory cascade development leads to severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway remodeling. Clinical symptoms peak around lag9, explaining our observed association with prolonged hospitalizations. Impaired lung function recovery and treatment resistance contribute to extended hospital stays.

The lag9 effect for BC suggests delayed inflammatory responses and clinical manifestations, consistent with previous research showing that BC-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades require several days to fully develop. The observed dose-response relationship, with effects plateauing at 1.98 µg/m³, indicates potential saturation of biological response mechanisms at higher exposure levels, possibly due to overwhelmed detoxification pathways or adaptive responses.

Our BC concentration range (median 0.94 µg/m³, IQR: 0.54–1.54 µg/m³) is comparable to levels reported in other Chinese industrial cities and tribal areas with intensive combustion activities [30,31]. This consistency across diverse geographical settings suggests that our findings may be generalizable to other regions with similar emission profiles and atmospheric conditions.

The pronounced vulnerability of children to BC exposure reflects multiple physiological factors. Children possess narrower airways, higher respiratory rates per unit body weight, and less developed antioxidant defense systems. Additionally, children spend more time outdoors and engage in higher levels of physical activity, potentially increasing effective exposure doses. Our finding of sustained associations in middle-aged adults (lag2-10) may reflect cumulative occupational exposures and age-related decline in respiratory function and immune response.

The absence of significant effects in elderly patients, while initially counterintuitive, may reflect survival bias, comorbidity masking, or differences in activity patterns that reduce exposure. Elderly patients with severe asthma may already have chronic airway inflammation that is less responsive to acute BC exposure, or their hospitalizations may be driven more by other factors such as respiratory infections or medication compliance.

The pronounced BC effects during non-pollen seasons highlight important exposure-disease interactions. During colder months, increased residential heating, reduced atmospheric mixing heights, and thermal inversions contribute to elevated BC concentrations and prolonged residence times. Additionally, indoor heating sources may create microenvironments with particularly high BC exposures, especially in regions like Yulin where coal and biomass combustion are prevalent.

The lack of significant effects during pollen season may reflect competing biological pathways, where allergen-induced inflammation dominates over pollutant-mediated effects. Alternatively, behavioral changes during pollen season (increased indoor time, air conditioner use) may reduce actual BC exposure despite ambient concentrations.

This study offers several methodological advantages over previous research. First, our focus on hospital LOS provides a more nuanced healthcare burden metric than simple admission counts, capturing disease severity and treatment complexity. Second, the CMAQ-based component estimation approach provides spatially and temporally resolved exposure estimates that better reflect population-level exposures than sparse monitoring networks. Third, our large sample size (4,509 patients) and six-year study period provide substantial statistical power for detecting component-specific effects and conducting stratified analyses.The distributed lag modeling framework allows identification of critical exposure windows while accounting for temporal correlation in exposure patterns. Our comprehensive confounder adjustment, including meteorological variables, patient characteristics, and healthcare system factors, strengthens causal inference compared to studies with limited covariate control.

Despite these strengths, several limitations warrant consideration and have important implications for interpretation of our findings.

The 10-km spatial resolution introduces exposure misclassification, particularly problematic for BC given its high spatial variability near emission sources such as traffic corridors and industrial facilities [32]. Urban transportation microenvironments can exhibit BC concentrations orders of magnitude higher than residential areas, as demonstrated in recent commuter exposure studies investigating college bus exposures in Indian cities [33]. This spatial averaging likely attenuates our effect estimates, suggesting that true associations may be stronger than observed.

Temporal resolution limitations also affect exposure assessment accuracy. Our 24-hour averaged concentrations mask important diurnal variations in BC levels, particularly morning and evening traffic peaks that may coincide with heightened respiratory susceptibility periods. Short-term BC spikes, which may trigger rapid-onset asthma exacerbations, are not captured in daily averages [34]. Similar challenges have been recognized in PM sensor accuracy studies, highlighting the importance of proper calibration procedures in urban monitoring networks [35].

Personal activity patterns introduce additional exposure misclassification. Most children spend > 8 h daily in school environments, while adults commute across multiple microenvironments with varying BC concentrations. Our residence-based exposure assignment cannot account for these mobility patterns, potentially affecting exposure-response estimates differently across age groups.

The retrospective observational design limits our ability to establish causal relationships between BC exposure and hospital length of stay. While we use association-based language throughout this manuscript, the temporal sequence and biological plausibility support our findings, but prospective studies with standardized clinical protocols would strengthen causal inference. Residual confounding represents a significant limitation. Individual-level factors unavailable in our retrospective design include: (1) smoking exposure and secondhand smoke exposure, (2) specific comorbidities and disease severity indicators, (3) medication compliance and treatment protocols, (4) socioeconomic status and health insurance coverage, (5) occupational exposures and indoor air pollution sources, and (6) genetic susceptibility factors. These unmeasured confounders could influence both BC exposure patterns and hospital length of stay. Multiple testing bias is acknowledged given our numerous subgroup and lag-based analyses. We conducted analyses across 11 lag periods, 4 age groups, 2 seasons, and 6 PM₂.₅ components, substantially increasing Type I error risk. While we report uncorrected p-values following epidemiological convention for exploratory analyses, future confirmatory studies should implement appropriate correction methods such as Bonferroni adjustment or False Discovery Rate control.

Healthcare system factors may also influence our findings. Hospital capacity constraints, discharge planning protocols, and seasonal variations in staffing could affect length of stay independent of pollution exposure. Additionally, healthcare-seeking behaviors may vary by socioeconomic status and access to care, potentially creating selection bias.

While our model diagnostics confirmed adequate fit and absence of severe multicollinearity, we acknowledge limitations in our analytical approach. The choice of knot placement for restricted cubic splines, while following established methods, may affect nonlinearity assessment. Future studies might benefit from more flexible modeling approaches such as generalized additive models (GLMs) or machine learning techniques that can better capture complex exposure-response relationships.

To address these limitations, future studies should prioritize personal exposure monitoring approaches. Miniaturized aethalometers capable of 1-minute temporal resolution measurements could capture individual BC exposure patterns across multiple microenvironments [33]. Integrating personal monitoring data with high-resolution land use regression models and real-time GPS tracking would provide unprecedented exposure assessment accuracy.

Prospective cohort designs with standardized clinical protocols would strengthen causal inference while allowing control for individual-level confounders. Biomarker studies measuring inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress indicators, and respiratory function could elucidate mechanistic pathways linking BC exposure to prolonged hospitalization.

Our findings provide quantitative evidence supporting BC-specific emission controls in air quality management. Traditional PM₂.₅ mass-based standards may inadequately protect public health if more toxic components like BC are not specifically regulated. Targeted interventions reducing combustion emissions—particularly from transportation, residential heating, and industrial sources—could yield disproportionate health benefits.

Clinical implications include enhanced environmental exposure assessment in asthma management, particularly for pediatric patients during non-pollen seasons. Air quality forecasting systems incorporating BC-specific predictions could inform clinical decision-making and patient counseling regarding exposure avoidance strategies.

This retrospective cohort study demonstrates that black carbon exposure is significantly associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in asthma patients, with each 1.00 µg/m³ increase at lag9 associated with 0.45 additional hospitalization days, particularly affecting children and middle-aged adults during non-pollen seasons. Our findings suggest that BC-specific emission controls could yield disproportionate health benefits compared to general PM₂.₅ reduction strategies. However, the observational design, potential exposure misclassification, and residual confounding preclude definitive causal inference. Future prospective studies with personal exposure monitoring and biomarker assessments are essential to establish causal relationships and inform evidence-based interventions for reducing pollution-related asthma burden.
