The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) captures a child’s participation across home, school, and community-based activities as well as environmental factors perceived as supporting/hindering this participation. This tool has been translated into Spanish for use in the United States and Colombia but there are linguistic and sociocultural differences between these countries and Spain. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a country-specific measure to promote environment-based interventions for Spanish children with disabilities. This study aims to adapt the PEM-CY for use with children and youth in Spain, and to investigate its psychometric properties.

Seven hundred thirteen parents of children with (n= 233) and without (n= 480) disabilities, aged 5 to 17, completed the Spanish version of PEM-CY. For the test–retest reliability study, 30 of these parents completed the instrument twice.

Internal consistency (0.58–0.97) and test–retest reliability (0.31–0.92) ranged from moderate to very satisfactory, according to Cronbach’s alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients. Discriminant validity, assessed through two-way ANOVA, was supported by significant differences between children with and without disabilities on participation and environment scales (p< .05). Some significant age differences were identified for participation at home and school. Validity was supported by a significant negative Pearson’s correlation (-0.32 to -0.41,p< .05) between desire for change and overall environmental supports.

The Spanish version of the PEM-CY is a valid and reliable tool to determine the participation and associated environmental factors in Spanish children and youth, with and without disabilities. It provides useful information for designing environment-based interventions to promote their participation.

Participation is conceptualized by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) [1] as “an individual’s involvement in life situations” affected by both personal and environmental factors. Among children with disabilities, successful participation in everyday situations is a sign of health and an essential rehabilitation goal [2–4] because it provides many opportunities to enhance abilities, social relationships, and overall quality of life [5,6]. Children with disabilities often experience substantial limitations in participation compared to their typically developing peers. These limitations vary depending on the type and severity of the disability, but are especially prevalent among children with physical, intellectual, or sensory disabilities (e.g., hearing or vision loss), as well as those neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disabilities. Research consistently shows that these conditions are associated with reduced frequency, diversity, and involvement in everyday activities across home, school, and community contexts, partly due to the interaction with environmental barriers such as insufficient support, inaccessibility, and negative social attitudes [2,4,6].

Therefore, an important aim for families and health and education professionals is to identify and improve the participation profiles of children with disabilities [2,3,7,8]. Most rehabilitation interventions proposed in the last decade have focused on modifying environmental conditions [7,9,10], but prior to attempting environment-based interventions, it is critical to analyze these children’s participation, as well as environmental supports and barriers, using valid and reliable measures [11].

The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) by Coster et al. [12,13] captures a child’s participation across a broad range of home, school, and community-based activities [14] while examining a variety of environmental factors (e.g., physical layout, social or cognitive demands of activities) that parents perceive as supporting/hindering their child’s participation [11]. The PEM-CY is a reliable, valid measure for children and youths (5–17 years), with or without disabilities [12–15], and it is suitable for minors across various disability types or health conditions, including developmental delay, orthopedic impairment, emotional impairment, speech/language impairment, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, health impairment, hearing impairment, learning disability, and other cognitive-behavioral or emotional difficulties (e.g., dyslexia, anxiety, depression) [8,13,14]. It has been applied in many countries [11,16,17] and translated into 22 languages [18].

The two Spanish versions of the PEM-CY were translated for use in the United States and Colombia [18]. Because there are major linguistic, social, and cultural differences between these countries and Spain, it is necessary to develop another country-specific measure that properly assesses children’s participation and environmental factors in order to promote environment-based interventions for Spanish children with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) and chronic health conditions. This is one of the guidelines established by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [19], as well as by Spanish rehabilitation, educational, and social legislation [20,21].

This study aimed to develop the Spanish version of the PEM-CY to be applied to Spanish children and youth aged 5 to 17 and to establish its psychometric properties, including its reliability (internal consistency and test–retest reliability) as well as its discriminant validity.

The PEM-CY is a parent-report questionnaire of 25 items that assesses children’s participation in broad types of activities at home (10 items), school (5), and community (10) settings considering three dimensions: frequency, involvement, and desire for change [22]. The PEM-CY also has 45 items about the environmental impact on home, school, and community participation [12,13]. For each setting, parents are asked to report whether certain factors support/hinder their child’s participation and whether supportive resources are perceived to be available. The original PEM-CY can be completed in either paper- or web-based format.

For all sections, the internal consistency of the PEM-CY has shown to be moderate to very good (Cronbach's α = 0.59–0.91) and the test–retest reliability is found to be moderate to good when assessed within a 4-week period after the completion of the first round (ICC 0.58–0.95) [12]. The validity of the PEM-CY is established because this measure identified a significant impact of disability on children’s participation across all variables and settings [12,14]. Also, age group was found to have a significant effect in children (with and without disabilities) for participation involvement at home and school, but not in the community [12].

In order to achieve the maximum level of conceptual, item, semantic, operational, and measurement equivalence, the Spanish version of the PEM-CY was developed considering the International Test Commission Guidelines for test translation and adaptation [23,24] as well as recommendations for cross-cultural adaptations of participation measures, including those provided by Stevelink and van Brakel [25] and Tomas et al. [8]. The adaptation process consisted of five phases, depicted in Fig.1: (1) forward translation, (2) consensual synthesis, (3) cognitive interviews, (4) back translation, and (5) pilot study.

After obtaining the authors'permission to begin adaptation, two independent translations were carried out by two bilingual translators with PhDs in psychology. For each item, the translators were asked to indicate both the level of equivalence of the translated version and the difficulty of the translation according to a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (completely). Subsequently, a committee of experts from the research team reviewed the independent translations and generated a consensual version adapted to the Spanish context.

Next, 10 parents of children with disabilities between 5 and 17 years were invited to participate in two rounds of cognitive interviews. They were asked about the degree of clarity, adequacy, and cultural acceptability of the instructions, items, and response options. The parents’ suggestions were analyzed by the research team to introduce modifications and improvements into the pre-final version of the PEM-CY.

Next, a back translation was developed by a bilingual translator with a PhD in psychology. This step aimed to ensure that there were no problems of cultural accuracy and conceptual equivalence despite the modifications introduced during the process.

A small pilot study was then conducted with a sample of 6 parents of children aged 5 to 17 years, both with and without diagnosis/disability. Participants were asked to read the instrument and assess (a) the format, (b) possibly misleading wording, (c) the level of comprehension of the instructions and items, (d) possible difficulties in answering the instrument, and (e) the time to complete it. Finally, the research team conducted a last review of the instrument before submitting it to the PEM-CY team for approval.

Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of University of Salamanca (Ref. 0000407). Participants were recruited via convenience sampling from schools in all geographical regions of Spain between September 2020 and September 2022, and therefore during a period of social restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. School principals and associations of families of children with disabilities were provided with detailed information on the study. Potential participants were asked to sign the informed consent form and voluntarily complete the Spanish version of the PEM-CY on an online platform if they met the following inclusion criteria: (a) they were parents or legal guardians of children and youths with or without diagnoses (e.g., chronic health problems such as asthma)/disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, ASD), (b) they were able to read Spanish, and (c) their child was 5 to 17 years old during the study.

The Spanish version of the PEM-CY was administered to a sample of 713 parents of children with (n= 233) and without (n= 480) diagnosis/disability. Moreover, a subsample of 30 parents was self-selected to complete the instrument twice within an interval of 6 to 8 weeks of the first completion for test–retest reliability study. This time frame was greater than in prior similar studies because of circumstances that hindered participants’ commitment to the study (i.e., the summer season).

For the present study, a sociodemographic questionnaire was designed to obtain information about child and family characteristics—specifically, on children’s gender, age, and diagnoses/disabilities, as well as on respondents’ relationship with the children, educational level, and employment status (Table1).

A total of 713 parents of children and youth with and without disabilities (Table1) were used to determine the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of PEM-CY, after meeting the following criteria for inclusion in analysis: (1) providing responses to the “child age” and “disability” questions and (2) answering at least two questions of the “participation at home” section—the same criteria used by the authors of the original scale [12]. It should be noted that the survey was not fully completed by all participants; consequently, the number considered in each analysis differed. Missing data were handled according to the PEM-CY scoring guidelines, which recommend calculating summary scores based on the percent maximum possible, using only the items that were actually answered. This approach, described in the original validation study [12], avoids the need for data imputation and allows for inclusion of partial responses while preserving the validity of the scores.

Descriptive statistics were used, on the one hand, to summarize participants’ characteristics, and on the other, to summarize participants’ perceptions on participation (frequency, involvement, and desire for change) and environment (environmental supports, barriers, helpfulness and resources and overall environmental supports): specifically, mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, and percentage for categorical variables.

The reliability of the Spanish version of PEM-CY was assessed in terms of internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to examine the internal consistency of both participation and environment scales. Values ranging from 0.70 to 0.95 were considered satisfactory [26]. Test–retest reliability was assessed in a subsample (n= 30) similar in size to that used by the authors of the original scale [12], through intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a two-way mixed effects model for absolute agreement. An ICC agreement ≥ 0.70 indicated sufficient test–retest reliability, > 0.75 excellent, 0.40 to 0.75 fair/good, and < 0.40 poor [27].

The validity of the Spanish PEM-CY was examined in terms of discriminant validity by assessing the extent to which scores were consistent with our hypotheses about the existence of significant differences in parents’ perceptions of their children's participation and influencing environmental factors as a function of the child having or not a disability, but not of the age group. This approach follows the validation strategy used in the original PEM-CY study by Coster et al. [12], where significant differences between children with and without disabilities were identified using known-groups comparisons. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for each outcome variable to examine the main effects of age group (5–11 and 12–17 years) and disability (yes/no), as well as the interaction effects between these two factors. When appropriate, post hoc tests and effect-size calculations were conducted. Finally, consistent with the analysis used for the validation of the original scale, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between desire for change and overall environmental supports. A value ofp< 0.05 was considered the cut-off for statistical significance. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.26 was used for all analyses.

Table1shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants.

In both samples (total and retest), most respondents were mothers in a nuclear family and had several children. A significant percentage of fathers and mothers had a high educational level (higher vocational education or university), and both fathers and mothers were employed (Table1). The total and retest samples were similar in all sociodemographic characteristics except for the proportion of children with disability: 32.7% and 63.6%, respectively. The children’s diagnoses/disability reported most frequently by the participants were health conditions like asthma and other chronic diseases (22.3%), intellectual disability (15.5%), delayed educational system incorporation or low school performance (13.3%), and learning disabilities (12.0%) (Table2).

Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for participation and environment scales at home, school and community settings, were satisfactory (≥ 0.74), with the exception of frequency of participation at home and school. The best values were obtained for the community setting (Table3).

The sample sizes of these analyses were small for participation scales (n= 30–25) and for environment scales (n= 30–22). As for participation scales, the ICCs of frequency were fair/good for school and excellent for home and community. These coefficients were also excellent for involvement across the three settings. For environment scales, ICCs of overall environmental supports were good for school and community, but poor for home (Table3).

Results of two-way ANOVA to examine the effects of child’s diagnosis/disability and age group are presented separately in Tables4and5, respectively, because there were no significant interaction effects between these two variables for the participation scales (frequency [F(1,470) = 1.73,p= 0.19], involvement [F(1,470) = 0.08,p= 0.78], or desire for change [F(1,470) = 0.08,p= 0.78]), nor for the environmental scales (supports [F(1,470) = 0.05,p= 0.83] and barriers [F(1,470) = 0.05,p= 0.83]).

There was a significant effect of child’s diagnoses across all settings and all variables, except for environmental resources at home (Table4). According to parents’ scores, children with disabilities participated in a lower percentage of activities, their frequency of participation and involvement was lower, and parents’ desire for change was higher, regardless of age group. In relation to the environment, parents of children with disabilities reported lower scores for environmental supports (except at home), helpfulness, resources, and overall environmental supports, and showed higher scores for environmental barriers, regardless of the child’s age group. The highest effect sizes were obtained for environmental barriers (eta2= 0.201), resources (eta2= 0.318), and overall environmental supports (eta2= 0.219).

There was a significant effect of the child’s age group for participation variables at home (except for involvement) and school, but not in the community setting (except for frequency and desire for change) or for environment variables (Table5). In the case of home activities, parents reported that youths (12–17 years) participated in a higher percentage of activities, but with lower frequency, and parents’ desire for change was higher. In the case of school activities, significant effects were found on all variables: youths participated in a lower percentage of activities, with lower frequency and involvement, and parents’ desire for change was higher. As for community activities, youths participated with lower frequency and their parents’ desire for change was higher. This pattern of results was similar for participants with and without diagnosis/disability, as the interaction was not significant.

For the whole sample, there was a significant negative medium correlation (p< 0.001) between desire for change and overall environmental supports for each setting: home (r= −0.32), school (r= −0.41), and community (r= −0.40). The same pattern of relations was found in both groups: disability (home,r= −0.24,p= 0.003; school,r= −0.39,p< 0.001; community,r= −0.44,p< 0.001) and without disability (home,r= −0.18,p= 0.002; school,r= −0.26p< 0.001; community,r= −0.09,p= 0.156). These correlations were higher for children with a diagnosis/disability.

The Spanish version of the PEM-CY is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the participation of Spanish children and youths (with and without disabilities) at home, school, and community settings, as well as the environmental factors that support or hinder this participation.

Reliability assessed with internal consistency was satisfactory to excellent for all scales except frequency of participation at home and school. These results are similar to those of the original [12] and other versions [11,16,28]. Additionally, the test–retest reliability of the Spanish version of PEM-CY was excellent for participation involvement across the three settings, and for participation frequency at home and in the community, but not at school. Between the two applications of the PEM-CY, there were continuous modifications of the measures implemented in the schools to adapt to the changing situation of the COVID-19 pandemic; this directly influenced the stability of the measure of participation in the school. The ICC scores for environment scales were good for school and community, but poor for home; the small size of the sample may explain this last result. Also, because the retest was applied during summer holidays, participants’ homes and their supports/barriers may have varied, as well as their personal involvement in providing support to their children.

In relation to discriminant validity, and similarly to the original [12] and other versions of the PEM-CY [11,16,22,28], the Spanish version can differentiate between children with and without disabilities. Children with disabilities participated in fewer activities across all settings, their frequency of participation and involvement were lower, and their parents’ desire for change was higher, regardless of age group. Additionally, these parents reported fewer environmental supports and more barriers to the participation of their children, again independently of age group. Similarly to Kaya Kara et al. [16] and Jeong et al. [28], no significant differences were found in environmental supports at home. This result may indicate that families provide supports at home regardless of the diagnoses/disability of their children, even in exceptional circumstances such as COVID-19 lockdowns, which made some environmental factors favorable in the home settings. In any case, these results highlight the need for environment-based interventions to enhance the participation of children with disabilities.

With regard to age, we found significant differences for participation at home and school. Youths participated in a higher percentage of activities at home, perhaps due to their increased autonomy, albeit with lower frequency. Further implications may be derived from the data related to the school setting. Youths participated in a lower percentage of school activities, with a lower frequency and involvement, and their parents’ desire for change was higher. This result differs slightly from that obtained in other studies where activity participation has been found to increase as children without disabilities grow older, and decrease for those with disabilities [16,29]. In our case, participation was lower in both groups of youths (i.e., with and without disabilities) compared to the sample of children. Again, this may be partly explained by the fact that the study was developed during COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that, as social restrictions loosened, youths prioritized community activities to counteract the isolation suffered in the previous months. Parents’ desire for change may have resulted from fear of their children becoming infected if they increased their social contacts in non-formal settings.

Finally, the significant negative correlation between desire for change and environmental supports in all settings corroborates the validity of the measure.

The present study has some limitations. Firstly, the instrument was applied only in an online, self-administered format because of the COVID-19 socio-health situation. Thus, on the one hand, the anonymity of the web-based procedure may have led participants to provide less thoughtful responses, especially in the retest phase. On the other hand, participation was one of the dimensions most affected by the pandemic, which prevents the generalization of results to less extraordinary situations. In the short term, the Spanish version of the PEM-CY will allow us to verify whether participation profiles in school and the community, especially, and the barriers experienced, change and in what sense, in less exceptional situations.

Secondly, a more in-depth exploration of the participation profiles and barriers experienced by children and young people with sensory and emotional problems is necessary. In this study, these two groups were notably underrepresented. On the other hand, mental health issues among children and adolescents have increased significantly worldwide, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [30]. Recent international reports, such as those by Liu et al. [31], underscore the urgent need to intensify post-pandemic mental health support. However, before implementing interventions targeting this population, it is imperative to identify the specific environmental barriers they face.

Thirdly, the educational level of participants is high and may not be representative of the general population. Moreover, because two-parent Spanish families with high educational levels are more likely to enjoy higher incomes, they are in a better position to offer support to their children with disabilities, and their responses may not be applicable to families with lower educational and economic levels. Therefore, future studies should ensure representation of families with different educational levels and incomes, and should also compare the differences in participation and environmental support/barriers according to other relevant child or family variables (e.g., severity of the disability).

Additionally, internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) was calculated using the full sample only, without separating participants by diagnostic status. Although this approach follows the procedure used in the original PEM-CY validation study, future research should examine whether the internal consistency of the instrument varies between groups with and without disabilities. Such analyses would help to assess the scale’s measurement invariance and ensure the robustness of comparisons across subgroups.

Finally, the PEM-CY is a parent-reported questionnaire and, as such, parents’ perceptions of their children’s participation may differ from their children’s self-perceptions [32]. Therefore, there is a need to develop child-reported participation measures. Currently, we have the Spanish Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) to assess children’s participation in leisure activities [33], and we are developing the School Participation Questionnaire to assess the school participation of students with and without disabilities from the student’s own perspective. By simultaneously administering the Spanish version of the European Child Environment Questionnaire (ECEQ) [34]-a tool designed to identify environmental barriers and facilitators for the participation of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and other disabilities- we will be able to confirm the criterion validity of our instrument.

The Spanish version of the PEM-CY is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the participation of Spanish children and youths (with and without disabilities) at home, school, and community settings, as well as the environmental factors that support or hinder this participation.

It provides useful information for designing environment-based interventions aimed at minimizing the effect of the barriers that limit this participation.
