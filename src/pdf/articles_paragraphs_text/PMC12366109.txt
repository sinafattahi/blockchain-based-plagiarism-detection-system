Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)is a significant global health threat, particularly in hospital environments, where it is often linked to severe infections. As the need for innovative therapeutic approaches grows, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have gained attention because of their high specificity, reduced immunogenicity, and enhanced affinity for target antigens, which may improve clinical efficacy.

Using the Beacon platform, we isolated single B cells from immunized humanized genomic orthologs for antibody development (HUGO-Ab) mice to develop outer membrane protein (OMP)-specific mAbs. The variable regions of the selected mAbs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing constant human IgG1 regions to generate fully human mAbs. After identifying mAbs binding to Omp38 via ELISA, their binding ability to LAC-4 and the clinical isolates was further evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of these mAbs onA. baumanniiadhesion and biofilm formation were tested, and their protective efficacy was assessed using a lethal infection model. Finally, bioinformatics methods were used to predict the binding conformation of mAb F2 to Omp38.

Omp38-specific fully human mAb F2 potently and broadly bound toA. baumanniistrains and inhibited bacterial adherence and biofilm formation. Binding modeling and conformational analysis revealed that F2 targets the extracellular region of Omp38 and forms stable hydrogen bonds with different strains, suggesting its potential for broad-spectrum binding to diverseA. baumanniistrains.

This study demonstrates the utility of high-throughput single-cell analysis and antibody engineering in developing fully human mAbs againstA. baumannii, highlighting the potential of these novel fully human mAbs to advance therapeutic strategies and improve clinical outcomes forA. baumanniiinfections.

Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)has emerged as a significant threat in healthcare settings, known for its role in severe opportunistic infections, particularly among immunocompromised patients and in intensive care units (ICUs) [1,2]. This pathogen is notorious for its profound ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance, leading to infections that are difficult to treat and resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality [1,2].

Standard treatment regimens often include a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics; however, this approach can lead to suboptimal outcomes, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality rates, especially in immunocompromised patients [3,4]. Additionally, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains poses a serious threat to effective treatment options [3,4]. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has several advantages over traditional antibiotics, including high specificity to their targets, increased therapeutic predictability, and a lower likelihood of adverse side effects due to reduced off-target activity [5]. Moreover, mAbs can be engineered to improve their pharmacokinetics, enabling prolonged biological activity and retention in circulation [6].

The earliest mAbs were mouse-derived antibodies invented by G Köhler and C Milstein in 1975 [7,8]. However, because the constant region of mouse-derived mAbs is recognized by the human immune system, the vast majority (up to 80%) of patients who receive mouse-derived mAb therapy develop anti-murine antibody responses (human anti-mouse antibody, HAMA) [9,10]. In contrast, humanized mAbs provide significant advantages by minimizing immunogenic risks while retaining the ability to bind to target antigens with high specificity [11,12]. With the development of fully human mAbs, the efficacy and safety of the treatment of various infections have improved [13,14]. In recent years, in vitro technologies such as phage display, ribosome display, and mRNA display have emerged that generate fully human antibodies from antibody gene libraries, which can even surpass the natural human antibody repertoire [15]. However, mAbs produced using these in vitro methods tend to have relatively low affinity, as they have not undergone processes such as affinity maturation [16]. Recent studies have shown that advancements have been made in techniques utilizing transgenic animals with a human antibody gene repertoire to obtain fully human antibodies [15,17]. This approach allows for the integration of modern recombinant DNA technologies with well-established immunization techniques to produce affinity-matured human antibodies [15,18].

A. baumanniipossesses a diverse array of protein targets with potential therapeutic implications, among which Omp38 stands out as a particularly significant OMP [1,19,20]. It plays a crucial role in mediating bacterial adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation [1,19,20]. Furthermore, Omp38 modulates inflammatory responses and influences various aspects of host immune defense mechanisms [1,21]. Our previous study developed Omp38-specific murine mAbs in a high-throughput manner and found that the mAbs played an important role againstA. baumanniiinfection [22]. However, no studies have focused on fully humanized mAbs against Omp38.

In this study, we immunized humanized genomic orthologs for antibody development (HUGO-Ab) mice with outer membrane proteins (OMP) and then utilized the Beacon platform for high-throughput single B cell isolation as previously described [22], which facilitates the identification and selection of high-affinity antibodies directly from the immune repertoire of the mice. Subsequently, we confirmed the binding activity and impact of these mAbs on bacterial invasiveness. Through these innovative approaches, Omp38-sepcific fully human mAbs may contribute to improved treatment outcomes forA. baumanniiinfections in clinical settings.

Ethical approval was obtained from the Animal Ethics and Experimental Committee of the Army Medical University in Chongqing, China (Approval No. 20250017). All surgical instruments and the operating environment were maintained under sterile conditions to minimize the risk of infections. Surgical procedures were conducted by skilled personnel to ensure operational precision, minimize bleeding, and reduce tissue trauma in mice.

ExpiCHO cells were cultured in MetaCell CHO-310 medium (Cellplus Bio, Catalog No. L1013). Six-to eight-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Army Medical University. The HUGO-Ab mouse was developed based on Cyagen’s proprietary TurboKnockout ES targeting technology. It features the replacement of the mouse heavy chain, kappa light chain, and lambda light chain V(D)J genes with human sequences and is designed for the discovery of fully human antibodies.

A total of 50 µg of OMPs was combined with 50 µL of QuickAntibody Mouse3W (Biodragon, Catalog No. KX0210042) were intramuscularly injected into the calf muscles of 6–8-week-old HUGO-Ab mice on days 0, 14, and 21 [22]. On day 21, a minor blood sample was collected from the tail vein to determine the serum OMP antibody titer using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [22]. The mouse with the highest anti-OMP polyclonal antibody titer was selected for further experimental procedures. Furthermore, a final booster injection was delivered intraperitoneally three days before conducting assessments using the Beacon system.

Before performing the on-chip assay, biotinylated outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were immobilized onto streptavidin-functionalized assay beads (Berkeley Lights, 520 − 00053) through overnight incubation at 4 °C [22]. The conjugated beads were subsequently mixed with a fluorescently labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568, Thermo Fisher, A-11004) at a dilution of 1:100 [22].

The ASCs were then loaded onto OptoSelect 11k chips and cultured at 25 °C in a specialized plasmablast survival medium (Berkeley Lights, 75002051) formulated to enhance antibody secretion while preserving cell viability [22–24]. Single-cell encapsulation was achieved using optoelectropositioning (OEP) technology, allowing for the optical transfer of ASCs into nanoliter-sized chambers referred to as NanoPens. This light-based manipulation technique enabled the distribution of thousands of ASCs across multiple chips into NanoPens [22]. A fluorescence-based on-chip assay was conducted to identify antibodies binding to the OMPs, with fluorescence intensity measurements recorded at 5-minute intervals for a total duration of 20 min under controlled conditions at 36 ℃ [22]. OMP-specific antibody-producing cells were identified within NanoPens [22]. After isolating and transferring antigen-specific B cells from the NanoPens using opto-electro-positioning (OEP), the microfluidic chips were rinsed with culture medium for 2 min per cell. Subsequently, the cells were exported into wells of 96-well RT-PCR plates preloaded with lysis buffer (Qiagen, 1070498) and maintained at 25 ℃ [22].

After being exported from the Beacon system, the VH and VL sequences of antibodies secreted by OMP-binding B cells were amplified using reagents provided in the Opto Plasma B Discovery cDNA Synthesis Kit (Berkeley Lights, 750–02030) [22]. RNA was extracted and purified from single B cells using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63987) [22]. Subsequently, first-strand cDNA synthesis and total cDNA amplification were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Berkeley Lights, 750–02030). The amplified total cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) and subsequently prepared for sequencing using the Opto Plasma B Discovery Sanger Prep Kit (Berkeley Lights, 750–02041) [22]. Sanger sequencing was used to determine the nucleotide sequences of the amplified products [22]. VH, VL, and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, as well as somatic hypermutation frequencies, were analyzed using Geneious Prime (version 2021.0.3) and the IMGT database (https://www.imgt.org/). The paired VH and VL sequences for the selected mAbs were codon-optimized, synthesized by Shenggong Biotech, and subsequently cloned into separate mammalian expression vectors carrying constant human IgG1 regions to develop fully human mAbs.

ExpiCHO cells were cultured to achieve a density of approximately 8 × 106to 1 × 107cells/mL, while maintaining a viability rate exceeding 98% [22]. The vectors were transfected into 2 × 10⁸ ExpiCHO cells using equal volumes of electroporation buffer parts A and B (Celetrix, 1228), followed by incubation at 37 ℃ in a 7% CO₂ environment. At 18–22 h post-transfection (day 1), the cell culture media was supplemented with 10% MetaCell CHO TransFeed (Cellplus Bio, L1008) and 0.7% MetaCell Tier Enhancer (Cellplus Bio, L1009) [22]. After a 5-day incubation period, samples with viable cell densities exceeding 50% and cell viability rates above 60% were harvested, and the supernatants were purified using Pierce centrifuge columns (Thermo Scientific, 89898) [22]. T The bound mAbs were washed with a buffer (5× sample volume) containing 100 mM Pro-Ac (pH 3.5). The pH of each sample was then adjusted to 5.0 using 0.5 M arginine [22]. The samples were concentrated using 50 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) membrane centrifugal filter units (Millipore, UFC905008) and centrifuged at 3500 × g for 3 min. Subsequently, the samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter (Millipore, GSWP04700) [22]. The yield of purified mAbs was quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, P0012), and their purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC). Purified mAbs were stored at −80 °C for long-term preservation.

A total of 0.4 µg of recombinant Omp38 or 1 × 10⁷ colony-forming units (CFUs) ofA. baumanniiwere added to each well of 96-well ELISA plates (LABSELECT, 31111) and incubated overnight at 4 °C [22]. The plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P3563), followed by blocking with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, A5669701) in PBS for 1 h [22]. After blocking, the plates were washed three times. Serial dilutions of either recombinant mAb or isotype control mAb (MedChemExpress, HY-P99001) were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 ℃ for 1 h [22]. Following three washes, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H + L) (AB Clonal, AS002) was added and incubated at 37 ℃ for an additional hour. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Beyotime, P0209), and color development was allowed to proceed in the dark. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 N hydrochloric acid, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm wavelength. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) was determined using a four-parameter nonlinear regression model.

A. baumanniiadherence assay was performed following previously established protocols [19,22,25].A. baumanniiATCC 17,978 was cultured overnight in 10 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 37 ℃ with moderate shaking at 175 rpm. The bacterial suspensions were washed with PBS and adjusted to approximately 1.0 × 10⁹ CFU/mL. After A549 cells adhered to the plate, the complete Ham’s F-12 K (Kaighn’s) medium was replaced with culture medium containing heat-inactivated FBS (incubated at 56 ℃ for 30 min) and preincubated at 37 ℃ for 30 min to eliminate complement interference. The cells were then infected with liveA. baumanniiATCC 17,978 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:100. Subsequently, either mAb or isotype control was added. The infected cells were incubated at 37 ℃ in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere for 90 min. To quantify the adherent bacteria, nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing the cells four times with PBS. The cells were then lysed by adding 100 µL of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS per well [19], and the number of adherent bacteria was determined using the serial dilution method.

The biofilm inhibition assay was conducted according to the methodology outlined in previous studies [19,22].A. baumanniiATCC 17,978 was cultured overnight in 10 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 37 ℃ with moderate shaking at 175 rpm. The bacterial suspensions were washed with PBS and adjusted to approximately 1.0 × 10⁷ CFU/mL. In each well of a 96-well polystyrene plate, 180 µL of the bacterial suspension and 20 µL of mAb was combined. The edges of the plate were sealed with film, and the plate was incubated at 37 ℃ for 26 h to facilitate biofilm formation. After incubation, the biofilm was fixed by adding 120 µL of methanol to each well for 20 min. The bacterial suspension was carefully aspirated, and the plate was washed twice with deionized water, followed by air-drying for 4 h. Subsequently, 150 µL of 0.1% crystal violet stain was added to each well, and the samples were stained for 30 min. The crystal violet solution was removed, and the wells were rinsed thoroughly with physiological saline until the wash solution became colorless. The plate was then air-dried overnight. To solubilize the biofilm, 120 µL of 95% ethanol was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 600 nm using a microplate reader.

Prior to the formal experiments, we conducted a series of dose-ranging studies and confirmed that the optimal challenge dose of LAC-4 was 1.4 × 10⁷ CFU (FigureS1). C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital sodium at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Following anesthesia, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of 1.4 × 10⁷ CFU of LAC-4 suspended in 20 µL of PBS, delivered via noninvasive intratracheal inoculation, as previously described [22,26,27]. Immediately after inoculation, the mice were intravenously treated with mAbs. LAC-4 was quantified and verified using a serial dilution method. To assess survival rates in mice with lethalA. baumanniiinfection, seven mice from each group were anesthetized through intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital at a dosage of 50 mg/kg to guarantee that the animals were unconscious and unaware during the procedure and then euthanized by cervical dislocation 72 h postinfection.

This study employed two protein structure prediction platforms, AlphaFold3 and GeoBiologics, to generate a three-dimensional structural model of the antigen-antibody complex between the Omp38-specific mAb F2 and the Omp38 protein of a reference strain ofA. baumannii(ATG88079.1) from the NCBI GenBank database. Building upon the antigen-antibody complex structures predicted by AlphaFold3 and GeoBiologics, the “Build Homology Models” module in Discovery Studio 2.5 was used to construct the antigen-antibody complex structures of Omp38 and mAb F2 from other strains. In the calculation of interaction energy, the loop regions of the antigen and the variable region of the antibody within the antigen-antibody complex structure were designated as the interaction regions, whereas the remaining regions were considered as “fixed.” The “Standard Dynamic Cascade” function in Discovery Studio 2.5 was applied to perform energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations using the CHARMm force field. Energy minimization was accomplished through the sequential use of the “Steepest Descent” and “Conjugate Gradient” methods until the root-mean-square (RMS) gradient reached 0.1. Subsequently, a 5000 picosecond (ps) equilibration process was conducted at 300 K, with the other parameters set to their default values. For the result output, the structures from the last 1000 ps of the dynamic calculation were extracted, with one conformation saved every 10 ps, yielding a total of 100 conformations. The “Calculate Interaction Energy Protocol” integrated in Discovery Studio 2.5 was employed to determine the interaction energy between the antigen and antibody, using “Implicit Distance-dependent Dielectrics” as the dielectric constant. The average interaction energy of the 100 output conformations was used to assess the strength of the interaction forces between the antibody and different antigens, and the conformation with the lowest energy among the output conformations was selected as the final complex.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using Student’s t-test. Survival rates across groups were evaluated using the log-rank (Mantel‒Cox) test. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEMs). Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05.

OMP was obtained as described in our previous study [22]. Compared with the non-immunized group, the titers of OMP-specific polyclonal antibodies in the OMP-immunized group were higher after three rounds of OMP immunization (Fig.1A and B).

Three days after the final boosting immunization with OMP protein, bone marrow and spleen cells were collected from the immunized mice. Plasma cells from immunized mice were enriched and loaded into the Berkeley Lights Beacon optofluidic system, where they were maintained in a supportive medium to ensure cell viability. High-throughput single-cell analysis confirmed that 9021 cells were successfully introduced into the individual NanoPens on the device chip (FigureS2A). Each plasma cell in the Nanopen secretes antibodies capable of binding to antigen microbeads, which exhibit a “bloom” phenomenon over time through their interactions with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Fig.1C). Furthermore, IgG beads were loaded into individual NanoPens on the microfluidic chip to quantify the population of plasma cells that actively secrete antibodies (Fig.1C). Statistical analysis revealed that among the 9021 plasma cells, 2029 secreted antibodies, of which 60 produced OMP-specific antibodies (FigureS2A). Therefore, we exported the 60 plasma cells for subsequent PCR amplification. Following single-cell isolation using the Beacon platform, PCR amplification was performed to amplify the light and heavy chain sequences from 60 individual cells (FigureS2B). Although technical difficulties were encountered during cDNA amplification of either the VH or VL genes from the extracted cellular material, paired VH and VL sequence information was successfully obtained and identified in 24 candidate cells. The Variable region amino acid sequences of the 24 candidates were obtained from the IMGT database (Table2).

Using the IMGT database, a complementarity-determining region (CDR) analysis was performed, revealing that antibodies such as H2, H4, and E3 displayed highly homologous sequences in the CDRs of both VH and VL chains (Fig.1D). Based on the similarities observed in the VH and VL CDRs among different mAbs, mAbs with distinct VH and VL CDRs were selected for further analysis, including B3, B4, B6, B7, C4, D4, D8, E2, E7, F2, F3, F4, F6, G7, and H2 (Fig.1D). Subsequently, the identities of the variable regions and germline characteristics of VH and VL for these antibodies were analyzed, and 15 unique mAb sequences were identified. The VHs of B3, B4, B6, B7, C4, D4, D8, E2, E7, F2, F3, F4, F6, G7 and H2 were assigned to VH4-4/JH6/DH3-10,VH5-10-1/JH4/DH5-18,VH3-7/JH4/DH3-16,VH3-7/JH4/DH3-16,VH6-1/JH3/DH3-10,VH3-48/JH6/DH2-2,VH3-23/JH4/DH3-10,VH3-21/JH6/DH3-10,VH1-3/JH4/DH3-16,VH3-21/JH6/DH3-10,VH4-61/JH5DH2-2,VH6-1/JH6/DH5-12,VH3-20/JH6/DH1-14,VH6-1/JH6/DH5-12 and VH1-3/JH4/DH3-16 family, whereas their VL were categorized within VK3-11/JK1,VK1-16/JK4,VK1-9/JK1,VL7-46/JL3,VL4-69/JL1,VK1-17/JK4,VK3-11/JK4,VK1-6/JK1,VK2-28/JK3,VK1-6/JK1,VK4-1/JK4,VK1-33/JK3,VK3D-15/JK2,VK1-33/JK3 and VK2-28/JK family. Furthermore, with the exception of H2 VH (which exhibited 89.58% identity), the VHs demonstrated more than 90% identity in their variable regions compared to their respective germline genes (Fig.1D). Among the 15 unique sequences of mAbs, we selected five sequences with VH and VL belonging to completely different families and high fluorescence intensity binding to Assay Beads on Beacon for expression. Specifically, fully human mAbs C4, F2, F3, F6, and G7 containing the human IgG1 constant region (IgG1 mAbs) and variable regions were expressed and purified (FigureS3).

Among the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) ofA. baumannii, Omp38 has been identified as a key factor in facilitating bacterial adhesion to and invasion of host cells [1,19,20]. We obtained the recombinant Omp38 as described in our previous study [22]. The results indicated that C4, F2, F3, F6, and G7 could bind to Omp38, with EC50values ranging from 1.032 to 202.5 µg/mL (Fig.2A). However, among the Omp38-specific fully human mAbs, only F2 was able to bind to the highly virulent strain LAC-4 ofA. baumannii, with an EC50value of 1.06 µg/mL (Fig.2B). Further experiments revealed that F2 could also bind to LAC-4, ATCC 17,978, and clinical strains Strain1-ST193, Strain2-ST205, Strain3-ST2, and Strain6-ST63, indicating a certain degree of broad-spectrum binding (Fig.2C).

Epithelial cells serve as the initial barrier for immune defense in the host [28]. Biofilms formed byA. baumanniifacilitate the attachment and colonization of the bacteria on respiratory epithelial cell surfaces, leading to their intracellular growth and eventual host cell death [19,29]. Consequently, we investigated the effects of F2 on the pathogenicity ofA. baumannii. Compared to the isotype control, F2 demonstrated inhibitory effects on both the adherence and biofilm formation ofA. baumannii(Fig.3A and B). Treatment with 100 µg/mL F2 reduced the mean log10CFU ofA. baumanniiadhering to A549 cells from 7.56 to 6.65 (12.1% reduction) (Fig.3A), which was comparable to that of murine mAb C3 (19.0% reduction) in our previous study (FigureS4A) [22]. Furthermore, F2 inhibited biofilm formation. At concentrations of 400, 200, 100, and 50 µg/mL, F2 reduced biofilm formation by 42.9%, 42.8%, 40.0%, and 22.3%, respectively (Fig.3B). This inhibitory profile matched that of murine mAb C3 (51.9%, 46.7%, 42.2%, and 27.5%, respectively) at the same concentrations (FigureS4B) [22].

To investigate the binding epitope of mAb F2 to Omp38, predictions made using Alphafold3 and GeoBiologics indicated that mAb F2 might bind to the extracellular domain of Omp38 in the reference strain (ATG88079.1) (Fig.4A). Further analysis of the binding conformation between F2 and Omp38 revealed that F2 bound to the four-loop structures in the extracellular regions of Omp38 (Fig.4B). Subsequently, residues from the four loops of variousA. baumanniistrains, including the reference strain and the aforementioned nine clinical strains, were extracted and compared. We found that some strains ofA. baumannii, such as clinical strains 2 and 6, possessed the same Omp38 loop structure; therefore, these strains were grouped for subsequent analyses (Fig.4C). The nine strains were ultimately categorized into four groups, and four binding conformations were constructed based on homology modeling (Fig.4C). Subsequently, we calculated the interaction energy of the four groups and found that mAb F2 exhibited the strongest binding affinity with Group1(strain3), with an interaction energy of −918.028 kcal/mol, followed by Group4 (strain8) at −846.226 kcal/mol (Fig.4D). These findings were consistent with the ELISA results (Fig.2C and D), supporting the reliability of the structural predictions.

Given the critical role of hydrogen bonds in achieving high specificity and affinity in antigen-antibody interactions [30,31], the key hydrogen bonds involved in the interactions between the light chain, heavy chain, loop regions, and CDRs were annotated based on the 3D spatial structure of the reference strain (Fig.4bonds between the antigen and mAb F2 A). After comparing the four binding conformations, we found that each loop structure of Omp38 contained several key amino acid residues, the side chains of which contributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the antigen and mAb F2 (Fig.4E). Among the four binding conformations, several key residues were highly conserved, such as 37Q in loop1 (Fig.4E). Although other critical residues varied across different strains, they still contributed essential hydrogen bonds for antibody binding. For example, when 71S in loop2 was mutated to 71Y, hydrogen bonds were still established between the hydroxyl group and the corresponding antibody residue (Fig.4E). The preservation of this binding mode may explain the broad-spectrum activity of F2.

To evaluate the protective efficacy of the fully human mAb F2 against highly virulentA. baumanniistrain LAC-4, mice were intratracheally inoculated with a lethal dose of LAC-4 and subsequently administered Omp38-specific mAbs. Survival rates were monitored over a 72-hour postinfection period (Fig.5A). However, the results demonstrated that mAb F2 failed to confer significant protection against lethalA. baumanniiinfection in a murine model (Fig.5B).

In this study, we isolated several mAbs targeting the OMPs ofA. baumanniiusing a high-throughput screening approach on the Beacon platform. The variable regions of these mAbs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors containing constant human IgG1 regions to generate fully-human mAbs. Following the identification of Omp38-specific fully human mAbs, their binding activities were validated againstA. baumanniistrains from diverse sources. Finally, we investigated the potential mechanism underlying the broad-spectrum binding capability of mAb F2.

This study primarily focused on evaluating the protective efficacy of mAbs againstA. baumannii. Subsequently, antimicrobial resistance profiling of clinical strains was performed exclusively through in silico analysis of second-generation sequencing data using the CARD database platform. Future investigations will incorporate phenotypic drug susceptibility testing, including Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and E-test methodologies, to comprehensively characterize the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) profiles of these isolates. In theA. baumanniiadherence and biofilm inhibition assays, we employed isotype controls (an irrelevant IgG mAb), as this approach is well-established in similar adhesion and biofilm studies to account for nonspecific binding and ensure the specificity of the observed effects [19]. However, we did not include a positive control mAb (e.g., a fully human mAb targetingA. baumannii) owing to the absence of successfully developed fully human mAbs.

In this study, the main reason for using LAC-4 instead of the thin capsule-formingA. baumanniiATCC 17,978 to establish the infection model is that our laboratory’s current model for ATCC 17,978 is not yet mature. At the same bacterial concentration,A. baumanniiATCC 17,978 fails to cause mortality in mice, whereas the highly virulent strain LAC-4 successfully induces lethal infection (FigureS1). Therefore, in subsequent studies, further optimization is needed to develop a suitable infection model for ATCC 17,978 that accurately reflects its pathogenic potential without confounding factors.

We also explored the protective effect of fully human mAbs againstA. baumanniiinfection and found that F2 did not demonstrate protective effects in a lethal infection model. The main reasons for this phenomenon may be that the clearance ofA. baumanniirelies not only on the neutralizing ability of the Fab fragment of the antibody but also on the interaction of the Fc fragment with components of the immune system [32]. Because the Fc fragment of IgG-type antibodies has different affinities for various subtypes of FcγR [33], it is essential to consider the affinity of the humanized Fc fragment for mouse FcγR when conducting functional validation of fully human antibodies in mouse models. Gillian Dekkers and colleagues found that mouse and human FcγRs share approximately 60–70% homology, indicating that there may be incompatibility between the humanized Fc fragment of the antibody and mouse FcγR during functional validation in mouse models [32]. In addition, differences in receptor function and cellular expression patterns also contribute to incompatibility [33]. For example, human FcγRIIA contains an intracellular ITAM that is not present in the murine ortholog, and human FcγRIIA is not, but mouse FcγRIII is expressed on NK cells and mast cells [33]. Moreover, human FcγRIIC and FcγRIIIB is not present in mice [33]. To address this issue, some researchers have utilized humanized mouse models that lack endogenous FcγR but express human FcγR, and have encountered various challenges [32,34]. Conventional strategies for generating fully humanized FcγR mice involve knocking out all murine activating FcγRs and crossing them with transgenic animals expressing the complete repertoire of human FcγRs [33,35]. However, a key challenge in this approach lies in maintaining multiple transgenes in an FcγR-deficient murine background, which demands considerable technical expertise and careful genetic management. Another approach for generating fully humanized FcγR mice involves engrafting immunodeficient mice with a human immune system comprising all hematopoietic cell lineages [33,36]. However, this model presents several limitations. First, both murine and human effector cells expressing species-specific FcγRs coexist in the peritoneal cavity, potentially competing for engagement by human IgG1 [33]. Moreover, human cells fail to properly repopulate key immunological niches like bone marrow, resulting in only transient reconstitution [33]. Therefore, future investigations should employ larger mammalian models, such as rhesus monkeys, which exhibit FcγR expression profiles closely resembling those of humans, to more accurately evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of fully human mAbs. In subsequent studies, we aim to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of mAbs using more physiologically relevant animal models. First, utilizing Fc receptor knockout humanized mice models, we will systematically validate whether the protective efficacy of mAbs depends on the specific interaction between their Fc region and Fc receptors. Second, fluorescence or radiolabeling techniques will be employed to conduct biodistribution studies of mAbs, aiming to elucidate their tissue distribution profiles in animal models, particularly their targeted enrichment capability at infection sites. Concurrently, pharmacokinetic experiments will be performed to evaluate key pharmacological parameters such as half-life, clearance rate, and bioavailability of mAbs in vivo, thereby providing a pharmacokinetic basis for their protective effects.

In this study, adhesion and biofilm formation assays were conducted usingA. baumanniistrain ATCC 17,978 (thin capsule), whereas animal challenge experiments employed the hypervirulent strain LAC-4 (thick capsule). Previous study showed that dense capsules may physically block mAbs from accessing outer membrane proteins such as Omp38 [37]. The observed lack of in vivo efficacy in the LAC-4 lethal infection model may thus be attributed to reduced accessibility of mAb F2 to Omp38 caused by LAC-4’s thick capsule. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, further structural investigations would be informative, such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) mapping of the interaction between mAb F2, Omp38, and the capsular matrix.A. baumanniibiofilm formation occurs in three stages: (1) initial adhesion, (2) early development and (3) mature biofilm [38]. In this study, we focused on evaluating the mAb’s activity against the first two stages but did not assess its efficacy against mature biofilms. Currently, strategies to disperse mature biofilms primarily involve natural compounds (e.g., honokiol and magnolol), synthetic agents (e.g., N-acetylcysteine), and antimicrobial peptides (e.g., magainin 2), with limited research on mAb-based approaches [38]. Future studies will include assays to examine the mAb’s effects on mature biofilms, offering a more complete assessment of its therapeutic potential.

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) represents a crucial immune defense mechanism in which mAbs specifically recognize and bind to infected cells, facilitating their engulfment and removal by phagocytic cells, particularly macrophages [39]. Research has confirmed the important role of macrophages in the initial stages of host immune response againstA. baumanniiinfection, primarily through their capacity to effectively phagocytose and eliminateA. baumannii[40]. In this study, we did not validate whether F2 could mediate ADCP. The absence of ADCP data leaves an important aspect of Fc-mediated effector functions unexplored, which could theoretically contribute to F2’s overall antibacterial efficacy through enhanced pathogen clearance. To address this limitation, we propose several experimental approaches in future studies. Enriching monocytes from human peripheral blood using magnetic beads, differentiating them into macrophages, and activating them prior to experimentation is a potential alternative. However, this approach requires substantial amounts of peripheral blood to obtain a sufficient number of macrophages for experimental needs. Alternatively, utilizing human macrophage cell lines (such as THP-1) for related experiments offers another potential solution [18], which represents an important method for further study. Furthermore, to comprehensively evaluate F2’s interaction with immune cells, we will perform immune cell depletion studies, including neutrophil depletion via anti-Ly6G antibody pretreatment to assess whether F2’s efficacy is diminished; macrophage depletion using clodronate liposomes to evaluate the impact on bacterial clearance; and NK cell depletion via anti-NK1.1 antibody treatment to examine its influence on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

In recent years, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, numerous computational models have been successfully applied to epitope prediction, including AlphaFold3, GeoBiologics, Bcepred, ABCpred, Discotope, BepiPred, and CEP [41,42]. In this study, we employed bioinformatics analysis to investigate the binding epitope of the mAb F2, providing preliminary insights into the molecular mechanism underlying its broad-spectrum binding activity. Current epitope-validation methods (ELISA, enzymatic/chemical cleavage, alanine scanning, phage display, X-ray crystallography) have limitations for identifying the conformational epitope of mAb F2 binding to Omp38. ELISA lacks resolution for conformational epitopes; cleavage methods only detect linear epitopes; alanine scanning is labor-intensive and disrupts protein structure; phage display yields short, non-native peptides; and crystallography is impractical for Omp38’s transmembrane structure. Instead, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is ideal, offering high-resolution conformational analysis without crystallization and lower sample purity requirements [43,44]. Thus, HDX-MS will be employed to experimentally map the mAb F2-Omp38 epitope.

Species specificity of the Omp38 protein is a critical consideration in antibody safety evaluation. Current studies indicate that Omp38 is not a species-specific protein ofA. baumanniibut exhibits structural homology withEscherichia coli (E. coli)Omp38 andPseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)OprF, suggesting a potential risk of cross-reactive immune responses. To comprehensively assess antibody specificity, subsequent investigations will employ standardized methodologies, including ELISA and flow cytometry, to systematically evaluate cross-reactivity of candidate antibodies. Should cross-reactivity be detected, antibody engineering techniques—such as CDR mutagenesis or affinity maturation—will be implemented to enhance specificity. Based on these findings, the clinical application scope will be strictly defined (e.g., restricted to respiratory specimen testing while excluding intestinal samples to mitigate potential cross-reactivity).

In summary, our study successfully identified mAbs targeting OMPs using a high-throughput screening approach. Subsequently, we developed Omp38-specifc fully human mAb F2 and found that F2 potently and broadly bound toA. baumanniistrains. Besides, F2 inhibited the bacterial adherence and biofilm formation ofA. baumannii. Finally, we explore the potential mechanism of the broad-spectrum binding activity of mAb F2. Further research and development of F2 might pave the way for novel treatments, ultimately contributing to better management and control ofA. baumanniiinfections in clinical settings.

Supplementary Material 1: Figure S1. Determination of optimal challenge dose in LAC-4 or ATCC 17978 infection model. Mice were infected with varying dose of LAC-4 or ATCC 17978 (1.2 × 10⁷, 1.4 × 10⁷,1.6 × 10⁷, or 1.8 × 10⁷ CFU), and survival rate was monitored over 72 hours (n = 6 per group, biological replicates). The 1.2 × 10⁷ CFU dose of LAC-4 induced sublethal infection (66.7% mortality), while 1.6 × 10⁷ CFU and 1.8 × 10⁷ CFU caused rapid lethality (<30h), precluding therapeutic evaluation. The intermediate dose of LAC-4 (1.4 × 10⁷ CFU) achieved consistent 100% mortality within 72 hours while permitting a sufficient window for intervention studies. However, ATCC 17978 could not induce the death of mice within 72 hours at the same concentration. h: hours.
