This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of switching from disposable insulin delivery pens to reusable insulin pens with a penfill cartridge system for the co-formulation of insulin degludec and insulin aspart (IDegAsp) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Türkiye. We assessed the impact on glycemic control to evaluate the sustainability of this transition.

A total of 226 adults with T2D who were initiating or switching to IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pens at a tertiary center in Türkiye were followed for 6 months. Data were retrospectively extracted from the medical records at baseline (prior to switching) and at follow-up visits after 3 and 6 months of IDegAsp Penfill reusable cartridges.

Initiating the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen in patients who previously used basal-bolus, basal, or premixed insulin therapies with disposable insulin pens was associated with a significant reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) [mean change -1.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) − 2.2 to − 0.20; p < 0.001)], [− 1.4% (95% CI − 2.3 to − 0.4; p < 0.001)], and [− 0.9% (CI − 1.7 to − 0.1; p < 0.001)]. Switching from IDegAsp disposable insulin pens to the reusable system demonstrated noninferior outcomes [− 0.08% (CI − 0.2 to 0.1; p = 0.629)]. The mean total daily insulin dose and body weight were also significantly lower in patients who were switched from basal-bolus insulin, basal insulin or premixed insulin therapies (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Initiating or switching to the IDegAsp reusable pen with the insulin cartridge system in a real-world population of people with T2D in Türkiye was associated with improved or maintained glycemic control.

Climate change and its effects on health are now well documented, emerging as one of the most pressing issues of our time [1].

Nonoptimal temperatures, extreme weather events, and climate change-related health issues, including infectious diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancer, and poor mental health, also increase the burden of diabetes and its complications [1,2].

People with diabetes are particularly vulnerable to climate change and face heightened risks from heatwaves, air pollution, extreme weather and infectious diseases, all of which contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. The impaired heat stress response in people with diabetes further exacerbates these risks, making it imperative to address the environmental factors influencing their health [2].

According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number of adults living with diabetes is expected to reach 852.5 million by 2050, increasing from 588.7 million in 2024. In Türkiye, the number of people living with diabetes in 2024 was 9.6 million, placing the country among the top ten countries globally and the highest in the European region [3]. A national survey in 2010 revealed that the prevalence of diabetes was 13.7% among Turkish adults [4]. By 2050, Türkiye is expected to remain among the top ten countries with the highest diabetes prevalence [3].

As the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased, the environmental footprint of the medical devices used to manage it has also become an increasingly urgent concern in the fight against both chronic disease and climate change. In response, there is an urgent need to reduce waste associated with diabetes care, minimize the carbon footprint, and implement sustainable waste management strategies [2,5].

Many adults with T2D eventually require and benefit from insulin therapy. According to current guidelines, insulin initiation should be considered regardless of background glucose-lowering therapy or disease when symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when HbA1c or blood glucose levels are very high [6].

Today, most prescribed insulin pens are disposable. In response to the growing need for sustainable diabetes management, advancements in insulin delivery have shifted from disposable devices to more eco-friendly, reusable alternatives [7,8].

The co-formulation of ultralong-acting basal insulin degludec and rapid-acting mealtime insulin aspart in a single injection product, named insulin degludec aspart (IDegAsp), has been demonstrated to provide improved glycemic control and lower rates of hypoglycemia in several trials [9–12].

Building on the growing need for sustainable diabetes management, one such innovation within the IDegAsp coformulation was the transition from a disposable insulin pen flextouch to a reusable insulin pen with a penfill cartridge system [7,13]. This shift represents a significant step in reducing waste associated with diabetes care while maintaining effective treatment options for patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no reports regarding switching and/or initiating the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen in the current literature.

In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the new penfill solution for injection in cartridges applied with a reusable pen on patient outcomes. Specifically, we compared patients using prefilled disposable insulin delivery pens with those now utilizing the refilled cartridge system. By examining these differences, we seek to gain insights into the clinical and environmental benefits of switching to a reusable insulin pen, contributing to both patient health and sustainability goals. Here, we report findings from a real-world clinical setting in Türkiye, focusing on individuals with T2D who initiated or switched to IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pens.

This study is a retrospective, observational analysis aimed at assessing the real-life outcomes of patients with T2D who switched to IDegAsp reusable pen with a Penfill cartridge. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 226 patients treated at the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Prof. Dr. Cemil Tascioglu City Hospital in Türkiye between November 2023 and January 2025, following approval from the institutional review board (IRB) and ethical committee (25.02.2025/E-48670771-514.99-269532648).

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable local regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before data collection. Patient confidentiality was maintained, and all the data were anonymized for analysis.

Previous Treatment with basal-bolus, basal, pre-mixed insulin or IDegAsp Flextouch insulin therapy with or without oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

Age, sex, education level (illiterate, primary school, secondary/high school, university) weight, height, body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease) were noted.

Basal-bolus insulin therapy, basal insulin therapy, IDegAsp Flextouch (a prefilled, disposable pen injector) and premixed insulin therapy were used. Bolus insulin includes glulisin, aspart, lispro insulin. Basal insulin includes glargine and detemir insulin. IDegAsp (Ryzodeg® 100 units/ml FlexTouch solution for injection in prefilled pens) used in prefilled disposable pen injector. Premixed insulin therapy comprises biphasic insulin aspart 30.

Daily total insulin dose before and after the switch were recorded. Additionally, the types of OADs [metformin, sodium‒glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4)] used by the patients were noted.

Glycemic control: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels.

Renal function: Serum creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Liver function: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

Lipid profile: High-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels.

Changes in these variables at month 3 and month 6 were compared to baseline values to assess the impact of switching to the IDegAsp Penfill cartridge on clinical outcomes. Additionally, patients’ self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) levels and patient-reported hypoglycaemic episodes were verified through medical record review.

Patients who met the eligibility criteria were transitioned to IDegAsp using Penfill® cartridges with a reusable insulin pen (NovoPen®). The IDegAsp formulation used was Ryzodeg® 100 units/ml, a premixed solution containing 300 units of insulin degludec/insulin aspart in 3 ml per cartridge.

All patients received individualized, face-to-face training by the clinic’s diabetes specialist nurse at initiation. Education included correct use of the reusable pen, cartridge insertion, insulin administration technique, recognition and management of hypoglycaemia and SMBG. Nurse-led reinforcement sessions were provided at the 3rd-month follow-up and after any dose titration.

Initiation and dosing of IDegAsp were supervised by the treating endocrinologist and individualized according to guidance from the Multinational Consensus Report on IDegAsp use and national expert panel recommendations. IDegAsp was administered with the main meal(s) of the day, defined as those containing the highest carbohydrate content. Patients were instructed to take a missed dose with the next main meal on the same day and then resume the usual dosing schedule. All patients continued regular SMBG throughout the study.

Basal insulin: Switched to IDegAsp at a 1:1 dose with once-daily administration. A twice-daily regimen was initiated if the total daily insulin requirement exceeded 0.5 U/kg or in cases of poor glycaemic control.

Premixed insulin: Switched at a 1:1 ratio with twice-daily administration.

Basal-bolus regimens: The total daily insulin dose was maintained and divided into two equal IDegAsp injections.

A 10% dose reduction was applied in patients already achieving target glycaemic levels or with a history of recurrent hypoglycaemia.

Insulin titration was guided by SMBG results, targeting fasting or pre-meal glucose levels of 80–130 mg/dl. Dose adjustments followed the 2–0–2 algorithm: an increase of 2 units if targets were not met, no change if targets were achieved, and a reduction of 2 units in the presence of hypoglycaemia.

As part of standard clinical practice in our endocrinology clinic, glucose readings obtained from SMBG were reviewed at a 1-week follow-up visit to assess titration needs. Routine appointments were then scheduled at three and 6 months. Patients also received education on the 2–0–2 algorithm, allowing them independently adjust insulin doses based on FPG results. They were encouraged to schedule additional visits with the diabetes nurse or treating physician if further guidance was needed regarding SMBG interpretation or insulin titration.

All concomitant medications including OADs were maintained at stable doses throughout the study period.

Descriptive statistics, including age, sex, BMI, weight, height, and prior insulin regimen, were used to summarize the baseline characteristics of the study population. Continuous variables, such as HbA1c, FPG, creatinine, eGFR, AST, ALT, HDL, LDL, and TG, were compared between baseline, month 3, and month 6 via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) or nonparametric tests, as appropriate.

Subgroup analyses were performed to assess differences in outcomes based on prior insulin regimens (basal bolus, basal insulin, IDegAsp Flextouch, or premixed insulin) and other demographic features. For pairwise comparisons between time points, post hoc testing was performed with Bonferroni corrections. Categorical variables were analyzed via chi-square tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All the statistical analyses were performed via IBM SPSS Statistics V21.0.

A total of 226 patients with T2D were included in this retrospective analysis. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are presented in Table1. The mean age of the patients was 61.1 ± 11.1 years, with 43.3% male and 56.7% female participants. At baseline, the mean BMI was 29.7 ± 3.9, and the average weight and height were 81.1 ± 11.8 kg and 164.9 ± 7.4 cm, respectively.

Prior to switching to the insulin IDegAsp Penfill cartridge, the patients were using various insulin regimens: 64 (28.3%) were on basal-bolus insulin, 72 (31.8%) were on basal insulin, 70 (30.9%) were on IDegAsp Flextouch, and 20 (8.8%) were on premixed insulin.

Significant improvements in glycemic control were observed in patients previously treated with basal-bolus insulin, basal insulin and premixed insulin following the switch to the IDegAsp Penfill. At baseline, the mean HbA1c in the group treated with basal-bolus insulin was 9.4 ± 1.6%, which decreased to 8.7 ± 1.0% at 3 months and 8.3 ± 1.2% at 6 months (p < 0.001 for baseline vs. follow-up comparisons). Similarly, in the group that previously received basal insulin, the initial mean HbA1c level decreased from 9.7 ± 1.7 to 8.9 ± 1.4% in the 3rd month and to 8.3 ± 1.1% in the 6th month (p < 0.001 for baseline vs. follow-up comparisons). Similarly, in the group that previously received premixed insulin, the initial mean HbA1c level decreased from 8.2 ± 0.8 to 7.3 ± 0.9% in the 3rd month and to 7.3 ± 0.6% in the 6th month (p < 0.001 for baseline vs. follow-up comparisons). Subgroup analysis based on prior IDegAsp Flextouch use revealed similar results for glycemic control (p = 0.629), suggesting that the switch to the IDegAsp PenFill cartridge may have further optimized insulin delivery. Figure1depicts the longitudinal change in HbA1c over 6 months of IDegAsp PenFill treatment.

Compared with those at baseline, fasting plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in each subgroup at the 6th month (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.049 and p < 0.001; Table2) (Fig.1). Ninety-four (41.6%) patients scheduled additional visits with the diabetes nurse to review SMBG records and receive support for insulin dose titration. The rate of hypoglycemic events reported by patients themselves and noted in their files was determined to be 1.76% (4/226). Severe hypoglycaemia requiring admission to hospital was not detected in the patient medical records.

Renal function was assessed through serum creatinine and eGFR at baseline and follow-up. The mean serum creatinine levels of each subgroup at baseline remained stable at 3 months and at 6 months (p = 0.128, p = 0.82, p = 0.375, and p = 0.934, respectively). The groups were also similar regarding the mean change in the serum creatinine levels throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.153). The mean eGFRs for the patients who were switched from basal bolus insulin, IDegAsp Flextouch and premixed insulin revealed no significant changes over the follow-up period (p = 0.175, p = 0.247 and p = 0.476, respectively); however, the mean eGFRs of the patients who were switched from basal insulin increased significantly over 6 months (p = 0.022). When the subgroups were compared, there was a significant difference between the subgroups in terms of the change in eGFR, in favor of the patients who were switched from basal insulin (p = 0.012) (Table2).

Liver function was assessed by measuring AST and ALT levels. The mean AST level for each subgroup did not change significantly throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.356, p = 0.503, p = 0.613 and p = 0.434, respectively). The subgroups were also comparable (p = 0.474). Similarly, the mean ALT level did not significantly differ among the groups (p = 0.851, p = 0.116, p = 0.534 and p = 0.097, respectively), and the subgroups were comparable in terms of ALT change (p = 0.310) (Table2).

There were notable improvements in the TG profile for each subgroup following the switch to the IDegAsp penfill (p = 0.032, p = 0.031, p = 0.305 and p = 0.248, respectively). This improvement was similar across the subgroups (p = 0.176). The mean levels of HDL and LDL did not significantly change throughout the follow-up period for each subgroup (p = 0.203, p = 0.871, p = 0.864, p = 0.507 and p = 0.086, p = 0.695, p = 0.819, p = 0.351, respectively). The subgroups were also comparable in terms of changes in the mean levels of HDL and LDL (p = 0.786 and p = 0.068, respectively) (Table2).

Patients who were switched from basal-bolus insulin, basal insulin and premixed insulin therapy presented a more pronounced decrease in the mean total daily insulin dose (p < 0.001). The mean total daily insulin dose did not significantly change in patients previously treated with IDegAsp Flextouch (p = 0.109) (Table3).

The changes in the mean body weight were also compared on the basis of the patients' prior insulin regimens. Patients who were switched from basal-bolus insulin, basal insulin and premixed insulin therapy presented a more pronounced reduction in body weight (p < 0.001). Patients in the group that used IDegAsp Flextouch insulin before the switch were found to maintain their initial weight by the 6th month (p = 0.098) (Table3).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study presenting the outcomes of switching and/or initiating the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen. The results demonstrated that switching from basal bolus, basal, or premixed insulin therapies with disposable insulin pens to IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen was associated with significant improvement in glycemic control, reductions in insulin dosage, and weight loss. Additionally, the transition from the prior disposable insulin pen injector (FlexTouch®) to the novel Penfill® cartridge showed noninferior outcomes, thus contributing to both clinical and environmental sustainability.

One of the primary objectives of this study was to evaluate the impact of switching insulin delivery systems on glycemic control. Our findings revealed a significant improvement in HbA1c levels in patients who switched to the IDegAsp penfill cartridge system, particularly in those previously using basal-bolus, basal insulin, and premixed insulin regimens. A reduction in HbA1c was observed within 3 months of the switch and continued to improve or remain stable for 6 months. These results are consistent with those of previous real-world studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of IDegAsp in improving glycemic control and reducing insulin requirements [14–18]. The subgroup of patients who previously used the IDegAsp FlexTouch prefilled disposable pen demonstrated comparable outcomes, indicating that the transition to the reusable cartridge did not compromise the efficacy of insulin therapy. These findings suggest that the reusable penfill cartridge system offers equivalent or superior control over blood glucose levels compared with the disposable system.

Although there is no publication in the literature reporting real-life results of Penfill® cartridge, there are several publications reporting FlexTouch® results. In a prospective study conducted in the Philippines, a 1.4% decrease in Hba1c, a 46.1 mg/dl reduction in FPG, and a 2 kg decrease in body weight were reported [14]. The Japanese Jaguar study, which included over 10,000 insulin-treated patients, revealed that switching to IDegAsp was associated with a 1.23% reduction in Hba1c and a lower incidence of hypoglycemic events, including among patients aged over 75 years [15]. In a retrospective cohort study by Onder et al., Hba1c was reduced by 1.4%, regardless of the baseline insulin regimen or use of OADs [16]. Kang et al. reported improvements in HbA1c, FPG, stable BMI, and insulin doses without hypoglycemia in a multicenter study [19]. Fulcher et al. conducted a 26-week open-label study with 1,102 patients with T2D across six countries, switching from previous therapies to IDegAsp. They reported a 1.4% reduction in HbA1c, a 1 kg weight loss, a 48.6 mg/dl reduction in FPG, lower hypoglycemia, and reduced insulin doses. However, only 20% of the patients achieved an HbA1c lower than 7% [18]. Similarly, the majority of our patients could also not achieve an HbA1c lower than 7%. This highlights the importance of structured titration protocols and intensified follow-up strategies to support patients in achieving glycaemic targets.

A reduction in the insulin dose is another noteworthy outcome. Patients previously on basal-bolus, basal insulin, and premixed insulin regimens experienced a significant reduction in their total daily insulin dose after switching to the IDegAsp penfill system. This reduction is likely a result of the enhanced pharmacokinetic profile of IDegAsp, which allows for a more efficient insulin regimen that reduces total insulin requirements while maintaining optimal blood glucose control and improving treatment adherence [9,20].

This study also addressed the sustainability aspect of diabetes care, particularly in reducing the environmental footprint associated with insulin delivery. The transition to reusable insulin pens represents a significant reduction in waste generation. Reusable insulin pens are either cost-neutral or more affordable and reduce plastic waste by 89%, as well as the carbon footprint by 40%, compared with disposable insulin pens [7]. By switching to a reusable pen system with penfill cartridges, the amount of plastic waste can be significantly minimized while maintaining effective glycemic control. This shift toward more sustainable insulin delivery options aligns with global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of medical devices and supports the growing demand for eco-friendly alternatives in healthcare.

The switch to the IDegAsp Penfill cartridge system did not result in any new safety concerns or documented adverse events, based on a review of patients’ medical records. No significant changes were observed in renal or liver function or in lipid profiles. A decrease in triglyceride levels was noted, which may be associated with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. Due to the retrospective nature of our study, diabetic lipodystrophy and injection site reactions were not systematically assessed, and therefore data on these outcomes were unavailable. Although the observed rate of hypoglycemic events was comparable to that reported in the literature, this finding should be interpreted with caution, as hypoglycemia was evaluated using patients’ SMBG records and self-reported hypoglycemic episodes, which were subsequently verified through medical record review.

Globally, approximately 60% of insulin users prefer pen devices due to convenience and ease of administration, which may enhance adherence [8]. Patient comfort—including ease of use, cartridge insertion, and dose readability—is critical for optimizing treatment adherence [21]. Yang et al. reported overall treatment satisfaction following a switch to IDegAsp with disposable pens in a separate study, further supporting the acceptability of this insulin regimen [22]. Although no formal treatment satisfaction questionnaire was administered in our study, patients did not report any difficulties with cartridge handling, nor were there any requests to revert to disposable pens. This outcome may be attributed to the structured education provided at treatment initiation, which was particularly important given the generally low educational level of the study population.

This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective, single-center design limits the ability to establish causality and generalize findings across broader populations of individuals with T2D. While our sample size was adequate for the study objectives, it may not fully represent regional or national trends in diabetes care. Second, the assessment of hypoglycaemia relied on patient-self-reported data; as continuous or flash glucose monitoring was not used. Therefore, the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemia may have been underreported. Third, although we observed improvements in BMI, we did not systematically assess injection site reactions or diabetic lipodystrophy, and no formal documentation of these outcomes was available. Furthermore, patient-reported outcomes such as satisfaction, ease of use, or perceived treatment convenience were not captured, and economic analyses comparing the costs of disposable versus reusable pen systems were beyond the scope of this study. Despite these limitations, our findings offer real-world insight into a commonly encountered clinical scenario: the transition to a more sustainable insulin delivery system without compromising glycaemic control.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that switching to the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen is a feasible and effective option for individuals with T2D that can maintain or improve glycaemic control while reducing insulin requirements and body weight in selected populations. Importantly, the use of reusable pens may contribute to reduced environmental impact and align with global efforts toward more sustainable healthcare practices. Although our results are promising, they should be interpreted within the context of the study's retrospective nature. Prospective, multicenter studies incorporating continuous or flash glucose monitoring, patient-reported satisfaction outcomes, and health economic analyses are warranted to further validate our findings and better assess the clinical, practical, and environmental implications of reusable insulin delivery systems.

Climate change disproportionately impacts people with diabetes, and sustainable diabetes care is an emerging priority.

This is the first real-world study evaluating the clinical and environmental outcomes of switching to the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen in patients with T2D.

The study revealed significant improvements in glycemic control, reduced insulin doses, and weight loss—comparable to or better than disposable pens—without safety concerns.

The transition to reusable insulin pens offers a clinically effective and environmentally sustainable alternative, supporting the global goals of reducing medical waste and carbon emissions in diabetes care.
