Photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a key approach to sustainable hydrogen production, yet many photocatalysts suffer from limited solar absorption and low conversion efficiency. In this study, we investigate the electronic, optical, and photocatalytic characteristics of Sr5Ta4O15through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, utilizing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation potential. The findings show that Sr5Ta4O15primarily absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light, which limits its photocatalytic activity to the UV range. To enhance its photocatalytic performance, we explore vanadium(v) doping in Tantalum (Ta) sites and the introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs). The results demonstrate a significant improvement in photocatalytic performance, with hydrogen production rates increasing from 2.18 μmol g−1for pure Sr5Ta4O15to 259.8 μmol g−1for V-doped Sr5Ta4O15with oxygen defects. Furthermore, the quantum efficiency (QE) and solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency improve notably, with the STH efficiency reaching 17.1%. These modifications help overcome light-harvesting limitations and contribute valuable insights toward the development of more effective photocatalysts for solar-driven hydrogen production.

Photocatalytic water splitting enables sustainable hydrogen production. V-doping and oxygen vacancies in Sr5Ta4O15boost solar absorption, achieving higher efficiency and hydrogen yield.

However, despite these advances, detailed insights into the intrinsic electronic structure of undoped Sr5Ta4O15remain limited. Most existing studies have focused on nitrogen doping or performance optimization, leaving the effects of other modifications, such as vanadium(v) doping and OVs, largely unexplored. Understanding how these specific changes influence the band structure and light absorption is essential for advancing visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance.

By employingab initiocalculations, we thoroughly analyzed the structural geometry, electronic band structure and optical properties of powdered Sr5Ta4O15. Additionally, we investigated the effect of V doping in Sr5Ta4O15, focusing on its influence on the electronic properties and hydrogen yield. We also studied the role of oxygen defects in further modifying the electronic and photocatalytic behavior of both the undoped and V-doped material. Furthermore, Huanget al.40conducted a study on Ba5Ta4O15, showing that under reduction conditions, significant OVs form and play a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity. Their XPS analysis revealed an increase in OV concentration from 4% in the pristine state to 24% in Ru/Ba5Ta4O15, and up to 63% in Cs–Ru/Ba5Ta4O15. These results highlight the importance of OVs in facilitating surface reactions, thus supporting the theoretical exploration of such defects in Sr5Ta4O15at vacancy concentrations of 3.33% and 6.66%.

Our goal is to qualitatively estimate hydrogen production in photocatalysis based on pristine Sr5Ta4O15and its doped variants with V and OVs. To achieve this, we assume ideal conditions where all electrons in the valence band (VB) are excited under visible light, and no interactions with hydrogen occur at the surface states, allowing us to establish an order of hydrogen production.

This study aims to address the current lack of understanding regarding how structural modifications, specifically V doping and OVs, affect the electronic and optical behavior of Sr5Ta4O15. By using first-principles calculations, we aim to provide insights that could guide the development of more efficient photocatalysts, particularly those capable of operating under visible light for sustainable hydrogen generation.

The results of this study were derived using density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the Quantum ESPRESSO package.41The exchange–correlation energy was modeled using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.42The electron–ion interactions were described using projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials43for Sr (5s2), Ta (5d36s2), and O (2s22p4). The electronic wave functions are expanded inaplane wave basis set with energy cut-offs (Ecut) of 1088 eV and charge density is taken 10 times ofEcut.

Sr5Ta4O15, crystallizes in a trigonal system, with space groupP3̄m1 as shownFig. 2(a).15Using this structure, the initial lattice parameters werea= 5.65 Å andc= 11.49 Å.37After optimization, the lattice parameters were found to bea= 5.69 Å andc= 11.62 Å.

To gain insights into the optical properties, we analyzed the electronic properties by calculating the band structures (Fig. 2(b)) and the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 2(c)).

As shown in the DOS in Fig. S1, applying the GGA + U correction52slightly increases the band gap of pure Sr5Ta5O15from 3.11 eV to 3.22 eV, representing only a minor adjustment. Since the d orbitals of Ta are localized in the CB, the Hubbard correction is not expected to significantly affect the band gap value.

The total DOS in Fig. S2(a) confirms the presence of a well-defined band gap, with no significant states within the gap region. The shape and position of the DOS curves reinforce the band structure findings and highlight the crucial role of Ta–O interactions in determining the material's semiconducting properties.

whereε1is the real part andε2the imaginary part of the dielectric function.

The absorption spectrum demonstrates an absorbance in the UV range, accounting for only 5% of solar radiation. Also, it shows a first peak located at 4.6 eV, which corresponds to the optical gapEgopt= 3.98 eV (see Fig. S3(a)). This value is slightly smaller than the experimentally reported optical gaps, which range fromEgopt= 4.51 eV36toEgopt= 4.75 eV.37Whereas, the other peaks arise from transitions along theK,Γ,L, andAdirections from the VB to the CB.

When light is polarized along thex- andz-axes, it generates two distinct spectra. This polarization-dependent behavior provides insight into the anisotropic properties of the material.

Understanding the optical properties of a material is essential for its application. In this study, we investigate how V substitution at Ta sites affects the material's optical properties. The following sections present the results of our calculations, focusing on the changes in the DOS, band structure, and band gap induced by V doping.

Fig. 3(a)presents the structure obtained by substituting V at 50% of the Ta sites. After optimizing the cell parameters and atomic positions, we calculated the DOS and band structure.

The results, shown inFig. 3(c)and S2(b), reveal clear changes in the electronic structure caused by V doping. The partial DOS inFig. 3(c)shows that V-3d orbitals contribute significantly within the band gap region, especially just below the CB edge. This leads to the formation of mid-gap states, which are localized energy levels, were not present in the undoped material. These mid-gap features are also clearly visible in the total DOS in Fig. S2(b), where the band gap is no longer clean and wide, but slightly filled by these new states.

These changes reduce the band gap from 2.98 eV in the pristine Sr5Ta4O15to 2.45 eV in the V-doped version.Fig. 3(b)confirms this reduction, showing an indirect band gap similar to the original structure.

The mid-gap states introduced by V slightly enhance light absorption near the visible-UV boundary, as illustrated inFig. 3(d), indicating an improvement in optical properties due to doping. The optical gap decreases from a range of 2.97 eV to 3.05 eV (Egopt= 2.97 eV for lower energy transitions andEgopt= 3.05 eV for higher energy transitions, as shown in Fig. S3(b)), compared to the 3.98 eV gap of pure Sr5Ta4O15. This reduction is attributed to the mid-gap states and crystal field splitting, which separates V d-orbitals into partially filled t2gand egstates. Transitions between t2gand eglevels occur, with the lowest energy transition at 2.85 eV. This change in the optical gap made by this material retains the same anisotropic properties as the pure Sr5Ta4O15when light is polarized along thex- andz-axes.

The electronic properties of Sr5Ta4O15, along with its V-doped variant, Sr5Ta2V2O15, can be significantly modified by introducing OVs. These vacancies create defect states within the material's band structure, altering its electronic behavior. In particular, OVs act as electron donors, which can boost conductivity and improve overall electronic performance.

To reduce the concentration of OVs, we created a supercell with dimensions 1 × 1 × 2, which helps to control the vacancy density more effectively. For Sr5Ta4O15(Fig. 4(a) and (b)), OVs at concentrations of 6.66% (Sr5Ta4O14) and 3.33% (Sr5Ta4O14.5) lead to the formation of mid-gap states associated with Ta 5-d orbitals. These mid-gap states, located near the Fermi level, facilitate electron excitation from the VB to CB. When OVs are combined with V doping (Fig. 4(c) and (d)), the band gap is further reduced. Donor states introduced by the 3d orbitals of V lower the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands, improving light absorption and electron–hole pair generation for photocatalytic reactions. The DOS (Fig. 4) and band structure (Fig. 5) illustrate the narrowing of the band gap, which enables the material to absorb a wider spectrum of light.

Additionally,Fig. 6highlights the synergistic effect of doping and OVs on absorption enhancement. The absorption spectra reveal a substantial increase in absorption intensity in both the visible and UV regions for materials exhibiting combined doping and defects. This enhancement is attributed to the interaction of mid-gap states and donor states, which together create additional pathways for light-induced electron transitions. The material also retains its anisotropic optical properties, as evidenced by polarization-dependent absorption along thex- andz-axes.

To gain deeper insight into the electronic impact of OVs, we performed Bader charge56analysis to examine how charge is redistributed around the defect sites. Our results show a noticeable decrease in Bader charge on the Ta atoms that were originally bonded to the missing oxygen atom. In the pristine Sr5Ta4O15structure, Ta atoms typically exhibit a Bader charge of about +2.83e, while the oxygen atom carries a charge of approximately −1.31e. When an oxygen atom is removed (creating Sr5Ta4O14), its charge is primarily redistributed onto the neighboring Ta atoms, with a smaller portion spreading to adjacent atoms.

In the V-doped structure (Sr5Ta2V2O15), when an oxygen atom is removed, forming Sr5Ta2V2O14, the vacancy region retains a Bader charge of approximately −1.07e, indicating that a significant amount of electron density remains localized near the defect site. This excess charge is primarily transferred to the adjacent V atom, whose Bader charge decreases from +2.20ein Sr5Ta2V2O15to +1.78ein Sr5Ta2V2O14, reflecting a notable gain in electron density. The rest of the redistributed charge is shared among neighboring atoms.

This behavior highlights the donor-like nature of OVs, which introduce localized states within the band gap. These states facilitate effective charge separation and suppress electron–hole recombination, key factors in enhancing photocatalytic performance.

For efficient water splitting in a semiconductor photocatalyst, the band gap energy (Eg) should exceed 1.23 eV. Additionally, the CB edge must be positioned above the water reduction level (H+/H2) at 0 Vvs.NHE, while the VB edge should lie below the water oxidation level (O2/H2O) at 1.23 Vvs.NHE. When illuminated with photons of energy equal to or greater than the semiconductor photocatalyst's band gap energy, electrons move from the VB to the CB by creating holes in the VB. Subsequently, the electrons reduce H+to H2, while the holes simultaneously oxidize H2O to H+and O2, resulting in overall water splitting.

To verify these criteria, we calculated the potentials of the CBM and VBM for The Sr5Ta4O15material using formulas(3)and(4).

The calculated CBM and VBM potentials of Sr5Ta4O15are displayed inFig. 7(a).

The simultaneous reduction of H+and oxidation of H2O prevents hole accumulation in the VB, thus minimizing undesired recombination between e−and h+.

The CBM and VBM potentials for the V-doped and oxygen-vacancy-modified structures are shown inFig. 7(a). In these materials, h+remain below the O2/H2O redox potential, while e−are positioned above the H+/H2reduction potential. The band gap values are 3.11 eV, 2.47 eV, 2.41 eV, 2.45 eV, 2.3 eV, and 2.1 eV for Sr5Ta4O15, Sr5Ta4O14.5, Sr5Ta4O14, Sr5Ta2V2O15, Sr5Ta2V2O14.5, and Sr5Ta2V2O14, respectively. In agreement with recent mechanistic models,57the positioning of the conduction and valence bands in V-doped Sr5Ta4O15suggests that photogenerated electrons and holes possess sufficient potential for H2and O2evolution, respectively.

Fig. 8shows the evolution of the CBM and VBM positions of pristine Sr5Ta4O15, its V-doped variant, and structures containing OVs as a function of pH, compared with the redox potentials relevant to water splitting.

InFig. 8(a), the pristine Sr5Ta4O15exhibits band edges well aligned with the H+/H2and O2/H2O redox levels across a broad pH range.Fig. 8(b)demonstrates that V doping preserves this favorable alignment, with both CBM and VBM remaining suitably positioned to drive hydrogen and oxygen evolution.Fig. 8(c)–(f)highlight the effects of introducing OVs and additional V doping. Although the band edges shift slightly in these modified structures, they continue to straddle the water redox levels, particularly near neutral pH (6–8). The calculated band edge offsets are presented inTable 1.

These values confirm that photogenerated electrons and holes in all studied structures retain sufficient redox potential to drive H2and O2evolution.

Under acidic conditions (low pH), the driving force for hydrogen evolution diminishes slightly as the CBM approaches the H+/H2level. In contrast, near-neutral pH provides a better balance between band alignment and redox potentials, supporting optimal photocatalytic performance.

The hydrogen production rates for the materials are presented inFig. 7(b)andTable 2. A significant improvement is observed compared to the undoped material. This enhancement is attributed to mid-gap states introduced by V doping, where the 3d orbitals of V and 5d orbitals of Ta act as donor levels. These donor levels facilitate electron transfer to the CB, improving charge separation and reducing recombination rates.

These findings demonstrate that V doping and OVs significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance of Sr5Ta2V2O15, making it a promising material for hydrogen production.

TheFig. 9(a)shows that the pure Sr5Ta4O15material has low QE, indicating it is transparent to light at lower energies. After doping with V and introducing OVs, new defect states are created, which improve the material's ability to absorb light, increasing the QE.

For our calculations, we assume standard 1-sun (AM 1.5G) conditions with a light intensity of 1000 W m−2and assume the QE at its maximum value. Based on these conditions, we estimate a theoretical upper limit for the STH efficiency, as shown inFig. 9(b). Our findings also shows that Sr5Ta2V2O14stands out with an impressive STH efficiency of 17.1%, compared to only 0.19% for the undoped Sr5Ta4O15.

In conclusion, we opted the DFT method within the Quantum ESPRESSO package, employing the GGA approximation to examine the structural, electronic, and optical properties of Sr5Ta4O15. Hence, the outcomes demonstrate that Sr5Ta4O15is a semiconductor with a 3.11 eV band gap and absorbs light in the UV range. The introduction of OVs in Sr5Ta4O15and its V-doped form, Sr5Ta2V2O15, significantly improves its electronic properties and enhances hydrogen production efficiency. OVs act as electron donors, increasing CB electron density and promoting charge separation. Notably, V doping reduces the band gap of Sr5Ta2V2O15to 2.45 eV, enhancing charge carrier generation. These findings highlight Sr5Ta4O15, with optimized OVs and V doping, as promising candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Further material optimization could accelerate the development of efficient, sustainable photocatalytic systems for renewable energy applications. To strengthen the validity of our results, we propose validating the theoretical findings by comparing them with experimental measurements of the material's optical and photocatalytic properties. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the material's behavior and further support the accuracy of our computational results.
