Pyloric gland adenoma (PGA) is a rare gastrointestinal tumor that is characterized by dense packing of gastric pyloric glands with occasional cystic dilatation1. PGAs represent almost 2.7% of all gastric polyps with a conversion rate of 47% to invasive adenocarcinoma2. There are currently no evidence-based recommendations on resection technique and surveillance protocol specific for PGAs. Previously reported large gastric PGA was treated with laparoscopic resection1. However, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been recently used in the treatment of smaller PGAs34. Herein, we report a rare case of huge gastric PGA treated with ESD.

A 68-year-old female came to our hospital with complaints of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. Laboratory investigations were unremarkable apart from iron deficiency anemia. Gastroscopy revealed a huge polypoidal mass with a thick stalk arising from the anterior gastric wall and occupying the fundus. Biopsy suggested PGA with low-grade dysplasia. The colonoscopy was unremarkable. Subsequently, abdominal computed tomography showed an intragastric polypoidal mass occupying the lumen with no extra-gastric extension or lymph nodes. The lesion was removed by ESD using a 3-mm ball-type knife Endocut Q, effect 2, for incision, forced coagulation 4 for dissection, and soft coagulation 5 using coagulation grasper for hemostasis, followed by resection bed closure with 5 endoclips (17 mm) with no intraprocedural complications (Video 1). The resected specimen was retrieved in piecemeal and measured about 13 cm × 9 cm (Fig. 1). Pathological examination of the lesion revealed tubular adenomatous proliferation with packed and dilated pyloric glands with ground glass cytoplasm lined and covered with mildly atypical cells with low mitotic activity consistent with PGA with low-grade dysplasia and clear deep resection margin (Fig. 2). No adverse events were reported after the procedure. The patient was discharged after 1 day and scheduled for follow-up gastroscopy after 3 months.
