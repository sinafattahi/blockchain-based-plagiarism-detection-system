Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) stands as a crucial therapeutic measure for improving the prognosis of individuals afflicted with cardiovascular ailments. This investigation seeks to examine the efficacy of CR training that integrates music and movement therapy in addressing atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.

From January 2023 to January 2024, a total of 144 AF patients who sought medical attention at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai were selected as research subjects. These participants were evenly divided into three groups through randomization: 48 patients in the music-movement CR group, 49 in the movement CR group, and 47 in the conventional CR group. Patients in the conventional CR group underwent standard CR training, while those in the movement CR group participated in CR training centered on movement therapy. The music-movement CR group engaged in CR training that harmoniously combined music and movement therapy. The intervention spanned a period of six months for all three groups. Post-intervention, comparative analyses were performed on cardiac function, AF duration, complication incidence, adverse emotional states, sleep quality, and quality of life among the three groups.

Post-intervention, compared to the Conventional CR group, the Music-Movement CR group demonstrated: Significantly lower LVEDD (43.65 ± 3.87 mm vs. 50.20 ± 3.88 mm,p< 0.001) and higher LVEF (48.47 ± 3.69% vs. 42.63 ± 4.12%,p< 0.001). Shorter AF duration (3.41 ± 0.14 days vs. 4.19 ± 0.67 days,p< 0.001) and lower complication rate (6.25% vs. 21.28%,p= 0.033). Lower SAS (50.31 ± 5.71 vs. 58.69 ± 6.45,p< 0.001) and SDS scores (51.15 ± 5.53 vs. 57.52 ± 6.17,p< 0.001). Higher AFEQT total scores (84.87 ± 14.67 vs. 72.31 ± 14.13,p< 0.001). Improvements in the Music-Movement CR group were also consistently superior to the Movement CR group across these metrics (allp< 0.05 or lower).

Implementing CR training that incorporates music and movement therapy for AF patients demonstrably enhances cardiac function, curtails AF duration and complication rates, and ameliorates emotional states, sleep quality, and overall quality of life.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most pervasive cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, is characterized by irregular and disorganized atrial electrical activity, thereby disrupting the normal sinus rhythm [1]. The incidence of AF is approximately 2% among the general populace and exponentially increases with age, affecting 10–12% of individuals aged 80 and above [2]. AF is implicated in severe complications, including stroke, heart failure, cognitive impairment, and cardiac arrest, which may culminate in mortality. Moreover, AF exacerbates healthcare expenditures, significantly impairing the quality of life for patients [3,4]. Presently, treatments for AF primarily involve catheter ablation or pharmacological interventions. However, postoperative patients are highly prone to recurrence, and the surgery is likely to bring about complications such as pericardial effusion and transient ischemic attack to patients. Consequently, the clinical treatment of AF fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes [5].

In recent years, multidisciplinary comprehensive management focusing on controlling AF risk factors has garnered increasing attention [6]. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a multidisciplinary program encompassing exercise training, modification of cardiac risk factors, psychosocial assessment, and outcome evaluation, is considered potentially beneficial in the prevention and treatment of AF [7,8]. Substantial evidence supports CR as a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention, significantly enhancing cardiovascular function and outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and positively influencing their quality of life [9]. Among the core components of CR, exercise training holds paramount significance in the rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease patients [10]. Although excessively strenuous exercise may correlate with an increased incidence of AF, regular moderate exercise training has been demonstrated to induce specific protective effects against AF, effectively reducing its occurrence [11,12]. Furthermore, exercise-based CR has proven to notably decrease all-cause mortality, readmission rates, and the incidence of ischemic stroke in AF patients [13]. Currently, both CR and exercise - based CR are associated with drawbacks such as unreasonable exercise regimens for patients, which severely limit the intervention efficacy of CR for patients with (AF [14]. Meanwhile, although existing evidence supports that CR is an effective intervention for individuals with AF, there is a lack of real - world data regarding the effectiveness of CR for individuals with documented AF [15].

Music, as a universal art form, is emerging as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for enhancing public health, alleviating negative emotions, and improving quality of life [16]. Some studies suggest that music intervention for patients can have a positive impact on cardiovascular physiology. Coupled with its low cost and high safety, it is highly suitable for application among patients with cardiovascular diseases [17]. Meanwhile, music can promote positive subjective experiences in patients, thereby improving their participation and compliance in treatment. When combined with exercise, it can effectively reduce the perceived fatigue during exercise and enhance patients’ exercise intensity and endurance [18]. Currently, existing research has confirmed that CR combined with music has a good application effect in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but its application effect in patients with AF has not been verified [19].

Therefore, in view of the current problems of unreasonable exercise regimens in the CR process for AF patients and the lack of real - world data on the effectiveness of CR for individuals with documented AF in current research, this study combined music intervention, exercise training, and CR to establish a CR model based on music - movement therapy and applied it to AF patients to explore its effects. This study aims to provide a reference for clinically improving the CR participation of AF patients and enhancing the rationality of their exercise regimens, as well as to offer real - world data on the effectiveness of current CR research for AF patients.

This research endeavor enlisted individuals diagnosed with AF who had sought medical intervention at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai between January 2023 and January 2024. The eligibility criteria for the study subjects were rigorously defined as follows: (1) patients unequivocally diagnosed with either paroxysmal or persistent AF in alignment with contemporary diagnostic guidelines [20]; (2) individuals aged 18 years or above; (3) patients possessing adequate communicative faculties, devoid of discernible linguistic or behavioral anomalies; (4) individuals exhibiting normal functional capabilities; (5) NYHA Class I-II. Conversely, the exclusion criteria encompassed: (1) patients afflicted with severe cardiac structural deformities; (2) those grappling with advanced hepatic or renal insufficiency; (3) individuals suffering from immune or hematological maladies; (4) Musculoskeletal disorders limiting exercise; (5) those with visual or auditory deficits. This investigation was sanctioned by the Institutional Review Board of Shanghai Tongji Hospital (Approval No.: SBKT-2022-182) and required the provision of written informed consent from all trial participants. The study adhered scrupulously to the tenets delineated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

A third - party statistician prepared a randomization sequence in the form of sequential envelopes, which were opened in order after obtaining the informed consent of the patients. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: the music - exercise CR group, the exercise - based CR group, and the conventional CR group. The rooms of patients in each group were arranged according to their group affiliations, or participants were placed in single rooms. All researchers were provided with training on the study content in advance to ensure the consistency of the research process. Randomization and questionnaire surveys were conducted by two postgraduate students who did not participate in the trial. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.

The movement CR group enhanced their traditional CR training with supplementary exercise regimens: (1) Condition Evaluation: Patients were instructed to monitor their heart rate through wearable devices or manual pulse counting, 3–5 times per week, with bi-weekly evaluations of their condition. Clinical rehabilitation specialists devised personalized aerobic exercise prescriptions based on the evaluation results and individual patient characteristics, utilizing these prescriptions to guide staged extended exercise rehabilitation. Patients were provided with exercise logs, and their family members were enlisted as external exercise supervisors. (2) Warm-up Routines: Joint mobility exercises were conducted, instructing patients to stretch their joints for 5–10 min each session. (3) Aerobic Activities: These included walking, tai chi, ba duan jin, and cycling, each session lasting 20 min, 4 times per week. (4) Elastic Band Resistance Training: Coordination of inhalation and exhalation during the tension and relaxation phases of elastic band stretching was practiced, with 8–10 sets per session, conducted every other day, and training intensity adjusted by varying the band’s stretch length and repetitions. (5) Flexibility Training: This involved trunk stretching (forward and backward bends), upper limb stretching (shoulder extensions, abductions, and flexions), and lower limb stretching (leg presses, “4” character stretches, knee hugs), each session lasting 10 min, once daily, prioritizing pain-free stretching. (6) Balance Training: Conducted using equipment, bodyweight exercises, and balance pads for standing and seated balance exercises, each session lasting 15 min, once daily, with exercise closely monitored by family members, and immediately halted if any discomfort was experienced. Continuous blood pressure and electrocardiogram monitoring were enforced, with activities ceased if symptoms were intolerable. Post-discharge, healthcare professionals and clinical rehabilitation specialists maintained real-time interactions with the patients via phone calls and WeChat, conducting follow-ups and readjusting exercise prescriptions as needed.

For the Movement CR Group and the Music-Movement CR Group, exercise intensity was prescribed and monitored based on the following principles: Aerobic Exercise: Intensity was prescribed using Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) targeting 40–59% HRR (corresponding to moderate intensity) and/or the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (target RPE 11–14, ‘Light’ to ‘Somewhat Hard’). This aligns with standard cardiac rehabilitation guidelines [10]. Elastic Band Resistance Training: Intensity was modulated by band resistance level, repetitions/sets (8–10 reps to moderate fatigue, RPE ~ 13–15), and stretch length. Individualization & Safety: Prescriptions were individualized based on initial assessment and progressed gradually. Intensity was monitored during supervised sessions via symptoms, hemodynamics (BP/ECG), and patient feedback. Patients were instructed to stop for any discomfort. Post-discharge, adherence and tolerance were assessed via logs, self-report (RPE), and remote consultation.

Upon discharge, all patients undergo a 6-month follow-up intervention conducted by physicians and responsible nursing staff through home visits, phone calls, and outpatient consultations. During the first month post-discharge, follow-up interventions occur weekly, diminishing to 1–2 times per month from the second to the sixth month. The follow-up content encompasses assessing patients’ conditions, analyzing psychological and sleep statuses, re-educating on disease health knowledge, medication guidance, dietary advice, and exercise recommendations, including music-exercise guidance for the music-movement CR group. Follow-up personnel consistently evaluate the patients’ conditions, psychological states, and sleep patterns, guiding them to complete standardized questionnaires on the spot and ensuring thoroughness by reminding patients to fill in any omitted items. Following evaluation and analysis, patients’ rehabilitation progress is reassessed.

All three groups undergo a 6-month CR training intervention. The 6-month CR intervention commenced during hospitalization and continued post-discharge for all participants, with structured follow-up ensuring consistent delivery and allowing for adjustments throughout the study period.

In the evaluation of patients, cardiac function indicators were measured pre - and post - intervention. A color Doppler ultrasound diagnostic apparatus (EPIQ 7 model, Royal Philips of the Netherlands) was used to measure the patients’ left ventricular end - diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), while a 24 - hour Holter monitor (DMS300–3 A model, DMS Inc., USA) was utilized to observe changes in the patients’ ventricular rate. Regarding the duration of atrial fibrillation and the incidence of complications, the same 24 - hour Holter monitor was employed to observe and record the duration of atrial fibrillation (recording the longest episode) pre - and post - intervention, and the incidence of complications like thromboembolic diseases and heart failure was documented during and one month after the intervention. All physiological instruments were calibrated per manufacturer guidelines and maintained temporal resolution exceeding clinical requirements.

Pre- and post-intervention, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were utilized to evaluate the patient’s negative emotions and sleep quality. The SAS scale categorizes the patient’s subjective experiences into anxiety, neurological dysfunction, motor tension, and somatic pain. The SDS scale encompasses dimensions of mental symptoms, somatic disorders, depressive psychological disorders, and sleep state. The cumulative score ranges from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pronounced negative emotions. The PSQI scale encompasses dimensions of sleep onset latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, subjective sleep quality, hypnotic medication use, and daytime functioning, with a cumulative score ranging from 0 to 21, where higher scores denote poorer sleep quality. All questionnaires were administered using validated Mandarin Chinese versions. The SAS and SDS demonstrated Cronbach’s α > 0.80 and strong diagnostic concordance. The PSQI Chinese version showed test-retest reliability > 0.85.

Pre- and post-intervention, the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) questionnaire was employed to assess the patient’s quality of life. The AFEQT scale comprises 20 items and 4 dimensions, including symptoms, daily activities, concerns about treatment, and treatment satisfaction. Elevated total scores and scores in each dimension signify a superior quality of life for the patient. The AFEQT Chinese version had an internal consistency α = 0.92.

A priori power analysis was not performed due to the exploratory nature of this novel intervention. However, a post-hoc power analysis using G*Power 3.1 indicated that withN= 144 (48 per group),α = 0.05, and an effect size (f) of 0.35 (derived from LVEF group differences in pilot data), the study achieved 84% power to detect significant differences via one-way ANOVA, exceeding the conventional 80% threshold. This sample size also aligns with recent RCTs on music-enhanced CR [18].

To ensure the precision of data analysis, all research data encompassed within this study underwent a meticulous double-checking process to substantiate their accuracy prior to their incorporation into the computer. Employing the SPSS 25.0 software, the study executed comprehensive statistical analysis. Quantitative data were symbolized as mean ± standard deviation (x̄ ± s), with contrasts among numerous groups facilitated through analysis of variance, distinctions between two groups scrutinized via independent samples t-tests, and comparisons between conjoint groups assessed using paired samples t-tests. Qualitative data, on the other hand, were depicted as frequencies and percentages, with intergroup evaluations conducted employing chi-square tests. A significance threshold ofP< 0.05 was adopted to designate a statistically significant disparity.

This study recruited 300 AF patients from Shanghai Tongji Hospital between January 2023 and January 2024. Of these, 100 (33.33%) declined participation, and 50 (16.67%) were excluded per the criteria. Thus, 150 patients were randomly divided into three groups: 50 in the conventional CR, movement - oriented CR, and music - enhanced movement CR groups each.

During follow - up, 3 patients from the conventional CR, 1 from the movement CR, and 2 from the music - movement CR groups were lost. In total, 144 patients completed the experiment (47 in conventional CR, 49 in movement CR, and 48 in music - movement CR). (Fig.1).

In the conventional CR group (25 males, 22 females), mean age was (52.41 ± 10.26) years, average disease duration (46.73 ± 41.32) months, and 10 patients were ≥ 60 years. It had 20 paroxysmal and 27 non - paroxysmal AF patients. The movement CR group (28 males, 21 females) had a mean age of (53.11 ± 10.57) years, average disease duration of (47.14 ± 40.17) months, 16 patients ≥ 60 years, 23 paroxysmal, and 25 non - paroxysmal AF patients. The music - movement CR group (26 males, 22 females) had a mean age of (51.89 ± 11.05) years, average disease duration of (48.04 ± 39.94) months, 12 patients ≥ 60 years, 23 paroxysmal, and 25 non - paroxysmal AF patients. No significant differences were found among the three groups in gender, age, disease duration, and AF type (gender:P= 0.921; age:P= 0.852; ≥60 years:P= 0.434; disease duration:P= 0.987; AF type:P= 0.856).(Table1).

Pre - intervention, LVEDD, LVEF, resting ventricular rate, and exercise ventricular rate were (64.26 ± 6.86) mm, (36.29 ± 3.47)%, (102.67 ± 10.23) beats per minute, and (135.40 ± 12.79) beats per minute in the conventional CR group; (63.84 ± 5.07) mm, (36.54 ± 3.55)%, (102.43 ± 10.11) beats per minute, and (135.35 ± 12.07) beats per minute in the movement - based CR group; (63.24 ± 4.35) mm, (37.24 ± 3.21)%, (102.28 ± 10.03) beats per minute, and (135.12 ± 11.89) beats per minute in the music - movement CR group. No significant differences were found among the three groups (LVEDD:P= 0.664; LVEF:P= 0.373; Resting Ventricular Rate:P= 0.982; Exercise Ventricular Rate:P= 0.993).

Post - intervention, in the conventional CR group, LVEDD, LVEF, resting ventricular rate, and exercise ventricular rate were (50.20 ± 3.88) mm, (42.63 ± 4.12)%, (86.87 ± 6.98) beats per minute, and (102.60 ± 6.76) beats per minute, showing a significant reduction in LVEDD, resting and exercise ventricular rates and an increase in LVEF compared to pre - intervention (allP< 0.001). In the movement CR group, they were (45.33 ± 4.17) mm, (45.36 ± 3.84)%, (83.61 ± 6.41) beats per minute, and (98.58 ± 6.12) beats per minute, with similar significant changes (allP< 0.001). In the music - movement CR group, they were (43.65 ± 3.87) mm, (48.47 ± 3.69)%, (79.93 ± 7.16) beats per minute, and (95.77 ± 6.04) beats per minute, also with significant changes (allP< 0.001).

Significant differences were observed among the three groups post - intervention (LVEDD:P< 0.001; LVEF:P< 0.001; Resting Ventricular Rate:P< 0.001; Exercise Ventricular Rate:P< 0.001). The music - movement CR group had lower LVEDD, resting and exercise ventricular rates and higher LVEF than the conventional CR group (LVEDD, Resting and Exercise Ventricular Rates:P< 0.001; LVEF:P< 0.001) and the movement CR group (LVEDD:P= 0.042; Resting Ventricular Rate:P= 0.009; Exercise Ventricular Rate:P= 0.025; LVEF:P< 0.001). The movement CR group had lower LVEDD, resting and exercise ventricular rates and higher LVEF than the conventional CR group (LVEDD:P< 0.001; Resting Ventricular Rate:P= 0.019; Exercise Ventricular Rate:P= 0.003; LVEF:P= 0.001) (Table2).

Pre - intervention, the duration of atrial fibrillation persistence was (5.78 ± 2.26) days in the conventional CR group, (5.45 ± 2.31) days in the movement - based CR group, and (5.21 ± 2.17) days in the music - movement CR group. There was no significant difference among the three groups (P= 0.465).

Post - intervention, the duration was (4.19 ± 0.67) days in the conventional CR group, (3.97 ± 0.43) days in the movement CR group, and (3.41 ± 0.14) days in the music - movement CR group. A significant difference was found among the three groups (P< 0.001). All three groups showed a reduction in the duration post - intervention (allP< 0.001). The music - movement CR group had a notably lower duration than the conventional CR group (P< 0.001) and the movement CR group (P< 0.001), while there was no significant difference between the movement and conventional CR groups (P= 0.057).

During the intervention and the subsequent month, complication rates were 6.25% (3 patients) in the music - movement CR group, 10.20% (5 patients) in the movement CR group, and 21.28% (8 patients) in the conventional CR group. There was no significant overall difference in complication rates among the three groups, but the music - movement CR group had a lower rate than the conventional CR group (P= 0.033). There was no significant difference between the movement and music - movement CR groups (P= 0.735) or between the movement and conventional CR groups (P= 0.135) (Table3).

Pre - intervention, the conventional CR group had SAS scores of (60.49 ± 6.66), SDS scores of (62.35 ± 7.21), and PSQI scores of (13.16 ± 3.55); the movement CR group had SAS (60.37 ± 6.83), SDS (61.97 ± 7.17), and PSQI (12.97 ± 3.92); the music - movement CR group had SAS (60.12 ± 6.57), SDS (61.23 ± 7.10), and PSQI (12.66 ± 3.64). No significant differences were found in SAS, SDS, and PSQI scores among the three groups (SAS:P= 0.963; SDS:P= 0.740; PSQI:P= 0.803).

Post - intervention, the conventional CR group had SAS (58.69 ± 6.45), SDS (57.52 ± 6.17), and PSQI (9.48 ± 2.16). SAS scores did not change significantly (P= 0.187), while SDS and PSQI scores decreased significantly (SDS:P< 0.001; PSQI:P< 0.001). The movement CR group had SAS (55.38 ± 6.03), SDS (54.47 ± 5.98), and PSQI (8.55 ± 2.04), with all scores decreasing significantly (allP< 0.001). The music - movement CR group had SAS (50.31 ± 5.71), SDS (51.15 ± 5.53), and PSQI (7.58 ± 1.89), also showing significant decreases (allP< 0.001). Significant differences were identified in post - intervention SAS, SDS, and PSQI scores among the three groups (SAS:P< 0.001; SDS:P< 0.001; PSQI:P< 0.001). The music - movement CR group had lower scores than the conventional CR group (SAS:P< 0.001; SDS:P< 0.001; PSQI:P< 0.001) and the movement CR group (SAS:P< 0.001; SDS:P= 0.006; PSQI:P= 0.017). The movement CR group had lower scores than the conventional CR group (SAS:P= 0.011; SDS:P= 0.016; PSQI:P= 0.033) (Table4).

Pre - intervention, the traditional CR group had a total AFEQT score of (61.83 ± 22.87) points, including symptom score (63.22 ± 19.56) points, daily activity score (56.81 ± 30.59) points, concerns about treatment score (64.39 ± 27.53) points, and treatment satisfaction score (58.57 ± 17.45) points. The movement - based CR group’s total AFEQT score was (64.76 ± 22.56) points, with symptom score (66.36 ± 21.11) points, daily activity score (60.78 ± 28.14) points, concerns about treatment score (65.64 ± 25.14) points, and treatment satisfaction score (60.48 ± 16.88) points. The music - movement CR group’s total AFEQT score was (67.53 ± 22.13) points, with symptom score (68.52 ± 24.15) points, daily activity score (66.83 ± 25.11) points, concerns about treatment score (66.89 ± 24.87) points, and treatment satisfaction score (63.87 ± 16.12) points. No significant differences were found in AFEQT scores and total AFEQT scores among the three groups during the intervention (total score:P= 0.469; symptom score:P= 0.491; daily activity score:P= 0.217; concerns about treatment score:P= 0.895; treatment satisfaction score:P= 0.300).

Post - intervention, the traditional CR group’s total AFEQT score was (72.31 ± 14.13) points, with significant improvements in all sub - scores (total score:P= 0.009; symptom score:P= 0.009; daily activity score:P= 0.012; concerns about treatment score:P= 0.048; treatment satisfaction score:P< 0.001). The movement CR group’s total AFEQT score was (78.58 ± 14.54) points, also showing significant enhancements in all sub - scores (total score:P= 0.001; symptom score:P= 0.001; daily activity score:P= 0.002; concerns about treatment score:P= 0.002; treatment satisfaction score:P< 0.001). The music - movement CR group’s total AFEQT score was (84.87 ± 14.67) points, with all sub - scores increasing significantly (total score:P< 0.001; symptom score:P< 0.001; daily activity score:P< 0.001; concerns about treatment score:P< 0.001; treatment satisfaction score:P< 0.001). Significant differences were identified in all AFEQT scores and total AFEQT scores among the three groups post - intervention (total score:P< 0.001; symptom score:P< 0.001; daily activity score:P< 0.001; concerns about treatment score:P= 0.001; treatment satisfaction score:P< 0.001). The music - movement CR group had significantly higher scores than the traditional CR group (total score:P< 0.001; all sub - scores:P< 0.001) and the movement CR group (total score:P= 0.037; all sub - scores:P≤ 0.044). The movement CR group also had significantly higher scores than the traditional CR group (total score:P= 0.035; all sub - scores:P≤ 0.049) (Table5).

This research endeavor integrates music therapy and exercise regimens into the CR framework for AF patients, revealing that post-intervention under a modality incorporating music and exercise therapy, patients exhibit restored cardiac functionality, notably abridged AF durations and complication incidences, and ameliorated emotional well-being, sleep quality, and overall quality of life.

AF patients frequently grapple with multifarious adverse emotional states, including anxiety and depression, fueled by their apprehension regarding the severity and nature of AF symptoms, which not only impinges upon their sleep and quality of life but may also exacerbate their condition and augment the risk of cardiovascular events [36–38]. Both music and exercise have demonstrated efficacious alleviation of negative emotions, such as depression and anxiety [39]. Music activates the brain’s reward circuitry, curtailing the incidence of negative emotions, through mechanisms that influence dopamine release, cortisol levels, and estrogen and testosterone concentrations [40]. Exercise, conversely, stimulates the endocannabinoid system, modulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, and shifts neural activity from the left hemisphere to the right, fostering a more sanguine emotional state [41]. Within the scope of this study, AF patients undergoing CR underpinned by music and exercise therapy exhibited lower scores on the SAS, SDS, and PSQI instruments and improved scores on the AFEQT instrument compared to those receiving conventional or exercise-oriented CR. This finding suggests that CR anchored in music and exercise therapy effectively enhances emotional well-being, sleep quality, and overall quality of life.

To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering randomized controlled trial that integrates music and exercise into the CR training for patients with AF. In contradistinction to prior studies [13], this research not only delved into the influence of music - exercise CR training on patients’ health conditions but also carried out a comparative analysis of patients’ negative emotions, sleep quality, and quality of life subsequent to the intervention, thereby rendering the study findings more all - encompassing. Concurrently, through the grouping and comparison of patients undergoing different CR training regimens, this study more efficaciously demonstrated the ameliorative impacts of integrating music into CR training for AF patients.

The study, despite achieving promising results, has several limitations that need to be considered. It was carried out at a single tertiary hospital in Shanghai, which may lead to selection bias and restrict the generalizability of findings to broader populations. The inability to blind participants due to the nature of interventions, such as music - movement therapy, may introduce performance bias. The cohort mainly consisted of Han Chinese patients with moderate - severe AF, so caution is required when applying the results to ethnic minorities, patients with different AF severities, or those with significant non - cardiovascular comorbidities. Unmeasured confounding factors also pose challenges; medication adherence was not objectively monitored, and lifestyle factors were only recorded at baseline and not tracked during the 6 - month intervention. Moreover, there are additional complexities in the music therapy aspect. While core parameters like rhythm and volume were standardized, finer elements such as melodic complexity, cultural associations of music, and individual auditory processing differences were not quantified. Additionally, comparing *receptive* vs. *active* music therapy modes was beyond this study’s scope. There are also mechanistic and dose - response gaps as biomarkers related to autonomic tone, inflammatory cytokines, and atrial remodeling were not assessed, and the “dose” of music therapy was not quantified.

To address these limitations, future research should involve multicenter randomized trials with diverse populations. Digital adherence tools, such as smart pillboxes and wearable ECG monitors, should be integrated. Mobile health platforms can be used for the longitudinal tracking of lifestyle confounders. Mechanistic studies that correlate music properties with physiological responses are also necessary to gain a better understanding of optimal therapeutic protocols. Future trials should specifically use EEG/fMRI to map neural responses to specific music features and conduct head - to - head comparisons of passive listening vs. active participation.

In summation, the implementation of CR rooted in music and exercise therapy among AF patients significantly augments cardiac function, curtails AF durations and complication rates, and enhances emotional well-being, sleep quality, and overall quality of life. Collectively, these findings offer profound insights into enhancing the health status and quality of life of AF patients.
