Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common malignant tumor that affects the head and neck area. HNSCC typically has complex clinical symptoms and is detected at a late stage. Therefore, it is quite difficult to give patients the best possible care and treatment. Faced with these challenges, nanomaterials are receiving increasing attention in the biomedical field due to their unique structural and physicochemical properties. The application of nanomaterial therapeutics has produced innovative HNSCC treatment options that go beyond the constraints of conventional surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In this review, we first reviewed the pathological mechanisms of HNSCC. Subsequently, a detailed introduction to nanomaterials was given, including their classification and definition. Then, the use of nanomaterials in the diagnosis and therapy of HNSCC was discussed, and incorporating the perspective of organoids and clinical trials to increase the feasibility of nanomaterial applications. In addition, we also reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of nanomaterials, proposed the idea of nanomaterial design, looking at how these properties may be used to improve our understanding and treatment of HNSCC. The present approaches for detecting and treating HNSCC can be improved by integrating the special qualities of nanomaterials with the available therapeutic modalities. This will eventually enhance patient outcomes in the battle against this highly invasive malignant tumor.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with 89,000 new cases reported in 2018 and an expected increase of 30% by 2030 [1,2]. This type of cancer is characterized by its aggressive nature and is often identified at advanced stages. It is marked by rapid recurrence and metastasis, contributing to a generally poor prognosis [3]. The increased prevalence of HNSCC is directly linked to well-known risk factors, such as excessive alcohol use, tobacco use, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [4,5]. The disease affects the salivary glands, pharynx, larynx, and oral cavity, with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) identified as the most common subtype [6].

Surgical tumor removal is usually the first step in the standard treatment of HNSCC. Depending on the stage of the disease, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may then be administered [7]. Despite recent improvements in medical technology, such as sophisticated radiation treatments, improved surgical methods, and the use of novel chemotherapeutic medications. However, the mortality rate for HNSCC remains between 40 and 50% [7]. The severe possibilities of disease recurrence, metastasis, or a mix of both for more than 65% of HNSCC patients [8]. Traditional remedies frequently result in a number of grave side effects. The quality of life can be greatly impacted by conditions including mutism, ageusia, xerostomia, facial nerve paralysis, and facial deformity [9]. These challenges highlight the urgent need to develop new approaches to improve the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC.

Thus far, a wide range of medical problems have been the subject of intensive research on the application of nanomaterials, with oncology receiving particular attention [10]. The development of nanotechnology has greatly accelerated the advancement of medicine [11]. Many different types of nanomaterials, including carbon-based, organic, inorganic, and composite materials, have been used to develop novel cancer treatment approaches [10]. This change has made it easier to understand cancer more comprehensively and opened up new avenues for innovative therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the development of novel therapies for HNSCC is being fueled by the thorough understanding of the disease that is being attained through a variety of nanomaterial-based therapeutic techniques.

In this paper, we initially reviewed the pathological mechanisms underlying HNSCC. We proceed with a comprehensive overview of nanomaterials, delineating their classifications and definitions. Following this, we summarized the unique properties of nanomaterials and their wide range of applications in the comprehensive treatment and diagnosis of HNSCC, highlighting how these advanced materials can revolutionize current approaches. By integrating the perspectives of organoids and clinical trials, we have enhanced the feasibility and practicality of employing nanomaterials in clinical settings. Moreover, we proposed innovative ideas of nanomaterial design, discussed the current issues that nanomaterials are facing and provided some hope for their future advancement. Finally, we have critically assessed the advantages and disadvantages of nanomaterials, recognizing their potential to transform HNSCC treatment while acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead. There are high hopes for the creative application of nanomaterials in HNSCC treatment. Even if there are still difficulties, it is predicted that further research and development will result in revolutionary solutions that might greatly enhance patient outcomes.

HNSCC arises from mucosal epithelial cells lining critical anatomical structures such as the mouth, pharynx, larynx and sinus [7]. The pathological mechanisms of HNSCC are multifaceted and complex, involving a cascade of molecular and cellular alterations that drive the transformation of normal mucosal epithelial cells into malignant cells. This process is characterized by a cascade of genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways [7,12], which together orchestrate the shift from healthy to cancerous states. The complexity of these mechanisms underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular landscape of the disease, which is essential for the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (Fig.1).

The hallmark of HNSCC is a range of increasing histological alterations, starting with epithelial cell hyperplasia. A rise in cell counts without loss of regular cellular architecture characterizes this early stage. Then, as the condition progresses, the dysplasia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe, each representing a different degree of cellular disorder and departure from normal structure and function. When aberrant cells with a malignant character are restricted to the initial location of epithelial tissue, a condition known as carcinoma in situ might develop if these precancerous alterations are not treated. Eventually, this may result in invasive carcinoma, a major progression in the severity and complexity of the disease, when the cancer has broken through the basement membrane and started to invade the surrounding tissues [7].

HNSCC is linked to a high degree of genetic instability, which frequently shows up as the acquisition or loss of certain chromosomal regions. For example, a frequent occurrence during the shift from normal head and neck epithelial mucosa to hyperplasia is the loss of the 9p21 area. This area is important because it contains tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) such ARF, which encodes p14, a p53 stabilizer, and CDKN2A (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), which produces the CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor p16INK4A [13]. Further development into dysplasia and carcinoma is linked to the sequential loss of additional chromosomal regions, including 3p21, 17p13, 11q13, 13q21, 14q32, 6p, 8, 4q27, and 10q23. These regions contain genes that are essential for controlling the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell adhesion, and the loss of 6p, 8, 4q27, and 10q23 is indicative of invasive carcinoma [14]. These chromosomal anomaly investigations highlight the likelihood that more than one genetic change is required for the entire transition to invasive HNSCC [14].

Epigenetic modifications, in addition to genetic mutations, are essential to the carcinogenesis of HNSCC. Together with localized hypermethylation, these cancers have global hypomethylation of DNA. Important TSGs have specific promoter regions affected by hypermethylation, which results in the downregulation or silence of these genes. Affected genes include CDKN2A, which encodes the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a gene associated in cell adhesion, and DCC, a gene implicated in methylation damage repair [18–20]. The expression of genes that regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cellular responses to DNA damage is influenced by this epigenetic reprogramming, which is a crucial aspect of the molecular alterations in HNSCC. The disease’s onset and course are greatly aided by the dysregulation brought on by these epigenetic changes.

Furthermore, the dysregulation of signaling pathways is a hallmark of HNSCC. One of the pathways in this illness that is most commonly changed is the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which is essential for supporting cell survival and proliferation [15,16]. In HNSCC, the STAT3 pathway is frequently overexcited, promoting the production of genes that mediate immunosuppression and aid in cell growth and survival, including VEGF, IL-6, IL-10, and TGFβ. In addition, hyperactivation of STAT3 signaling has been linked to mutations in genes producing protein tyrosine phosphatase receptors, notably PTPRT and PTPRD [17,18]. These mutations can lead to the continuous activation of STAT3, fostering a tumor-promoting environment. The WNT-β-catenin pathway is an additional oncogenic signaling pathway that plays a substantial role in the development and advancement of HNSCC, underscoring the intricate nature of the signaling networks responsible for this cancer [19].

Understanding these intricate pathological mechanisms is crucial for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies for HNSCC. By dissecting the molecular underpinnings of this disease, researchers and clinicians can better tailor therapies to address the specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations present in individual tumors, thereby improving treatment outcomes and patient prognosis.

The concept of “nanomaterials” was first articulated by the European Commission in a recommendation issued in 2011 [20]. Nanomaterials refer to a wide range of materials with structural dimensions ranging from 1 to 100 nm [21,22]. A pivotal attribute of nanomaterials is that they possess at least one dimension within the nanometer range [23]. Consequently, any material satisfying this criterion is classified as a nanomaterial.

The history of nanomaterials is both extensive and fascinating, with roots that extend far back into antiquity [24]. There are two types of nanomaterials, natural nanomaterials, which are produced unintentionally and belong to the environment, and artificial nanomaterials, which are composed for a defined purpose through systematic synthesis or fabrication processes. Artificial nanomaterials are classified into four main categories, carbonaceous, organic, inorganic, and composite-based nanomaterials (Table1).

Nanomaterials have significant diagnostic potential due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and quantum confinement effects. A major challenge for surgeons is to accurately delineate tumor boundaries from healthy tissue [40]. To address this, functionalized nanomaterials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), have been developed to specifically target tumor tissues, demarcate normal tissue boundaries, enable targeted molecular imaging, facilitate intraoperative margin identification, and monitor post-treatment prognosis in HNSCC [41]. Spectral cancer diagnosis using AuNPs has shown promise. Xue et al. [42] exposed serum samples from patients with OSCC and mucoepidermoid carcinoma to AuNPs, comparing them with samples from healthy blood donors. Using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis, they achieved a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 84% in distinguishing nucleic acids and certain proteins in patient serum. These findings indicated that this technique holds potential for early OSCC diagnosis [42] and could be applied to the TNM (tumor, lymph node, and metastasis) classification system for OSCC based on serum SERS characteristics.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging technique for diagnostic purposes, valued for its high spatial resolution, non-ionizing radiation, and excellent tissue penetration [43]. However, traditional MRI alone often falls short in providing satisfactory tumor tissue recognition, limiting its application. To address this limitation, contrast agents can be employed to enhance the resolution of MRI under various clinical conditions, specifically designed to differentiate between tumors and normal tissues [44]. Nanoparticle-based contrast agents have emerged as powerful tools for in vivo imaging enhancement. Numerous MRI contrast agents utilizing nanomaterials have been investigated to selectively amplify tumor signals. For instance, Zheng et al. [45] developed a redox-activated nanostructure for diagnosis and treatment of OSCC, constructing dual-valence cobalt oxide (DV-CO) nanospheres. These nanospheres serve as contrast agents for MRI, exhibiting enhanced transverse and longitudinal relaxation upon glutathione (GSH) release and redox Co3+/Co2+conversion in acidic conditions, thereby enabling self-enhancement of T1/T2-weighted MR imaging. DV-CO also demonstrates characteristics of intracellular GSH consumption and hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation through Fenton reaction, thereby enhancing the efficacy of chemodynamic (CD) therapy. DV-CO exhibits effective near-infrared laser-induced photothermal (PT) effects, demonstrating the synergistic inhibitory influence of PT-CD on OSCC tumor cells. Furthermore, the tumor-specific self-enhanced MR imaging capability of DV-CO was further examined in subcutaneous and orthotopic OSCC mice, confirming the therapeutic efficacy of DV-CO in orthotopic OSCC models.

Nanomaterial-based biosensor manufacturing technology offers a simplified and enhanced approach for diagnosing oral cancer (OC) or OSCC. Determining the incidence of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) or OSCC based on a single biomarker is challenging in clinical settings. Therefore, detecting a variety of biomarkers becomes essential for obtaining a more accurate prognosis. This multiplex detection can be achieved by immobilizing different target-specific biometric probes on the surface of nanomaterials. Nanoparticle-based scaffolds, benefiting from their increased surface area-to-volume ratio and quantum confinement effect, enhance chemical reactivity and stability while accommodating multiple ligands. The biosensing capability of nano-biosensors has been successfully demonstrated in minimally invasive or completely non-invasive OSCC detection on clinical platforms [46,47]. For instance, fluorescence-based nanostructures have been developed to detect specific HPV-DNA, exhibiting high specificity against HIV, influenza, HPV, and HBV-specific oligonucleotides. Notably, the system demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting HPV-16E6 in clinical samples from patients diagnosed with HNSCC [48]. Functional nanomaterials have found widespread use in nano-biosensor platforms for detecting clinically relevant biomolecules in biological fluids, leveraging their unique properties. By combining biosensor technology with nanotechnology, it becomes possible to overcome limitations such as low sensitivity and instability [49], thus paving the way for significant advancements in OSCC detection and diagnosis (Table2).

In the head and neck region, the oral cavity is highly susceptible to malignancies, with OSCC accounting for approximately 80–90% of cases. While radical resection remains the primary treatment option, chemotherapy plays a crucial role as an adjuvant therapy for patients with advanced/recurrent OSCC or those who cannot undergo surgery. In recent years, the availability of chemotherapy regimens has expanded rapidly. However, the 5-year survival rate for advanced/recurrent OSCC remains below 30% [67]. The tumor microenvironment, specifically hypoxia and acid conditions, significantly contribute to the poor efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in OSCC treatment. To address this issue, Chen et al. [55] synthesized a series of Zn1-xMgxFe2O4nanomaterials exhibiting enzyme-like properties, including catalase (CAT)-like, peroxidase (POD)-like, and glutathione (GSH)-like activities. Among them, Zn0.4Mg0.6Fe2O4demonstrated the most favorable characteristics. It effectively increased oxygen content, rectified the anoxic microenvironment within OSCC tumors, reduced OSCC chemotherapy tolerance, and improved chemotherapy outcomes. The nano-enzyme exhibited POD-like activity and selectively targeted tumor cells in the acidic tumor microenvironment while preserving normal cell integrity. Zn0.4Mg0.6Fe2O4significantly enhanced the efficacy of Doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy in OSCC treatment while reducing cardiotoxicity. Therefore, Zn0.4Mg0.6Fe2O4holds promise as a novel chemical sensitizer in OSCC therapy.

In addition to OSCC cells, stromal cells play a significant role in tumor progression by creating anoxic and acidic microenvironments that promote OSCC growth. Among the stromal cell populations, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the dominant contributors [68–70]. CAFs play a pivotal role in the development and progression of malignant tumors, including OSCC, making them a promising target for therapeutic intervention. In a study by Xia et al. [56], gold nanoparticles (GNPs) exhibited remarkable size-dependent anti-CAFs properties, with the smallest GNPs outperforming their larger counterparts. Exposure to GNPs led to a decrease in a group of proteins and cytokines responsible for the invasive growth of OSCC cells in CAFs derived from OSCC patients. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that GNPs with a diameter of 3 nm effectively inhibited OSCC tumor growth, presenting a novel clinical approach to OSCC treatment.

Radiation oncology is a standard therapeutic approach for treating HNSCC. While its effectiveness is notable, there have been reports of radiation resistance, as well as the occurrence of side effects such as mucositis and xerostomia. In the field of radiotherapy, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as potential sensitizers capable of enhancing the radiation response of tumors while minimizing adverse effects. The high atomic number of AuNPs results in strong photoelectric absorption and secondary electron emission when exposed to gamma rays or X-rays. Studies have revealed that oxidative stress, DNA damage induction, cell cycle arrest, and potential interference with the bystander effect are the primary mechanisms underlying the biological response of cells to AuNPs’ radiosensitization [71]. Additionally, AuNPs can amplify the effects of photons and particles that induce ionizing radiation.

To maximize the benefits of radiotherapy (RT), efficient delivery and internalization of AuNPs within cancer cells are crucial. AuNPs enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis [72], making their combination with radiotherapy a comprehensive treatment approach [73]. One proposed therapeutic platform involves a nanocomposite that integrates cisplatin-functionalized AuNPs, demonstrating remarkable tumor suppression in vivo following irradiation and exhibiting potential as a contrast agent for computed tomography (CT) imaging [74]. In another study utilizing an HNSCC cell line model, the combination of AuNPs with X-ray radiation or an epidermal growth factor inhibitor displayed enhanced cytotoxicity, reduced cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis, underscoring their synergistic effects [57].

The enhanced radiosensitivity of AuNPs at kiloelectron volt (KeV) energy levels surpasses that of the clinical megavolt (MV) used in RT. In light of this, Piccolo et al. [73] devised a diamond target beam (DTB) system to augment the quantity of low-energy photons both in vitro and in vivo using head and neck tumor cell lines and zebrafish xenotransplantation models. In comparison to standard RT, the viability of HNSCC cells decreased, and tumor cell eradication increased in zebrafish xenotransplantation experiments. These effects were primarily attributed to DNA double-strand breaks and the elevated generation of ROS, including superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide. These preclinical findings indicated the significant potential of AuNPs in advancing radiation oncology and suggest that clinical benefits for patients may be realized in the coming years.

Surgery-based comprehensive therapy, supplemented by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has long been the primary approach for treating HNSCC. However, functional tissue damage to the tongue can result in significant dysfunction and psychological trauma for patients [75]. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), with its non-invasive nature, spatial–temporal controllability, and repeatability, has emerged as a viable option in the field of head and neck tumor treatment. Oral cancer, given its relatively superficial location and high clinical maneuverability, is particularly suitable for clinical application of PDT. PDT, an established non-invasive treatment method with a history of over a century, has been extensively studied in numerous clinical trials. These trials have demonstrated that PDT not only preserves the oral structure, function, and appearance of OSCC patients but also minimizes side effects without causing permanent or systemic toxicity [76]. The fundamental principle of PDT lies in the introduction of photosensitizers (PSs) into tumor tissues, followed by the application of light at specific wavelengths. PSs interact with oxygen and light to generate phototoxic molecules that directly induce cancer cell death. Upon photoactivation, PSs convert intracellular oxygen into cytotoxic ROS, such as singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy [77], and immunogenic cell death (ICD). AuNPs coated with PSs, such as porphyrin [78], have shown promise in the treatment of superficial epidermoid carcinoma and are recommended for the management of mucosal and tongue tumors.

Duman et al. [59] devised a nanocomposite by encapsulating gold nanorods (GNRs) within polyacrylic acid (PAA), which were electrostatically coupled with cationic porphyrin TMPyP. The photosensitizing effect of this approach was evaluated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of HNSCC. These cellular systems were exposed to 420 nm wavelengths with a peak emission of 7mWcm-1 for a duration of 10 min. Remarkable phototoxicity was observed, resulting in a decrease in tumor cell proliferation in both models. In another investigation, HNSCC cell lines were subjected to AuNPs coated with 5-aminolevulinic acid, followed by irradiation with a red-light emitting diode (LED) source at 621 nm for PDT. This technique induced tumor cell apoptosis and inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of β-catenin, c-Myc, Cyclin D1 [79].

PDT, as a promising non-invasive therapy, has garnered considerable attention in the field of tumor treatment. However, its therapeutic efficacy is hampered by the limited absorptive capacity of tumor cells and the imperfect mechanisms of damage repair. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of PDT, Dai et al. [60] developed a biomimetic nanomaterial called PCN-CQ@CCM, which is coated with oral cancer cell membrane. This novel approach aims to establish targeted therapeutic functions and autophagy inhibition strategies. By utilizing the metal–organic skeleton material PCN-224 as the carrier, the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was loaded and then coated with OSCC cell membrane. Upon entering the bloodstream, the nanoparticles benefit from the surface camouflage effect provided by the oral cancer cell membrane, enabling them to evade the immune system. This camouflage effect also endows the nanoparticles with homologous targeting capabilities, thereby minimizing potential systemic side effects. Following activation by a 660 nm laser, the produced ROS induce apoptosis via mitochondrial damage. The release of CQ further enhances the lethality of ROS by effectively inhibiting protective autophagy. This non-invasive, targeted, and spatiotemporally controllable treatment modality maximizes the preservation of normal tissues and organs surrounding the tumor, while significantly improving the preservation and functional maintenance of the oral and jaw system affected by oral cancer.

Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an emerging and promising treatment modality that utilizes photothermal conversion agents (PTAs) to generate sufficient heat under near-infrared (NIR) light for tumor cell ablation [80,81]. It has been reported that temperatures as high as 41 °C can induce vasodilation and enhance blood perfusion in tumor tissues, thereby triggering a heat shock response in cells. Temperatures exceeding 46 °C result in irreversible cellular damage [82]. The principal wavelength used in PTT is near-infrared light because of its remarkable tissue penetration, minimal biological tissue absorption, dispersion, and remote control capabilities [81]. PTAs serve as a vital component in PTT, acting as the medium for converting light energy into heat energy. Through targeted recognition technology, PTAs are injected into the human body and accumulate at the tumor site. Upon irradiation with near-infrared light, the absorbed light energy is efficiently converted into heat energy, subsequently elevating the temperature within the lesion area and eradicating cancer cells [83].

Metal nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), have garnered significant attention as PTT agents due to their unique optical properties, particularly their strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption. In a study by Zhang et al. [61], gold nanorods (GNRs) coated with EGFR monoclonal antibody were synthesized. The previously treated laryngeal cancer cells were then irradiated with an 808 nm NIR laser for 6 min, resulting in a local average temperature of 50 °C and the induction of apoptosis-mediated cell death. Likewise, cetuximab-coated GNRs along with human anti-EGFR antibody EGFR-hIgG1 were employed in the HNSCC cell line CAL27. Following a 24 h treatment period, the cells were exposed to a 2 min dose of a continuous wave (CW) diode laser operating at 1064 nm and with a power density of 2 Wcm-2. It was discovered that a rise in local temperature was linked to a considerable loss of tumor cells, indicating that the use of GNRs in conjunction with targeted EGFR has potential as a successful PTT strategy [84].

Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and evaluation of OSCC, particularly in tumor localization and the detection of metastatic lymph nodes. PAI is an emerging non-ionizing and non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables high-resolution and depth-specific tissue visualization [85]. An additional notable characteristic of PAI is its potential for integrated diagnosis and treatment, such as PTT. Zeng et al.’s paper described the effective development of DOX-AuNRs@mSiO2-HA, a new mesoporous silica composite coated with gold nanoparticles [62]. This composite exhibited ultra-high photoacoustic imaging signals, remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency, and excellent drug loading capacity. The gold nanoparticles were coated with mesoporous silica featuring large pores, while doxorubicin hydrochloride—an effective anticancer drug—was loaded into the mesoporous silica via electrostatic interactions, specifically van der Waals forces. The attachment of hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules to the AuNRs@mSiO2nanoparticles occurred through amide bonds. The resulting gold nanomaterials demonstrated exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency and generated high-resolution photoacoustic signals, making them suitable for tumor targeting and PAI-guided photothermal chemotherapy in OSCC.

Tumor immunotherapy has emerged as a novel approach for the treatment of primary tumors, capitalizing on the activation of immune cells to recognize and eliminate residual cancer cells. This mechanism holds great promise in reducing tumor metastasis and recurrence, and its success has been demonstrated in clinical practice. In the case of HNSCC, certain immunotherapeutic drugs, including cetuximab and nivolumab, have received approval for treatment. However, these antibodies have inherent limitations when used as standalone therapies for HNSCC. To overcome these limitations, coupling them with gold nanomaterials has been explored to enhance their therapeutic efficacy [86].

Cell stiffness is a fundamental biomechanical characteristic that has garnered increasing attention. Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells exhibit relatively softer and more deformable properties compared to normal cells [87]. Low cell stiffness is associated with cancer cell adhesion, metastatic potential, and invasiveness, highlighting its relevance to malignant transformation and tumor progression. Changes in cancer cell stiffness play a crucial role in the anti-tumor response and immune evasion, as harder tumor cells display heightened sensitivity to T cell-mediated killing. The biophysical impact of increased cancer cell stiffness enhances their ability to activate cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby effectively modulating the immune microenvironment within tumors. Consequently, enhancing cancer cell stiffness to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy holds great promise as a potential tumor treatment strategy. In a study conducted by Zhang et al. [63], a novel carbon nano-enzyme, graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), was synthesized through acid oxidation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that GDYO could enhance the stiffness of tumor cells under laser irradiation, thereby augmenting the cytotoxicity of T cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α). Furthermore, GDYO exhibited inhibitory effects on an OSCC model by combining PDT, and it triggered an anti-tumor immune response mediated by specific cytotoxic T cells. These findings highlight the potential of GDYO in breaking through the barriers of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

In recent years, nanomaterials have made significant progress in developing targeted therapeutic systems for HNSCC. By combining nucleic acid aptamers or antibodies with nanomaterials, precise treatment can be achieved [88]. Nucleic acid aptamers are single stranded oligonucleotide with high affinity and specificity, capable of specifically binding to target molecules on the surface of tumor cells [89]. For example, researchers have developed nucleic acid aptamer nanomaterials that bind to EGFR for targeted therapy of HNSCC [64]. Antibody-conjugated nanomaterials achieve precise targeting by binding specific antibodies to receptors on the surface of tumor cells. For example, gold nanoparticles conjugated with anti-EGFR antibodies have been developed for PTT in HNSCC. These nanomaterials can generate local high temperatures under NIR light irradiation, thereby inducing tumor cell apoptosis [65]. Beyond single targeting strategy, researchers have also developed multifunctional nanomaterials that combine multiple therapeutic approaches. For example, a nano material based on HA modified gold nanorods has been developed for the combined application of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy. These nanomaterials can not only kill tumor cells through photothermal effects, but also further enhance therapeutic effects by loading chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin [90]. This multifunctional approach holds great promise for improving treatment outcomes in HNSCC by leveraging the synergistic effects of different therapeutic modalities.

Tumor invasion and metastasis are critical factors influencing the prognosis of HNSCC, particularly OSCC. They pose significant challenges to effective treatment. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of phytochemicals as adjuvants in traditional cancer therapy. Zingerone, a phenolic component found in ginger, is one such phytochemical. This non-volatile and biologically active compound possesses diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antibacterial effects [91]. In a study conducted by Yang et al. [66], zingerone nanoparticles (NPs) derived from phytochemical sources were prepared, and their inhibitory effects on invasiveness and metastasis of human OSCC cell lines were investigated. The phytochemical zingerone NPs demonstrated the ability to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells by targeting and suppressing Akt activity. These findings suggest that zingerone NPs, as a novel and efficient phytochemical-based nanoparticle, hold promise as effective adjuvants in future chemoprophylaxis and cancer treatment for OSCC. Their utilization may improve the side effects, drug resistance, and recurrence associated with traditional cancer therapy (Table3).

Nanomaterials’ application within tumor organoids marks a cutting-edge advancement in oncology. These organoids, which are 3D tumor mimics, serve as invaluable models for probing cancer biology and evaluating treatments [92]. (Table4) By merging nanomaterials with organoids, the research field gains unique advantages for both cancer study and therapy development. Currently, research has been conducted on pancreatic cancer [93], colorectal cancer [94], and breast cancer [95,96] (Table5). Yet, within the domain of HNSCC, substantial gaps in knowledge persist, offering numerous avenues for deeper inquiry. The synergy between nanomaterials and cancer organoids holds great potential for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and for the discovery and validation of novel anticancer strategies. As this field continues to evolve, it is expected to contribute significantly to the arsenal of tools available for cancer research and treatment.

Nanomaterials-based cancer therapies have exhibited promise in preclinical settings, yet the transition of these nanomedicine strategies to clinical practice has been limited. A mere fraction of nanomedicine strategies has made it to clinics. Challenges such as safety, efficacy, scalability, and regulatory hurdles, along with the mismatch between preclinical models and actual tumors, impede the progress of nanomaterials to clinical trials [97,98]. Table6outlines nanomaterials-mediated drugs used in cancer therapies, including those that have been completed, discontinued, and those in phase I and II clinical trials.

Patients with HNSCC treated conventionally face a high rate of complications, necessitating the development of safer and more effective management strategies. Complications such as xerostomia, facial paralysis, mutism, and facial disfigurement significantly impact patients’ quality of life. A critical objective is to increase cure rates and extend disease-free survival, a challenge that has persisted due to late diagnoses. Functionalized gold nanomaterials offer a promising approach. These materials can home in on tumor tissues, offering molecular imaging that assists surgeons in identifying resection margins during surgery [41]. Additionally, they have potential in spectral cancer diagnostics [42]. With their high sensitivity to OSCC, these nanomaterials could facilitate earlier diagnosis and more accurate staging. The author posits that the incorporation of functionalized gold nanomaterials into clinical practice could greatly benefit early diagnosis, prevention, and surgical intervention. They are deemed suitable for clinical trials and subsequent research in HNSCC management.

HNSCC, being accessible and palpable, offers an advantageous aspect for treatment via PDT, which the author deems to have substantial application potential. PDT preserves the oral cavity’s structure, function, and aesthetics while minimizing adverse effects [76]. A specific biomimetic nanomaterial, PCN-CQ@CCM [60], coated with a membrane from oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, is believed to augment PDT’s effectiveness. This enhancement is achieved by introducing a targeted therapeutic approach and inhibiting autophagy, a cellular self-digestion process that can counteract the therapy’s objectives. The author posits that this nanomaterial-based treatment could protect the tumor’s surrounding healthy tissues and organs, thus preventing the oral cancer’s impact on the oral and jaw systems. Considering a clinical trial for such nanomaterials in HNSCC is advocated, with the anticipation that it may ameliorate or resolve clinical challenges and pave the way for future investigative endeavors.

Nanotechnology offers unique advantages, such as the ability to load multiple substances into a single carrier and to combine diagnostic and therapeutic functions. This allows for the development of nanoparticles that encapsulate both therapeutic drugs and imaging contrast agents, thus improving diagnostic imaging and therapeutic effectiveness. Jing et al. have crafted a nanoprobe derived from extracellular vesicles, which exhibit a strong affinity for binding to tumor cells. When integrated with PET, CT, and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, this nanoprobe offers clear visualization of colon cancer in its natural environment, supporting surgical navigation. The use of real-time NIRF imaging is especially adept at identifying the precise boundaries of tumors during surgical procedures in mice [119].

Diagnostic imaging can be effectively integrated with phototherapy to enhance cancer treatment. Zhang et al. created an amphiphilic Janus nanoparticle (JNP) from PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH)3-PAA for the dual delivery of hydrophilic drugs like doxorubicin (DOX) and hydrophobic drugs like docetaxel. These JNPs feature pH sensitivity and respond to near-infrared light, facilitating the timed release of their drug payloads. The integration of AuNC and Fe(OH)3nanomaterials provides the system with capabilities for CT/MR imaging. When activated by a near-infrared laser, these materials can initiate a chemophotothermal therapeutic approach, which has been shown to significantly inhibit tumor growth [120]. Qiu et al. introduced a composite drug delivery system named ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD, which also serves as a nano ultrasound contrast agent. This system is engineered to combine the benefits of ultrasound imaging with immune stimulation. The synergistic effect is achieved through the use of iron deposition and PTT [121].

Currently, nanomaterial-based strategies for integrated diagnosis and treatment have shown a strong focus on cancers of the digestive system. In contrast, research on HNSCC is markedly lacking. This discrepancy indicates a clear research gap that necessitates additional investigation. Gold nanomaterials have become a pivotal focus in nanotechnology, particularly for their applications in medicine. They are already in use for diagnostics [41,42] and therapy [56]. The evolving research is poised to develop these materials to a point where they can integrate diagnosis with treatment, potentially expanding their medical applications. Gold nanomaterials boast unique properties—biocompatibility, modifiable surfaces, and robust optical absorption—that render them ideal for a spectrum of uses in biomedicine. They serve not only as imaging agents and drug carriers but also in photothermal therapies and molecular targeting. The continuous pursuit of innovation in this field is expected to yield multifunctional gold nanomaterials. These advanced materials are set to provide tailored and efficacious treatments, thereby improving patient outcomes. The convergence of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities into one platform is anticipated to enable real-time treatment monitoring and dosage personalization. Such an integration could be transformative for cancer treatment and other medical interventions.

Nanomaterials have great application and development potential in the future. Yet, their entry into the body’s internal circulation systems necessitates a critical evaluation of biosafety. The potential toxicity of these materials is influenced by factors such as particle size, shape, surface charge, stability, and concentration. When formulating nanomaterials for cancer therapies, it is crucial to fine-tune their physical and chemical properties to minimize harm to healthy cells. Moreover, studies have indicated that nanomaterials might induce DNA damage and alter gene methylation patterns, which could potentially initiate carcinogenesis [122,123]. Despite these findings, there is no conclusive evidence that nanomaterials can directly trigger malignant transformations or genetic mutations in cells. The absence of direct evidence, however, does not equate to safety. The long-term effects of nanomaterial metabolism and accumulation within the body remain uncertain and warrant further investigation through extended exposure studies.

The translation of nanomaterials into clinical practice poses significant challenges, particularly regarding their ability to address clinical needs and support widespread use. A primary obstacle to clinical application is cost. The expense of nanomaterial formulations is a limiting factor. However, this cost can be mitigated by using less material and employing strategies that enhance therapeutic efficacy. Firstly, the incorporation of cost-effective adjuvants or the development of composite nanomaterials can enhance treatment outcomes [124]. Secondly, advanced drug delivery methods, such as microneedles for precise delivery, layered self-assembly of nanomaterials, and nanoscale systems for controlled drug release [125], can be implemented to optimize treatment and reduce the overall dosage of nanomaterials required. Furthermore, refining the formulation and refining the manufacturing process are effective strategies for lowering production expenses. Given the diversity of nanomaterials and their properties, a multifaceted approach to their application in HNSCC is essential. Future research should delve deeper into innovative mechanisms of action to refine therapies and minimize adverse effects.

Currently, nanomaterial research is in its early stages, yet it is gaining increasing attention, particularly in the areas of cancer treatment and drug design. These materials possess unique characteristics, such as surface effects, quantum size effects, and macroscopic quantum tunneling effects, coupled with remarkable thermal, biological, and electromagnetic properties [126–129]. These attributes distinguish nanomaterials from traditional materials. In cancer research, the utilization of nanomaterials is on the rise [130–133]. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, among others, have shown distinctive anti-tumor capabilities, highlighting the significant potential of nanomaterials in oncology [134–136].

However, it is crucial to consider the potential toxicity of innovative nanomaterials. Even with the EPR effect, nanomaterials have the potential to distribute and accumulate in different organs. Specifically, metal-based nanomaterials can produce ROS, which may compromise cell membrane integrity and lead to epigenetic changes [137,138]. Furthermore, the effectiveness and safety of nanomaterials are determined by a variety of factors. These include the size [139], shape [140], surface characteristics [141], crystalline structure [142], tendency to aggregate [143], and solubility [144] of the particles. Addressing the toxicity of nanomaterials is a critical step in ensuring their successful transition to clinical use.
