The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is uncontrollable and appears in different patterns and shapes; accordingly, it is not easily detected and solved with preceding solutions. A DDoS attack is the most serious threat on the Internet. These attacks became a preferred weapon for cyber extortionists, terrorists, and hackers. These attacks can quickly undermine a target, producing massive revenue loss. Classification methods are applied in numerous investigations and have been used to identify and resolve DDoS attacks. Detection of DDoS attacks is problematic in terms of identifying and mitigating them. However, it is valuable as these attacks may lead to big problems. Various methods are presented for attack detection and prevention. However, artificial intelligence (AI)-based Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies are highly effective for detecting DDoS attacks in cybersecurity. This paper proposes a Cybersecurity-Resource Exhaustion Attack Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model and Metaheuristic Optimizer Algorithms (CREA-HDLMOA) technique. The primary goal of the CREA-HDLMOA technique is to advance an effective method for DDoS attack detection using advanced optimization algorithms. Initially, the data normalization stage leverages linear scaling normalization (LSN) for converting input data into a beneficial format. Furthermore, the feature selection process uses the RIME optimization algorithm (ROA) model to select the most relevant features from the data. In addition, the hybrid of long short-term memory and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (LSTM + Bi-GRU) technique is employed for the DDoS attack classification process. Finally, the modernized pufferfish optimization algorithm (MPOA)-based hyperparameter selection process is performed to optimize the classification results of the LSTM + BiGRU technique. An extensive simulation is performed to validate the performance of the CREA-HDLMOA method under CIC-IDS2017 and Edge-IIoT datasets. The experimental validation of the CREA-HDLMOA method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.31% and 99.36% under dual datasets over existing approaches.

DoS attacks have become an undeniably severe challenge on the Internet, whose effects are well-defined in computer network publications1. DoS’s primary goal is to interrupt services by limiting access to a service or machine rather than subverting it. This type of threat focuses on rendering a system unable to provide normal service by aiming at both connectivity and network bandwidth2. These threats attain their objective by sending a target stream of packets which swamps his system or processing ability, denying admittance to his usual clients. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are real attacks on digital, cyberinfrastructure, and networks3. These threats can cause considerable disruptions in a few information communication technology (ICT) frameworks. There are many reasons for launching DDoS threats. These comprise political gains, disruption, and financial gains4. DDoS threats can paralyze services and networks by overwhelming network links, gadgets, and servers with illegal traffic5. Figure1signifies the general structure of a resource exhaustion attack. They can cause service degradation, and a complete DoS leads to a massive loss. The growing dependence on data centres and the Internet has forced this concern. An increasing reliance on the vital structure of a country in ICT has given rise to the requirement for effective solutions for safeguarding against DDoS threats. For example, data centres run essential services like smart grids and provide highly reliable services6.

DDoS attacks make online services inaccessible by overwhelming targets with traffic from various attackers. As more businesses migrate to online operations, DDoS threats initiate substantial economic losses. Reports show that the frequency of DDoS attacks has increased recently7. Consequently, quickly and effectively identifying DDoS threats is the most significant concern when measuring the network. Since DDoS attackers are generally distributed throughout the system, coordinated, extensive system monitoring is needed to detect DDoS effectively. For mitigation and timely detection, DDoS recognition should also react rapidly to the beginning of a traffic anomaly8. Relevant publications have been performed in which investigators have projected diverse intrusion detection systems (IDS) to reduce the risk of harmful intrusion threats. In recent times, some detection approaches have been proposed against DDoS threats. Indeed, identifying a DDoS attack is moderately easy at the targeted system, since attack traffic near the target is remarkably overwhelming9. Threats are taken depending on recognizing unusually high traffic with certain classifications. Recognizing DDoS threats is instantly connected to continuous configuration errors and wasted time because of the absence of devices that follow the system’s dynamics without constant human intervention10. In this context, the endorsement of solutions with models depends on artificial intelligence (AI), generally deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models are well-known for providing higher flexibility in the process of classification, thus enhancing the recognition of harmful traffic.

This paper proposes a Cybersecurity-Resource Exhaustion Attack Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model and Metaheuristic Optimizer Algorithms (CREA-HDLMOA) technique. The primary goal of the CREA-HDLMOA technique is to advance an effective method for DDoS attack detection using advanced optimization algorithms. Initially, the data normalization stage leverages linear scaling normalization (LSN) for converting input data into a beneficial format. Furthermore, the feature selection process uses the RIME optimization algorithm (ROA) model to select the most relevant features from the data. In addition, the hybrid of long short-term memory and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (LSTM + Bi-GRU) technique is employed for the DDoS attack classification process. Finally, the modernized pufferfish optimization algorithm (MPOA)-based hyperparameter selection process is performed to optimize the classification results of the LSTM + BiGRU technique. An extensive simulation is performed to validate the performance of the CREA-HDLMOA method under CIC-IDS2017 and Edge-IIoT datasets. The key contribution of the CREA-HDLMOA method is listed below.

The CREA-HDLMOA model utilizes the LSN method to scale input features, effectively ensuring consistency across the data. This normalization approach enhances the model’s robustness and prevents issues related to varying feature magnitudes. By standardizing the data, LSN improves the overall performance and accuracy of the DDoS detection system.

The CREA-HDLMOA method utilizes the ROA technique for effective feature selection, ensuring that only the most relevant features are used for DDoS detection. This methodology improves the model’s capability to concentrate on critical information, improving detection accuracy. By mitigating complexity, ROA contributes to faster processing and better model generalization.

The CREA-HDLMOA approach employs a hybrid of LSTM + Bi-GRU for DDoS classification, integrating sequence learning with bidirectional memory to capture past and future attack patterns. This approach improves the detection of complex attack scenarios and enhances the model’s ability to detect subtle anomalies. The hybrid structure optimizes performance, making it more robust in identifying and classifying diverse DDoS attacks.

The CREA-HDLMOA methodology integrates the MPOA model for hyperparameter tuning, improving the model’s performance while maintaining low computational cost. This optimization ensures effective fine-tuning of parameters, resulting in faster convergence and better overall accuracy. The approach mitigates resource consumption without losing detection capabilities, providing scalability in real-time environments.

The novelty of the CREA-HDLMOA model is in its unique integration of LSTM + Bi-GRU, which captures both forward and backwards temporal patterns for robust DDoS detection. This is improved by using ROA to select the most discriminative features and MPOA to tune hyperparameters. The hybrid architecture enables precise attack classification with minimal resource consumption.

While effective in many cases, the existing DDoS and IoT systems studies suffer from limitations such as high computational cost, inadequate handling of dynamic attack vectors, and inability to scale for massive datasets effectively. Several studies mainly focus on detection and fail to present effective mitigation strategies. ML and DL techniques illustrated promising results, but threats remain in balancing detection accuracy with resource constraints, specifically for IoMT and IoT networks. The research gap is developing more lightweight, efficient, and adaptable models for real-time, large-scale data while maintaining high detection performance across varied attack scenarios. Moreover, integrating robust feature selection methods with optimized hybrid models to mitigate false positives and improve detection speed remains an open challenge.

This paper proposes a novel CREA-HDLMOA methodology. Its primary goal is to advance an effective method for DDoS attack detection using advanced optimization algorithms. The methodology involves various processes, such as data normalization, dimensionality reduction, hybrid classification, and parameter selection. Figure2represents the workflow of the CREA-HDLMOA model.

Initially, the data normalization stage employs LSN for converting input data into a beneficial format. This model is chosen for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to scale input features into a uniform range, typically [0,1], which is crucial for accelerating model convergence during training. LSN ensures no feature dominates others due to scale differences, preserving the relative relationships among data points. The model also exhibits efficiency for time-series and DL techniques and does not distort feature distributions. The method also assists in reducing gradient vanishing issues in deep networks by maintaining numerical stability. Compared to more complex normalization techniques, LSN presents minimal overhead, making it ideal for real-time and resource-constrained environments. This makes LSN a perfect choice for pre-processing in DDoS detection tasks.

LSN is an essential pre-processing stage in DDoS attack detection, guaranteeing that networking traffic features are converted to an ordinary scale, usually inside [0,1] or [– 1,1]. This normalization avoids features with large numeric intervals to control those with small choices, resulting in more symmetrical and precise ML methods. During the detection of DDoS, whereas real-time study is essential, normalization improves the efficacy of classifiers by guaranteeing that each feature contributes similarly to the decision-making procedure. It reduces the influence of noise and outliers, making anomaly-based detection models more predictable. Eventually, linear scaling standardization is essential in improving feature representation and enhancing the complete detection precision of DDoS attacks.

Besides, the ROA implements the FS process for selecting the most relevant features from the data31. This model is chosen for its robust global search capability and efficiency in handling high-dimensional feature spaces. The technique replicates the natural rime growth process, enabling it to explore and exploit feature subsets efficiently to detect the most relevant attributes for DDoS detection. This method maintains the semantic integrity of features and does not need data transformation, which is significant for interpretability. The model also shows excellence in dynamically adjusting the selection process based on fitness values, ensuring optimal feature subsets tailored for the classification task. This results in improved model accuracy, faster training, and reduced computational complexity.

RIME is the optimizer model, miming the natural frost formation procedure. Frost formation mainly takes place in two kinds: hard and soft frost. This model utilizes a forward greedy method to repeatedly hunt for the optimum solution, attaining a global optimizer.

During RIME, all frost bodies are considered the individual searching particles inside the model, and the complete frost body population is deliberated as the model’s population. The complete frost body population RRR is initially set to determine the primary mathematical representation, as provided in Eq. (1).

Here,signifies the original frost body population, andcharacterizes thefrost particle within the frost crystal. The fitness functionfor the frost body agent is given in Eq. (2).

After all frost particles are compressed into soft frost, they transfer based on the particular design, and ecological features influence their efficacy. When the particle surpasses the escape radius, compression cannot take place.

Here:represents the upgrade location of the particle;signifies theparticle of the optimal frost body within the frost population;means randomly generated numbers inside the intervalspecifies the particle movement direction that alterations in all iterations, as exposed in Eq.6;represents ecological aspect, which pretends modifications in the outside atmosphere in iterations to guarantee the model’s convergence, through the convergence equation specified in Eq. (5);control the central distance among dual elements and is randomly generated numbers inside the intervalandcharacterize the lower and upper limits of the escaping interval, controlling the particle movement range;means randomly generated number in the interval ofand, in addition to the attachment coefficient EEE, controls the upgrade of the particle position;signifies attachment coefficient, which improves with the iteration counts, as stated in Eq. (6).

Now,represents the present iteration amount;characterizes the maximal iteration counts;specifies rounding to the closest integer;refers to segment counts that control the step function.

As the range of soft frost improves, it shows a stronger chance and wide-ranging coverage that enables the fast recognition of the best decomposition parameters. A hard frost penetration mechanism is presented to update the model among agents to stop them from being stuck in local ideals in the optimization procedure. This mechanism allows the particles to exchange through dissimilar local areas, thus enhancing model convergence and avoiding local bests, as exemplified in Eq. (7).

Here:signifies the present standardized fitness value, which designates the likelihood of theice particle having swapped;means a randomly generated number in the interval. The fitness function (FF) applied in the ROA is established to have a balance amongst the selected feature amounts in every solution (minimal) and the classification precision (maximal) gained by exploiting these chosen features. Equation (8) characterizes the FF to assess solutions.

In addition, the hybrid of the LSTM + BiGRU technique is deployed for the DDoS attack classification process32. This model was chosen because it captures long-range temporal dependencies and contextual information from past and future sequences. BiGRU improves performance by processing data in both forward and backwards directions, enhancing context awareness, and LSTM retains critical patterns over time. Unlike conventional RNNs or standalone models like LSTM or GRU, this hybrid model gives higher accuracy and robustness against sequential data irregularities. The model effectively detects subtle and growing patterns seen in DDoS traffic. Its relatively lower computational complexity than stacked deep models ensures efficiency without compromising accuracy. Figure3represents the infrastructure of LSTM + BiGRU.

Initially presented, LSTM, a version of the RNN method, was applied to resolve the disappearance gradient and explosion difficulties challenged by RNN in long-range sequences. It is particularly adjusted to prevent longer‐range dependencies. This method incorporates the powers of BiGRU and LSTM models, making detecting and classifying sequential data especially efficient. LSTM outshines by taking longer-term dependencies inside the data, whereas Bi-GRU provides a more effective manner to take past or future context over its bidirectional structure. This integration enhances the model’s ability to understand composite sequences. This method may offer more precise classifications by incorporating the memory ability of the LSTM and the bidirectional feature of the BiGRU. The hybrid model also alleviates computational efficiency compared to utilizing distinct LSTM or GRU methods, but exploits their powers.

Here,denotes the bias term,specifies the HL state at the instantsymbolize the gated state upgraded at the instant, andrefers to the function of sigmoid.

Bi-GRU builds dual backwards GRUS, demonstrating time-series data backwards and forward. The result of the time step connects the results of either GRU.

At last, the MPOA-based hyperparameter selection process is performed to optimize the classification results of the LSTM + BiGRU method33. This model is chosen for its enhanced exploration and exploitation capabilities, which address the challenges of local optima and premature convergence in conventional optimizers. This model adjusts the search process, ensuring optimal convergence speed and solution diversity. The method also presents adaptive and intelligent tuning, resulting in more efficient optimization with mitigated computational overhead. Its robustness and precision make it appropriate for fine-tuning DL methods in complex tasks like DDoS detection.

POA is a new meta-heuristic optimization approach inspired by nature to discover the best solution to the problem. It imitates the individual defensive mechanism of pufferfish. To prevent predators, these incredible animals expand themselves when at risk. The POA mimics this behaviour to avoid local bests and explore the search area more effectively. The pufferfish’s safeguarding behaviour is the primary inspiration for the growth of POA. Pufferfish are smaller in size and have only four teeth. To escape from predators, the pufferfish fill their elastic stomachs with water. After filling massive amounts of water, they turn out spherical ball-shaped fish, and their directed spines become evident. Therefore, the predators cannot touch them. Pufferfish cannot swim rapidly. As a result, this defensive mechanism is vital for their everyday life. Predators are unable to attack these fish after they are spherical. It contains dual stages: the exploitation and the exploration stage. The modelto examine new selections during this exploration stage by extending its search space. However, in the exploitation phase, itto focus on a small, more promising region when the new area isn’t better. This model progresses toward a better solution found in exploration or exploitation. By balancing exploitation and exploration, POA can recognize possible solutions and direct without less-than-ideal ones. It is applied in various fields, including image processing, engineering, and ML.

The traditional POA processes composite high-dimensional issues, and allocating some controller parameters is unnecessary. However, it has failed to reach the optimal global solution. Thus, an enhanced version of this model is advanced to upgrade its randomly generated number by considering the fitness values. By selecting MPOA, the capability to handle the load balance between nodes is improved, and it guarantees the enhanced survival of WSN. The randomly generated number updated in the presented MPOA is specified in Eq. (19).

Now, the mean fitness value is described by the term. The termsandsignify the present fitness and poor fitness values. This model is used in Eq. (11). The presented method resolves early convergence and gains a global optimal solution by presenting an improved balance among both stages in the model. The population count of 10 is considered in this paper. For every population, 50 sets of iterations should be implemented. The present fitness function (FF) characterizes the fitness value from the present iteration above all iterations. The fitness value gained from each iteration is enhanced and separated by two to become the mean fitness value. The poor FF is the maximum fitness value attained after finishing each iteration. The presented model resolves early convergence and acquires a global optimal solution by presenting an improved balance between both stages. Current POA may be stuck in the local bests and influence the exploration capability. Updating the random variable enhances the probability of exploring the problem area and decreases the likelihood of becoming trapped in local ideals. Owing to the theory in Eq. (9), the MPOA ability of the algorithm to reflect the objective function is improved. This procedure mainly relies on managing those objective functions and leads to an even more flexible and effective optimizer procedure.

This approach has two modelled phases: the attacking and defending stages.

During this beginning phase of the POA, the positions of the fish are randomly organized. Themember of the pufferfish population is. The lower and upper limit of the decision variableais designated asand, respectively. A random integer in the range [0,1] is represented as. The whole population is characterized as. According to themember, an objective function is assessed and named. These functions calculate the quality of all optimum solutions produced by all fish. According to the solution, the best and worst fish are chosen. During all iterations, the position of the optimal member becomes advanced.

During this exploration stage, the predator deliberates on its attack on the pufferfish. The pufferfish’s position changes after it attempts to escape from the predator. The pufferfish population is stated in Eq. (20).

The termdenotes the objective function, and the fish with the enhanced objective function is mentioned as. The candidate pufferfish’s position is referred to as. During this whole population, one fish is randomly attacked by the predator. The new position of pufferfish is projected utilizing Eqs. (21) and (22) are adapted from.

Now, the term, describes the new position of the fish. The randomly generated numbers are expressed asand. The picked fish by the predator is specified as. The random number is updated through Eq. (19). During this exploitation phase, the fish’s position is updated depending on its defensive approach. Once they saw the sharp spines of pufferfish, the predator didn’t attack the fish. The position of the pufferfish is modified later, and the predator leaves the fish. The new site of the pufferfish is computed utilizing Eqs. (23) and (24).

During the above terms, the iteration count is mentioned as. The new position and objective function are simultaneously stated asand. In this paper, the reduction of the classification error rate is reflected as the FF, as provided in Eq. (25).

In this study, a novel CREA-HDLMOA methodology is proposed. The primary objective of the CREA-HDLMOA methodology is to advance an effective method for DDoS attack detection using advanced optimization algorithms. Initially, the data normalization stage employs LSN to convert input data into a beneficial format. Besides, the ROA implements the FS process for selecting the most relevant features from the data.

The model may be affected by high-speed traffic conditions due to computational overhead. Furthermore, real-time deployment on low-resource devices poses latency and scalability challenges. Although comprehensive, the dataset may not fully represent real-world traffic diversity. Label imbalance in the dataset can also affect classification fairness. Future studies may explore lightweight architectures appropriate for edge deployment, integrate adaptive learning mechanisms to cope with evolving threats, and utilize ensemble methods for improved generalization across varied attack types and network settings.
