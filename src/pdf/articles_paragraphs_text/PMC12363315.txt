Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a fibro-inflammatory syndrome with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors and a prevalence of 41.8 to 91.9 per 100,000 person-years in the United States.1,2Individuals with CP are at increased risk of developing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a condition resulting from insufficient production, delivery, or activity of pancreatic enzymes.3The probability of developing EPI increases substantially over time in patients with CP.4,5Left untreated, EPI results in maldigestion, steatorrhea, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition, an increase in bone fractures,6and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL).3,7Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific clinical symptoms and being secondary to underlying primary diseases. Measurement of fecal elastase (FE-1) in stool samples is the most common diagnostic test, but limitations include poor sensitivity in mild to moderate EPI, and inaccuracies when used on liquid stool samples.8,9The established cutoff of stool FE-1 levels for the assessment of EPI severity (abnormal, <200 µg/g; mild to moderate, 100–200 µg/g; and severe, <100 µg/g) is still debated due to these limitations8,9Consequently, EPI is often diagnosed based on clinical presentation including abnormalities on pancreatic imaging, abnormal serum nutritional markers, presence of risk factors, unintentional weight loss, and abdominal and bowel symptoms which are nonspecific or become overt only as severity worsens. The cornerstone of treatment for EPI is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), a combination of porcine-derived lipases, proteases, and amylases that help mitigate maldigestion, malnutrition, and other adverse health outcomes.3Our current understanding of PERT effects on clinical symptoms of EPI is limited.10Short-term pancrelipase treatment in patients with CP and EPI has been shown to improve HRQoL11; however, real-world data informed by validated patient-reported outcome assessments are lacking for US patients.

To inform clinical practice, a real-world study [CREON®Impact of EPI Symptoms in Chronic Pancreatitis (CisCP)] of US patients with EPI due to CP is examining the effects of pancrelipase on patient-reported EPI symptoms and its impact on HRQoL by utilizing the validated Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Questionnaire (PEI-Q). The aim of this study is to describe the methodology to expand similar research in other settings and report current patient enrollment and characteristics.

This is an ongoing prospective, real-world, observational, cohort study (NCT04949828) conducted at 7 US academic pancreatology centers. Enrollment started in May 2021, and follow-up is planned to end in 2024. The study design is provided in Figure1and detailed in the supplement. The study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines, applicable regulations, and guidelines governing study conduct and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study flowchart. *In person at the clinical research site or virtual study visit.†Virtual study visit.‡Dose adjustments were performed at the discretion of the physician if needed based on the dose adjustment questionnaire. CP indicates chronic pancreatitis; EPI, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; HGS, hand-grip strength; LU, lipase unit; PEI-Q, Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Questionnaire; PROMIS, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; SS, PEI-Q Total Symptom Score.

Eligible patients include adults aged ≥18 years with a medical history of probable or definite CP and moderate to severe EPI [PEI-Q Total Symptom Score (PEI-Q SS) ≥1.4], who were recommended to initiate pancrelipase (CREON®)12treatment at 72,000 lipase units (LU)/meal and 36,000 LU/snack by their treating physician. Patients are PERT-naive or PERT-experienced (ie, no PERT within the past 3 months, or 7 days if dose is <40,000 LU/meal). Key exclusion criteria are non–EPI-related gastrointestinal symptoms/conditions, recent systemic antibiotic therapy, and upcoming pancreatic endotherapy or surgery.

Safety assessments include treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to premature study discontinuation.

A sample size of 35 evaluable patients is needed to achieve 90% power at a 2-sidedPvalue of 0.05 in a 1-samplettest. This is based on the SD of the PEI-Q SS of 0.7 for patients with EPI with moderate to severe symptoms14and assuming the true mean of the primary endpoint of 0.4. Additional statistical methods are provided in the Supplement, Supplemental Digital Content 1,http://links.lww.com/MPA/B381.

As of May 2024, 49 patients have enrolled with a median age of 59 years, 53% female, 62% white, and 97% non-Hispanic (Supplementary Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2,http://links.lww.com/MPA/B382). Steatorrhea was present in 62% of patients and the mean FE-1 concentration was 65 µg/g stool. Median body weight was 158 lbs, 49% of patients had diabetes, and 30% were current alcohol users.

The clinical efficacy of pancrelipase (CREON®) and pancreatin (KREON®) for EPI secondary to CP has been demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.19,20One study showed significant improvements in stool frequency, stool consistency, and flatulence but not in abdominal pain.20In contrast, no differences between pancrelipase versus placebo were observed for stool consistency, flatulence, or abdominal pain during the double-blind period of the other study.19In addition, these studies had methodological limitations that may affect the applicability of the results to real-world clinical practice, including a lack of statistical power, limited clinical assessment of only 4 symptoms, and the utilization of nonvalidated patient-reported outcome tools to assess EPI symptom. This study is evaluating the effect of pancrelipase on EPI symptom burden, HRQoL, and state of nutrition in the real-world setting among patients with EPI secondary to CP utilizing the validated PEI-Q for the first time. Results are expected to address key research gaps, inform clinical practice, and aid the management of patients with EPI due to CP.
