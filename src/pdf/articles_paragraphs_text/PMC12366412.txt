Ophiocordyceps sinensisis globally recognized for its exceptional nutritional and medicinal properties. Variations in the edible qualities and tonic values ofO. sinensisat different harvesting stages remain poorly understood in terms of compositional changes and regulatory mechanisms. Utilizing UPLC-MS/MS and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), this study unveiled discrepancies in metabolite accumulation and gene expression ofO. sinensisacross various harvesting stages. Metabolomics analysis identified 596 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs), primarily enriched in amino acid-related metabolic pathways such as tyrosine, tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine metabolism. The up accumulation of organic acids and derivatives with delayed harvesting led to distinct abundances and compositions of amino acids, peptides, analogs, and fatty acids and conjugates, ultimately influencing the quality ofO. sinensis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 2550 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different harvesting stages, with KEGG-based enrichment analysis highlighting their involvement in amino acid-related activities like tyrosine metabolism and fatty acid degradation. The upregulation of these DEGs in amino acid-related pathways presents a promising target for studyingO. sinensisquality. Integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses indicated potential roles forDDC(G6O67_000335),TYR(G6O67_005660),AOC(G6O67_005457), andfahA(G6O67_004634) in the synthesis pathways of amino acids, peptides, and their analogs, suggesting a possible indirect association withO. sinensisquality. These findings offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the quality formation and metabolic evolution ofO. sinensis.

Ophiocordyceps sinensisis a rare medicinal and edible fungus, which is an excellent raw material for tonic food and Chinese medicinal materials [1]. Its first recorded mention in China was in the ‘YueWang Yaozhen’ in 710 A.D., which claimed that it had the effects of tonifying the kidneys and moistening the lungs [2]. In recent years, it has gained considerable popularity worldwide, with reports indicating that it may possess anti-aging and cardiopulmonary function-improving properties [3]. Several studies have demonstrated thatO. sinensispossesses pharmacological activities, including antitumor, antioxidant, and cardiopulmonary function regulation activities [4–6]. Modern pharmacological studies have identified numerous compounds with bioactive functions, including cordyceps polysaccharides, which are effective against hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, hypoglycemia, and anti-oxidative stress [7,8]. Endogenous sphingosine has been shown to reduce diseases caused by excessive immune responses by inducing the isolation of lymphocytes from primary and secondary lymph nodes [9,10]. It has been demonstrated that cordycepin, a nucleoside antibiotic that has been successfully clinically applied, is involved in antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor pharmacological processes [11,12]. These studies have demonstrated thatO. sinensisis an efficacious herbal medicine that was also utilized as a health food in 2013 [13,14]. The diverse array of metabolites and the high nutritional value ofO. sinensisoffer a promising avenue for the development ofO. sinensisas a functional food.

However, the composition of these metabolites is variable and influenced by a variety of factors, and there is a close relationship between these factors and the harvesting stage [15,16]. The content and diversity of these nutrients are important factors in determining the nutritional quality ofO. sinensisand are important indicators for studying their quality [17]. The appearance quality of theO. sinensis(individual length, individual weight, color, smell, etc.) is also an important trait that affects its exploitation and commercial value [18,19].O. sinensisharvested in early May each year was in the early stage of ascospore germination, with shorter light fellow individuals and poor commercial traits. TheO. sinensisstroma harvested in June was close to maturity, with longer overall lengths, bright yellow coloration, slightly fishy smells, and rounded stroma texture with the best appearance quality.O. sinensisharvested in mid-June, whose matured stroma had ejected ascospore spores, did not vary in length, was darker yellow in color, had heavier fishy smells, and the stroma became rough [20]. The study of the physiological and biochemical properties ofO. sinensisin different periods found that melanin was enriched in stroma and carotenoids were significantly enriched in sclerotia during the growth cycle ofO. sinensis[21]. It plays an important role in coping with environmental stresses, cellular oxidative damage, and UV-B radiation [22]. The mannitol content maintains a steady increase in stroma, decreases, and then increases, and the mannitol content in sclerotia is 10-fold higher than that in sclerotia at the stage of sclerotia germination [23]. Ergosterol, amino acids, and nucleosides vary with the growth cycle ofO. sinensisowing to their complex metabolic regulation in response to environmental stresses [24]. Up to 10-30-fold differences in antioxidant activities, such as inhibition of lipid peroxidation and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, were observed between naturalO. sinensis, artificialO. sinensis, and cultured mycelium [25]. Whereas the related reports on the odor and volatiles ofO. sinensisare rarely covered, volatile analysis based on the headspace extraction technique might be an important means to resolve the composition of the unique fishy odor ofO. sinensis[26]. These results suggest that nutrients inO. sinensisare handled in an accumulated state at the early stage of maturation, with the best cosmetic quality at mid-maturation and higher medicinal and edible values at the end of maturation [27]. This implies that earlier harvestedO. sinensishas higher commercial value, and later harvestedO. sinensisis suitable for industrial processing as a raw material in traditional Chinese medicine for the extraction of a variety of bioactive substances [28].

These studies have shown that the active ingredient composition and nutritional quality ofO. sinensischange with the harvest stage. However, it is a pity that the compound composition and metabolite accumulation mechanism ofO. sinensisin different harvest stages have not been disclosed, which inhibits the deep utilization of its medicinal value and health care function. China has the most abundant naturalO. sinensisin the world and is mainly distributed in high-altitude areas such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. TheO. sinensisin Zaduo County is geographically iconic in China. Therefore, this study takes it as the research object and selects the three harvest stages of theO. sinensis. The variation characteristics and accumulation trends of metabolites were investigated in detail by metabolomics combined with transcriptomics, and this change was explained from the perspective of transcriptomics, which provided a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular basis of the quality formation and metabolite evolution ofO. sinensis. At the same time, it also promotes its in-depth development as a functional food and provides good scientific guidance for consumers to provide health care.

The growth and development stage ofO. sinensishas been assessed in previous studies [29], indicating that the sclerotia takes approximately 20 days from germination to full maturity. In our laboratory, we defined the first day of sclerotia germination as D1, characterized by the emergence of black-brown mycelium. D2 represents the developmental stage of the sclerotia, occurring on the 10th day post-germination. Subsequently, D3 signifies the mature stage of the sclerotia, where the top of the sclerotia displays a dense punctate bulge due to ascospore germination and ejection [23,30]. May 1, 2024 - July 1, 2024, the research group purchased fresh naturalO. sinensissamples (just out of the soil) from the base of Baohuitang, Co., Ltd., (Xining city, Qinghai Province, China), which is located in Zaduo County (96°32′38′′E, 32°27′15′′N, Elevation: 4562 m), Yushu Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China (Fig.1). All samples were stored in the liquid nitrogen, and stored in the − 80 refrigerator in the laboratory for inspection. And use the GPS locator to determine the precise geographic information. About 100 samples were collected at each stage, and 10 were used as a repeat. The metabolome used 6 biological replicates, and the transcriptome used 3 biological replicates. Quality control (QC) samples, consisting of three equally mixed sample groups, were utilized to assess instrument stability prior to injection and throughout the UPLC-MS/MS analysis.

The methods of metabolite extraction and detection were primarily based on existing literature and modified from existing studies in the laboratory [31,32]. For each sample, 50 mg of stroma and sclerotia were collected in a 2 mL centrifuge tube and 6 mm diameter grinding beads were added. Metabolite extraction was conducted by adding 400 µL of L-2-chlorophenylalanine extract (methanol: acetonitrile: water = 2:2:1, V: V:V) containing 0.02 mg/mL to the centrifuge tube. The samples were cryomold at a temperature of −10 °C and a frequency of 50 Hz for a duration of 6 min. This was followed by low-temperature ultrasonic extraction at a temperature of 4 °C and a frequency of 40 kHz for a duration of 30 min. The samples were then allowed to stand for a period of 30 min at a temperature of −10 °C. They were then centrifuged at a temperature of 4 °C and a speed of 13,000×g for a duration of 15 min at a low temperature. The supernatant was then injected into the injection vial for detection.

The authors used an HSS T3 column (100 mm×2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 μm) in tandem with a Thermo Q Exactive Focus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) on a UHPLC-Q Exactive system to analyze all samples. The column temperature was set at 30 °C, the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, and the injection volume was 2uL. The samples were eluted and determined by mobile phases A (water + 25mM ammonium acetate + 25mM ammonia) and B (acetonitrile) as the NEG model, and mobile phases C (water + acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid 5%) and D (water containing 0.1% formic acid) as the POS model. The linear elution program was as follows, 0–0.5 min, 5%B/C; 0.5–6 min, 5-95%B/C; 6–7 min, 95%−40%B/C; and 7–8 min 5%B/C. The mass spectrometer was used in positive and negative ion scanning modes, with the relevant settings, such as, spray voltage of ± 5,500 V, sheath gas pressure of 40 psi, auxiliary heating gas of 10 psi, ion source heating temperature of 400 °C, Orbitrap analyzer scanning in the range of 70 − 1,050 m/z, MS1 resolution of 70,000 and MS2 resolution of 17,500.

The authors used Proteo Wizard MSConvert to convert the raw data into MzXML format, which was later imported into the XCMS program for baseline filtering, peak identification, integration, peak alignment and retention time correction. A data matrix of retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and peak intensity was obtained by discarding characteristic peaks with relative standard deviation (RSD) > 30% in the QC samples. The XCMS parameters were as follows, For peak picking, centWave m/z = 10ppm, peakwidth = c(1,060), prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5, mzwid = 0.025, minfrac = 0.5. MS and MS/MS mass spectrometry information was combined with metabolic public databases HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/compound/) and Metlin (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/compound/). MS and MSMS mass spectrometry information was matched with the metabolic public databases HMDB (https://metlin.scripps.edu/), KEGG (https://metlin.scripps.edu/) and Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/) as well as self-constructed libraries to obtain metabolite information. The obtained data were also checked for completeness by removing metabolites with missing values > 50%, removing extreme values, and null KNN (smallest value in the original matrix) filling. Finally, in order to reduce the errors caused by the sample preparation process and instrumentation, the response intensities of the sample mass spectrometry peaks were normalized by the total peak area and log10 logarithm zed to obtain the data matrix for subsequent analysis.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using the R package gmodels (v2.18.1). The ropls package (Version 1.6.2) in R language was utilized for performing principal component analysis and orthogonal partial square discriminant analysis on the preprocessed data matrix. The model’s stability was evaluated through 200 cycles of interaction verification and a visual heat map was generated. Significantly different cumulative metabolites were determined based on the variable importance in projection (VIP) values of the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model andpvalues obtained from student’s t test (VIP > 1 andp< 0.05). The R package heatmap (v1.0.12) was employed to standardize the data for cluster analysis and visualize the heat map, providing an intuitive representation of metabolite expression patterns across all samples. The cor() function in R was used to calculate correlation coefficients, and corrplot was used for plotting. DAMs were mapped to each term of the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/), and the number of genes for each term was calculated to obtain a list of genes with a GO function and the number of genes. Based on the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html), DAMs were mapped to metabolic pathways, and classified and enriched according to the pathways or functions it involved, and the most relevant biological pathways were obtained by Fisher’s exact test.

The samples were stored in dry ice and mailed to Shanghai Meiji Biomedical Technology Co. Ltd. for transcriptome sequencing based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology of Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform. Total RNA was extracted from each sample using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) gel electrophoresis was used to evaluate RNA integrity, and a NanoDrop NC2000 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Beijing, China) were used to measure RNA concentration and quality. High-quality RNA samples (OD260/280 = 1.8–2.2, OD260/230 ≥ 2.0, RQN ≥ 6.5, 28S:18S ≥ 1.0, > 1ug) were selected for constructing sequencing libraries. RNA purification, reverse transcription, library construction, and sequencing were performed at Majorbio bio-pharma Biotechnology Ltd (Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Poly(A) mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly- T oligo-attached magnetic beads, and it was fragmented into short fragments of 300 bp by adding fragmentation buffer. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using Super Script Double-stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, CA) and random hexamer primers (Illumina). Finally, End Repair Mix was added to the synthesized cDNA for end repair, phosphorylation and ‘A base’ addition. The cDNA target fragment of 300 bp library was selected on 2% Low Range Ultra agarose, and then 15 PCR cycles were amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB). After quantification by Qubit 4.0, paired-end RNA-seq sequencing libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq X Plus sequencer (2 × 150 bp reads). Three biological replicates were set up for each group for transcriptome analysis.

To obtain high quality sequences, connectors and low quality reads were filtered using Cuta dapt (version 1.15). The relevant parameters were as follows, reads containing adapters were removed, reads with an average quality score of < 20 were removed, and clean reads were used to calculate the GC content, Q20 and Q30 were used for quality control. Finally, HISAT2 version 2.0.5 was used to compare the clean reads with the reference genomeOphiocordyceps sinensis(GenBank: GCA 012934285.1). We used DESeq2 (v1.34.0) software to process the raw data. Count features (v2.0.3) were used to calculate the gene expression, which was expressed as the number of fragments per million bases (FPKM), which was calculated by formula 1 [33]. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by FDR < 0.05 and |Log2(fold change)| > 1. GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs were performed by Gotools (v1.24) and Python scipy software (v3.8.10), respectively, with Bonferroni-correctedp< 0.05 as the standard.

The mapped fragments of transcripts represent the number of fragments aligned to a transcript, i.e., the number of double-ended reads; total count of mapped fragments (millions) represents the total number of fragments aligned to the transcript, in units of 106; length of transcript (kb) was 103bases.

To verify the reliability of RNA-seq data, a total of 29 DEGs were selected from cysteine and methionine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism for qRT-PCR analysis. The 18 S ribosomal RNA gene was used as an internal control gene [34]. Total RNA was extracted with total RNA kit I (Omega Biotek), and then treated with DNaseI (Omega Biotek) to remove trace genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was performed using the RevertAid first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (thermo scientific) according to the manufacturer ‘s protocol. Primer Premier 5 was used to design specific primers for RT-qPCR analysis, and the sequence information was listed in Table S1. The thermal cycle conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of 95 °C 10 min, 95 °C 10 s and 60 °C 40 s, and three biological replicates were set for each DEGs. The relative expression of genes was calculated based on the 2−ΔΔCtmethod [35]. All data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corp., New York, USA), and the gene expression levels between the two groups were compared using an independent sample student’s t test and Person analysis. The significant level of difference was set top< 0.05, and the closer the correlation coefficient R was to 1, the stronger the correlation was. All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

QC samples were obtained by combining the three groups ofO. sinensissamples to investigate the reproducibility and accuracy of the UPLC-MS/MS method. The results revealed that the retention times and peak intensities of the full chromatograms of the three groups of samples had good overlap (Fig. S1A and S1B), and the relative standard deviations (RSD, %) of POS and NEG were < 30% (Fig. S1C and S1D), which demonstrated that the experimental methodology and assayed data were stable and highly reliable. After removing the poorly reproducible peaks, 6357 ion features (POS: 3591, NEG: 2766) were obtained from all samples (Table S2). Based on self-constructed and public databases, 1,129 metabolites were identified (POS: 683, NEG: 446) (Table S3). They were annotated into 19 categories, including carboxylic acid derivatives (n= 278, 26.65%), fattyacyls (n= 143, 13.71%), organooxygen compounds (n= 96, 9.20%), prenollipids (n= 46, 4.41%), benzeneandsubstituted derivatives (n= 44, 4.22%), steroidsandsteroidderivatives (n= 44, 4.22%), glycerophospholipids (n= 25, 2.40%), and indole derivatives (n= 25, 2.40%). Indoles and derivatives (n= 24, 2.30%), organonitrogen compounds (n= 20, 1.92%), phenols (n= 17, 1.63%), purine nucleosides (n= 17, 1.63%), diazines (n= 16, 1.53%), imidazopyridine (n= 16, 1.53%), ketoacid derivatives (n= 12, 1.15%), pyridines and derivatives (n= 12, 1.15%), glycerolipids (n= 10, 0.96%), cinnamic acid derivatives (n= 8, 0.77%), phenylpropanoid acids (n= 8, 0.77%), pyrrolidines (n= 7, 0.67%), and others (n= 200, 19.18%) (Table S4). The metabolite dataset obtained was analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to characterizeO. sinensismetabolites at various harvesting stages. PCA revealed distinct groupings of samples into three clusters, with a significant separation between them (Fig.2A). The aggregation of replicate samples within each group was strong, indicating substantial metabolite variations between groups and high similarity within groups. Subsequently, OPLS-DA model was employed to validate the PCA results, yielding an OPLS-DA model score of 71.60% (Fig. S2A). Model validation through 200 replicates demonstrated high values of R2= 0.993 and Q2= 0.978 (Fig. S2B). Pairwise sample comparisons (D1 vs. D2, D3 vs. D2, and D3 vs. D1) consistently showed smaller Q2values compared to R2values, suggesting a well-fitted model that was not overfitted and possessed good interpretability and predictability (Fig. S2C- S2H) (Table S5).

To gain insight into the changing characteristics ofO. sinensismetabolites in different harvesting stages, based on the score of each metabolite in the OPLS-DA model, the variable importance in projection (VIP) value was calculated, and VIP ≥ 1 andp< 0.05 was used to screen DAMs, and a total of 596 DAMs were screened (Table S6, Fig. S3A). The distribution of these DAMs was as follows (Fig.2B), with a total of 419 DAMs (up accumulation: 224; down accumulation: 195) in D1 vs. D2 comparison, in which the majority of organic acids and derivatives (69.18%) were up accumulated, while the majority of the lipids and lipid-like molecules (64.71%), organoheterocyclic compounds (61.11%), and benzenoids (62.50%) were down accumulated. In D2 vs. D3 comparison, there were 446 DAMs (up accumulation: 249; down accumulation: 197), of which most of the lipids and lipid-like molecules (77.27%) and benzenoids (71.43%) were up accumulated, while most of the organic acids and derivatives (61.79%) were downregulated. In D1 vs. D3 comparison, there were 438 DAMs (up accumulation: 292; down accumulation: 146), of which the majority of organic acids and derivatives (69.93%), lipids and lipid-like molecules (73.03%), and organoheterocyclic compounds (65.45%) were up accumulated, whereas most nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogs (53.33%) were down accumulated (Table S7). A total of 157 DAMs were shared in three pairwise comparisons, and 60, 49, and 21 unique DAMs were found in D1 vs. D2, D2 vs. D3, and D1 vs. D3, respectively (Fig.2C). These results indicated that DAMs inO. sinensishad different accumulation patterns at different harvesting stages, and they were mainly fatty acids and conjugates (superclass: 29.43–37.73%), carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates (subclass: 25.11–33.65%), amino acids, peptides, and analogs (subclass: 39.15–50.68%) (Fig. S3B-S3D). In contrast, most of the organic acids and derivatives were up accumulated in D1 vs. D2 and D1 vs. D3, suggesting that the up accumulated of organic acids and derivatives may have contributed to the abundance of amino acids, peptides, analogs, fatty acids, and conjugates acids and conjugates, ultimately leading to changes in the quality ofO. sinensis.

Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of the core DAMs with the top 100 VIP values was performed to determine the accumulation patterns of DAMs at different harvesting stages (Table S8). In D1, the metabolites of clusters 1 and clusters 3 showed an upward trend, and the metabolites of cluster 4 showed a downward trend. In D2, the metabolites of cluster 4 showed an upward cumulative trend, and the metabolites of clusters 1 and clusters 2 showed a downward cumulative trend. In D3, the metabolites of cluster 2 showed an upward trend, and the metabolites of cluster 3 showed a downward trend (Fig.3B). This implies that the metabolite composition and content ofO. sinensischanged significantly during the delayed harvesting stages. Prolyl-arginine, γ-glutamyl proline decreased and then increased (subclasses 3, 4, and 5), and 15 metabolites (e.g., d-sorbitol, histidyl leucine, and glycyl-leucine) increased and then decreased (subclasses 6, 7, and 9) (Table S9).

The DAMs identified by KEGG were associated with 74 metabolic pathways across the three comparison groups (Table S10). They shared 8 metabolic pathways, among which 5 showed significant differences (p< 0.05), including arginine and proline metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, galactose metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism (Fig.2D and F). Across the three harvest stages, starting from D1, DAMs involved in tyrosine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism exhibited up-regulated expression levels, while DAMs in galactose metabolism showed down-regulation in expression. Furthermore, DAMs in arginine and proline metabolism initially displayed down-regulation followed by up-regulation in expression. These pathways primarily relate to the metabolism of amino acid peptides and their analogs, implying that the metabolic intensity and composition of secondary metabolites produced by organic acids and derivatives in these pathways are key factors influencing the quality ofO. sinensisat different harvesting stages, with amino acids, peptides, and analogs playing a prominent role.

Using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencing platform, nine cDNA libraries were constructed from samples D1, D2, and D3. Each sample yielded clean data exceeding 7.52 Gb with a Q30 base percentage of over 93.23%, resulting in a total accumulation of 77.47 Gb of clean data. Sequence alignment against the reference genome showed a successful mapping rate of 95.52–96.63% (Table S11). A total of 9357 expressed genes were identified, comprising 8100 known genes and 1257 new genes. These genes were annotated in various databases: GO (6186 genes, 76.37%), KEGG (3702 genes, 45.70%), EggNOG (7196 genes, 88.84%), NR (8093 genes, 99.91%), Swiss-Prot (5426 genes, 66.99%), and Pfam (6046 genes, 74.64%) (Fig.4A). PCA revealed that PC1 accounted for 72.24% and PC2 for 11.75% of the variance, demonstrating distinct distribution among the sample groups (Fig.4B). Furthermore, Pearson correlation indicated that biological replicates within each group exhibited close clustering and high correlation (R> 0.95), confirming the robust repeatability of the transcriptome data (Fig.4C). A total of 2026 DEGs were identified in the comparison between D2 and D3, with 1060 upregulated and 966 downregulated genes. The number of DEGs in the D1 vs. D3 and D2 vs. D3 comparisons was notably similar (Fig.4D). Additionally, D1 vs. D2 displayed 61 unique DEGs, D2 vs. D3 had 408 unique DEGs, and there were 98 DEGs shared between the two comparison groups (Fig.4E). Among them,ATM1(G6O67_001160),G6O67_004546,kyn-1(G6O67_007658) andAt3g51130(G6O67_008513) were significantly up-regulated, andG6O67_000875,G6O67_002184,G6O67_002754andatrR(G6O67_007965) were significantly down-regulated (p< 0.05).

Based on the obtained transcriptome data, the core DEGs were screened by⎟Log2FPKM⎜ ≥ 2 andp-adjust (correctedpvalue) < 0.05, we obtained a total of 2,550 DEGs in the 3 groups of samples. A total of 351 DEGs were obtained in D1 vs. D2 (upregulated: 198, downregulated: 153). A total of 1083 DEGs were identified in D1 vs. D3 (upregulated: 112, downregulated: 971). To clearly understand the expression patterns of 2550 DEGs in different harvest stages, K-means clustering was performed on them. According to their expression patterns, they can be divided into 5 subcategories, 1190 DEGs in subcluster 2 (n= 51) and subcluster 5 (n= 1139) were up-regulated, and 1251 DEGs in subcluster 1 (n= 1244) and subcluster 4 (n= 7) were down-regulated. 102 DEGs in subcluster 6 were down-regulated first and then up-regulated (Fig.4F). These DEGs were significantly differentially expressed during different harvest stages, indicating that they may be related genes that regulate the metabolic changes ofO. sinensisduring the harvest period and indirectly regulate the quality formation ofO. sinensis.

In the GO enrichment analysis of the three comparison pairs, 24, 32, and 33 GO terms were annotated, respectively. The top 20 GO terms enriched by these DEGs were categorized into biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) (Fig.4G). Within BP, the majority of DEGs were associated with metabolic process (n= 758) and cellular process (n= 706). For CC, membrane part (n= 695) and cell part (n= 610) were the predominant terms. In terms of MF, catalytic activity (n= 1005) was the most significantly enriched by DEGs. Importantly, the GO terms that were significantly enriched in each category were shared by all three comparison groups (Fig. S4A-S4C). KEGG enrichment analysis based on DEGs revealed that the three comparison groups shared pathways such as RNA degradation, fatty acid degradation, and tyrosine metabolism, with most DEGs being up-regulated. This suggests that the up-regulated expression of genes related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism was a key factor influencing the quality changes ofO. sinensisat different harvest stages. Seven pathways were shared between D2 vs. D3 and D1 vs. D3, with the DEGs being up-regulated in pathways such as vitamin B6 metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, starch and sucrose metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism (Fig. S4D-S4F). This suggests that the up-regulated expression of these DEGs at different harvest stages leads to the heterogeneous accumulation of amino acids such as cysteine, valine, leucine, and carbohydrates such as fructose, mannose, starch, and sucrose, which is a significant factor in the quality formation ofO. sinensisat different harvest stages. These pathways also present potential targets for further study on the quality formation ofO. sinensisat different harvest stages (Fig.4H).

Twenty-nine DEGs were selected to evaluate the accuracy of transcriptome data by qRT-PCR. Among them, 10 DEGs (eca39,G6O67_006580;gCLM,G6O67_003678;sER1,G6O67_003034;ilvE,G6O67_000530;poxL,G6O67_005538;bAT2,G6O67_007558;yKL069W,G6O67_004398;aN2882,G6O67_008885;dNMT,G6O67_004967andmet26,G6O67_005821) are annotated to cysteine and methionine metabolism. 8 DEGs (hmgA,G6O67_001889;ustQ,G6O67_003346;rhmA,G6O67_002453;tyrP,G6O67_008019;DDC,G6O67_000335;pPO1,G6O67_005660;b23G1.170,G6O67_005906and fahA,G6O67_ 004634) were annotated to tyrosine metabolism. 3 DEGs (cta1,G6O67_007307;bna1,G6O67_007095andechs1,G6O67_00686868) are annotated to tryptophan metabolism. 5 DEGs (HK,G6O67_008151;hxkA,G6O67_008150;gAL1,G6O67_006337;pgmA,G6O67_007036andGAL10,G6O67_004854) are annotated to galactose metabolism. 3 DEGs (otaA,G6O67_008846;sPCC70.03c,G6O67_007651andGOT1,G6O67_000726) was annotated to arginine and proline metabolism. Relative expression profile analysis revealed that 2 differentially expressed genes (fahAandGOT1) exhibited an upward trend in genes associated with amino acid synthesis and metabolism, while 2 other DEGs (TYRandhmgA) displayed a downward trend. Among the 29 DEGs analyzed, their expression patterns were consistent between qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq (Fig.5), showing a strong correlation (meanR> 0.826). These findings suggest that the transcriptome data obtained were reliable and accurate.

To investigate the association between DEGs and DAMs in various harvest stages ofO. sinensis, an integrated analysis was conducted. A correlation matrix was constructed for the top 200 DEGs and the top 100 DAMs, and those with a strong significant correlation (Table S12) withR> 0.8 andP< 0.5 were chosen. The findings revealed a significant positive or negative correlation between most DEGs and DAMs, suggesting a distinct co-expression pattern. For instance, the levels of 2-Aminoadipic acid, ll-2,6-diaminopimelic acid, and meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate in amino acid metabolism were linked to the expression oflys-4(G6O67_001051),fahA(G6O67_004634),B23G1.170(G6O67_005906), andTYR(G6O67_005660). Similarly, the levels of 2-isopropylmalic acid, sucrose, and glucose 1-phosphate in carbohydrate metabolism were associated with the expression ofcel3B(G6O67 002355),TR07(G6O67 005479), andlad1(G6O67 008451). Moreover, the contents of homomethionine, l-dopa, crocin, and 3”-diamino-3”-oxonicotianamineme in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites were correlated with the expression ofcel3B(G6O67_002355) andbglF(G6O67_00681) (Fig. S5).

To identify the common enrichment pathways among the three comparison groups in transcriptome and metabolism, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) were mapped to the KEGG database (Fig.6A and C). The analysis revealed enrichment in 108 pathways, with only tyrosine metabolism (map00350) being significantly enriched in both DEGs and DAMs. Notably, tryptophan metabolism (map00380) was not significantly enriched in the transcriptome of D1 vs. D2 alone (Fig.6D). Other highly enriched pathways included starch and sucrose metabolism (map00500), biosynthesis of cofactors (map01240), lysine degradation (map00310), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (map01040), and nucleotide metabolism (map01232). These pathways present potential targets for investigating the quality formation ofO. sinensisat different harvest stages.

Tyrosine, l-tyroxine, and l-dopa are key active components ofO. sinensis, playing a crucial role in the tyrosine metabolism pathway. These compounds can be synthesized independently in microorganisms as semi-essential amino acids. Additionally, serving as precursors to various proteins, dopamine, adrenaline, and other hormones, they are classified as nutritionally essential amino acids and are considered potential markers for quality control and evaluation ofO. sinensis. In this study, a wide array of amino acids, peptides, and analogues were detected inO. sinensisat different harvest times. Among them, the levels of tryptophan, l-histidine, glycyl-leucine, and prolyl-arginine varied significantly across the three groups (Table S9). To investigate the impact of tyrosine metabolism on the quality ofO. sinensisat different harvest stages, 6 DAMs and 11 DEGs were identified. The reaction process in the KEGG pathway map00350 (Fig. S6) was analyzed based on their expression levels, leading to the construction of a new reaction process (Fig.7B).

The DAMs and DEGs were obtained from samples harvested at various time points, exhibiting either similar or contrasting expression patterns (Fig.4F). Correlation analysis revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation (R> 0.8,p< 0.05) between six DAMs and DEGs (Table S12). Notably,ALDH(G6O67_002860),TPO(G6O67_006144),tyrP(G6O67_008019),ustQ(G6O67_003346),GOT1(G6O67_000726), andhmgA(G6O67_001889) displayed down-regulation across all three harvest stages and exhibited significant positive correlations with leucodopaquinone and 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate, demonstrating similar expression patterns. Conversely,DDC(G6O67_000335),TYR(G6O67_005660),AOC(G6O67_005457),fahA(G6O67_004634), andB23G1.170(G6O67_005906) were up-regulated in all three harvest stages and showed significant negative correlations with 4-hydroxyphenglacetylgcine and 4-hydroxy-phenylacetate. Dopaquinone exhibited a significant positive correlation with these five DEGs (Fig.7A). These findings suggest a close relationship between the composition and quantity of amino acids, peptides, and analogs involved in tyrosine metabolism and the expression of DEGs.

In the post-epidemic era, consumers are increasingly health-conscious and prioritize their physical well-being and daily healthcare. This trend has led to a growing appreciation forO. sinensisamong dietitians and healthcare professionals, as it is known to be rich in various bioactive substances [36]. The relationship between maturity and compound composition and quality ofO. sinensisduring its maturation process remains largely unexplored, posing a significant obstacle to fully realizing its food and medicinal benefits. Therefore, investigating the quality variations ofO. sinensisat different harvesting stages is essential for providing a scientific foundation for consumers’ healthcare decisions and gaining a deeper understanding of its compound composition. In the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China 2020, the recommended standard for quality control ofO. sinensisis an adenosine content of ≥ 0.01% [37]. Recent studies have shown thatO. sinensiscontains a diverse range of compounds, including amino acids, peptides, nucleotides, alkaloids, carbohydrates, peptides, and steroids, each with distinct health and pharmacological functions [38]. These metabolites were also detected in our study, consistent with previous research findings (Table S4). Analysis using PCA, OPLS-DA, HCA, and K-means clustering revealed significant differences in metabolite accumulation patterns at different harvest stages ofO. sinensis. A total of 419, 446, and 438 DAMs were found in D1 vs. D2, D2 vs. D3, and D1 vs. D3 comparisons, with 157 DAMs shared across these comparisons, involving acids, peptides, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Notably, the diversity and abundance of acids, peptides, and analogs at different harvest stages were identified as key factors influencing the quality ofO. sinensis.

Nutrition is a key factor in determining disease and aging, playing a crucial role in maintaining the dynamic balance within organisms. The significance of proteins and amino acids, particularly functional amino acids, is increasingly being recognized [39]. Acids, peptides, and analogues serve as the building blocks for protein synthesis and other bioactive compounds, playing a vital role in the treatment of specific diseases [40]. Cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline (CHP), derived from proline, was clinically assessed as a novel anticancer medication in 2008, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing liver damage in patients with bladder and prostate cancer [41]. L-proline enhances sperm motility and chromosome quality by boosting reactive oxygen species scavenging and antioxidant capacity, facilitating malondialdehyde breakdown, and improving sperm motility [41]. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid for humans, must be obtained through diet. It serves as a precursor for NAD/NADP(H), melatonin, and coenzymes, aiding in the maintenance of T lymphocyte balance and immune function [42]. This study found that the contents of proline and tryptophan in the D1 group were significantly increased, suggesting that the enrichment of these specific metabolites in the pre-harvest ofO. sinensismay be related to its potential as an antioxidant and immunomodulatory functional raw material [43]. Particularly, this is worthy of further functional verification in the field of male health care. Arginine, known to counteract the syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reducing vascular permeability and vasodilation, promoting platelet function and coagulation function [44], was found to be abundant. Mouse experiments have validated its positive effects on keratin formation, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation at wound sites, ultimately promoting wound healing [45]. Furthermore, glutamic acid has been identified to contain β-sheet peptides with potent self-healing properties. The hybrid hydrogel created through the polymerization of β-sheet peptides holds promise as a future platform for tissue engineering scaffolds and biomedical applications [46]. D2, on the other hand, displayed the highest levels of arginine and glutamic acid, suggesting that matureO. sinensispossesses broad medicinal potential. L-histidine has been shown to bind to the degradation products of poly (dl-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) in an acidic environment, enhancing GAG-binding enhanced transduction peptide transduction activity, improving protein delivery, and stimulating cell growth [47]. Isoleucine is known to enhance the affinity and transport activity of NaDC1 transporters on the apical membrane of renal proximal tubules and small intestinal cells [48]. D3, rich in l-histidine and isoleucine, is considered an excellent protein supplement [49]. These studies have demonstrated that the amino acid content and species ofO. sinensisvary significantly across different harvest stages, leading to diverse pharmacological and healthcare applications. This research has unveiled the nutritional composition and molecular regulation mechanism ofO. sinensisat a specific harvest stage, offering a scientific foundation for the guidance of nutritionists and pharmacists.

The composition and types of amino acids varied with the developmental stages. Amino acid content ranged from 39.15 to 50.68% (Fig. S3D), with L-proline, tryptophan, arginine, glutamic acid, l-histidine, serine, and aspartic acid identified as the main components. This study reported higher amino acid content compared to previous findings forO. sinensis(24.8–37.2%) [50], possibly influenced by environmental factors or the origin ofO. sinensis. Recent research utilizing full-length transcriptome sequencing across different developmental stages ofO. sinensishighlighted the regulatory role of microRNAs in gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, identifying 19 miRNAs associated with fruiting body development and metabolite biosynthesis [30]. A comparative analysis ofO. sinensismetabolites in four Chinese provinces revealed richer amino acid composition in Qinghai Province and Tibet Autonomous Region [51]. Comparative proteomics and metabolomics quantitative analysis indicated significant differences in lysine, threonine, serine, and arginine between naturally grown and cultivatedO. sinensis, indirectly influencing its nutritional and medicinal properties [52]. Various studies have highlighted the diverse correlations between different metabolites ofO. sinensisand various environmental factors. For instance, amino acids, peptides, and analogs have been found to have positive associations with the average temperature of the warmest season, as well as with the average temperature and annual precipitation [53]. Transcriptome analysis ofO. sinensisdevelopment has revealed that temperature stress triggers heightened expression of two key environmental sensing factors: the pheromone receptor gene (OSIN6252) and the amino acid sensing gene (OSIN6398). This, in turn, promotes the up-regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, leading to increased accumulation of amino acids in fruiting bodies and sclerotia [54]. Studies have also shown that histidine and proline levels tend to rise under high-temperature stress conditions [55], while high solar radiation can inhibit their accumulation due to their consumption in various stress resistance processes such as antioxidant and pigment accumulation [56,57]. These findings underscore the variability in amino acid content across different growth environments andO. sinensismaterials, highlighting their distinct medicinal value and nutritional quality.

Enrichment analysis of DAMs and DEGs showed that tyrosine metabolism was significantly enriched in the three harvest stages (Fig.6D). In vivo, tyrosine produces several important metabolites in multiple metabolic steps, which are catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (TPO) to form L-tyrosin [58]. Tyrosine is catalyzed by L-amino-acid oxidase (IL4I1) and 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate (PDS1) to form 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate [59,60]. Tyrosine first forms tyramine in aromatic-L-amino-acid/L-tryptophan decarboxylase (DDC) [61]. Then 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde was formed under the catalysis of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and primary-amine oxidase (AOC3) [62,63]. Or 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde was formed under the catalysis of 4-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde synthase (TYRDC-2) [64]. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+) (ALDH3) and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (feaB and tynC) co-catalyzed the formation of 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde to 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate [65]. Or 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate was synthesized under the catalysis of 4-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (TYRDC-2) and 4-HPAL dehydrogenase [66]. The 4-Hydroxyphenylacetate: CoA ligase then catalyzes the formation of 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate to 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetyl-CoA. Step 1 is then followed by the formation of L-glutamine-N-acetyltransferase, glutamine phenylacetyltransferase, and L-glutamine-N-acetyltransferase, phenylacetyltransferase, glutamine phenylacetyltransferase, phenylacetyl-CoA, and L-glutamine-N-acetyltransferase catalyzing the formation of 4-Hydroxyphengl-acetylglutamic acid. Step 2 is the substitution with glycine to form 4-Hydroxyphengl-acetylene. Polyphenol oxidase (BMI1), tyrosinase (TYR) [67,68], tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (TH) [69], and L-tyrosine peroxygenase (lmbB2) together in tyrosine can form L-DOPA [70], which is catalyzed by tyrosinase and polyphenol oxidase to form dopaquinone and leucodopaquinone. It is worth noting that pheomelanin and eumelanin are the final products of this process, and the unbalanced accumulation in the fruiting body and sclerotium is one of the reasons why the fruiting body is black [42]. In this study, the down-regulation ofALDHandTPOwas significantly positively correlated with the down-regulation of leucodopaquinone and 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate. Based on this, the authors speculate that the down-regulation of these two groups may inhibit the synthesis of leucodopaquinone and dopaquinone [58]. The up-regulation ofDDC,TYCandAOCwas significantly positively correlated with the up-regulation of 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate, respectively. Therefore, the authors speculated that the expression of these two genes may promote the synthesis of 4-Hydroxy-phenylacetate [61,63].

Tyrosine metabolism is intricately linked to various amino acid-related metabolic pathways, including isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism (Fig. S6). Within these pathways, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis contribute to the export of tyrosine, while 4-Hydroxyphenylacetate and 3-Hydroxyphenylacetate from phenylalanine metabolism feed into tyrosine metabolism to enhance tyrosine levels. Tyramine is channeled into phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, dopamine is directed towards isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, pyruvate is utilized in pyruvate metabolism, and fumarate enters the citrate cycle to facilitate tyrosine utilization, consequently leading to a reduction in its concentration. These interconnected metabolic pathways present crucial targets for investigating the quality formation ofO. sinensis.

In this research, the quality formation mechanism ofO. sinensisat various harvest stages was investigated using a combination of metabolomics and transcriptomics. The findings revealed significant variations in metabolic profiles and gene expression patterns ofO. sinensisat different harvest stages. Across the three harvest periods, a total of 419 (D1 vs. D2), 446 (D2 vs. D3), and 438 (D1 vs. D3) DAMs were identified. The classification of these DAMs, K-means clustering analysis, and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the up-regulation of organic acids and derivatives in multiple amino acid metabolic pathways, such as tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism, led to the production of amino acids, peptides, and analogues. Carbohydrates, carbohydrate conjugates, and fatty acids exhibited varying contents and diversity at different harvest stages, contributing to the quality differences observed inO. sinensis. Furthermore, 11 genes associated with tyrosine metabolism were annotated. The levels and types of amino acids present in different harvest periods were potentially influenced by the increased expression ofDDC,TYR,AOC, andfahA. These results offer a theoretical foundation for comprehending the molecular mechanisms underlying quality formation and metabolic spectrum evolution inO. sinensis.
