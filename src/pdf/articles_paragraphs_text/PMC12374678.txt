The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) has been reported as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease risks and clinical outcomes. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the AIP and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Data were collected from consecutive patients with STEMI who received PCI at Fuyang People’s Hospital from January 2023 to March 2024.

A total of 334 patients with STEMI who underwent PCI. The adjusted AIP (aAIP) was calculated using the following formula: aAIP=log ((triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol × 100). The patient population was divided into four groups based on the aAIP quartiles.

The primary outcome was MACEs, and the secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission as individual endpoints.

Among 334 eligible patients, 68 (20.36%) experienced MACEs during a median follow-up of 8.70 months. After adjusting for confounders, continuous aAIP was positively correlated with MACEs in all three models. Patients in Q3 and Q4 had significantly higher MACE risks than Q1 (p<0.001 for each model), but no difference was observed between Q1 and Q2 (p>0.05 for each model). Compared with Q1, Q4 had significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (Model 2: HR=12.72, 95% CI 1.39 to 76.44 and Model 3: HR=16.18, 95% CI 1.66 to 117.50). All-cause readmission risk was also higher in Q3 and Q4 (Model 3: Q3: HR=2.242, 95% CI 1.043 to 4.818, p=0.039 and Q4: HR=5.378, 95% CI 2.557 to 11.314, p<0.001). Kaplan–Meier curves showed that higher aAIP was associated with increased risks of MACEs, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission (all log-rank p<0.0001), but not all-cause mortality (log-rank p=0.1534). No significant interactions between subgroups and the aAIP were observed (p>0.05 for interaction).

Higher aAIP was significantly associated with increased risks of MACEs, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission.

The adjusted atherogenic index of plasma (aAIP) was used instead of atherogenic index of plasma to avoid negative values and ensure a normal distribution.

Potential confounders were adjusted in multivariable Cox regression models to enhance the robustness of the association.

Key lipid parameters required for aAIP calculation were available for all enrolled patients, minimising missing data bias.

The parameters used to calculate aAIP were collected during the hospital stay, and changes in aAIP were not monitored during follow-up.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a severe type of heart attack that occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures, causing a sudden decrease in blood flow to the heart. This condition leads to the high rates of disability and mortality. Over the past two decades, reperfusion therapies, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), thrombolytic therapy and coronary artery bypass grafting, have greatly improved the survival rate of patients with STEMI.1 2Although these interventions greatly reduce the rates of death and complications, a subset of patients remains at risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) post-PCI, including recurrent infarction, repeat revascularisation and cardiac death.3A meta-analysis of ten randomised trials reported the MACE rates of 10.4% (single-vessel disease) and 16.6% (multivessel disease) in patients with STEMI.4Similarly, a multicentre retrospective cohort study found no significant reduction in 3-year all-cause mortality (15.7% vs 15.5%; HR=0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03, p=0.14) between 2005 and 2007 and 2011 and 2012.5The China PEACE study also noted stable in-hospital mortality from 2001 to 2011 (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12, p for trend=0.06).6These findings highlight the unmet need for early risk stratification tools to identify patients with high-risk STEMI post-PCI.

Several prognostic indices have been proposed for MACE prediction in STEMI, such as the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), triglyceride-glucose index (TyG),7glycaemic dispersion index,8motion score index9and haemoglobin (HGB), albumin, lymphocyte and platelet score index.10Among those, the AIP, a logarithmically transformed ratio of triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), has emerged as a promising biomarker for lipid metabolism dysregulation and coronary artery disease (CAD) severity.11A meta-analysis linked elevated AIP to a 63% higher MACE risk in patients with CAD (Risk Ratio (RR)=1.63, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.85, p<0.001).12Furthermore, the AIP’s prognostic value extends to metabolic syndrome,13non-diabetic CAD,14type 2 diabetes,15hypertension16and the general population,17with higher AIP levels predicting stroke, myocardial infarction and MACEs. However, few studies have examined the relationship between AIP levels and MACEs in patients with STEMI postdischarge.

This study aimed to explore the association between AIP and MACEs following PCI in patients with STEMI, with all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission as secondary endpoints. To mitigate negative values and normalise the distribution, we used an adjusted AIP (aAIP). By elucidating this association, our findings may enhance post-PCI risk stratification and improve cardiovascular outcomes in STEMI.

This study was a prospective observational study. Patients with STEMI who underwent PCI at Fuyang People’s Hospital were enrolled from January 2023 to March 2024. The permission to conduct the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fuyang People’s Hospital (No. 202311).

Patients were included based on the following criteria: (1) patients with STEMI underwent PCI and (2) age≥18 years. Patients were excluded as following criteria: (1) patients with blood diseases or malignant tumours; (2) patients with unmeasured TG or HDL-C; (3) patients who had previously undergone coronary stenting; (4) patients with severe lipid profile metabolic dysfunction,14indicated by serum bilirubin levels of 5 mg/dL (85 µmol/L) or higher, an international normalised ratio of 1.5 or greater, with prothrombin activity below 40%, or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; (5) patients who did not undergo PCI during hospitalisation or (6) patients with incomplete follow-up.

The sample size was calculated using PASS software (V.15.0). Based on the previously reported 1-year MACE rates (overall 9.7%, with AIP quartile groups at 6.3%, 9.9%, 10.3%, and 12.4%, respectively),18with a two-sided α=0.05, 80% power and accounting for a 5% loss to follow-up, the calculated minimum required sample size was 335 patients.

Trained researchers collected clinical data using a standardised questionnaire to ensure consistency. Researchers recorded the patients' demographic characteristics and underlying diseases, which included sex, age, height, weight, smoking status, alcohol consumption, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and stroke. Venous blood samples were collected on the second day of hospital admission after an overnight fast. The following biological markers were measured: total cholesterol (TC), TG, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-C, fasting blood glucose, B-type natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase, creatine kinase myocardial band, cardiac troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and serum creatinine levels. The platelet count and HGB level from routine blood tests, along with the left ventricular ejection fraction from echocardiography, were also recorded. The medications administered at discharge were documented, including lipid-lowering agents (such as statins), antiplatelet agents (such as aspirin, clopidogrel and ticagrelor), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and beta-blockers. Comorbidities in this study were defined via International Classification of Diseases (ICD)−10 codes. The ICD-10 codes I10.0, E11.9 and I63 correspond to hypertension, diabetes mellitus and stroke, respectively. Current smoking was defined as smoking one cigarette per day for at least 6 months, whereas current drinking was defined as consuming alcohol at least one time a week for the same duration. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Creatinine clearance (Ccr) was used to estimate the GFR. Ccr was calculated according to the Cockcroft–Gault formulaCcr=(140−age)×bodyweight(kg)serumcreatine(mgdl)×72(×0.85forfemales).

The AIP was calculated using the formula AIP=log (TG/HDL-C).19To avoid negative values and ensure a normal distribution, we adjusted the AIP (aAIP) by multiplying the TG/HDL-C ratio by 100 before taking the logarithm, resulting in the formula: aAIP=log ((TG/HDL-C) ×100). Based on the calculated aAIP values, the patients were divided into four quartile groups: Q1 (aAIP<1.97), Q2 (1.97≤aAIP<2.18), Q3 (2.18≤aAIP<2.42) and Q4 (aAIP≥2.42).

Follow-up for the study was conducted through telephone calls or electronic medical records every 3 months. Relevant medical information was collected during each follow-up. The primary outcome of the study was the occurrence of MACEs. The secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission as individual endpoints. MACEs were defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, target vessel revascularisation, all-cause death and unplanned readmission for cardiac causes. Non-fatal myocardial infarction was defined as type I myocardial infarction occurring after PCI. Target vessel revascularisation was defined as angina or ischaemia related to the target vessel necessitating repeat PCI or coronary artery bypass graft. All-cause mortality was defined as death from any cause occurring after the index STEMI discharge. All-cause readmission was defined as any unplanned or planned hospital readmission occurring after discharge, regardless of primary diagnosis. Emergency department visits without subsequent hospitalisation were excluded. Unplanned readmission for cardiac causes was defined as readmission for unstable angina pectoris, acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, malignant arrhythmia, etc. Endpoint outcomes were collected either at the end of follow-up in September 2024 or at 12 months postenrolment, whichever came first.

Data analysis and figure creation were carried out via SPSS (V.26), GraphPad Prism (V.8.3.0) and R (V.4.4.0). Normally distributed continuous data are expressed as the mean±SD and were analysed for statistical significance via one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Non-normally distributed continuous data are expressed as medians and IQRs and were analysed by the Kruskal–Wallis test. Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson χ2test. Baseline characteristics were stratified by aAIP values. Patients were divided into four groups according to the quartile level of the aAIP, with the lowest quartile as the reference class. In addition to its use as a categorical variable, aAIP was also analysed as a continuous variable to enhance the reliability of the results. Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate the relationships between aAIP and various outcomes, including MACEs, all-cause mortality, overall readmission and unplanned readmission. Trend tests were calculated by transforming aAIP quartiles into continuous variables. The results from the Cox regression analysis are presented as HRs and 95% CIs. Model 1 represented the unadjusted data. In Model 2, the data were adjusted for age, sex and BMI. In Model 3, the results were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Ccr, current drinking, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and LDL-C. In the subgroup analysis, possible modifications of the association between aAIP and clinical outcomes were assessed for variables, including sex (female vs male), age (<60 years vs ≥60 years), Ccr (<80 mL/min vs ≥80 mL/min), current drinking (yes vs no), hypertension (yes vs no), type 2 diabetes (yes vs no), BMI (<24 kg/m2vs ≥24 kg/m2) and LDL-C (<3.4 mmol/L vs ≥3.4 mmol/L). Multivariate Cox regression models were used in the analysis of interaction. The mean imputation method was applied to impute the missing data of continuous variables. A two-sided p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Figure 1illustrates a schematic representation of the selection process. Among 483 patients with STEMI hospitalised at Fuyang People’s Hospital between January 2023 and March 2024, certain patients were excluded primarily due to the absence of PCI during hospitalisation (n=41), severe lipid profile metabolic dysfunction (n=27), lack of available data on TG and HDL-C (n=25) and a history of coronary stenting (n=23). Furthermore, 11 patients were lost to follow-up. Consequently, 334 eligible patients were included and categorised into four groups based on the quartile level of the aAIP, with 83 individuals in the Q1 group, 84 in the Q2 group, 84 in the Q3 group and 83 in the Q4 group.

Table 1presents the baseline characteristics of the patients grouped by aAIP quartile. The average age of the patients at baseline was 62.21±13.30 years, with 253 (75.75%) being male. Higher aAIP groups were younger (p=0.004) and had elevated BMI (Q4: 24.14 kg/m² vs Q1: 22.51 kg/m²; p=0.011). Hypertension (Q4: 65.06% vs Q1: 39.76%; p=0.004) and type 2 diabetes (Q4: 37.35% vs Q1: 10.84%; p<0.001) were more prevalent in higher quartiles. Metabolic dysfunction markers (TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C; all p<0.05), current drinking and Ccr also differed significantly across groups.

Over a median follow-up of 8.70 months, 20.36% (n=68) patients experienced MACEs, including unstable angina (8.98%), acute heart failure exacerbation (3.89%), non-fatal MI (3.59%), all-cause death (2.99%), ischaemic stroke (1.50%) and malignant arrhythmia (0.60%). Continuous aAIP was positively correlated with MACEs in Model 1. This correlation remained significant after adjusting for sex, age and BMI in Model 2, and further adjusted for Ccr, current drinking, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and LDL-C in Model 3 (p<0.001 for each model). Quartile analysis revealed significantly higher MACE risks in Q3 and Q4 versus Q1 (all p<0.001), but no Q1–Q2 difference (p>0.05). A dose-dependent trend was observed (p<0.001 for trend). Kaplan–Meier curves (figure 2A) confirmed progressively higher MACE incidence from Q1 to Q4 (log-rank p<0.0001).

During the follow-up period, the study recorded 79 cases (23.65%) of all-cause readmission and 68 cases (20.36%) of unplanned readmission (table 2). Continuous aAIP correlated with all-cause death, readmission and unplanned readmission (all p<0.05). Q4 had significantly higher all-cause mortality versus Q1 (Model 2: HR=12.72, 95% CI 1.39 to 76.44 and Model 3: HR=16.18, 95% CI 1.66 to 117.50), though Kaplan–Meier curves showed no quartile difference (log-rank p=0.1534;figure 2B). For all-cause readmission, Q3 (HR=2.242, 95% CI 1.043 to 4.818; p=0.039) and Q4 (HR=5.378, 95% CI 2.557 to 11.314; p<0.001) had elevated risks in Model 3, with a significant trend (p<0.001). Unplanned readmission risks were higher in Q3–Q4 across all models (p<0.05), supported by Kaplan–Meier analysis (log-rank p<0.0001;figure 2C,D).

Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore consistency among the significant subgroups.Figure 3presented the results of the modification effects between aAIP and MACEs in various subgroups. Continuous aAIP was positively correlated with MACEs in all subgroups. No significant interaction effects were observed (all p for interaction >0.05).

In this observational study, we found a significant association between elevated aAIP and increased risks of MACEs, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission in patients with STEMI post-PCI, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. These findings highlight the potential clinical utility of aAIP as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in this high-risk population.

STEMI is a critical cardiovascular condition characterised by sudden blockage of blood flow in the coronary arteries, leading to myocardial injury. It remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, significantly affecting the patient quality of life and healthcare systems.20Despite advancements in PCI therapeutic approaches, challenges persist, including the risk of MACEs and the need for improved prognostic markers to improve patient outcomes.2 21The AIP, defined as the logarithm of the TG to HDL-C ratio, serves as a significant indicator of lipid metabolism disturbances and cardiovascular risk. Several studies have demonstrated that the AIP was associated with various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and conditions, acting as a potential prognostic marker for MACEs. Abduet al22reported that the AIP was notably associated with the incidence of MACEs in myocardial infarction patients and non-obstructive coronary artery patients. Yaoet al23reported that, for each additional unit of the AIP, the risk of MACEs increased by 19% in coronary artery calcification patients. They suggested that AIP was a readily available and low-cost strategy for identifying MACEs and mediating the association between coronary artery calcification and MACEs. However, Karakayaliet al24found that although both AIP and TyG index were significantly higher in patients with non-obstructive CADs compared with the control group, the TyG index provided a stronger prediction than AIP. In addition, other studies have indicated that AIP was also a useful prognostic tool in non-diabetic CAD,14chronic coronary syndrome25and type 2 diabetes mellitus.15However, the application of the AIP in predicting MACEs after PCI in patients with STEMI remains limited in the literature. In previous reports, negative values were frequently observed in AIP calculations, primarily because of the calculation formula.12,17However, the negative values of AIP posed challenges in data processing and statistical analysis, which complicated the accurate interpretation of the results. In this study, aAIP was used instead of AIP to avoid negative values and ensure a normal distribution of data. This study observed that a higher aAIP was significantly correlated with an increased risk of MACEs, as well as a notable rise in all-cause and unplanned readmission rates. These findings indicated that the aAIP might serve as a valuable tool for risk stratification in clinical practice, assisting in the identification of patients with STEMI at increased risk of MACEs.

While a Lithuanian cohort study found AIP significantly predicted CVD mortality in men and all-cause mortality in women,30our study showed conflicting results. Although adjusted models revealed higher all-cause mortality risk in Q4 versus Q1 (Models 2 and 3), Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated no significant cumulative mortality difference (log-rank p=0.1534). This aligns with two large cohort studies showing no significant AIP–mortality association after full adjustment,31 32despite trending HRs. The discrepancy may reflect our shorter follow-up duration (8.7 months vs 10 years31), suggesting that extended observation may be needed to detect mortality effects. These mixed findings highlight the importance of considering study design and follow-up duration when interpreting AIP’s prognostic value for mortality outcomes.

Our study indeed demonstrated a significant association between higher aAIP and an elevated risk of MACEs, as well as all-cause and unplanned readmissions. For patients with STEMI with high aAIP levels, particularly those in Q3 and Q4, we propose the importance of a more personalised and comprehensive management strategy. Specifically, patients with higher aAIP levels may benefit from more intensive cardiovascular risk factor management, including aggressive lipid-lowering therapy, tighter blood pressure control and enhanced lifestyle interventions. Additionally, closer monitoring and follow-up may be warranted to detect and manage potential complications early. However, these recommendations require validation in prospective intervention trials specifically targeting aAIP reduction. Future studies should investigate whether aAIP-guided therapy can improve outcomes in this high-risk population.

Although AIP has been studied in CVD, its prognostic value in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI remains unclear. Our study focuses on this high-risk cohort, which has distinct pathophysiological characteristics compared with other cardiovascular populations. We provide insights that a higher aAIP is significantly associated with increased risks of MACEs, all-cause readmission and unplanned readmission. These findings are directly relevant to the management and prognosis of patients with STEMI treated with PCI. To improve risk stratification, we introduced an aAIP formula that addresses a key limitation of the conventional AIP calculation. The traditional formula can yield negative values, reducing its utility in risk assessment. In contrast, the aAIP formula eliminates this issue, enabling more robust and clinically meaningful risk stratification. This adjustment enhances the applicability and reliability of AIP as a prognostic marker in PCI-treated patients. In addition to traditional MACEs, our study identifies the association between aAIP and unplanned readmissions. Unplanned readmissions reflect persistent health challenges and increased healthcare utilisation, carrying significant clinical and economic implications. Our findings broaden the understanding of aAIP’s prognostic impact and its relevance to post-PCI outcomes.

This study has several limitations. First, this was a single-centre observational study with a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalisability of the findings. Second, the adjusted covariates were only collected at baseline, and they may have changed over time. Additionally, residual confounding factors cannot be entirely excluded. These factors may potentially influence the association of aAIP with MACEs in patients with STEMI after PCI. Third, the parameters used to calculate aAIP were collected during the hospital stay, and changes in aAIP were not monitored during follow-up. Some factors, such as dietary patterns and environmental factors, may affect the value of aAIP, potentially leading to bias. Hence, further studies are needed to evaluate the application of aAIP among patients with STEMI after PCI.

This study demonstrated that elevated aAIP levels were independently associated with higher risks of MACEs, all-cause mortality and unplanned readmission in patients with STEMI after PCI. These findings highlight the potential of aAIP as a novel prognostic biomarker for post-PCI risk stratification. By identifying high-risk patients during the acute phase, aAIP measurement may facilitate timely secondary prevention strategies to improve clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to validate its utility in prehospital settings and to explore targeted interventions for patients with elevated aAIP.
