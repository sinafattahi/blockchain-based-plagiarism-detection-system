The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for enema reduction failure and to establish a combined model that integrates deep learning (DL) features and clinical features for predicting surgical intervention in intussusception in children younger than 8 months of age.

A retrospective study with a prospective validation cohort of intussusception.

The retrospective data were collected from two hospitals in south east China between January 2017 and December 2022. The prospective data were collected between January 2023 and July 2024.

A total of 415 intussusception cases in patients younger than 8 months were included in the study.

280 cases collected from Centre 1 were randomly divided into two groups at a 7:3 ratio: the training cohort (n=196) and the internal validation cohort (n=84). 85 cases collected from Centre 2 were designed as external validation cohort. Pretrained DL networks were used to extract deep transfer learning features, with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression selecting the non-zero coefficient features. The clinical features were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. We constructed a combined model that integrated the selected two types of features, along with individual clinical and DL models for comparison. Additionally, the combined model was validated in a prospective cohort (n=50) collected from Centre 1.

In the internal and external validation cohorts, the combined model (area under curve (AUC): 0.911 and 0.871, respectively) demonstrated better performance for predicting surgical intervention in intussusception in children younger than 8 months of age than the clinical model (AUC: 0.776 and 0.740, respectively) and the DL model (AUC: 0.828 and 0.793, respectively). In the prospective validation cohort, the combined model also demonstrated impressive performance with an AUC of 0.890.

The combined model, integrating DL and clinical features, demonstrated stable predictive accuracy, suggesting its potential for improving clinical therapeutic strategies for intussusception.

This was a multicentre study that included data from two tertiary paediatric hospitals in China.

The combined model was prospectively validated, enhancing its credibility.

The proposed models demonstrated practical value in predicting surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception and enhancing clinical therapeutic strategies.

The dataset of this study remained relatively small. A larger dataset would enhance the robustness and generalisability of our findings.

Intussusception is a common cause of acute abdomen in infants, primarily in the first 2 years of life, with the highest incidence in those aged 4–10 months.1 2It is defined as the invagination of one part of the intestine into another.3,5Fluoroscopic or ultrasonographic guidance of hydrostatic and air enema reduction can be the preferred treatment of choice, with a range of overall success rates between 42% and 95%.6Some children still require surgical intervention despite advancements and refinements in enema reduction techniques. Surgical reduction is reserved for failed cases of nonsurgical methods and cases presenting complications such as bowel necrosis and peritonitis.7 8Identifying patients at a high risk of failure of non-operative reduction is crucial for optimising management strategies. Early recognition allows for better planning, such as planning the next step in advance and informing the parents about the possibility of unsuccessful reduction, thereby facilitating timely surgical intervention. In recent years, increasing studies have focused on younger paediatric patients.9 10They have indicated that failure of non-operative reduction is more likely to occur in younger children, especially in those under 12 months, although a standardised age threshold has not been established. Shekherdimianet alhighlighted that the failure rate of enema reduction in patients under 6 months could be as high as 78.4%, with 51.7% of the patients requiring bowel resection.11In this context, it is imminent to identify risk factors for enema reduction failure in younger children and to establish a predictive model for identifying cases likely to require surgical intervention, aiming to decrease delays and improve salvage of the intussuscepted bowel.

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal performance in computer vision and have found applications in medical imaging.12,14They represent an emerging technique where features are automatically extracted from imaging data within the hidden layers of neural networks.15,17This yields quantitative and high-throughput features from medical images such as CT, MRI and ultrasound. These features are then employed to develop diagnostic and predictive models by various machine learning and deep learning (DL) methods.18However, compared with the prediction model only constructed based on clinical data, DL radiomics combined with clinical parameters can integrate clinical information and network features to provide complementary information for image features.19,21We believe that with the help of DL networks, extracting DL features can identify characteristics that are not observable or are easily overlooked by the human eye, thereby effectively assisting in determining whether a child with intussusception requires surgical intervention.

In this study, we extracted the deep radiomics features from ultrasound images for intussusception in children younger than 8 months. Then, we proposed three models, namely, a clinical model, a DL model and a combined model that integrates DL radiomics features and clinical features for predicting surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception.

This multicentre study, comprising both retrospective and prospective components, used data from two hospitals in south east China, namely, Children’s Hospital of Soochow University (Centre 1) and Affiliated Changzhou Children’s Hospital of Nantong University (Centre 2).

The subjects were diagnosed with acute intussusception via abdominal ultrasound conducted during their hospital visit. Then, those confirmed with intussusception were treated with air enema reduction. Patients who did not achieve successful reduction of intussusception after three enema reduction attempts required surgical treatment. The interval between the three enema reduction attempts was 1 hour if the patient was stable.

Between January 2017 and December 2022, in Centre 1, a total of 4818 consecutive patients were diagnosed with acute intussusception, of which 183 underwent surgery after failed air enema reduction. The patients were divided into the successful air enema group and the operation group based on the results of the air enema reduction and surgery. The overall failure rate of air enemas was 3.8%. However, further analysis revealed that the failure rate of air enemas varied with age, generally increasing as the child’s age decreased. More information is shown inonline supplemental table 1 and figure 1. In patients younger than 8 months, the failure rate of air enemas was 23.7%, while in those older than 8 months, it was only 2.4%. The difference between the two age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). Therefore, we focused on the children with intussusception younger than 8 months. This age threshold was not only supported by clinical observations and prior literature suggesting distinct anatomical and physiological characteristics in younger infants but also validated through exploratory analyses using multiple age cut-offs (6, 8, 10 and 12 months), with 8 months yielding the most statistically significant separation in air enema failure rates.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age <8 months, (2) both abdominal ultrasound examination and air enema reduction performed and (3) availability of images and clinical data. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history of previous intestinal surgery and (2) inadequate ultrasound image quality that cannot be used for further analysis.

We retrospectively enrolled 390 patients with acute intussusception in children younger than 8 months across the two centres between January 2017 and December 2022. At Centre 1, 280 of the 299 patients met the inclusion criteria. These patients were then randomly divided into two groups at a 7:3 ratio, namely, the training cohort (n=196) and the internal validation cohort (n=84). At Centre 2, a total of 85 of the 91 patients met the criteria and were designated as the external validation cohort. Additionally, we enrolled 50 patients between January 2023 and July 2024 from Centre 1—the prospective validation cohort. Among these patients, 12 cases (approximately 3% of the dataset) had missing values in one or more clinical features. To ensure data integrity and minimise bias potentially introduced by imputation, these cases were excluded from all analyses. Preliminary assessment of the missing data pattern showed no significant differences between cases with missing data and those with complete records in key clinical variables. Therefore, the missing data were assumed to be missing at random, and complete case analysis was considered appropriate for this study.

We included all available and eligible cases within the study period to maximise the robustness and generalisability of the model. This pragmatic approach was chosen to reflect real-world clinical practice and ensure the diversity of patient characteristics.Figure 1shows the patient recruitment workflow.

All of the enrolled patients underwent an abdominal ultrasound examination prior to air enema reduction or surgery. The ultrasound machines included TOSHIBA Aplio400, VINNO 80, Canon Aplio400, Siemens Acuson S1000 and GE HealthCare E20. During the ultrasound scanning process, both a linear array probe and a convex array probe were used to conduct a thorough scan of the entire abdominal cavity. Longitudinal and transverse multisectional scans were conducted upon identifying any anomalies. Once the lesions were distinctly visualised, the location of the mass was recorded, the diameter of the ‘concentric circle’ sign was measured and the mesenteric lymph nodes in the lesions were observed. The greyscale images of intussusception were routinely stored in Picture Archiving and Communication Systems.

A static greyscale image of the most extensive long-axis cross-section for intussusception was selected to evaluate the characteristics of intussusception based on the following ultrasound features: nested position, mass size, pathologic lead points (PLPs), enlarged lymph nodes and hydrops abdominis. The ultrasound images were independently reviewed by two radiologists (J-jZ, who has 5 years of diagnostic experience and Y-fQ, who has 8 years of diagnostic experience). The inter-rater agreement between them was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, which was 0.87, demonstrating excellent consistency. Detailed results are presented inonline supplemental table 2. If there was a discrepancy between the interpretations of the two radiologists, the final decision was made by a third radiologist (W-lG, who has more than 15 years of experience in ultrasound imaging).

We referred to clinical data along with conventional ultrasound features collectively as the clinical features. The patients’ clinical data were obtained from regular clinical records. A total of 16 clinical features were retrieved, namely, age, gender, abdominal pain, paroxysms of crying, vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal mass, fever, diarrhoea, nested position, mass size, PLPs, enlarged lymph nodes, abdominal and pelvic effusion, air enema pressure and duration of symptoms.

In this context, nested position was defined as the right abdomen or left abdomen depending on whether the mass was located on the right or on the left of the spine, respectively. Enlarged lymph nodes were defined as those with a short-axis diameter >15 mm. Mass size was defined as the average of the long and short diameters in the maximum section of ultrasound. The duration of symptoms was categorised as either exceeding 24 hours or not exceeding 24 hours.

In this study, all of the reviewed ultrasound images of the enrolled patients were stored in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine(DICOM) format, and then converted to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative(NII) format. Two radiologists (Y-fQ and W-lG), who were blinded to the results, used ITK-SNAP software (V.3.8.0,http://www.itksnap.org/) to manually segment regions of interest (ROIs). Each mass was outlined along its margins, and a bounding rectangle around the most extensive long-axis cross-section of the mass was used to crop the maximum ROI. The obtained images were used for subsequent model development. The interobserver and intraobserver agreements were evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). 70 patients were randomly selected for repeated ROI segmentation by one of the radiologists (Yf-Q.) after a 3-week interval. An ICC >0.7 was considered an indicator of good consistency and was retained for subsequent analysis.

Transfer learning was applied herein from the pretrained convolutional neural networks for extracting DL features. In this study, all implementations were performed using the Onekey AI platform, which provides standardised DL pipelines based on PyTorch frameworks. We selected ResNet-50 as our pretrained model (torchvision implementation), which had originally been trained on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 dataset. We selected the largest cross-sectional view from the ultrasound images and normalised the intensity values to a range of [−1, 1] using min–max transformation. Each of those images from cropped subregions was then resized to 224×224 pixels using nearest-neighbour interpolation. These processed images served as the input for the model. After removing the final classification layer, 2048-dimensional DL feature vectors were extracted from the global average pooling layer of ResNet-50. To ensure a balanced representation of the features, principal component analysis (PCA) was subsequently applied for dimensionality reduction (using scikit-learn’s PCA with n_components=0.95). We standardised all of the features using z-score standardisation method and then conducted correlation coefficient screening with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient test to evaluate the interrelationship between the features, aiming to ensure the robustness of the features. Any feature having a correlation coefficient >0.9 with any two features was retained with one of these two features. Finally, we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression (LR) algorithm, combined with 10-fold cross-validation for penalty parameter tuning to select the features with non-zero coefficients from the training cohort. The selected features and optimal parameters were then applied to the validation cohorts for model evaluation.

After performing LASSO feature selection, we identified the ultimate retained features for DL models. Based on these features, we developed a DL predictive model with various machine learning algorithms, including LR, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, random forest, ExtraTrees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and light gradient boosting machine. Traditional machine learning classifiers were implemented using the scikit-learn library. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. Detailed hyperparameters are presented inonline supplemental table 3.

Furthermore, we conducted univariate analysis to compare the clinical features between the two groups in the training cohort. The variables that showed significant differences (p<0.05) were further evaluated using multivariate analysis. For every independent factor, ORs with 95% CIs were determined to estimate the relative risk. The selected variables were then used to construct a clinical model employing the same machine-learning algorithms.

Finally, we constructed a combined model, which integrated the selected DL and clinical features, applying the same machine learning algorithms. We assessed the predictive performance of these models by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Ultimately, the optimal models were obtained.Figure 2shows the entire process of model construction.

SPSS software (V.27.0) and Python (V.3.9.0,http://www.python.org) were used for statistical analyses. The normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables conforming to normal distribution were presented as mean±SD and compared by Student’s t-test. For continuous variables not meeting the normality assumption, non-parametric tests were applied. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (percentages) and were analysed using the χ2test.

The AUC, along with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, was compared between the predictive models. DeLong’s test was employed to compare the AUC values. Calibration curves were used to assess the agreement between the observed and predicted outcomes. The clinical utility of the prediction models was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA) to calculate the net benefit across different threshold probabilities. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was applied to examine the consistency between the expected and observed probabilities in the prediction model. All of the calculations were performed with 95% CIs, and statistical significance was considered when p value was <0.05 in a two-sided analysis.

Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this research.

A total of 365 patients with intussusception in children younger than 8 months of age were enrolled for model construction. This cohort comprised 196 patients in the training cohort, 84 patients in the internal validation cohort and 85 patients in the external validation cohort, and the rates of surgical reduction were 25% (49/196), 26.19% (22/84) and 24.7% (21/85), respectively.Table 1summarises the clinical and ultrasonic characteristics of these cohorts. There were no significant differences between the training and two validation cohorts.

Numerical data are presented as mean±SD, and categorical data as numbers (n%).

The univariate analysis revealed that vomiting, bloody stools, nested position, mass size, PLPs, abdominal and pelvic effusion, and duration of symptoms were associated with surgical intervention for intussusception in the training cohort. Then, these characteristics were imported to multivariate LR analysis. The multivariate LR analysis revealed nested position, mass size, PLPs, bloody stools, abdominal and pelvic effusion, and duration of symptoms (all p<0.05) as the independent significant factors associated with surgical intervention for intussusception (table 2).

A total of 2048 DL features were extracted from segmentations. After the downscaling of DL features and LASSO LR, 13 features with non-zero coefficients were retained for the construction of the DL model. The coefficients and mean SEs of LASSO regression, resulting from the 10-fold validation, and the coefficients of these retained DL features are depicted inonline supplemental figure 2. Based on the univariate and multivariate LR analyses, six clinical features were initially selected for the construction of the clinical model. The construction of the combined model was based on the six clinical features and 13 DL features. Among the 19 features, the DL features showed higher correlation coefficients compared with the clinical features.

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to visualise the network to explore the interpretability of the DL model. Grad-CAM generates a coarse localisation map that highlights important regions relevant to the classification target (online supplemental figure 3).

The ROC curves for the predictive models created with different common machine learning algorithms are displayed inonline supplemental figure 4, with the three optimal predictive models illustrated inonline supplemental figure 5. Additional metrics are included inonline supplemental table 4. In the internal validation cohort, the combined model achieved the highest performance for predicting surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception with an AUC of 0.911 (95% CI 0.8385 to 0.9826), accuracy of 0.893, sensitivity of 0.773, specificity of 0.935, PPV of 0.810 and NPV of 0.921, while the clinical model achieved an AUC of 0.776 (95% CI 0.6580 to 0.8933) and the DL model achieved an AUC of 0.828 (95% CI 0.7259 to 0.9295). In the external validation cohort, the combined model achieved the highest AUC of 0.871 (95% CI 0.7663 to 0.9762), accuracy of 0.906, sensitivity of 0.905, specificity of 0.906, PPV of 0.760 and NPV of 0.967. The clinical model and the DL model achieved lower AUCs, namely, 0.740 (95% CI 0.6199 to 0.8600) and 0.793 (95% CI 0.6797 to 0.9066), respectively. Furthermore, the combined model universally outperformed the clinical and DL models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV in the internal validation cohort and the external validation cohort. The quantitative comparison of these models is summarised intable 3, and ROC curves are illustrated infigure 3.

We applied the DeLong test to further evaluate the models’ effectiveness (online supplemental table 5). In the internal validation cohort, the combined model significantly outperformed the clinical model (p=0.011), while no significant difference was found between the combined model and the DL model (p=0.107). In the external validation cohort, the combined model surpassed both the clinical model (p=0.005) and the DL model (p=0.049), indicating that the combined model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy.

In addition, the calibration curves for the combined model showed that the bias curves closely followed the ideal line, reflecting strong consistency between the predicted and actual outcomes in surgical intervention for intussusception in children younger than 8 months. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test results, with p values provided inonline supplemental table 5, also demonstrated that the combined model had better predictive accuracy than the other models in both the internal and external validation cohorts. The calibration curves for every cohort are displayed infigure 4.

DCA was also employed to assess the clinical utility and benefits of predicting surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception across various models. As illustrated infigure 5, the DCA results demonstrated that the combined model offered the most substantial net benefit for predicting surgical intervention, thus outperforming both the clinical model and the DL model in the training, internal validation and external validation cohorts.

We also conducted a prospective validation to further evaluate the reliability and applicability of the combined model for predicting surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception. This phase of research involved the enrolment of a new cohort of patients from Centre 1, between January 2023 and July 2024. Importantly, this cohort was selected independently of the original training and validation datasets used in our prior analyses to ensure that the results of this validation were not biased by earlier data.

In the test set (n=50), the combined model demonstrated impressive performance metrics, with an AUC of 0.890 (95% CI 0.7545 to 1.0000), accuracy of 0.900, PPV of 0.636, NPV of 0.974 and F1 score of 0.737 (online supplemental table 6). The ROC curve and predicted sample scores are shown inonline supplemental figures 6 and 7.

The results from the prospective validation demonstrated that the predictive model not only maintained a high level of accuracy but also exhibited consistency in different patient populations. This robustness signifies that the model has a strong potential to make reliable predictions regarding the need for surgical intervention in intussusception in children younger than 8 months.

In this study, we developed and validated a combined model that integrates DL radiomics features with clinical features to predict the need for surgical intervention in intussusception in children younger than 8 months. The combined model achieved a high AUC of 0.911 in the internal validation cohort, outperforming the individual models based solely on clinical features (AUC=0.776) or DL features (AUC=0.828). In addition, the combined model demonstrated strong performance in prospective validation, achieving an AUC of 0.890, further underscoring its high accuracy and robustness.

This is the first study to combine clinical and DL features to predict surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception. Previous studies have reported various risk factors for surgery in paediatric patients with intussusception, often yielding incongruent results.22,24Several studies have shown that clinicopathological risk factors for surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception include age, duration of abdominal pain, presence of bloody stool, C-reactive protein levels, trapped fluid and nested position.20However, there is still no standardised set of criteria to guide clinical decisions. In the present study, based on the univariate and multivariate LR analyses, we affirmed that bloody stools, left-sided intussusception, larger mass, PLPs, hydrops abdominis and longer duration of symptoms were associated with an increased probability of surgical intervention. Fragosoet al25and Sommeet al26published a similar report and pointed to symptom duration of 48 hours or more as a risk factor for failure of hydrostatic reduction in intussusception. In contrast, Limet al27did not find any relationship among symptom duration, clinical symptoms such as blood in the stool and vomiting, and success of ultrasound-guided water enema. Similarly, Liuet al28found no significant difference in the success rate of ultrasound-guided hydrostatic enema between children with a disease duration of more than 48 hours and those with less. However, Khoranaet al17reported symptom duration exceeding 72 hours as a predictor of failed nonsurgical reduction. Our findings support the association between longer symptom duration and an increased risk of failed non-operative reduction. Indeed, prior studies have also emphasised the role of age in reduction failure, indicating that children under 1 year of age are at an increased risk for failure of reduction. Shekherdimianet al11reported that individuals younger than 6 months of age experienced a high operative rate. Chuaet al10reported that the rate of air enema reduction was lower in patients younger than 3 months. This is similar to our results. These findings are further supported by our study, which evidences that children younger than 8 months have a higher likelihood of undergoing surgical intervention; however, no significant difference was found among age groups under 8 months of age.

In addition, earlier studies have noted that the presence of interloop fluid and free fluid in ultrasound indicates a potentially increased risk of surgery. Kimet al9described that among ultrasound features, ascites, left-sided intussusception and trapped fluid were linked to enema reduction failure, with success rates dropping <50% when these signs were present. In the present study, ascites and left-sided intussusception were also identified as risk factors for failure of enema reduction. Furthermore, we found that the presence of a larger mass and PLPs significantly contributed to the failure of enema reduction.

Relying solely on clinical risk factors to predict the need for surgical intervention in intussusception is insufficiently accurate. A significant portion of children with intussusception can present without classic triads, and the risk factors detected by ultrasound might be more helpful than clinical features to predict the reduction outcome and give useful information to the surgeons for a preoperative candidate.29,31Liuet al20developed a nomogram based on clinical risk factors to predict surgical intervention in paediatric patients with intussusception. The nomogram demonstrated a classification performance with an AUC of 0.757. In the present study, we built a machine learning model using clinical risk factors combined with deep radiomics features from ultrasound images of intussusception. Our results indicated that the combined model exhibited the best performance with an AUC of 0.911. This approach provided complementary insights beyond image features, effectively compensating for their limitations and enhancing the model’s reliability in predicting surgical interventions for paediatric intussusception. In addition, the present study specifically addressed the age group that experiences the highest rates of enema failure in these cases, enabling a more focused analysis. Notably, our model demonstrated strong performance in both internal and external validation sets, and additional validation on prospective data confirmed its robustness and predictive accuracy.

The present study had several limitations. First, although this was a multicentre study and prospective testing was conducted, the dataset remained relatively small. Moreover, the prospective validation cohort was collected from the same hospital as the training and internal validation cohorts, which may limit the external validity of the model when applied to other centres or populations. A larger dataset involving more hospitals across different cities and countries would enhance the robustness and generalisability of our findings. Second, given the ultrasound data we used, we only employed two-dimensional features from the maximal ROI slice of the mass. However, the two-dimensional segmentation may lack some information to fully describe the features of the entire lesion. Third, we did not analyse the effect of specific intussusception types on the risk of surgical intervention for intussusception. Fourth, although standardised preprocessing and consistent feature extraction methods were applied to reduce variability across different ultrasound machines, we acknowledge that residual device-specific differences may still exist. A dedicated analysis of the impact of device-related variation on model performance was beyond the scope of the present study, but we recognise its importance and plan to investigate this in future work. Overall, while our findings contribute to predicting surgical intervention in paediatric intussusception, addressing these limitations in future studies will be essential for refining our models and enhancing clinical applicability.

Our study identified six significant risk factors associated with enema reduction failure in children younger than 8 months of age with intussusception: (1) bloody stools, (2) left-sided intussusception, (3) larger mass diameter, (4) presence of PLPs, (5) abdominal and pelvic effusion and (6) prolonged symptom duration (>24 hours). Based on these findings, we developed and validated an ultrasound-based combined model integrating clinical risk factors and DL features to predict surgical intervention in intussusception in children younger than 8 months of age. The combined model yielded a stable predictive accuracy, and it may have the potential to improve clinical therapeutic strategies for intussusception.
