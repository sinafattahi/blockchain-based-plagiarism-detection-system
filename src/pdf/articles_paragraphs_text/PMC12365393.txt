Determination of the prevalence of suicidal behaviors (thoughts, plans, and attempts) would help to comprehend the burden and chances of death by suicide. However, no previous meta‐analysis was noted measuring the rates of different suicidal behaviors in Bangladesh. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal behavior in the country.

We registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42024613969) and followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We searched PubMed and Scopus and conducted meta‐analyses to pool the lifetime, 1‐year, and point prevalence estimates for suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts.

Our search included 34 studies with 27,992 responses between 2015 and 2024. Half of the studies were conducted among students. The pooled prevalence of suicidal thoughts was 24.2% (95% CI: 15.7%–35.3%) during the lifetime (15 studies, 12,710 subjects), 15% (95% CI: 10.7%–20.5%) during a year (20 studies, 15,020 subjects), and 6.7% (95% CI: 3.2%–13.8%) during a month (11 studies, 7047 subjects). Statistical heterogeneity ranged from 96.6% to 99.3%. The pooled prevalence of suicide plan was 5.6% (95% CI: 2.4%–12.8%) during the lifetime (7 studies, 5772 subjects), and 5.2% (95% CI: 3.1%–8.8%) during a year (5 studies). Statistical heterogeneity ranged from 82.1% to 97.9%. The pooled prevalence of suicide attempt was 7% (95% CI: 4.3%–11.1%) during the lifetime (15 studies, 11,699 subjects), and 3.9% (95% CI: 2.8%–5.3%) during a year (7 studies, 8107 subjects). Statistical heterogeneity ranged from 88.1% to 95.4%.

The rates of suicidal behavior are high in Bangladesh, as about one in four persons has thoughts and about one in fourteen persons has attempted during their lifetime. Attention from multiple stakeholders is warranted to ensure preventive measures in Bangladesh.

Suicidal behavior is a significant public health issue globally, and its prevalence serves as a crucial indicator of mental health challenges within a population [1,2]. Alarmingly, low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) account for nearly 73% of 727,000 suicides, highlighting the urgent need for effective mental health support and intervention in these regions [1]. The interplay of poverty, unemployment, gender‐based violence, mental illness, and inadequate access to mental health services significantly amplifies vulnerability in these regions [3]. Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering resilience and promoting well‐being among affected populations [4]. South Asia faces a critical challenge with alarmingly high suicide rates. Countries like India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan are grappling with significant levels of suicidal behavior, underscoring the urgent need for effective mental health interventions and support systems in the region [5].

Bangladesh's socio‐demographic profile and cultural context significantly influence the prevalence and patterns of suicidal behavior [6]. Suicide rates in Bangladesh are likely much higher than reported, primarily due to pervasive stigma, cultural taboos, and ineffective reporting systems. Addressing these issues is crucial for understanding and combating this serious public health concern [7]. Emerging evidence indicates that suicidal behavior is an unaddressed concern, necessitating a comprehensive investigation [8]. There is a significant opportunity to enhance our understanding of suicidal behavior in Bangladesh, as current epidemiological studies are limited and often lack methodological rigor [7]. Existing research indicates that suicide rates in Bangladesh vary widely, with higher rates observed among women and rural populations [7,8,9].

One significant barrier to understanding the prevalence of suicidal behavior in Bangladesh is the absence of a centralized and systematic reporting mechanism [7]. Suicide is frequently misclassified as accidental death or goes unreported due to stigma and fear of social or legal consequences [7,10]. Moreover, a significant number of current studies are cross‐sectional and focused on particular regions, which restricts the relevance of their findings to the wider population [9].

It is crucial to understand the prevalence of suicidal behavior in Bangladesh to understand the burden as well as to develop targeted interventions and policies that address this urgent public health issue. Two previous reviews discussed various metrics of suicide and studies conducted on suicide in Bangladesh [9,10]. As the majority of the studies are cross‐sectional, focused on a region, a meta‐analysis would reveal rates considering the given the heterogeneity in instruments, settings, and study populations to measure the overall burden. Therefore, this review aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal behavior (thought, plan, and attempt) in Bangladesh to provide a comprehensive foundation for policymakers, researchers, and public health practitioners in designing and implementing effective suicide prevention strategies tailored to the Bangladeshi context. In this review, we considered suicidal behavior for suicidal thoughts/ideations, plans, and nonfatal suicide attempts and excluded death by suicide.

We registered the review protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42024613969). We performed a search in PubMed and Scopus using predefined search terms [(self?harm* OR suicid* AND (Bangladesh)] to identify the available articles with the prevalence of suicidal thoughts/ideations, plans, and attempts. All published articles from inception to search date (November 13, 2024) were included. We also performed hand searches of the reference lists of eligible papers, a book,Suicide in Bangladesh, and conducted hand searches of key papers to identify additional reports to include all new papers [11]. Additionally, we searched Google, Google Scholar, and BanglaJOL to identify the potential papers published in non‐indexed local journals, as mental health journals of Bangladesh are not included in PubMed and Scopus as well as to identify the gray literature [12]. We used “suicidal behavior in Bangladesh,” “suicide attempt in Bangladesh,” “suicide plan in Bangladesh,” “suicidal ideation in Bangladesh,” and “suicidal thought in Bangladesh” as search terms for searching.

Cross‐sectional research studies mentioning specific rates of different suicidal behavior (thoughts/ideas, plans, and attempts), articles with quantitative measures, published in English, articles published on Bangladeshi populations living in Bangladesh, and available in full‐text were included. We did not apply any restrictions on age, sex, or study populations.

Studies with other designs, qualitative studies, multiple papers from the same data set, review articles, letters, editorials, and corrections were excluded. Studies mentioning suicidal behavior as a total rate and studies with non‐suicidal self‐injury were excluded from the review.

Two individual authors (S.M.Y.A., H.A.) screened the list following PRISMA 2020 guidelines for the identification of potential articles [13]. The stepwise details are mentioned in Figure1. We sought a third opinion (R.K.) when necessary.

Data were extracted by two separate individuals (H.A., R.K.) in Microsoft Excel version 10 and a third individual (S.M.Y.A.) was involved when needed. As guided by the study objectives, we extracted the estimates of suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts in the life time, last year, and the last month. We consider estimates of last month as point prevalence.

Two independent authors (S.M.Y.A., H.A.) assessed the quality and risk of bias of the selected cross‐sectional studies by theNewcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale(NOS) [14,15]. We consulted a third opinion (RK) whenever needed. Based on the scale, we assessed three domains; (1) sample selection, (2) comparability of the different outcome groups, and (3) outcome assessments and statistical analysis of the studies. Based on the responses in the sections, scores were mentioned on a scale of 0–10. We considered a high risk of bias (≤ 3), moderate risk of bias (4–6), and low risk of bias (≥ 7) [15].

Lifetime, 12‐month and point prevalence (last month) estimates for the three suicidal behaviors (thoughts/ideas, plans and attempts) were pooled using the “Meta” and “Metafor” packages in RStudio version 4.4.0. Random intercept logistic regression was used to pool the data. Heterogeneity was examined with theI²‐statistic. Random‐effects models were used due to the high heterogeneity. Pooled results were visualized using forest plots. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted: (1) by excluding studies that were based on clinical populations, and (2) by retaining only the high‐quality studies as per quality assessment. As a large proportion of studies were based on student populations, separate meta‐analyses were conducted for this subpopulation, provided there were at least three studies for each analysis. Moderator analyses were performed to test whether the year of publication, gender composition (i.e., the percentage of males), and mean age of the samples affected the effect sizes. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots, and Egger's test of funnel plot asymmetry; a significantpvalue (< 0.05) for Egger's test would indicate the presence of publication bias. Moderation analyses and tests of funnel plot asymmetry were not performed in meta‐analyses with fewer than 10 studies.

We did not seek for formal approval from any institutional review board as we reviewed already published papers.

A total of 33 peer‐reviewed articles and one report of a nation‐wide study were included in this meta‐analysis (Table1) [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49]. We found the earliest study was published in 2015, and the latest study was published in 2024, where the sample size ranged from 60 to 3331. The total analysis contains 27,992 responses. Among the studies, more than 70% (n= 24) were conducted in urban settings, about 15% (n= 5) were conducted in rural settings and the rest 15% were conducted in both rural and urban areas. We identified two nationwide studies [29,37] (one analyzed secondary data) and one report from a nationwide sample [37]. Only eight studies (23.5%) utilized objective instruments to measure suicidal behavior. Data were collected by interview in thirteen studies (38.2%), by online survey in eight studies (23.5%), from secondary data analysis in one study, by self‐reporting instruments in five studies, and by survey in seven studies (Table1). Samples were collected from students in 17 studies (50%) [medical, university, and rehabilitation students], religious leaders in one study [17], nurses in two studies [22,28], postpartum mothers in one study [27], among physicians in one study [36], persons with disabilities in two studies, gays in one study [39], geriatric persons in one study [49], psychiatric patients in two studies [42,45], adolescent pregnant in one study [31], adolescents and youths in two studies. Among the studies, data were collected from the community population in five studies, and another study used secondary data of community populations. About one‐third of the studies (n= 11) assessed all three types of suicidal behavior (thought, plan, and attempt), seven studies assessed thought and attempt, twelve studies assessed only suicidal thought, and four studies assessed only suicide attempt (Table1). Among the studies, two studies (related to pregnancy) were conducted among female participants only [27,31] and two studies were conducted among only male participants (Imams and gays) [17,39].

The pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal thoughts, based on 15 studies (12,710 subjects), was 24.2% [95% CI: 15.7%–35.3%] (Figure2). A high degree of heterogeneity was noted (I2= 99.3%). Moderator analysis revealed that the year of publication moderated the lifetime prevalence (b= 0.42, SE = 0.14,z= 3.04,p= 0.002), that is, the reported prevalence has increased with time. This suggests that the prevalence increased by 0.4% per year on average. Prevalence rates were not moderated by the mean age (b= 0.017, SE = 0.043,z= 0.411,p= 0.681), or male percentage (b= 0.015, SE = 0.013,z= 1.177,p= 0.239) in the samples. A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding one study, which was based on a clinical population. This only slightly reduced the pooled prevalence value to 23.6% (95% CI: 14.9%–35.4%). However, when only high‐quality studies with relevant data (k= 5) were retained in the meta‐analysis, the pooled prevalence dropped to 15.7% (95% CI: 8.8%–26.4%). In the subset of studies representing student populations (k= 7), the pooled prevalence was higher, reaching 30.9% (95% CI: 18.6%–46.6%).

Forest plot for the lifetime prevalence of suicidal thoughts (15 studies, 12710 subjects).

Egger's linear regression test was performed to statistically evaluate funnel plot asymmetry. The results indicated no significant evidence of asymmetry (t(13) = − 0.36,p= 0.72), suggesting the absence of substantial publication bias.

The 12‐month prevalence of suicidal thoughts, based on 20 studies (15,020 subjects), was 15% [95% CI 10.7%–20.5%] (Figure3). Statistical heterogeneity was high (I2= 98.1%). Prevalence rates were not moderated by the year of publication (b= −0.062, SE = 0.169,z= −0.365,p= 0.716), mean age (b= 0.007, SE = 0.0314,z= 0.234,p= 0.815), or male percentage (b= −0.0065, SE = 0.009,z= −0.669,p= 0.503). A sensitivity analysis performed by excluding three studies that were based on clinical populations slightly reduced the pooled prevalence value to 14.4% (95% CI: 9.9%–20.6%). When only the high‐quality studies with relevant data (k= 5) were retained in the meta‐analysis, the pooled prevalence dropped further to 12.1% [95% CI: 6.2%–22.2%]. When the meta‐analysis was confined to student populations (k= 10), the prevalence was 15.6% (95% CI: 11.7%–20.6%). Egger's linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry indicated no significant evidence of asymmetry (t(18) = − 0.96,p= 0.35), suggesting the absence of substantial publication bias.

Forest plot for the 12‐month prevalence of suicidal thoughts (20 studies, 15,020 subjects).

The point prevalence of suicidal thoughts, based on 11 studies (7047 subjects), was 6.7% [95% CI: 3.2%–13.8%] (Figure4). Heterogeneity was high (I2= 96.6%). Prevalence rates were not moderated by the year of publication (b= −0.145, SE = 0.176,z= −0.824,p= 0.409), mean age (b= 0.0129, SE = 0.0306,z= 0.421,p= 0.674), or male percentage (b= 0.0207, SE = 0.0156,z= 1.3254,p= 0.185) in the individual studies. A sensitivity analysis conducted by excluding two studies that were based on clinical populations reduced the pooled prevalence value down to 5% (95% CI: 2.2%– 11%). When the meta‐analysis was confined to student populations (k= 3), the prevalence was 9.7% (95% CI: 6.7%–13.8%). Egger's linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry indicated no significant evidence of asymmetry (t(9) = − 2.1,p= 0.065), suggesting the absence of substantial publication bias.

Forest plot for the point prevalence of suicidal thoughts (11 studies, 7047 subjects).

Based on 7 studies (5772 subjects), the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal plans was 5.6% [95% CI: 2.35%–12.8%] (Figure5). Statistical heterogeneity was high (I2= 97.9%). A sensitivity analysis conducted by excluding one study which was based on a clinical population reduced the pooled prevalence value down to 4.7% (95% CI: 1.8%–12%). However, when only the student populations (k= 3) were considered, the prevalence was 11.2% (95% CI: 5.2%–22.3%). Moderator analysis and Egger's test were not performed due to the limited number of studies.

Forest plot for the lifetime prevalence of suicidal plans (7 studies, 5772 subjects).

Five studies reported the 12‐month prevalence of suicidal plans. The pooled prevalence rate was 5.2% [95% CI: 3.1%–8.8%] (Figure6). A considerable degree of heterogeneity was noted (I2= 82.1%). When only the student populations (k= 3) were considered, the prevalence was 7.3% (95% CI: 6.7%–8.1%). Moderator analysis and Egger's test were not performed due to the limited number of studies.

Forest plot for the 12‐month prevalence of suicidal plans (5 studies, 6218 subjects).

There were no studies reporting the point prevalence of suicidal plans.

The lifetime prevalence of suicidal attempts was reported in 15 studies (11,699 subjects). The pooled prevalence rate was 7% [95% CI: 4.3%–11.1%] (Figure7). The degree of heterogeneity was high (I2= 95.4%). Prevalence rates were not moderated by the year of publication (b= 0.477, SE = 0.278,z= 1.714,p= 0.0864), mean age (b= −0.0323, SE = 0.0258,z= −1.2506,p= 0.211), or male percentage (b= 0.02, SE = 0.0115,z= 1.7302,p= 0.084) in the individual studies. A sensitivity analysis conducted by excluding one study based on a clinical population changed the pooled prevalence rate only slightly to 6.9% (95% CI: 4.1%–11.4%). However, when only the three high‐quality studies with relevant data were retained in a sensitivity analysis, the pooled prevalence dropped to 4.3% (95% CI: 2.2%–8.2%). The prevalence was higher (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.7%–12.5%) when only student populations were considered. Egger's linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry indicated no significant evidence of asymmetry (t(13) = − 0.32,p= 0.743), suggesting the absence of substantial publication bias.

Forest plot for the lifetime prevalence of attempts (15 studies, 11,699 subjects).

According to 7 studies (8107 subjects) reporting the 12‐month prevalence of suicidal attempts, the pooled prevalence rate was 3.9% [95% CI: 2.8%–5.3%] (Figure8). High heterogeneity was observed (I2= 88.2%). The prevalence was similar (3.9%; 95% CI: 2.7%–5.8%) in the subset of studies representing student populations (k= 4). Moderator analysis and Egger's test were not performed due to the limited number of studies.

Forest plot for the 12‐month prevalence of suicidal attempts (7 studies, 8107 subjects).

There were no studies reporting the point prevalence of suicide attempts.

As per the modified NOS, the quality assessment score ranged from 4 to 8. Among the 34 studies, 9 (26.5%) had scores supporting high‐quality categorization, and the rest 25 (73.5%) studies had scores for categorization of moderate quality (Supporting Information S1: FileS1). Studies were missing criteria of truly representative sample and comparability in the section domain, whereas studies properly mentioned the statistical appropriateness.

This meta‐analysis revealed that the pooled life‐time prevalence of suicidal thoughts (15 studies), plans (7 studies), and attempts (15 studies) was 24.2%, 5.6%, and 7% respectively; the corresponding rates during a 12‐month period were 15%, 5.2%, and 3.9% respectively. The point prevalence (1 month) of suicidal thoughts was 6.7%. It indicates that about one in four persons had thoughts of killing themselves at some point during life‐time, more than 60% of them had the thoughts during the past year of investigation, and about 30% of them had the thoughts during the past month of investigation. The rate of suicide plans was found to be relatively stable during life‐time and 1‐year duration. The rate of suicide attempts during a year was about half that of the life‐time rate.

The life‐time prevalence of attempts being higher than plans may indicate impulsive suicide attempts in Bangladesh in response to immediate life events, which is a prominent feature in Bangladesh [50]. A previous meta‐analysis found similar rates of suicidal thoughts among students in Bangladesh, which was 24% during life‐time, 13% during the past year, and 7% during the current period of study [51]. It also found higher rates of suicide plans (6% lifetime, 8% last year) than the current study. It revealed 9% of the students had suicide attempts in their lifetime, which is higher than this study, and 4% had attempts during the last month, which is similar to this study. These variations could be explained by the inclusion of samples from various groups. Perhaps, due to the young age, the rate of suicide plans is higher among students. A cross‐national study with participants from 17 countries found the prevalence of life‐time suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts was 9.2%, 3.1%, and 2.7% respectively [52]. The rates are higher compared to rates noted in Ethiopia, where the prevalence of suicidal thoughts was 9% and attempts 4% in a year [53]. The life‐time rate of suicidal thoughts was 20%, plans 2.1%, and attempts 5.7% in India, which is lower than the current study [54]. The life‐time rate of suicidal thoughts was 16.7%, plans 7.4%, and attempts 4.9% in Australia [55]. The prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behavior was 4.3% in a year among adult populations in the USA, which is significantly lower than the current study [56]. At the same time, the suicide rate is significantly higher in the USA, Australia, and India than in Bangladesh [57]. Several possibilities can be considered, like over‐representation of suicidal behavior in Bangladesh, which can be attributed to the use of improper measurement tools, low conversion of suicidal behaviors to suicide, and under‐reporting of suicide in Bangladesh. Further studies are warranted to answer these questions.

The findings have several implications. Firstly, the rates of suicidal behavior are high in Bangladesh, which warrants preventive measures. Attention from all stakeholders is needed to identify the potential risk factors and preventive measures. Psychosocial risk factors should be evaluated properly to understand the gravity of the problem. It is important to note that Bangladesh has no national surveillance system for suicidal behavior and no national suicide prevention strategy [58]. Secondly, the rates of suicidal behavior in Bangladesh are higher than in the USA, Australia, India, and Ethiopia; however, the rate of suicide is significantly lower than in these countries [53,55,56,57]. This may raise concerns of potential methodological errors while assessing suicidal behavior in the studies, as two nationwide studies with well‐accepted measures revealed lower rates [29,37]. The development of culture‐sensitive instruments for measuring suicidal behavior could be a remedial measure. Psychometric adaptation and cultural validation of already available measurement tools (e.g., SBQ‐R or SIDAS) should be attempted in further studies. Additionally, differentiating self‐harm without an intention to die from suicidal behavior could be a problematic issue in estimating the rates precisely. Thirdly, the conversion rate from thoughts to suicide attempts and suicide is lower, even though we only included cross‐sectional studies. Longitudinal studies are needed to measure it precisely. Under‐reporting and misclassification of suicide could be another possibility as the quality of suicide data is poor due to social stigma and enduring cultural norms related to suicidal behavior [7,59,60]. Another possibility could be the influence of religion, as Islamic beliefs have a protective role in suicide [61,62]. It has been noted in a meta‐analysis that rates of suicidal behaviors (thoughts and attempts) were higher in Bangladesh and Indonesia than in India and Nepal, whereas the rates of suicide were lower in Islamic countries [51].

This analysis has several limitations. Firstly, more than 70% of the studies were conducted among urban areas where only about 30% of the population live. The lifestyle, stress pattern, and resilience are different in urban and rural populations. Secondly, there is an over‐representation of students in the studies, as 50% of the studies were conducted among students. The dynamics of life significantly vary between students and other people. Thirdly, measurement of suicidal behavior varies among the studies in respect of items and instruments, which may contribute to biases in reporting. Fourthly, there may be concerns regarding the intention of the attempt among the study populations, which is an important source of under‐estimation or overestimation of the rates. Fifthly, enduring high stigma and low suicide literacy may produce under‐reporting of the behaviors, specially in cases where data were collected by self‐reporting measures. Additionally, social desirability bias may produce under‐reporting of suicidal behavior. Sixthly, we used broad search terms that vary in the cases of searching in PubMed and Scopus, with the searches in Google Scholar and BanglaJOL, which may be a source of selection biases.

The rates of suicidal behavior are high in Bangladesh, as about one in four persons has had suicidal thoughts, and about one in fourteen persons has attempted suicide during their lifetime. Assessment of conversion from suicidal thoughts to attempts could be a major area of further research to understand the precise implications of the rates. Attention from multiple stakeholders is warranted to ensure preventive measures in Bangladesh.
