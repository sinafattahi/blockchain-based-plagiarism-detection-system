Monocytes serve as the first line of defense against pathogen invasion in the host. It has been reported that patients with HBV-ACLF exhibit functional imbalances in the intrahepatic and peripheral monocytes.[1,2]However, these research on monocyte has yielded contradictory results. Therefore, clarifying the precise dysfunction of monocytes and its underlying mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for immunotherapy in ACLF.

Patients with HBV-ACLF exhibit excessive and persistent hepatic and systemic inflammation, potentially driven by over-activated monocytes, which may exacerbate organ failure and increase mortality risk.[1]In response to acute liver injury during the initiation of HBV-ACLF, the injured liver immediately releases various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, histones, IL-33, and inflammatory oxylipids, which interact with monocytes and/or macrophages via specific binding to pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on the surface of monocytes, including TLR4 and ST2, resulting in immune activation[3,4]. Moreover, pathogens invading through the respiratory tract or a compromised intestinal barrier, the most common extrahepatic trigger for ACLF, can generate a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as LPS, which also activate monocytesviaPRRs.[4]Although the functions of DAMPs and PAMPs are not identical, they collectively activate the monocytes and complicate the mechanism of ACLF.

These studies revealed that monocytes may play a dual role in the progression of HBV-ACLF. In the early stage, monocytes are rapidly activated into a pro-inflammatory state by exposed to DAMPs and PAMPs, leading to systemic inflammation and exacerbating multi-organ damage. Under prolonged stimulation by multiple pro-inflammatory factors, monocytes shift toward an immunosuppressive phenotype, which ultimately lead to secondary infections or sepsis. It is worth noting that both excessive immune activation and immune suppression are closely associated with poor prognosis in ACLF patients (Figure 1).

The dysfunction of monocyte in the development of HBV-ACLF. PAMP: pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMP: damage-associated molecular patterns; HBV-ACLF: HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure; CCL: C-C motif chemokine ligand; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL: interleukin; HLA: human leukocyte antigen.

In summary, reshaping the immune homeostasis of monocytes may be a potential therapeutic target for ACLF. Given the considerable heterogeneity in severity and disease staging among HBV-ACLF patients, it is critical to investigate the evolutionary patterns of monocyte dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms, identify precise diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and provide an immunological foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of HBV-ACLF.
