We extend the generic Bell inequalities suggested by Son, Lee, and Kim [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 060406 (2006)] to incorporate multiple observables for tripartite systems and introduce a geometric methodology for calculating classical upper bounds of the inequalities. Our method transforms the problem of finding the classical upper bounds into identifying constraints in linear congruence relations. Using this approach, we derive the upper bounds for scenarios with three and four observables per party. In order to demonstrate quantum violations, we employ Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states that can achieve values exceeding the classical upper bounds, with the violation becoming more pronounced as the number of observables increases.

Bell derived a constraint, in terms of statistical inequality, on correlations for two remote systems that local realistic theories must obey, and he showed that the constraint can be violated by quantum mechanics in case of two coupled spin-1/2 particles and suitable local measurements1. This is known as Bell’s theorem, which states that local realistic theories cannot completely simulate quantum correlations. Later, Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH) improved Bell’s original idea by proposing a statistical inequality that is more experimentally feasible2. Following these theoretical developments, significant experimental efforts were undertaken to empirically verify the predictions of Bell’s theorem across various physical platforms (for historical review, see Ref.3). Notably in 2015 and 2017 loophole-free Bell tests were successfully implemented in different physical platforms4–7. Studying Bell inequalities has thus become fundamental to illustrating the profound differences between quantum mechanics and classical physics. Nowadays, it is well established that violations of Bell inequalities are essential for enabling various quantum information protocols to outperform their classical counterparts, such as random number generation, quantum key distribution, reducing communication complexity, and so on8, driving extensive research across both theoretical and experimental domains3. Recently, violations of Bell inequalities become central to self-testing, where certifying a unique quantum entangled state and local observables for quantum violations, as well as the corresponding classical upper bounds, is essential for constructing self-testing in a device-independent manner9–13.

The simplest case of Bell’s theorem involves two spin-1/2 particles, where each subsystem is measured with two observables, and each observable yields two possible outcomes. This scenario can be represented using the notation (N,M,d), whereNdenotes the number of subsystems,Mrepresents the number of observables per subsystem, anddspecifies the number of outcomes per observable. Under this notation, the cases considered by Bell and CHSH correspond to. Since Bell’s discovery, many efforts have been devoted to extending Bell inequalities to more general scenarios, including multi-particle systems and configurations with more measurement outcomes. These investigations have led to significant progress in generalizing Bell inequalities to diverse physical contexts. For the (N, 2, 2) case, Mermin, Ardehali, Belinskii, and Klyshko derived a set of inequalities14–16. For the (2, 2,d) case, Collins, Gisin, Linden, Massar, and Popescu proposed inequalities17, demonstrating that quantum violations increase with the dimensionality of the Hilbert space, consistent with numerical results18. Extending this to the (N, 2,d) case, Son, Lee, and Kim (SLK) proposed a set of Bell inequalities, referred to as generic in their work19, meaning that these inequalities are derived from the all-versus-nothing contradiction introduced by Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ)20. Beyond this, significant research efforts have been devoted to generalizing Bell inequalities to various other scenarios21–26.

While the SLK inequalities addressed the case of, they left open the question of extending the approach to arbitraryM. In this paper, we generalize the SLK inequalities to incorporate multiple observables for tripartite systems, focusing on the cases ofand, while also discussing arbitrary values ofM. This extension is particularly significant because the original SLK inequalities withare unable to demonstrate the quantum violations in odd-dimensional systems. Although a variant form of the SLK inequality was proposed to overcome this issue, it no longer retains the generic property of the original construction. In contrast, our generalization with increased values ofMnot only overcomes this limitation but also preserves the generic structure of the inequalities. As a result, it enables the detection of quantum violations in previously inaccessible odd-dimensional cases. To this end, we first propose a quantum operator involving multiple observables for calculating the quantum expectation values, and demonstrate the expectation values obtained by maximally entangled states. Then, to establish the quantum violations, we prove that no local realistic description can achieve these quantum values. In principle, the classical upper bounds can be calculated by analyzing the structure of the convex polytope under the local realistic description. However, this method becomes computationally intractable for multipartite and high-dimensional systems. In order to calculate the upper bounds, we introduce a geometric methodology. Our method transforms the problem of finding the upper bounds into identifying constraints in linear congruence relations. Although the quantum violations forwere previously established in Ref.27, we rederive these results using our geometric method, obtaining consistent results and thereby demonstrating the versatility of our approach. Our generalized Bell inequality can also be considered a generic Bell inequality because its underlying derivation is based on the all-versus-nothing contradiction shown in Ref.28. The geometric approach is not intended for a direct comparison with polytope-based methods in terms of computational efficiency, but rather offers conceptual and structural insights into the local realistic bounds.

whereis an orthonormal basis set. Ind-dimensional Hilbert space, an orthogonal measurement is represented by an operatorwith an eigenvalueand an eigenvector. For the observables of the higher dimensional systems, we shall use the unitary observable, which have been widely employed in Bell’s theorem investigations for higher dimensional systems17,19,27,29,30. To this end, the observable operatoris assumed to take, as its eigenvalue, one of the values in, where the values represent thedth roots of unity over the complex field, i.e.,. Then, it turns out that the operatoris unitary30.

To generate a set ofMdistinct observables, we utilize phase valuesin the range. In case of, the operatorforreduces thein Eq. (2) andreduces thein Eq. (4).

This result follows from the fact that the generalized GHZ state is an eigenstate of the composite observablesin Eq. (9), as further elaborated in Ref.28. In the Supplementary Information  S2, we show that the generalized GHZ state is the eigenstate of the Generic Bell operator.

Here we employ alternative notations with,, and, wherea,b, andcindicate the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd observables, respectively, and the subscriptjdenotes thejth party. In other words, these correspond to the following replacements:,, and. The maximum ofdepends on, which satisfies the constraint. When, the classical upper bound becomes, which is equivalent to the quantum upper bound, resulting in no quantum violation. Consequently, the quantum violations can be observed whenever.

and it consists of four delta functions with variablesand. It is shown that no values ofandcan simultaneously satisfy all four delta functions, with three being the maximum number that can be satisfied19. Consequently, the classical upper bound equals. We reproduce the result by using our geometrical approach.

Consider a square with eight vertices depicted in Fig.1a. Each vertex represents an integer valueor, and each solid line corresponds to one of the four delta functions in Eq. (16). Vertices connected by dotted lines are constrained to have identical values.

(b) Value assignment showing that at most three delta functions can be simultaneously satisfied. The variables in the blue lines indicate solutions satisfying the corresponding delta functions from the left diagram, while following the circular path clockwise leads to the red line which represents a constraint that cannot be satisfied, proving that all four delta function cannot be satisfied simultaneously. This geometric approach demonstrates the classical upper bound as 3d/4 - 1.

Finally, the delta functionbecomes, indicated by the red arrow.

The last delta function cannot equal unity for evend-dimensional system by Theorem1. The linear congruencehas no solution for evendbecauseand, where the notationindicates thatadoes not divideb. Consequently,, thus the maximum number of delta functions that can simultaneously equal unity is 3, establishing that.

where. Let. Then the linear congruence has a solution if and only ifbis divisible byg.

A key aspect of our method is the closed loop, wherein values are assigned in consecutive order to satisfy each delta function, ultimately yielding an incompatible constraint. This approach remains valid regardless of the initial assignment point, due to the permutation symmetries inherent in the linear congruence relations of the delta functions.

Finally, the delta functionis reduced to, indicated by the red arrow.

According to Theorem1, the linear congruence of the last delta function,, has no solution for, wherekis an integer. This implies that, and consequently only five delta functions, indicated by the blue lines, can equal unity. This result indicates the quantum violation since it establishes. However, to calculate the classical upper bound, we can examine the remaining three delta functions to obtain the exact upper bound. The remaining delta functions, denoted by circled numbers,, and, contain an undetermined variable. With the assigned variables by the closed loop analysis, the three delta functions are reduced as follows:,, and. Note that no values of, andexist for which all three delta functions equal to unity simultaneously, instead at most two delta functions can be satisfied concurrently. Consequently, there exists a solution of,, andthat satisfies at most seven out of the nine delta functions. The classical upper bound of the generic Bell inequality for the (3, 3,d) system is, which contradicts the quantum upper bound. The second and third loops in Fig.2b and c yield the identical results, confirming that at most seven delta functions can simultaneously equal unity.

(a)–(c) Three distinct loops generate the constraints, confirming that at most seven delta functions can simultaneously equal unity.

In order to apply the closed loop analysis, we employ an octagonal shape depicted in Fig.3. All sixteen delta functions are represented by the solid lines in Fig.3. Note that the sixteen delta functions can be categorized into four groups and each group has the same structure as that of (3, 2,d) system in Eq. (16). Therefore, the four delta functions in each group cannot all be unity for evend-dimensional system, with at most three delta functions being able to equal unity. Figure3a–d represent the closed loops corresponding to each group of the delta functions, and each red line indicates the constraint delta function. Consequently, the, and thus the classical upper bound of the generic Bell inequality for the (3, 4,d) system can be calculated as. This also can be violated by the quantum upper bound of.

As each group has the equivalent structure individually, the classical upper bound from one group is essential to calculate the total values of the classical upper bound.

withand. Finding a closed loop from our geometrical method can lead to the condition. The theoretical framework established in Ref.28proved the existence of the constraints in the form of linear congruences for arbitrary values ofM. Specifically, these constraints exist when the dimensiondsatisfies the relation, wherekis an integer. This suggests that suitable geometric structures with closed loops can always be identified for arbitrary numbers of observables. Consequently, the quantum violations can be demonstrated in principle, although calculating precise classical upper bounds requires a more comprehensive analysis of the complete set of delta function combinations and their corresponding constraint relations.

We have demonstrated quantum violations of generic Bell inequalities involving multiple observables beyond the two-observable scenario. We constructed observable operators for each subsystem by employing quantum Fourier transformation and phase shift operations. Using these observables, we proposed generic Bell operators for systems with three and four observables per party, extending the original Son-Lee-Kim framework19. A key contribution of our work is the introduction of a geometric methodology that enables systematic calculation of the upper bounds based on local hidden variables for the generic Bell inequalities. Through this approach, we established quantum violations for the (3, 3,d) case whenand for the (3, 4,d) case with even dimensionsd. Our approach can be extended to arbitrary values ofM, where we expect the quantum violations to exist for dimensions satisfying, withkbeing an integer. Notably, our Bell operators consistently achieve a quantum upper bound ofusing the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Finally, we remark that it would be worth exploring the application of our geometric methodology to calculate the exact classical upper bounds for the generic Bell inequalities with arbitrary numbers of observables, which may further illuminate the fundamental boundary between quantum and classical physics.
