This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a biosimilar Laronidase (CinnaGen Company, Iran), compared to the reference Laronidase (Aldurazyme, BioMarin, USA) in maintaining urinary glycosaminoglycan (uGAG) levels in mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) patients. In this phase III, open-label, single-sequence, and cross-over study, MPS I patients received Aldurazyme for 12 weeks, followed by Laronidase (CinnaGen) for another 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the assessment of mean uGAG levels at the final visits of each medication administration. The secondary outcomes included the assessment of 6-minute walking test (6MWT), predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), enzyme activity assay, and adverse events (AEs). Twelve patients with mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 10.25 ± 3.11 years were included in the study. The mean (± SD) uGAG level was 220.47 ± 177.13 CPC unit/g creatinine at the end of Aldurazyme treatment and changed to 270.02 ± 111.55 CPC unit/g creatinine at the end of Laronidase (CinnaGen) treatment, with variable patient responses. The mean 6MWT and predicted FVC improved by almost 30 m and 13%, respectively. Post-infusion enzyme activity levels showed similar patterns between Aldurazyme and Laronidase (CinnaGen), with no detectable activity before the infusion. A total of 30 AEs were reported during the trial. In the first time period (receiving Aldurazyme), AEs were reported for seven patients (58.33%), and in the subsequent time period (receiving Laronidase (CinnaGen)), AEs were reported for six patients (50%). Among all, nasopharyngitis was the most common reported AE. In conclusion, the biosimilar Laronidase was shown to have a comparable efficacy and safety profile compared with the reference Laronidase.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), a crucial enzyme responsible for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)1. GAGs are long chains of sugar molecules found throughout the body. When their metabolism is impaired due to insufficient IDUA, they accumulate in various tissues, leading to a spectrum of health issues, including organomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, cardiovascular complications, respiratory issues, and neurological decline1–3. The accumulation of GAGs in cells and tissues leads to their excessive urinary excretion, a hallmark feature of the disease. This characteristic serves as a rapid screening tool to aid in diagnosis4,5. The MPS I spectrum is classified into two broad groups, including attenuated MPS I (Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes) and severe MPS I (Hurler syndrome), with a wide range of phenotypes in between6,7. The estimated prevalence of MPS I ranges from 1 in 100,000 (for severe forms) to 1 in 500,000 (for non-severe forms) live births, with significant variability across different populations8.

The accumulation of GAGs, including heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, leads to multi-organ failure if left untreated. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes1. Aldurazyme (Laronidase), the first FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for MPS I, has been a cornerstone in managing the disease. Laronidase, a recombinant form of IDUA, works by providing an external source of the deficient enzyme, facilitating the breakdown of accumulated GAGs and alleviating some of the clinical manifestations of MPS I. While ERT does not cure the disease, it has been shown to improve organ function, reduce urinary GAG (uGAG) levels, and enhance quality of life9,10. Although Aldurazyme offers several benefits, its high cost remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for more affordable alternatives and the development of biosimilars, which can provide lower costs while preserving therapeutic efficacy. A biosimilar is a biological product that closely resembles an authorized reference product in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy. This similarity is established through comprehensive assessments, including analytical and clinical studies. The active substance must have the same amino acid sequence as the reference product, and any minor differences in inactive components should not affect therapeutic performance11.

However, in the context of rare diseases such as MPS I, conducting equivalency or non-inferiority studies for biosimilars presents significant challenges. Given the limited patient population, it is often not feasible to conduct adequately powered, randomized controlled trials that directly compare the biosimilar with the reference biologic. Consequently, regulatory agencies typically adopt alternative approaches, including the recruitment of accessible patients to compare efficacy and safety. This paradigm shift recognizes the ethical and logistical challenges of studying rare diseases. It seeks to balance patient access to potentially life-saving therapies with the rigorous evaluation of biosimilar safety and efficacy.

A biosimilar version of Laronidase was developed by CinnaGen Company, Iran. Like the reference product (Aldurazyme), Laronidase (CinnaGen) is expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines, ensuring consistency in post-translational modifications critical to therapeutic activity. A thorough comparability exercise was performed prior to initiating the clinical trial, encompassing analytical characterization, structural integrity, biological activity, glycosylation profiles, impurity profiles, and stability—in addition to manufacturing process consistency and process validation aligned with international standards.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this biosimilar Laronidase in maintaining the uGAG levels and clinical efficacy within the ranges provided by Aldurazyme in patients with MPS I, as well as assessing its safety profile.

This phase III, open-label, single-sequence, cross-over study was conducted in four centers in Iran. Patients aged between 5 and 18 years and diagnosed with MPS I were eligible for the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: prior bone marrow transplantation or being a candidate for receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); prior tracheotomy; being naïve to Laronidase; acute hydrocephalus; abnormal renal function determined by measuring serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels; any severe organic disease that was not associated with MPS I; known hypersensitivity to Laronidase or components of the Laronidase solution; presence of any medical condition or other circumstances that could significantly interfere with study compliance; pregnancy and lactation; and administration of any investigational drug within 30 days before study enrollment.

Written informed consent was obtained from all legal guardians of the patients. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (IR.TUMS.TIPS.REC.1401.001), and was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06406153).

The subjects received Aldurazyme for 12 weeks (week 0–11) at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg, followed by Laronidase (CinnaGen) for an additional 12 weeks (week 12–23) at the same dose. The final visit (week 24) was for the patient follow-up. The patients received premedication with antipyretics and/or antihistamines one hour before the infusion started.

The primary outcome of the study was to compare the mean uGAG levels at weeks 8, 10, and 12 (uGAG1; related to Aldurazyme) with the mean uGAG levels at weeks 20, 22, and 24 (uGAG2; related to Laronidase (CinnaGen)). For the uGAG level assessment, 50 mL of the patient’s urine samples were collected before the medication infusion, and the cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) method was performed on the samples. Age-specific uGAG normal levels are shown in Supplementary TableS1.

The secondary outcomes were the assessment of changes in 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), comparing the enzyme activity level at the last visit of each period, and the assessment of the adverse events (AEs).

For the enzyme activity assay, blood samples were collected from the patients before the infusion, immediately post-infusion, at 30 min, and 90 min after the infusion. Laronidase activity was measured in dried blood spot (DBS) samples using 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-L-iduronide free acid as a synthetic substrate. The blood was extracted from the DBS samples and incubated with the substrate for 20 h at 37 °C. The reaction was then stopped using a glycine carbonate buffer, and fluorescence intensity was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 450 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity was quantified using a standard curve generated from dilutions of 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), the reaction product12.

Safety assessments were performed during the study, and all AEs were categorized utilizing the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)13employing both System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) for classification. The severity of the reported AEs was determined using the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)14. Additionally, serious adverse events (SAEs) were documented according to the (E2B(R2)) guideline15. The causal relationship of AEs was evaluated following the criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO)16.

Considering the study design, all reported AEs were assessed based on the study periods (period 1: week 0–11 receiving Aldurazyme, period 2: week 12–23 receiving Laronidase (CinnaGen)).

Due to the rarity and genetic complexity of MPS I, we were able to enroll only 12 patients in this study, which resulted in considerable limitations in statistical power. As a consequence of the small sample size, formal statistical tests, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-values, were not applicable. Therefore, non-inferiority or equivalency testing could not be performed. The main aim of this study was to demonstrate whether the biosimilar Laronidase preserves the clinical effects of Aldurazyme, thereby supporting the concept of comparability in terms of efficacy and safety. In this context, the primary focus was on assessing the clinical impact of the biosimilar treatment, including its ability to provide therapeutic benefits similar to those of the reference product, Aldurazyme.

Given the small cohort, statistical methods were not appropriate, thus a descriptive analysis was employed to highlight individual patient trends and observe clinical outcomes. While we acknowledge the significance of statistical rigor in clinical research, the design and conduct of this study were centered on providing clinical evidence that biosimilar Laronidase could serve as a viable alternative to Aldurazyme for MPS I patients, offering comparable therapeutic benefits. All statistical calculations were performed using STATA version 14.0.

A total of 12 patients were enrolled in the study, all receiving Aldurazyme (12 weeks) and Laronidase (CinnaGen) (12 weeks). One patient (patient number 11) was expired after week 9 (Fig.1). The demographics and baseline characteristics of the participants are shown in Table1.

The enzyme activity assay was conducted at the final visits of each medication administration (weeks 11 and 23) at four timepoints. Prior to infusion, the enzyme activity was undetectable in all individuals (< 0.1 µmol/h/L of blood). Following Aldurazyme infusion, mean (± SD) enzyme activity levels (µmol/h/L of blood) were 36.06 ± 14.06, 17.49 ± 16.00, and 14.08 ± 19.04, immediately, at 30 min, and 90 min post infusion, respectively. It was also 33.27 ± 16.00, 18.35 ± 12.55, and 8.75 ± 10.96 at the same respective timepoints after Laronidase (CinnaGen) infusion. The individual enzyme activity data are presented in Table3.

During the two study periods, a total of 30 AEs were reported. Table4demonstrates a comprehensive record of all AEs during the 24 weeks for each patient. Notably, no AE was reported during the 24th week. Most of the AEs were assessed as grade 1 or 2 and non-serious. Furthermore, they were mostly attributed to the underlying disease rather than treatment. According to the findings, six and four patients experienced at least one AE at periods 1 and 2, respectively.

Adverse events reported per patient during the study.

According to the results, nasopharyngitis was the most commonly reported AE, which was reported by five patients in period 1 and by four patients in period 2. Most of the reported AEs were considered to have ‘unlikely’ and ‘unrelated’ causal relationships with the intervention.

Based on the findings, infusion-related reactions, which were probable/likely related to the treatment, were assessed as grade 1 or 2.

Two SAEs were reported during the study. One of the patients developed an AE as a result of ingesting the fruit. The patient was hospitalized due to foreign body aspiration and sinusitis at week 13 (period 2, Laronidase (CinnaGen)). Based on the investigator’s opinion, foreign body aspiration and sinusitis had ‘unrelated’ and ‘unlikely’ causal relationships with the treatment, respectively. Another reported SAE resulted in death, and was attributed to the patient’s pre-existing condition. This patient was suffering from significant medical challenges associated with MPS I during the study. Furthermore, the patient experienced airway disorders and peripheral edema. The underlying MPS I conditions progressed to pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and obstructive airways disorder, ultimately leading to the patient’s death at week 9 (period 1: Aldurazyme). Based on the investigator’s opinion, this event had an ‘unrelated’ causal relationship to the treatment.

The results of this study showed that although there were fluctuations in uGAG levels (187.9 CPC unit/g creatinine at baseline, 220.47 CPC unit/g creatinine after Aldurazyme treatment, and 270.02 CPC unit/g creatinine after Laronidase (CinnaGen) treatment), Laronidase (CinnaGen) was able to effectively maintain the uGAG levels stable, as the magnitude of the increase in uGAG levels was not clinically considerable. It is noteworthy that despite the moderate numerical increase in uGAG levels observed between the Aldurazyme and Laronidase (CinnaGen) periods, no corresponding clinical deterioration was noted in patients’ physical function, respiratory capacity, or overall health status. On the contrary, the 6MWT and predicted FVC values showed mild improvement over the same period.

The absence of validated thresholds for clinically important changes in uGAG levels for MPS I patients limits the ability to interpret fluctuations strictly based on numerical values. In this context, we considered the trajectory of each patient’s uGAG levels in conjunction with their clinical status.

The potential inter-patient variabilities in uGAG levels, could be influenced by factors such as disease activity, prior treatment, genotype, and differences in timing of urine sampling. Another reason for the fluctuations in the uGAG levels in this study could be the presence and development of anti-drug antibodies. As observed in the phase III study of the enzyme, most patients developed antibodies; however, these antibodies did not affect the clinical outcomes despite their impact on uGAG levels17. Antibody measurement was not conducted in the present study, as according to the drug monograph and previous studies, antibodies are developed in almost all patients17–19. Furthermore, given the cross-over study design and the uncertainty surrounding antibody development timing, it would be impossible to determine which product induced the antibody response.

In our trial, a formal washout phase was not implemented, as ERT in patients with MPS I—particularly those already stabilized on Aldurazyme—would not have been ethically acceptable. Interrupting treatment could lead to biochemical rebound and clinical deterioration, especially given the progressive nature of the disease. Instead, we ensured that each treatment phase lasted at least 12 weeks, exceeding the known tissue half-life of the enzyme (~ 6 days), which allowed sufficient time for meaningful evaluation of drug-specific effects. The purpose of the initial 12-week Aldurazyme period was to ensure standardized dosing and establish a consistent treatment effects prior to switching.

In a case report of an MPS I patient whose ERT was discontinued for two months, a significant increase in uGAG level was observed from 142 mg/g creatinine at the time of ERT discontinuation to 631 mg/g creatinine (more than 4-fold increase) at 6 weeks after ERT discontinuation20. Also, in the phase III and dose optimization studies of Aldurazyme, the greatest decrease in the amount of uGAG was observed in the first three to four weeks of treatment, and after that, fluctuations in the levels of uGAG and sometimes a slight increase in its amount were recorded, which is consistent with the results of this study17,21.

In our trial, assessments were performed much longer than the tissue half-lives after switching from Aldurazyme to the biosimilar, which minimizes any residual pharmacological effect. Importantly, we did not observe a rebound increase in uGAG, which would be expected if the biosimilar was ineffective and prior Aldurazyme effects were wearing off. This supports the conclusion that the biosimilar maintained biochemical efficacy. Had our biosimilar been ineffective, we would have expected a surge in uGAG levels after switching from Aldurazyme. The absence of such marked rebound supports therapeutic effect.

Although the 6MWT and predicted FVC values showed a numerical increase over the course of the study, these changes were deemed not clinically meaningful. This assessment was based on the absence of consistent, observable improvements in patients’ daily functioning or respiratory status as reported by patients and caregivers. Given the lack of established minimal clinically important difference values for these parameters in MPS I patients, we relied on clinical judgment to interpret the findings. In this context, the modest changes observed were not considered to reflect a meaningful enhancement in functional capacity or pulmonary performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the two medications worked similarly.

The enzyme activity assay conducted during the final visits of Aldurazyme and Laronidase (CinnaGen) administration showed no considerable difference between the two medications. Enzyme activity level was undetectable before infusions, then peaked immediately after infusion and gradually declined at 30 and 90 min. The mean enzyme activity levels at various timepoints post-infusion were comparable for both medications.

Based on the safety results, it appears that there was no difference in the safety profile between the two study periods. Furthermore, the individual safety results between Laronidase (CinnaGen) and Aldurazyme were comparable, and both medications were well tolerated.

There are several limitations in this study. First, it was conducted in a single country with a limited number of patients, focusing on a rare disease. Based on available cases, we set the sample size at 12, making statistical analysis unfeasible. Moreover, we preferred not to include both naïve and non-naïve patients in the study, as the treatment responses differ considerably between these two populations and the study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a biosimilar Laronidase in maintaining the uGAG levels and clinical efficacy within the ranges provided by Aldurazyme. Including both naïve and previously treated patients would have introduced considerable heterogeneity in treatment response, making interpretation more difficult. Additionally, the majority of eligible patients were already on Aldurazyme as part of routine care, and the availability of truly naïve patients was extremely limited. Another limitation pertains to the endpoints of the study. We do not anticipate dramatic changes or progress in clinical measures as a result of drug usage. Typically, significant changes occur at the start of the treatment, with medications primarily serving to slow disease progression thereafter. Additionally, due to the rare nature of the diseases and the resulting low sample size, performing an equivalency or non-inferiority analysis was not feasible. However, we assessed the ability of Laronidase (CinnaGen) in maintaining the effects provided by Aldurazyme, which was the only way to compare these two medications in the context of this rare disease.

Future studies in real-world settings, including treatment-naïve patients, are recommended to assess the effectiveness of the biosimilar product at the initiation of treatment.

According to the results, Laronidase (CinnaGen) successfully maintained the clinical benefits previously established by Aldurazyme. Additionally, the safety profiles of both products were comparable, demonstrating that Laronidase (CinnaGen) is a viable alternative to Aldurazyme for maintaining therapeutic efficacy and safety in MPS I patients.

Given its comparable efficacy and safety profile—combined with better accessibility and lower cost—Laronidase (CinnaGen) represents a particularly valuable treatment option for Iranian MPS I patients, addressing critical challenges of affordability and availability in this population.
