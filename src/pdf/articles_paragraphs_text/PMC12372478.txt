The personalized cancer vaccine EVX-01 (Evaxion) combined with the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab induced an overall response rate (ORR) of 69% after two years, with tumor reduction in 15 of 16 subjects with advanced melanoma enrolled in a Phase 2 trial.

EVX-01 is a liposome-adjuvanted recombinant vaccine consisting of neoantigen-derived peptides identified by the PIONEER artificial intelligence prediction platform.

The melanoma vaccine iSCIB1+ (Scancell), combined with PD-1 and CTLA-4 ICIs nivolumab and ipilimumab induced a 70% ORR in patients with advanced unresectable melanoma, compared to 50% typically seen following ICI treatment alone. The Phase 2 SCOPE trial also reported a 90% disease-control rate and 18% complete response rate.

iSCIB1+ is a DNA vaccine encoding an IgG antibody modified with the melanoma-associated antigens gp100 and TRP2.

The influenza nucleoprotein-targeting vaccine OVX836 (Osivax) was safe and induced specific antibody and cell-based responses in a Phase 2a trial involving 180 healthy adults up to 55 years old.1OVX836 was tested both alone and with the licensed seasonal influenza vaccine Fluarix Tetra.

OVX836 targets the internal nucleoprotein antigen, which is much more conserved across influenza strains compared to the surface antigens targeted by traditional vaccines.

The HPV-specific IL-2 immunotherapeutic CUE-101 (Cue Biopharma) combined with pembrolizumab induced a 50% ORR in subjects with recurrent metastatic HPV-positive head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, compared to historical control of pembrolizumab alone, in an open-label, dose escalation Phase 1 trial.

CUE-101 elicits T-cell responses by combining the E7 antigen from the HPV16 strain with the immune-stimulating cytokine IL-2.

The European Commission has granted marketing approval to the autologous CAR-T cell regimen obecabtagene autoleucel (Aucatzyl, Autolus Therapeutics) for subjects over 26 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The decision is based on results of the Phase 1/2 FELIX trial, which reported a complete response rate of 77% in the experimental group. Obecabtagene autoleucel targets the B-cell antigen CD19.

The dsRNA-based TLR3 agonist rintatolimod (Ampligen, AIM ImmunoTech) combined with the PD-L1 ICI durvalumab induced a 64% overall survival rate in 14 metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with stable disease enrolled in a Phase 2 trial.

The treatment was well tolerated, with three subjects reporting no disease progression.

Rintatolimod, a double-stranded RNA TLR3 agonist with a broad range of potential applications, is designed to stimulate innate immunity.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted its Fast-Track Designation to the stem-cell loaded oncolytic virotherapeutic CLD-201 (SuperNova, Calidi Biotherapeutics) in soft-tissue sarcoma.

CLD-201, which is yet to enter clinical trials, consists of allogeneic adipose mesenchymal stem cells loaded with oncolytic vaccinia virus. It is designed to replicate in the tumor microenvironment, thereby boosting anticancer immunity.

The anti-butyrophilin 3A MAb ICT01 (ImCheck) received Orphan-Drug Designation by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The immunotherapeutic induced a high survival rate in an early trial with patients ineligible for chemotherapy.

ICT01 is designed to activate γ9δ2 T cells, a subset of cells recognizing phosphoantigens and responding to both infections and cancer.

The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has endorsed a new variant of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer) for prevention of Covid-19 caused by the LP.8.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2, currently in circulation.

The vaccine will be available in EU for all people above 6 months of age in the 2025–6 season.

Ronald Ellisreceived his PhD at Cornell University. He worked 35 years in line and senior management of pharma, mid biotech and small biotech companies and biotechnology incubator in the research and development of new vaccines and drugs, including leadership roles for five products that became commercially licensed worldwide. He worked subsequently as an independent consultant. He is the founding (2005) and incumbent Editor-in-Chief of Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics.
