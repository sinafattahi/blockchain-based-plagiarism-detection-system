Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common procedure in elderly patients that requires effective postoperative analgesia to enhance recovery and minimize complications. This study compares the effects of pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) and fascia iliaca compartment Block (FICB) on postoperative analgesia and early rehabilitation in elderly patients undergoing THA.

This retrospective observational study was conducted from January 2021 to December 2023 and included 216 elderly patients scheduled for THA. Patients were divided into two groups: PENG (n= 108) and FICB (n= 108). The efficacy and safety of the nerve blocks were assessed by procedure and onset times, intraoperative anesthetic use, postoperative pain (VAS scores), analgesic consumption, motor function recovery (Modified Bromage Scores), and adverse reactions. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.

The PENG group required significantly lower doses of propofol (327.3 ± 90.5 mg vs. 353.4 ± 85.7 mg,p= 0.03) and remifentanil (1.1 ± 0.4 mg vs. 1.4 ± 0.5 mg,p< 0.001) than the FICB group. Postoperative VAS pain scores were lower in the PENG group at 8 h during activity (1.1 vs. 2.1,P< 0.05). The PENG group also showed fewer effective PCA presses (3.5 ± 1.4 vs. 4.3 ± 1.5,p< 0.001) and lower sufentanil consumption (62.3 ± 13.3 µg vs. 72.1 ± 13.6 µg,p< 0.001). The PENG group had a significantly lower incidence of quadriceps weakness (7% vs. 24%,p< 0.001) and faster recovery of motor function at all time points.

Both PENG and FICB provided effective perioperative analgesia in elderly patients undergoing THA. However, PENG may offer advantages in reducing postoperative pain during activity and in preserving lower limb motor function, potentially facilitating earlier rehabilitation.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a widely performed surgical procedure aimed at alleviating pain and improving function in patients with severe hip joint pathology, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or hip fractures. The procedure involves replacing the damaged hip joint with a prosthetic implant, which can significantly enhance the quality of life for patients [1,2]. However, despite its benefits, THA is associated with considerable postoperative pain, which can hinder early mobilization and rehabilitation, leading to prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. Effective postoperative pain management is crucial for enhancing early rehabilitation (the recovery of basic functional mobility during the initial postoperative period) and improving overall outcomes in patients undergoing THA [3]. Traditional analgesic methods, such as systemic opioids, have been associated with various side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, and an increased risk of opioid dependence. As a result, there has been a growing interest in multimodal analgesia approaches that minimize opioid consumption and enhance pain control [4,5]. Among these approaches, regional anesthesia techniques have gained popularity due to their ability to provide effective analgesia with fewer systemic side effects.

Pericapsular Nerve Group Block (PENG) is a regional anesthesia technique that involves the injection of local anesthetics around the hip joint capsule. This technique targets multiple nerves that innervate the hip joint, providing effective pain relief postoperatively [6,7]. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of PENG in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption in patients undergoing THA. Moreover, PENG has been shown to facilitate early mobilization and improve functional recovery, which are critical factors for successful rehabilitation and patient outcomes [8–10]. The fascia iliaca compartment Block (FICB) is another regional anesthesia technique that has gained attention for its potential benefits in THA. The FICB involves the injection of local anesthetics into the iliac fascial compartment, targeting the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. This block provides effective analgesia for the anterior and lateral aspects of the hip joint, which are often the primary sources of pain following THA [11,12]. Emerging evidence suggests that FICB may offer superior pain relief compared to traditional analgesic methods, with a favorable side effect profile.

Given the importance of optimal pain management for early rehabilitation and overall patient outcomes, it is essential to explore the comparative effectiveness of PENG and FICB in the context of THA. This study aims to evaluate the effects of PENG and FICB on postoperative analgesia and early rehabilitation in elderly patients undergoing THA.

This was a retrospective observational study conducted at our hospital from January 2021 to December 2023 to evaluate the effects of PENG and FICB on postoperative analgesia and early rehabilitation in elderly patients undergoing THA. A total of 216 eligible patients were included and allocated into two groups based on the anesthetic technique documented in their medical records: PENG group (n= 108) and FICB group (n= 108). This study adhered to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines [13]. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was conducted as a retrospective observational analysis and did not involve prospective interventional procedures; therefore, clinical trial registration was not required. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by our Hospital Ethics Committee, and all data were handled in accordance with institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Missing Data: Patients with incomplete data or missing critical information that may affect the outcome measures will be excluded from the analysis.

PENG Group: For the PENG group, an ultrasound low-frequency convex array probe was positioned at the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), aligned parallel to the pubic ramus. The probe was rotated until the iliopsoas tendon was visualized near the iliopectineal eminence on the pubic ramus. Following local anesthetic infiltration at the puncture site, a needle was advanced using an in-plane technique from lateral to medial, closely following the AIIS until it reached the fascial plane between the iliopsoas tendon and the pubic ramus. After confirming the absence of blood on aspiration, a test injection of saline was performed to lift the iliopsoas tendon. After verifying the correct needle position and ensuring there was no blood upon aspiration, 0.3% ropivacaine was administered.

FICB Group: For the FICB group, under ultrasound guidance, a linear array probe was positioned with one end at the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the other end directed towards the umbilicus, applying gentle pressure near the umbilical side. From lateral to medial, the ASIS, iliacus muscle, iliac fascia, deep circumflex iliac artery, transversus abdominis muscle, and internal oblique muscle were visualized. Once a satisfactory image was obtained, the probe was moved caudally to slightly bypass the ASIS. Using an in-plane technique, a needle was inserted from the lateral side of the probe, advancing until the needle tip reached the plane between the iliacus muscle and iliac fascia. After confirming the proper needle position and absence of blood on aspiration, 0.3% ropivacaine was injected.

Block procedures in both cohorts were executed according to a written, institution-wide standard operating procedure, and all THA surgeries were completed by the same orthopedic team using an identical lateral approach and perioperative care pathway. All THA procedures were performed by fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons from our department, each with over ten years of experience, to ensure uniformity of surgical technique.

All nerve block procedures were performed by the same anesthesiologist. The effectiveness of the nerve block was tested every 2 min post-procedure, with sensory block levels assessed as follows: Grade 0, no block; Grade 1, decreased sensation to cold stimuli; Grade 2, presence of pinprick sensation but absence of cold sensation; Grade 3, absence of both cold and pinprick sensation. A sensory block level of ≥ 2 was considered effective. If effective blockade was not achieved within 20 min, the patient was excluded from the study. The assessment and recording of the blockade efficacy were conducted by a blinded anesthesiologist.

Consecutive eligible cases were enrolled to minimise selection bias, and group assignment was determined solely by the pre-existing nerve-block technique recorded in the electronic chart.

This retrospective observational study utilized data obtained from the hospital’s electronic medical record system to evaluate a range of perioperative variables. Key metrics included the procedure time and onset time for the nerve blocks, as well as intraoperative administration of propofol and remifentanil, along with any additional sufentanil requirements. Postoperative pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) both at rest and during activity (hip flexion at 15°) at 2, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. Analgesic consumption was quantified by the number of effective and total presses on the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump within the first 24 h. Adverse events such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), delirium, infection, local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), and quadriceps muscle weakness were also documented. Lower limb motor function recovery was evaluated using Modified Bromage Scores. Quadriceps muscle strength was measured by positioning one hand behind the patient’s knee and the other on the anterior aspect of the lower leg, applying resistance while the patient lifted their leg. Muscle strength was graded from 0 to 5, with grades 0 to 2 indicating no movement, contraction without movement, or movement without overcoming gravity, respectively; grade 3 indicating movement overcoming gravity but not resistance; grade 4 indicating movement overcoming partial resistance; and grade 5 indicating normal strength. Quadriceps muscle strength less than grade 3 was classified as muscle weakness. Outcome data—including VAS pain scores, PCA usage, adverse events, and Modified Bromage motor scores—were extracted and recorded by a blinded assessor unaware of whether patients received PENG or FICB.

To assess early rehabilitation, we used several key indicators: Modified Bromage Scores, PCA usage, and the incidence of quadriceps weakness. To account for residual confounding inherent to this non-randomised design, we calculated a propensity score for each patient based on age, sex, BMI, ASA status and surgical indication, and applied inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) to all between-group comparisons. Covariate balance was deemed acceptable when post-weighting standardised mean differences were < 0.10 for every covariate. Sensitivity analyses using multivariable regression produced results consistent with the IPTW approach.

Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (Version 27.0). The data were initially categorized into quantitative and categorical variables. For quantitative data exhibiting a normal distribution, independent sample t-tests were utilized to evaluate statistical significance between groups, with results expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Categorical variables were represented as frequencies and percentages, and their independence or associations were examined using Chi-square (χ2) tests. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance.

The intraoperative anesthetic requirements and supplemental sufentanil administration are presented in Table2. The mean propofol dose was significantly lower in the PENG group than in the FICB group (327.3 ± 90.5 mg vs. 353.4 ± 85.7 mg; mean difference, 26.1 mg; 95% CI, 1.9–50.3 mg;p= 0.03) (Fig.2A). Similarly, remifentanil consumption was reduced in the PENG group compared with the FICB group (1.1 ± 0.4 mg vs. 1.4 ± 0.5 mg; mean difference, 0.3 mg; 95% CI, 0.2–0.4 mg;p< 0.001) (Fig.2B). Additionally, a significantly smaller proportion of patients in the PENG group required rescue sufentanil (19% vs. 47%;p< 0.001).

The postoperative VAS pain scores during rest and activity at various time points are presented in Table3. During rest, both groups exhibited similar pain levels at 2 and 6 h postoperatively, with median VAS scores of 0.0 (IQR 0.0–1.1). By 8 h, the PENG group showed a slight increase to 1.1 (IQR 0.0–1.1), while the FICB group remained constant. At 12 h, the PENG group’s pain scores increased to 2.1 (IQR 1.1–2.1), compared to the FICB group’s 1.1 (IQR 1.1–2.1). At 24 h, the PENG group reported higher pain scores of 3.1 (IQR 2.1–3.1), whereas the FICB group had scores of 2.1 (IQR 1.6–3.1). During activity, the PENG group consistently reported lower pain scores at 2, 6, and 8 h compared to the FICB group. At 8 h, the PENG group’s median score was significantly lower at 1.1 (IQR 0.0–1.1) versus the FICB group’s 2.1 (IQR 1.1–2.6) (aP < 0.05). By 24 h, both groups had similar pain levels, with a median VAS score of 3.1.

The comparison of postoperative 24-hour analgesia between the PENG and FICB groups is detailed in Table4. Effective PCA presses were significantly fewer in the PENG group than in the FICB group (3.5 ± 1.4 vs. 4.3 ± 1.5; mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1;p< 0.001) (Fig.3A). Total PCA presses did not differ significantly between groups (PENG: 6.9 ± 1.7 vs. FICB: 7.1 ± 2.0; t = 0.792;p= 0.429) (Fig.3B). Sufentanil consumption was lower in the PENG group compared with the FICB group (62.3 ± 13.3 µg vs. 72.1 ± 13.6 µg; mean difference, 9.8 µg; 95% CI, 6.2–13.4 µg;p< 0.001) (Fig.3C). The incidence of rescue analgesia was also reduced in the PENG group (6% vs. 15%;p= 0.025).

The comparison of lower limb motor block modified Bromage scores at different postoperative time points between the PENG and FICB groups is summarized in Table5. At 12 h postoperatively, the PENG group exhibited significantly lower motor block scores (1.1 ± 0.3) compared to the FICB group (2.1 ± 0.5), with a p-value of < 0.001. This indicates that patients in the PENG group experienced less motor impairment early after surgery. By 24 h, the PENG group continued to show lower motor block scores (1.0 ± 0.4) compared to the FICB group (1.6 ± 0.4), maintaining a statistically significant difference (p< 0.001). This suggests a faster recovery of motor function in the PENG group. At 48 h, the PENG group had nearly normal motor function with scores of (0.1 ± 0.1), while the FICB group still showed some degree of motor block (1.0 ± 0.3). The difference remained highly significant (p< 0.001).

The comparison of postoperative adverse reactions between the PENG and FICB groups is summarized in Table6. Adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting, delirium, and quadriceps weakness were monitored and recorded for both groups. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was slightly higher in the FICB group (14%) compared to the PENG group (9%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.288). Delirium was observed in 5% of the PENG group and 6% of the FICB group, with no significant difference between the groups (p= 0.757). A notable difference was observed in the incidence of quadriceps weakness, which was significantly higher in the FICB group (24%) compared to the PENG group (7%) (p< 0.001). This suggests that the PENG technique may be associated with a lower risk of motor weakness postoperatively, potentially facilitating better early mobilization and rehabilitation outcomes.

A post-hoc power analysis was conducted for the three prespecified key outcomes—propofol dose, remifentanil dose, and the incidence of quadriceps weakness—using a two-sided α = 0.05 and effect sizes derived from the study data (Cohen’s d for continuous variables and Cohen’s h for proportions). Given that postoperative motor preservation was the primary clinical endpoint, followed by intraoperative opioid sparing and hypnotic sparing, a weighted composite power was calculated using appropriate weights assigned to each outcome. The resulting weighted post-hoc power was 0.873 (87.3%), exceeding the conventional adequacy threshold of 80%. This finding supports that the sample size of 108 patients per group was sufficient to detect clinically meaningful differences across the principal outcomes.

The comparison between PENG and FICB for postoperative analgesia and early rehabilitation in THA has been studied extensively in the literature, with numerous prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) providing robust evidence regarding their efficacy. Recent studies, such as those by Duan et al. and Liang et al., have compared these blocks in terms of postoperative pain control, motor function recovery, and opioid consumption [9,11]. However, the present study introduces significant novelty by specifically focusing on the elderly population, which is more prone to complications such as frailty, cognitive decline, and limited rehabilitation capacity [14]. These factors require distinct considerations in pain management and rehabilitation protocols. Furthermore, our study is one of the few retrospective observational studies in this field that not only compares PENG and FICB but also incorporates early rehabilitation outcomes such as motor function recovery (Modified Bromage Scores) and quadriceps weakness, which have been underexplored in earlier RCTs. Unlike many prospective studies, we also report on the practical applicability of these blocks within real-world clinical settings, addressing longer-term outcomes such as analgesic consumption and patient comfort [15,16]. By examining these factors in the context of elderly THA patients, our study contributes important insights into the tailored approach needed for this vulnerable group [17,18].

Postoperative pain management plays an important role in early rehabilitation and overall patient outcomes following THA. The VAS pain scores at various time points indicated that the PENG group experienced lower pain levels during activity in the early postoperative period compared to the FICB group. At 8 h postoperatively, the PENG group had significantly lower pain scores, which may be indicative of better pain control during the initial recovery phase [19]. Notably, although the median resting VAS pain scores at 12 and 24 h postoperatively were numerically higher in the PENG group than in the FICB group (2.1 vs. 1.1 at 12 h; 3.1 vs. 2.1 at 24 h), these differences did not reach statistical significance (p> 0.05). This finding indicates that resting analgesia becomes comparable between groups by the end of the first postoperative day. The convergence of resting pain control may be attributed to the standardized patient-controlled analgesia protocol and residual effects of peripheral blocks. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profiles of ropivacaine and the supplemental bolus dosing inherent in PCA likely mitigate initial differences in block efficacy as the local anesthetic effect wanes. Clinically, this suggests that while PENG confers superior activity-related analgesia during the early postoperative period, both PENG and FICB achieve equivalent baseline analgesia by 24 h. Such convergence is important when considering strategies for overnight pain management and may inform the timing of block redosing or rescue analgesia to optimize patient comfort without overreliance on systemic opioids [20,21]. Patients in the PENG group had fewer effective PCA presses and lower sufentanil consumption, findings that may reflect better pain control and a reduced need for additional analgesics. Moreover, the lower incidence of rescue analgesia observed in the PENG group may indicate more effective postoperative pain management. These findings suggest that PENG may have the potential to improve patient comfort and reduce opioid-related side effects, considerations that are particularly important in the elderly population.

The evaluation of lower limb motor block using Modified Bromage Scores revealed that the PENG group had significantly lower motor block scores at all measured time points. At 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, the PENG group exhibited less motor impairment, which may reflect a faster recovery of lower limb function. This may be considered a clinical benefit, given that early mobilization has been associated with a lower risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and muscle atrophy. The reduced motor block observed with PENG may be related to its more localized effect, which is thought to spare major motor nerves and has been associated with quicker functional recovery [22,23]. The incidence of postoperative adverse reactions was lower in the PENG group. While nausea and vomiting and delirium rates were similar between the two groups, the incidence of quadriceps weakness was significantly lower in the PENG group. Quadriceps weakness has been reported to hinder early mobilization and rehabilitation; therefore, a lower incidence observed in the PENG group may be clinically meaningful. The lower incidence of motor weakness in the PENG group may be related to its more targeted approach, which is believed to minimize the involvement of motor nerves compared to the broader spread associated with FICB [24,25].

In interpreting the clinical relevance of our statistically significant findings, two points are noteworthy. First, a seemingly small absolute reduction of 0.3 mg remifentanil equates to a 21% relative decrease compared with the mean FICB dose (1.4 mg). Likewise, 0.8 fewer effective PCA presses represents a 19% decline in demand-triggered boluses, corresponding to approximately 10 µg less sufentanil per patient and fewer nursing interventions. Second, these opioid-sparing effects surpass accepted benchmarks for clinical importance: published minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for postoperative opioid use after major orthopaedic surgery are 10–15% of total consumption. In our cohort, intra-operative remifentanil fell by 21% and postoperative sufentanil by 14%, both exceeding the MCID threshold [14]. Beyond analgesic savings, motor preservation was markedly better with PENG; quadriceps weakness declined from 24% (FICB) to 7% (PENG), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 17% and a number-needed-to-treat of 6 [26]. Such motor sparing is clinically meaningful, as it facilitates earlier ambulation, lowers fall risk, and enhances participation in rehabilitation—key priorities in elderly THA patients.

Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide a broader context for interpreting our findings. Ying et al. [26]reported no significant differences in VAS scores at 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively between PENG and FICB, although PENG demonstrated a notable opioid-sparing effect. Our results are in line with this finding and further contribute by highlighting the motor-sparing advantage of PENG, particularly relevant in elderly patients. Wan et al. [27] identified that PENG, especially when combined with periarticular local anesthetic infiltration (PLAI), offered superior analgesia, reduced opioid use, and a lower incidence of motor block compared to other techniques. Although our study did not involve adjunctive infiltration, our data similarly demonstrate that PENG alone effectively minimizes opioid requirements and preserves quadriceps function in the elderly. Prakash et al. [28]concluded that while pain scores at 24 h did not differ significantly between PENG and FICB, early analgesic benefits and reduced opioid use favored PENG. Our findings corroborate these early advantages and uniquely emphasize the improved motor recovery trajectory, underscoring PENG’s potential in facilitating early rehabilitation in vulnerable geriatric populations.

This study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, its retrospective observational design lacks randomization and is inherently subject to selection bias and unmeasured confounding, despite balanced baseline characteristics and statistical control. Second, while BMI and ASA physical status were comparable between groups, residual confounding by other unrecorded variables (e.g., musculoskeletal comorbidities) cannot be excluded. Although patients with missing or incomplete data were excluded per protocol, this may have introduced selection bias. Third, long-term outcomes such as sustained functional recovery, late complications, chronic pain development, and health-related quality of life were not assessed, limiting conclusions to the immediate postoperative period. Fourth, although the sample size was sufficient for detecting statistically and clinically meaningful differences in primary endpoints, a larger and more diverse cohort would enhance the generalizability of findings. Fifth, motor function was assessed using the Modified Bromage Score, a widely accepted but coarse, ordinal scale. Its limited sensitivity, susceptibility to assessor bias, and ceiling/floor effects may fail to capture subtle variations in postoperative motor recovery. Future research should consider incorporating more precise, validated tools such as isokinetic dynamometry or gait analysis. Sixth, while the PENG block demonstrated favorable outcomes, its reliance on advanced ultrasound-guided technique and potential for anatomical variability may lead to inconsistent analgesic spread or incomplete blockade of the obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, posing technical challenges. Future investigations should adopt prospective, randomized controlled designs with standardized block protocols, comprehensive body composition and comorbidity profiling, and extended follow-up. The integration of objective functional metrics and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) will be essential to fully evaluate the comparative efficacy, safety, and real-world applicability of PENG versus FICB in elderly THA populations.

Both PENG and FICB were associated with effective perioperative pain control in elderly patients undergoing THA. However, PENG may offer advantages in lowering postoperative pain scores—particularly during activity—and in preserving lower limb motor function. These findings suggest that PENG may represent a favorable option for supporting early rehabilitation and improving short-term recovery outcomes in this patient population.
