Abortion emerges as a primary concern for small ruminant breeders, leading to substantial economic losses for livestock farmers. The most important factor contributing to abortion in sheep and goats is the presence of infectious agents. The bluetongue virus (BTV), border disease virus (BDV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), Akabane virus (AKAV) and pox virus are notable viruses responsible for inducing abortion in small ruminants globally.

This study focused on the prevalence of viral agents in aborted foetuses and adult sheep and goats with a recent abortion history in East Azerbaijan province, Northwest Iran. For this purpose, a comprehensive evaluation was performed in the nine cities of East Azerbaijan province, Iran. A total of 62 aborted foetuses and 373 blood samples were collected from 43 sheep and goat flocks. The conventional and nested PCR methods were employed for BTV, BDV, PPRV, pox virus and AKAV detection after extracting viral DNA/RNA and cDNA synthesis from the buffy coat (adults) and foetal spleen tissue samples. The formalin‐fixed tissue samples from the aborted foetuses were examined histopathologically.

Molecular findings revealed that viral infection was present in 7.77% (29 out of 373) of the blood samples and 35.48% (22 out of 62) of the aborted foetuses. Among the blood samples, 1.34%, 2.41% and 4.29% were positive for BTV, BDV and PPR, respectively. No pox virus or AKAV samples tested positive in the adults. In the samples from aborted foetuses, the positivity rates were 12.90%, 25.80%, 9.67%, 1.61% and 0% for BTV, BDV, PPRV, pox virus and AKAV, respectively. Histopathological studies revealed extensive inflammatory reactions associated with severe hyperaemia and haemorrhagic lesions in the tissue sections, particularly in the brain, heart, intestine and spleen, which were more notable in the PCR‐positive samples for BTV.

In conclusion, the detection of viral agents in both aborted foetuses and blood samples indicates that viral infections play notable roles in the abortion of sheep and goats in East Azerbaijan. Therefore, effective management and vaccination strategies are crucial for preventing and controlling the disease in this region.

Evaluation of viral causes of abortion in small ruminants in East Azerbaijan province, Northwest Iran.

a. A total of 373 blood samples were collected from adult sheep and goats with a recent abortion history.

b. A total of 62 aborted foetuses were collected after a systematic necropsy.

Step 2: The blood samples (buffy coats) were evaluated using the conventional PCR. Among these, 1.34%, 2.41% and 4.29% were positive for BTV, BDV and PPR, respectively.

Step 3: The spleen of the aborted foetuses were evaluated using the conventional PCR. Among these, the positivity rates were 12.90%, 25.80%, 9.67%, 1.61% and 0% for BTV, BDV, PPRV, pox virus and AKAV, respectively. Moreover, the tissues were examined using pathological studies, which revealed extensive vascular and inflammatory reactions in the intestine (A), spleen (B), liver (C), heart (D) and brain (E).

Sheep and goat breeding in West Asian countries is a main sector within animal husbandry, notable for its population size and the value of its products. Consequently, abortion in sheep and goats has a significant impact on food security due to the shared pathogens between humans and animals as well as on the livelihoods of the middle and lower socioeconomic classes (Kosgey and Okeyo2007). Abortion serves as a limiting factor for production; not only does it diminish the potential pool of breeding stock and milk output, but it also increases the number of non‐productive females within the herd over time (Ali et al.2019). Several factors, such as infectious agents (bacterial, parasitic, viral and fungal), nutritional deficiencies, genetic issues and environmental conditions, can lead to abortion in sheep and goat populations. Depending on the cause, specific strategies must be developed for prevention, control and treatment (Menzies2007).

Among the infectious agents, several families of viruses, including Sedoreoviridae, Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Poxviridae and Peribunyaviridae, play a significant role in causing abortion and pregnancy abnormalities (Dorsch et al.2021). In the Sedoreoviridae family, the genusOrbivirusincludes the bluetongue virus (BTV), which induces a significant viral infection in ruminants, particularly sheep. It is non‐contagious but can be transmitted through biting midges, colostrum, semen or placenta. BTV infection leads to severe economic losses worldwide, as infection may occur without clinical symptoms, resulting in hidden vectors. Infected animals function as virus carriers, with the potential for transmission to healthy ruminants, leading to reduced milk and meat production and, occasionally, death (Kyriakis et al.2015). Border disease virus (BDV), which belongs to the family Flaviviridae and the genusPestivirus, is closely related to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Interspecies transmission of BDV that commonly occurs between sheep, cattle and pigs may make diagnosis challenging. Notably, BDV can result in significant economic losses through prenatal and postnatal infections in lambs, which are the main source of infection and maintenance of the virus in the population (Righi et al.2021). Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) belongs to the genusMorbillivirusof the family Paramyxoviridae. It is a major threat to the small ruminant industry, infecting sheep and goats (Tang et al.2022). Sheep are less likely to become infected compared to goats and white‐tailed deer. The form of the disease in cattle is only subclinical, and some wild ungulates and camels suffer from occasional outbreaks. Some reports are indicating a potential indirect connection (such as PPR‐induced oxidative stress) between PPRV and abortion in sheep and goats (Murat2024). The family Poxviridae includes viruses that infect small ruminants (sheep and goats), leading to an economically important and contagious disease called pox. Sheep and goat pox caused by sheep pox virus and goat poxvirus are widespread and commonly found in Central Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia (Zewdie et al.2021). The Akabane virus (AKAV) belongs to theOrthobunyavirusgenus and is a part of the Peribunyaviridae family. The virus is transmitted through arthropod vectors, which include midges (Culicoidesspecies) and mosquitoes (AedesandCulexgenera) (Passler et al.2012). AKAV is acknowledged as a teratogen in cattle, sheep and goats, causing a high frequency of abortions in sheep and goats, with lambs being born with arthrogryposis along with hydranencephaly (Odend'Hal1983).

East Azerbaijan province is one of the most important sheep and goat breeding areas in Iran. However, few studies have been conducted on viral infections in these animals. In other regions of Iran, some studies have been conducted and mostly involved serological tests, which do not frequently indicate the presence of active infection. Emerging evidence reported antibodies of AKAV in small ruminants using ELISA in Fars (Manavian et al.2023) and Semnan (Mohajer et al.2019) provinces. Besides, other studies demonstrated antibodies of BTDV in Fars (Mohammadi et al.2012), Khorasan (Najarnezhad and Rajae2013) and Semnan (Mohajer et al.2019) provinces using ELISA. Moreover, limited studies have been reported using PCR for detection of BDV in adult small ruminants in Tabriz city (Kaleibar et al.2014) and Charmahal and Bakhtiari province (Mokhtari and Manshoori2018). Moreover, one study reported the presence of PPRV by PCR in Alborz province (Alidadi et al.2021). Of note, the present study evaluated the presence of the virus genome using PCR, which was used to confirm clinical cases, in aborted foetuses and adults with a history of abortion. Therefore, in this study, sampling was carried out purposefully in herds involved in abortion, whereas in previous studies, a history of abortion has been considered a risk factor. Given the lack of extensive research on viral abortions in small ruminants and the importance of understanding viral causes of abortion to improve herd health management and prevent economic losses, the aim of this study was the molecular detection and pathological investigation, including necropsy and histopathology of viral abortions in sheep and goats in East Azerbaijan province of Iran.

This study was conducted in Tabriz, Marand, Charuymaq, Khoda Afrin, Jolfa, Heris, Bostan Abad, Mianeh and Hashtrud cities located in the East Azerbaijan province in Northwest Iran (Figure1). From November 2023 to February 2024, a total of 62 aborted foetuses and 373 blood samples were collected from sheep and goat flocks in the mentioned regions, which their owners had referred to or contacted for abortion in their farms. In the studied area, semi‐intensive production systems predominate, with agricultural production coexisting with sheep and goat farming. Sheep and goats graze in pastures from spring to mid‐autumn but are housed and fed indoors during winter, relying on forage and crop residues as primary feed sources. We studied 43 sheep flocks, categorized by size: 7 small flocks (1–100 sheep), 19 medium flocks (101–300 sheep) and 17 large flocks (over 300 sheep). The history of the sampled herds, including herd size, abortion rate and vaccination schedule, was recorded. Given the lack of information on abortion rates in the studied region, we utilized a nonprobability sampling method, specifically convenience sampling, for our study. Convenience sampling was chosen due to practical constraints and the need to gather data based on the availability of participants and their reports of having abortions in their flocks, rather than a random selection. Thus, the sample size was determined on the basis of the accessibility and willingness of participants to provide information relevant to our study objectives.

Five millilitres of blood samples treated with anticoagulant was obtained from aborted and pregnant animals. Whole blood was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min to separate the buffy coat, which was then transferred to a sterile 1.5‐mL microcentrifuge tube and stored at −70°C for further analyses. Additionally, aborted foetuses were measured from forehead to tail to estimate foetal age using the formula (X+ 17) × 1/2, whereXis the size of the foetus in centimetres (Edmondson et al.2012). Following this, a systematic necropsy was performed, and pathological lesions of the organs were recorded. Next, a minimum of 50 mg of spleen tissue was placed in a microtube and stored in a freezer at −70°C for molecular studies. Finally, tissue samples of at least 2 × 2 × 3 cm3were transferred to 10% formalin solution for histopathology purposes.

Viral nucleic acid (DNA and/or RNA) was extracted from buffy coat and foetal spleen tissue using commercial kits (PsPure Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit, Pishgaman Sanjesh, Iran). First, to extract viruses from the spleen, approximately 200 mg of tissue was collected and homogenized in 1:5 volume of PBS using sterile surgical scalpel blades, centrifuged at 6000 ×gfor 10 min at 4°C. Then, the clear supernatant was collected and used for RNA/DNA extraction. Briefly, 200 µL of sample and 20 µL of proteinaseKwere added to a 1.5 mL microtube, followed by 300 µL of lysis buffer and 10 µL of carrier RNA. Following a 15‐min incubation at 60°C, a binding buffer was introduced before moving the mixture to a column. The column was washed with Wash Buffers I–III and was subsequently eluted using Elution Buffer. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was carried out using Ps‐Revert Kit (Pishgaman Sanjesh, Iran) based on the manufacturer's instructions. The genome's quality and quantity were analysed using NanoPhotometer NP80 (IMPLEN, Germany).

All PCR assays were performed in a final volume of 25 µL with Taq DNA Polymerase Master Mix RED (Ampliqon, Denmark) and 3 µL DNA/cDNA, using the T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio‐Rad, USA). The amplified products were detected through electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels stained with a safe DNA stain (SinaClon, Iran). The primers and reaction conditions for each PCR protocol are presented in Table1.

To investigate the histopathological lesions, tissue samples were collected from the liver, kidney, brain, heart, lung, spleen, intestine and stomach following a systematic necropsy of the aborted foetuses. Tissue samples were fixed in a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for at least 48 h. The processing of the tissues was performed using a DS2080/H tissue processor (Didsabz, Iran). The tissue samples were dehydrated using ethanol, clarified with xylene, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 µm thick sections and routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

Proportions (percentages) of viral infection rates in flocks that experienced abortions were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

TableS1presents the history of the sampled herds, including herd size, abortion rate, vaccination programme and PCR results. The sheep flocks were visited only once during sampling, with no severe clinical signs observed or reported by the farmers.

Molecular investigations are presented in Table2. Briefly, the PCR results revealed that viral infection was detected in 29 out of 373 (7.77%; 95% CI: 0.07 ± 0.025) of the adult blood samples and 22 out of 62 (35.48%; 95% CI: 0.35 ± 0.118) of the aborted foetuses. Interestingly, among the examined foetuses, 14 foetuses showed 1 viral infection (8, 5 and 1 for BDV, BTV and PPRV, respectively), 7 foetuses demonstrated 2 viral infections (4 and 3 for BDV/PPRV and BDV/BTV, respectively), and 1 foetus showed 3 viral infections (BDV/PPRV/BTV). In the blood samples, one sample showed two viral infections by BDV and BTV.

At necropsy (Figure2A,B), macroscopic pathological lesions were observed in the examined organs. Remarkably, the most severe pathological changes were found in the brain, lungs, liver, spleen and small intestine, which frequently included severe hyperaemia and haemorrhage. In more detail, these changes included severe hyperaemia associated with focal haemorrhage in the brains. Additionally, there was a non‐fusion of the skull bones in one aborted foetus. The lungs showed various degrees of diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In the examined liver, the observed pathological lesions included pale to yellowish round foci of necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. In the small intestine, pathological lesions were observed which included haemorrhagic enteritis ranging from mild‐to‐moderate degrees and, in some cases, severe. In the spleen, moderate‐to‐severe degrees of hyperaemia and focal haemorrhage were observed. In the hearts and kidneys, the observed lesions included small pale foci with mild‐to‐moderate degrees of hyperaemia and haemorrhage.

Pathological lesions of the aborted foetus with macroscopic and microscopic morphology: (A) There were extensive hyperaemia and interstitial pneumonia in the lung (Lu) associated with severe hyperaemia in the liver (Li), haemorrhagic enteritis in the small intestine (I) and focal haemorrhage in the spleen (S); (B) severe hyperaemia and haemorrhage were observed in the brain and meninges; (C) necrotic haemorrhagic enteritis (arrow) in the small intestine (PPRV/BDV PCR positive foetus); (D) extensive haemorrhage (arrow) and lymphocyte depletion in the spleen (PPRV/BDV PCR positive foetus); (E) haemorrhagic necrotic hepatitis (arrow) and vascular hyperaemia (arrowhead) in the liver; (F) extensive haemorrhage (arrow) and severe vascular hyperaemia (arrowhead) in the heart (BTV/BDV PCR positive foetus); (G) very severe and extensive vascular hyperaemia (arrowheads) in the brain (BTV/BDV PCR positive foetus); (H) vascular hyperaemia (arrowhead) and focal gliosis (large arrow) and necrosis (small arrow) in the brain (BTV/BDV PCR positive foetus) H&E.

In microscopic studies (Figure2C–H), pathological lesions of varying degrees (often moderate‐to‐severe) were observed in different tissues. Notably, pathological lesions in the brains included moderate‐to‐severe and extensive hyperaemia, focal necrosis and haemorrhages, perivascular and perineuronal oedema and focal to diffuse gliosis. In the lungs, in addition to severe vascular lesions, such as oedema, hyperaemia and haemorrhage, various degrees of diffuse pneumonia with the presence of mixed inflammatory cells and increased alveolar wall thickness were observed. In the livers, pathological lesions included focal, multifocal to extensive cellular necrosis along with the presence of various inflammatory cells, sinusoidal hyperaemia and multifocal to extensive haemorrhage. In the kidneys, there were various degrees of necrosis associated with inflammatory cell infiltration from focal to extensive, especially in the tubules and in the cortical area. In the small intestine, necrotic haemorrhagic enteritis with mononuclear inflammatory cells in the mucosa and submucosa was observed. In the spleen, there was lymphocyte depletion accompanied by moderate‐to‐severe hyperaemia and haemorrhage. In the hearts, pathological lesions included oedema, focal to multifocal nonsuppurative myocarditis, hyperaemia and focal to extensive severe haemorrhages. Importantly, in the PCR‐positive foetus for BTV, the severity of the haemorrhagic lesions was more notable. Moreover, in the PCR‐positive foetus for both BTV/BDV, myocarditis with mononuclear cell infiltration and mild encephalitis were found. In the PCR‐positive foetus for both PPRV/BDV, the severity of the haemorrhagic changes significantly increased in the spleens.

The present study identified the viral agents responsible for abortion and their prevalence in small ruminant populations in the East Azerbaijan province. On the basis of the present molecular findings, 7.77% of adults with recent abortion histories tested positive for viral infections. Additionally, viral agents were detected in 35.48% of aborted foetuses, indicating their significant contribution to abortions in the region. Notably, the most prevalent viral infection in adults was PPR (4.29%), followed by border disease (2.41%) and bluetongue disease (1.34%). However, the most prevalent viral infection in the aborted foetus was border disease (25.8%), bluetongue disease (12.90%), PPR (9.67%) and pox virus (1.61%), respectively. The present findings are more notable in the examined foetuses.

The current study is the first molecular identification of BTV in adults and aborted foetuses in Iran and showd 12.9% of foetuses and 1.34% of adults positive results. However, a previous study from Turkey did not detect BTV‐specific RNA in ovine (n= 1144) and caprine foetuses (n= 82) (Şevik2023). Recently, one study reported that 1.9% of aborted foetuses were infected with BTV in Iran (Esmaeili et al.2022), but it did not specify the geographical area of sampling. In this regard, growing evidence identified the serological presence of BTV in small ruminants in Iran; however, there has been a lack of molecular studies on this subject. A previous study demonstrated that the seroprevalence rates of BTV in sheep and goats from various epidemiological units of Iran were 57.59% and 65.65%, respectively (Bakhshesh et al.2020). In addition, the seroprevalence of BTV in small domestic ruminants has been documented as 34.7% in West Azerbaijan (Shoorijeh et al.2010), 89.2% in the northwestern region of Iran (Najarnezhad and Rajae2013), 6.57% in the southeastern area (Mozaffari and Khalili2012), 51.6% in Isfahan and 73.5% in Shiraz (Mohammadi et al.2012). A research study carried out in the Mediterranean area of Turkey indicated that the actual prevalence of BTV antibodies in small ruminants was found to be 74.2% (Şevik2023). A systematic review and meta‐analysis conducted in Africa revealed that the seroprevalence of BTV was found to be 36.30% in sheep and 47.00% in goats (Medrouh et al.2024). On the basis of a previous report, macroscopically observable abnormalities present in aborted foetuses encompass brachycephaly, hydranencephaly, superior brachygnathia, non‐fusion of the mandibles linked to a gingival vascular hamartoma and cerebellar aplasia (Saegerman et al.2011). In the present study, non‐fusion of the skull bones was observed in one aborted foetus. Additionally, at histopathology, there were more severe haemorrhagic lesions, particularly in the brains, spleens, small intestines and hearts.

Border disease is regarded as endemic among small ruminants in Iran (Esmaeili et al.2022). The present study, the first in Iran to investigate aborted foetuses for border disease, indicated that 25.8% of foetuses and 2.41% of sheep and goats with a recent history of abortion tested positive for BDV genome. In a previous study in Iran in 2014, the genome of BDV was detected in 11.3% of the blood samples from sheep with a history of reproductive failure in Tabriz, Iran (Kaleibar et al.2014). Another similar study reported that 9% of aborted foetuses were infected with BDV using the RT‐PCR method in Chaharmahalo‐Bakhtiari province, Iran (Mokhtari and Manshoori2018). Similarly, a recent study in Turkey revealed that 58% of sheep and 55% of goats tested positive for pestivirus antigen using the Ag ELISA test. Notably, 1.72% of sheep samples were identified as BDV positive via the Real‐Time RT‐PCR test, whereas 5.17% were detected as BDV positive using the conventional RT‐PCR test (Okur Gumusova and Akman2023). Furthermore, a different study from Turkey reported that the detection rate of BDV in sheep foetuses was 12.16% (Şevik2018). It seems that the difference in these results could be due to the type of sample tested, primer sensitivity, sample size, herd size, animal housing system and sampling interval.

Reported histopathological changes in foetus and neonatal small ruminants have previously included significant lymphocyte depletion in the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes, associated with interalveolar interstitial pneumonia, and the infiltration of mononuclear cells, focal nonsuppurative interstitial myocarditis, diffused enteritis with the infiltration of mononuclear cells within the lamina propria mucosa (Toplu et al.2012). Additionally, nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis accompanied by hypomyelinogenesis was observed (Toplu et al.2011). In the present study, similar histopathological lesions with more severity were observed in the examined foetus.

Our findings demonstrated a prevalence of 9.67% positive cases for the PPR virus in the aborted foetuses, alongside a positivity rate of 4.29% in blood samples collected from the examined small ruminant populations. The detection of the PPR virus in both aborted foetuses and adults indicates that the PPR virus may play a notable role in the abortion of sheep and goats. This hypothesis is further corroborated by earlier research carried out in Turkey, which reported positive rates of 11.7% for embryos/foetuses, 94% for ewes and 100% for nanny goats (Murat2024). In India, the outbreak of PPR was identified through serological methods. The mortality rate observed during this outbreak was relatively low, averaging 26.75% (Kumar et al.2018). In a prior investigation carried out in the Alborz province of Iran, PPR was detected in two flocks exhibiting characteristic clinical symptoms of the disease (Alidadi et al.2021). The prevalent macroscopic findings associated with PPRV infection have been previously reported, which included necrotic enteritis, pneumonia and splenomegaly (Abubakar et al.2008). The present pathological findings are in agreement with these results, focusing on necrotic haemorrhagic enteritis and interstitial pneumonia.

Control programmes for sheep and goat pox have been executed in Iran for over 50 years (Mirzaie et al.2015). In the present study, pox virus was detected in just one aborted foetus among 62 examined cases, with no blood samples testing positive for pox virus. Despite the rising reports of SGP viral infections in Iran (Alwan et al.2023), our findings indicate that vaccination and reducing transportation stress are effective primary strategies for controlling these diseases in the East Azerbaijan province.

The AKAV, recognized as a teratogenic pathogen, is responsible for both epizootic and sporadic incidents of abortion, premature births, stillbirths and congenital anomalies in sheep and goats. AKAV is prevalent across tropical and temperate zones in Australia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Middle East and Africa (Kurogi et al.1977; Yang et al.2008; Jun et al.2012; Sevik2017; Manavian et al.2023). AKAV has been documented in various areas of Iran, such as Semnan (0%–75%) (Mohajer et al.2019), Khuzestan (72.39% and 85.87%) (Ahi et al.2015; Karami Boldaji et al.2016), Fars (15.37%) (Manavian et al.2023) provinces and Shahrekord (1.75%) (Kojouri et al.2015). However, the current study conducted in East Azerbaijan province did not identify any positive samples of Akabane disease in either blood or foetal specimens. Recently, it was reported that small ruminants residing in warmer climates exhibit higher antibodies against AKAV compared to those in colder climates due to the optimum temperature and humidity for the reproduction, growth and activity of theCulicoidesvectors (Manavian et al.2023). This observation suggests a higher prevalence of the disease in tropical and temperate regions, including Semnan and Khuzestan provinces, while also explaining its lower or absent prevalence in colder areas such as Shahrekord and East Azerbaijan.

The most important viral infections detected in the small ruminant populations and their aborted foetuses included border disease, PPR and bluetongue disease, which were more prevalent than in the examined foetuses. There has been no comparable extensive research undertaken to investigate the viral agents associated with abortion in adult small ruminants and their aborted foetuses simultaneously within the same flocks in Iran. This study represents the most extensive investigation conducted in this province. The findings of this study hold significant importance for identifying and managing viral agents linked to abortion in sheep and goats. However, it should be noted that our data were derived from convenience sampling (selected based on the report of having abortions on the flocks, rather than a random selection), which may not be representative of the entire population.
