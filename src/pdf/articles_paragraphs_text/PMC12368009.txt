Due to inadequate fixation, early tea produced in the Chuanyu region exhibits high astringency. To mitigate the astringency of early tea, this study identified the astringent compounds present in the tea, subsequently optimized its fixation process based on the key astringent substances. Initially, 20 early tea samples were categorized into three groups (low, middle, and high astringency) according to the differences in astringency. Metabolomics revealed a total of 129 differential metabolites, of which 8 metabolites were positively correlated to the astringency of early tea. Finally, DoT (Dose-over-threshold: concentration-to-threshold ratio) values, taste recombination, omission, and addition experiments confirmed that (−) epigallocatechin (EGC), hyperin, and rutin were the key astringent compounds of early tea. Ultimately, the orthogonal test determined that the best fixation parameters of early tea were fixation temperature of 300 °C, fixation time of 65 s, and leaf amount of 150 kg/h, which significantly reduced the astringency of early tea.

Green tea, a traditional Chinese beverage, has gained global popularity due to its unique flavor and notable health benefits1. Early tea, as an important component of the green tea industry in the Sichuan and Chongqing (Chuanyu) region, possesses substantial market and economic value due to its early harvest, tender raw materials and rich connotation2. Early tea is harvested before late March each year and produced from single buds, one bud and one leaf from early or extra-early tea trees through spreading, fixing, shaping, and drying. For achieving the best shape, low fixation temperature and short fixation time usually lead to the insufficient conversion of flavor substances and significant astringency. Fixation is the most critical process influencing the flavor quality of green tea as non-volatile components undergo substantial changes during this process3. Different fixation methods and parameters will change the component’s composition, thus affecting the flavor quality of green tea4,5. For instance, electromagnetic rolling-hot air-steam triple coupling fixation can reduce the phenol-ammonia ratio of green tea, thereby decreasing its bitterness and astringency6. Higher fixation temperatures can mitigate the bitterness and astringency produced by polyphenols in tea2,7. Consequently, optimizing the fixation process and reducing astringency represent effective strategies for improving the quality and economic value of early tea.

As a significant quality, astringency has been shown to greatly influence the taste of green tea8. Currently, it’s widely accepted that polyphenols including flavanols, flavanones, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids are the main contributors to the astringency of green tea9. Ester catechins like (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) have been reported to be the major contributors to astringency in tea10,11. Recent studies have found that the astringency threshold of flavonoids was significantly lower than that of catechins, which might contribute more to the astringency of tea10,12. For example, Zhang13found that rutin and quercetin-3-O-galactoside were the most critical astringent components of baked green tea. The phenolic acids in tea include gallic acid, ellagic acid, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid. Phenolic acids impart both a sour and astringent taste, which correlate positively with their concentration14. However, due to the diversity of flavor compounds and complex interactions, the molecular mechanisms underlying the astringency of tea remain incompletely understood.

Presently, numerous methods exist to evaluate and quantify the flavor and constituents of tea. Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) can systematically investigate the relationships among tea flavor characteristics, sensory strength and components by employing sensory scales for quantitative evaluation of tea’s flavor properties15. On the other hand, taste addition, recombination, and omission experiments validate the flavor contribution of compounds, and these methods have been widely adopted in tea flavor chemistry16,17. Moreover, metabolomics can rapidly identify the structures of small molecules, facilitate the identification and quantification of these compounds to reveal flavor differences. For example, Xu7identified 17 key umami compounds in Longjing tea using non-targeted metabolomics techniques.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the key astringent components of early tea and optimize the fixation process to diminish the astringency of early tea. We used QDA to categorize 20 early tea samples into low, middle, and high astringency groups according to the differences in astringency. The non-targeted metabolome was utilized to identify the metabolites, and the variable importance in projection (VIP) values were employed to screen for candidate astringent compounds. The DoT values further elucidated the possible contributors to astringency in early tea, which were verified through recombination, omission, and addition experiments. Using the identified key astringent substances, we optimized the fixation process parameters through orthogonal experiments, combined with sensory evaluation and the content of astringent substances.

According to the results of the QDA analysis, the astringency intensity of 20 early tea samples ranged from 1.53 to 5.83. Twenty samples were divided into three groups by the Euclidean distance method (Fig.1).

The cluster analysis of 20 Chuanyu early tea samples based on QDA result. Group I: low astringency group, and the astringency score is 1.53–2.40; group II: middle astringency group, and the astringency score is 3.17–3.43; Group III: high astringency group, and the astringency score is 4.42–5.83.

From Table1, we found that Group I (low astringency) contained 7 kinds of early tea samples (ZC34, ZC21, ZC29, ZC6, ZC1, ZC4, and ZC2), and the astringency intensity ranging from 1.53 to 2.40. Group II (middle astringency) contained 7 kinds of samples (ZC3, ZC23, ZC20, ZC10, ZC14, ZC15, and ZC27), and the astringency intensity ranged from 3.17 to 3.43. The remaining 6 samples (ZC19, ZC28, ZC33, ZC31, ZC17, and ZC35) belonged to Group III (high astringency) and their astringency intensity ranged from 4.42 to 5.83.

The differences in green tea astringency were closely related to its substances18. In order to explore the reasons for the different astringency of the three groups’ early tea, We used a non-targeted metabolomics method to analyze the differential astringent substances in three groups of early tea samples with differential astringency.

Firstly, as illustrated in Fig.2A, an overview of metabolic profiles among early tea samples with different astringency intensities was obtained based on an unsupervised multivariate PCA (Principal Component Analysis) approach. The results showed that the first two principal components explained 84.97% of the total variance (59.82% and 25.15%), which indicated that the identified metabolites adequately represented the full information of the metabolites. Secondly, the three groups of samples, high astringency (HS), middle astringency (MS) and low astringency (LS), were clearly clustered and differentiated in the score plots of the PCA model, which indicated that the metabolites of early tea with different astringency intensities were significantly different19.

The supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model (Fig.2B) was used to investigate the differential metabolites between the early tea groups with different astringency intensities, and the first two factors explained 0.851 (R2X) and 0.993 (R2Y) of the variation, respectively, and the model had a good predictive quality (Q2= 0.912). Additionally, to validate the model, permutation testing with 200 iterations was performed, yielding Q2= -0.199, which indicated no overfitting (Fig.2C). Therefore, 129 differential metabolites were significantly distinguished in the high, middle, and low astringency groups of samples.

According to the results of metabolomics, a total of 399 metabolites were identified. The variable importance in projection (VIP) reflects the contribution of the compounds to the overall tea. According to VIP > 1 andp< 0.05, 129 differential metabolites were identified, and their related heat maps with astringency were shown in Fig.3Band more metabolic information was presented in TableS1. Among the 129 metabolites, one of the most diverse flavor component classes was the polyphenols (17). Phenolics generally have a bitter and astringent taste, which may be the material embodiment of the astringent taste of early tea. The next most abundant metabolites were amino acids (12), which contribute to the freshness taste of early tea. This finding was consistent with the sensory profile of early tea: where the fresh taste is dominant but accompanied by distinct bitterness and astringency due to high amino acid and catechin contents. In particular, the polyphenols presented were primarily catechins and flavonoid glycosides, which are generally associated with bitterness and astringency, potentially explaining the pronounced astringency of early tea20. We used Pearson correlation analysis to explore the correlation between 129 differential metabolites and astringency intensity (Fig.S3). 73 metabolites were found to be positively correlated with early tea astringency intensity, of which 21 metabolites were significantly positively correlated with astringency (Pearson’sr= 0. 81–1.00,p< 0.05 after multiple testing correction). Combining the taste attributes of all the differential metabolites (TableS1), eight astringent substances (rutin, hyperin, vitexin, GA, GC, EC, EGC, and ellagic acid) were screened out as the potential astringent substances affecting the astringency of early tea (Fig.3A). Liu21analyzed the correlation between green tea contents and sensory quality found that catechins including EGCG, ECG, EGC and seven flavonoid glycosides such as rutin, hyperin, and Kaempferol-3-O-glucoside were significantly and positively correlated with astringent flavor. Zhao22also found that catechins and flavonoids were higher in Sichuan green teas with significant astringency, and the contents of EGCG, ECG, EGC, GC, EC, and rutin were positively correlated with the strength of astringency. These results were consistent with the findings of our analysis. The VIP values of the 8 astringent substances were: rutin (VIP = 1.505), hyperin (VIP = 1.657), vitexin (VIP = 1.606), GC (VIP = 1.610), GA (VIP = 1.482), EC (VIP = 1.453), EGC (VIP = 1.075) and ellagic acid (VIP = 1.145).

HS represents high astringency group, MS represents middle astringency group, and LS represents low astringency group. Data were mean ± SEM. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01.

The dose ratio threshold factor (DoT) values were defined as the ratio of taste component concentration to its taste threshold, which were employed to identify potential key astringent compounds in early tea. To calculate the DoT values, HPLC and the 3-AFC methods were utilized to determine the concentration and recognition thresholds of eight substances (hyperin, rutin, vitexin, GA, EC, EGC, GC and ellagic acid). The concentrations of these compounds across all samples were presented in Table2, and showed similar trends to the results of the non-target metabolomics analysis. The contents of EGC (426.72–1535.31 μg/mL), EC (129.06–310.23 μg/mL), rutin (10.04–55.98 μg/mL) and hyperin (13.47–45.70 μg/mL) in early tea were much higher than those of previous studies on other green teas, which showed a range of EGC (34.90–291.00 μg/mL), EC (19.30–154.00 μg/mL), rutin (0.18–31.70 μg/mL) and hyperin (0.61–11.50 μg/mL)21. Therefore, we speculated that the high contents of these astringent substances led to the heavier astringency of early tea.

#The code of sample was named as the abbreviation of early tea followed a number.

aThe data was represented as “mean ± standard deviation”. Values without same lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...) within each column were significantly different (p< 0.05) through Tukey test.

The recognition thresholds of 8 astringent substances in distilled water at 25 °C were detected. As shown in the fitting curve of astringent substances in Fig.S2, the accuracy of evaluators increased significantly as substance concentration increased (p< 0.05). When the recognition accuracy was 66.7%, the astringency recognition threshold of the substances was hyperin 7.17 μg/mL, rutin 25.57 μg/mL, vitexin 96.79 μg/mL, GC 249.41 μg/mL, GA 46.99 μg/mL, EC 356.12 μg/mL, EGC 167.82 μg/mL and ellagic acid 8.26 μg/mL. We compared the astringency thresholds reported in other countries: EGC (160 μg/mL), EC (270 μg/mL), GC (165.38 μg/mL), rutin (0.0007 μg/mL), and hyperin (0.3 μg/mL)12,23. The results showed that the astringency threshold determined in this study was higher. There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, in terms of methodology. The half-tongue test method used in previous studies, which uses a solution to locally stimulate a specific tongue area (e.g., the lateral margin) to determine perception thresholds, is more sensitive and biases towards detecting the lowest perceivable concentration. The 3-AFC method used in this study required subjects to identify the target sample from three samples, and the results were usually above the perception threshold24. The next factor was region and dietary habits. It was found that Chinese people had lower taste thresholds than Indians25. People in inland areas generally have higher taste thresholds than those in coastal areas, as individuals preferring high-intensity tastes often develop higher thresholds26. Third is age and oral saliva. Numerous studies have shown that older people have higher astringency thresholds than younger people27,28. Oral salivary flow was found to be negatively correlated with astringency sensitivity in young people, and the lower sensitivity in older people was due to lower levels of oral salivary proteins27. In conclusion, the evaluation method and the subject population can affect the taste threshold. The evaluators in this study all lived in Sichuan and Chongqing for a long time, had a heavy taste, and had the habit of drinking tea for a long time, which may have reduced their taste sensitivity. Existing international astringency thresholds are mostly based on data from European and American populations, and future studies could consider physiological and cultural differences in populations from different regions to guide more accurate food flavor design.

DoT values are a useful metric for identifying the key taste substances in tea. When the DoT value was greater than 1, it indicated that the component had a significant contribution to the taste of tea. The DoT values for astringent compounds in 20 early tea samples were presented in Table2: hyperin (1.88–6.38), rutin (0.39–2.19), vitexin (0.04–0.53), GC (0.61–3.08), GA (0.05–0.56), EC (0.36–0.87), EGC (2.54–9.15), and ellagic acid (0.77–4.70). Therefore, hyperin, rutin, GC, EGC, and ellagic acid were the possible key astringent substances in early tea as their DoT values (DoT > 1) exceeded those of vitexin, GA, and EC. Zhang13investigated the taste contributions of bitter and astringent substances in baked green tea and revealed that EGC, rutin, and hyperin were the key contributors to astringency, which was consistent with this study. Although the DoT value is a necessary condition for taste perception, the taste of tea broth is determined by multiple components, and the taste perception of a substance may be affected by the concentration effect, matrix effect, as well as the synergistic and antagonistic effects among substances. Therefore, this index cannot determine the actual contribution of taste substances alone. The taste contribution of a single substance needs to be verified in combination with taste recombination, omission, and addition experiments.

According to the results of VIP values (TableS1) and DoT values (Table2), rutin, hyperin, EGC, GC, and ellagic acid were preliminarily screened as the possible key astringent components of early tea. To further verify their contribution, we used taste recombination, omission, and addition experiments to determine whether they were key astringent compounds in early tea. In the recombination experiment, hyperin, rutin, GC, EGC, and ellagic acid were added to a blank matrix (deionized water) at the natural concentrations of randomly selected tea samples (ZC6, ZC14, ZC31). A radar chart was generated to score the taste properties of the three groups of tea infusions and recombinant samples (Fig.4, TableS2). The recombinant samples effectively simulated the astringency of the tea infusions. Moreover, the astringency of each recombinant sample closely matched of the original tea infusion, showing no significant difference. Thus, this further substantiates that hyperin, rutin, GC, EGC, and ellagic acid significantly contribute to the astringency of early tea.

The taste recombination results analysis of ZC6 (Group I Low astringency), ZC14 (Group II Middle astringency), and ZC31(Group III High astringency). Data were mean ± SEM. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01.

Following the taste recombination experiment, an omission experiment was conducted to verify the contributions of individual substances (EGC, GC, hyperin, rutin, and ellagic acid) to the astringency of early tea (Table3). Due to the high astringency of ZC31 and the change of astringency was more obvious; we chose the recombinant sample of ZC31 as the control sample.

Twelve panelists were asked to detect the solution lacking certain component by means of a triangle test. If the sample was detected correctly, the changes in taste intensities were evaluated on a scale from 0 (not detectable) to 10 (strongly detectable); significant, *p< 0.05; **p< 0.01.

In the first group of tests, EGC and GC were omitted from the completely reconstituted sample. For EGC, all 12 evaluators accurately identified the sample and unanimously agreed that the astringency was significantly lower than the completely reconstituted sample (5.21 → 3.32). Only 6 experts identified the samples missing GC, and noted the astringency was not significantly different from the fully reconstituted samples (5.21 → 4.70). The result indicated that EGC had a greater contribution to the astringency of early tea, whereas GC exhibited a weak contribution. Previous studies8,29also found EGC was significantly correlated with the astringency and bitterness of tea, while GC had a weak contribution through omission experiments.

In the second group, rutin and hyperin were omitted from completely reconstituted samples. Eight experts correctly identified the sample that lacked rutin and noted that the astringency was lower than the completely reconstituted sample (5.21 → 4.41). A total of 10 experts accurately identified the sample missing hyperin and agreed the astringency of this sample was significantly lower than the completely reconstituted sample, with a decrease in intensity from 5.21 to 3.90. Lastly, ellagic acid was removed from the completely reconstituted sample. Only 4 experts successfully identified the samples missing ellagic acid and the astringency of the partial samples was close to the complete samples, with an intensity of 4.92. The weak contribution of ellagic acid was probably due to its low concentration, which resulted in a less pronounced its astringency in early tea. We hypothesized that ellagic acid shared similar taste characteristics with other phenolic acids in tea and that astringency becomes evident only at high concentrations30. Therefore, the astringent substances in early tea included rutin, hyperin, EGC, GC, and ellagic acid, with rutin, hyperin, and EGC contributing more significantly to astringency, while GC and ellagic acid contributed less.

Based on the results of recombination and omission experiments, we conducted taste addition experiments of natural concentrations of hyperin (24.74 μg/mL), rutin (27.01 μg/mL), GC (398.25 μg/mL), EGC (942.26 μg/mL), and ellagic acid (16.83 μg/mL) into the LS (Group I: ZC34, ZC21, ZC29, ZC6, ZC1, ZC4, ZC2) to further verify the key astringent substances.

As illustrated in Fig.5, all five substances enhanced the astringency of the low-astringency samples. Notably, hyperin, rutin and EGC exhibited significant enhancement effects, whereas ellagic acid and GC showed no significant impact. This aligned with the results of recombination and omission experiments, indicated that hyperin, rutin, and EGC were key astringent components of early tea. Zhang31also identified rutin and hyperin as key astringent compounds, EGCG, ECG, and EGC significantly contribute to the astringency and bitterness of green tea.

The addition experiments of EGC (A), GC (B), rutin (C), hyperin (D) and ellagic acid (E) in group I samples(ZC29, ZC34, ZC21, ZC6, ZC1, ZC4, ZC2). And the taste-concentration curve of EGC at 0.5–6 times of the threshold concentration (F). Data were mean ± SEM. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01.

Considering that EGC possesses both bitter and astringent taste properties, we conducted a taste concentration experiment to further confirm the astringency of EGC in early tea. The result indicated that at 0.5–6 times of threshold concentrations, both bitterness and astringency of EGC increased with concentration with astringency been higher than bitterness as shown in Fig.5F. The concentration-taste intensity curve of EGC in early tea could fit the cubic function well, and the R2values were all above 0.997. Astringency score of EGC = 0.4673×3–3.05×2+ 5.9016X + 0.6937; bitterness score of EGC = 3.8135×3–8.9775×2+ 7.67X + 0.1107. Notably, at the tea concentration, the astringency of EGC was more evident than its bitterness. This further validated that EGC was a key astringent component in early tea. Xu9,10et al. found that the intensity of bitterness and astringency in EGC increased with the increase of concentration and astringency was greater than bitterness, which was consistent with the results of this study.

We observed that ZC2 from the LS group contained significantly higher levels of EGC (1476.53 μg/mL) compared to other samples in the same group, but had lower concentrations of rutin and hyperin. Conversely, in the HS group, ZC19 exhibited the lowest EGC content (880.15 μg/mL) while exhibiting elevated contents of rutin and hyperin. Thus, we speculated that an interaction existed among these three compounds to enhance the astringency of tea soup. Research indicated that rutin can inhibit the astringency of catechins like EGCG at low concentrations while promoting it at high concentrations32. Nevertheless, the interactions among EGC, hyperin, and rutin require further research.

Most studies suggested that ester catechins EGCG and ECG were the key components of green tea astringency18,21However, in this study, we found that the contents of EGCG and ECG were higher in early tea, but there was no significant difference between different astringency groups. It was speculated that EGCG and ECG had contributed to the astringency of early tea, but they were not the key astringent substances that cause the change of astringency. And, the bitterness of EGCG and ECG was easier to perceive at high concentrations33,34. So, compared with astringency, EGCG and ECG in early tea might contribute more to bitterness.

Fixation is a key process affecting the formation and transformation of astringent substances in green tea. Based on the key astringent substances in early tea, we selected three key parameters according to the existing early tea process: fixation temperature of 280 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C; the fixation time of 55 s, 65 s, 75 s and the amount of leaves of 100 kg/h, 150 kg/h, 200 kg/h. Taking the sensory evaluation and key astringent substances content of different combinations of fixation parameters as indexes, L9 (33) orthogonal test was used to investigate the effects of different fixation parameters on the astringency and optimized the best fixation parameters22.

First of all, to more intuitively understand the sensory quality of early tea samples under different fixation parameters, the sensory evaluation of 12 experts through traditional sensory evaluation methods was shown in TableS3. Except for the sample with the fixation temperature of 320 °C, the shape scores of other samples were not much different. They were shown strong buds and emerald green color. At the same time, the color of tea soup was more greenish. It indicated that the degradation of chlorophyll was alleviated at lower fixation temperature and the yellowing of tea color and soup color was prevented35. From the description of aroma and taste, the aroma of the samples at 280°C and 300°C was dominated by fresh and floral aroma, and chestnut aroma was the characteristic aroma of the samples at 320°C. The overall taste was dominated by freshness, with heavier green astringency in the 280 °C killed samples, and obvious sweetness aftertaste in the 300°C and 320°C killed samples although there was bitterness and astringency. However, from the scores, 280 °C and 320 °C fixation samples had lower ratings.

At the low temperature and short time of fixation, endogenous enzyme activities in tea are stimulated, and catechin analogs undergo enzymatic oxidative polymerization to generate catechin dimers36, which produce astringent flavors. As the temperature rose, differential isomerization of catechins, with a decrease in the content of cis-catechin, ester-catechin, non-esterified catechin, and an increase in the content of trans-catechin and gallic acid. Bitterness and astringency of the tea were broth decreased37,38. At the same time, the breakage of glycosidic bonds of flavonoids and the reduction of flavonoid glycoside content, e.g., rutin is decomposed into quercetin glycosides and sugar ligands39. EGC, rutin and hyperin are all polyphenols have a nucleophilic structure, and under high-temperature conditions, the C-6 and C-8 positions on the structure of polyphenols can capture carbonyl compounds produced by the Maillard reaction and lipid degradation, and combine to form adducts40. For example, capture the Strecker reaction degradation products produced by theanine under high-temperature conditions to create new compounds such as N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavan-3-ols (EPSFs)38. All these substances affect the quality of tea. However, with prolonged high temperatures, catechins undergo coupling reactions and intramolecular rearrangements with catechin oxidative condensation products to form browning products and bitter substances41. Therefore, both excessive and insufficient degrees of fixation adversely affect the taste of tea. An appropriate level of fixation enhances both the sensory quality and nutritional value of tea.

The astringency of early tea was closely related to the content of astringent substances. We quantitatively detected the key astringent components (EGC, rutin, hyperin) combined with the taste score and the total score of sensory evaluation to obtain the best fixation process parameters of early tea. The results of the orthogonal experiment of early tea fixation process by range analysis were shown in Table4. The fixation temperature (R = 6.33, R = 3.37) had the greatest influence on the taste and total sensory quality of early tea. The best fixation condition for the sensory quality of tea was A2B2C2 (fixation temperature 300 °C, fixation time 65 s, leaf amount 150 kg/h). The EGC content was most affected by fixation temperature (A), followed by leaf amount (C) and fixation time (B) and the best fixation condition was A2B1C3 (fixation temperature 300 °C, fixation time 55 s, leaf amount 200 kg/h). The most important factor that affected the content of rutin was the amount of leaf (R = 1.50) and the best combination of fixation parameters was A2B2C2 (fixation temperature 300 °C, fixation time 65 s, and leaf amount 150 kg/h). The most important factor that affected the hyperin content was the fixation temperature (R = 3.88) and the best fixation condition was A2B2C2 (fixation temperature 300 °C, fixation time 65 s, and leaf amount 150 kg/h). Therefore, based on the best sensory quality and the lowest content of astringent substances, we concluded that A2B2C2 (fixation temperature 300 °C, fixation time 65 s, leaf amount 150 kg/h) was the best fixation process for early tea.

Factor A stands for fixation temperature: A1 = 280 °C; A2 = 300 °C; A3 = 320 °C. Factor B stands for fixation time: B1 = 55 s; B2 = 65 s; B3 = 75 s. Factor C stands for leaf amount: C1 = 100 kg/h; C2 = 150 kg/h; C3 = 200 kg/h. k: the average value of the data for each factor at each level; R: the range of each factor. The data were expressed as ‘mean ± standard deviation’. The Tukey test showed that there was no significant difference in the values of the same letters in each column (p< 0.05).

To verify the optimal fixation process, we evaluated the astringency intensity of early tea samples treated with nine different fixation parameters by QDA. As shown in TableS4, the astringency intensity of A2B2C2 (fixation temperature 300 °C, fixation time 65 s, leaf amount 150 kg/h) sample was significantly lower than that of other samples (P< 0.001), and there was no significant difference in astringency intensity with low astringency group samples. In summary, based on the best sensory quality and the lowest content of key astringent substances, the optimal fixation process for early tea in Chuanyu region was fixation temperature of 300 °C, fixation time of 65 s, and leaf amount of 150 kg/h.

This study successfully identified the key astringent substances in early tea and optimized the fixation process to mitigate its astringency. Through QDA and metabolomics, eight candidate compounds were initially screened. The taste thresholds of these substances in 25 °C aqueous solution were determined, followed by DoT value calculations for 20 early tea samples, indicating that hyperin, rutin, GC, EGC, and ellagic acid were potential astringent contributors. Further verification via recombination, omission, and addition experiments pinpointed hyperin, rutin, and EGC as the critical astringent substances. Subsequently, orthogonal tests established the optimal fixation conditions: 300 °C of fixation temperature, fixation time of 65 s, and 150 kg/h of leaf amount. Under this condition, the astringency of early tea decreased significantly from 4.42–5.83 (high astringency group) to 2.50, comparable to the low astringency group (1.53–2.40). These findings provide a new perspective for the early de-astringency technology of tea. Future research will focus on the leaf temperature, water content and enzymatic reaction of early tea under different fixation conditions, and explore the transformation mechanism of astringent substances during processing, and investigate the effects of different fixation methods and parameters on the quality of early tea.

In this study, 20 early tea samples were collected from eight major producing areas in the Chuanyu region between January and mid-March 2023 for the identification of astringent substances (Table5). The fresh tea leaves (single buds) utilized for optimizing the fixation process were harvested from Fu Ding Da Bai tea in the Nanchuan district (Chongqing, China) in mid-March 2024. All early tea samples were stored in a refrigerator at −20 °C for subsequent analysis.

The QDA evaluation of 20 early tea samples and the samples with different fixation treatments referred to Li15. Twelve experienced experts from the College of Food Science at Southwest University (Chongqing, China) were recruited to form a sensory panel (4 males and 8 females, 24–30 years old). Before participation, informed consent was obtained from each expert and they were compensated for their time. Before the experiment, they were trained at least 20 times. The MES and F values in the Panel Check software were used to evaluate the repeatability and discrimination of the evaluators. After the stability of the repeatability and discrimination of the evaluators was achieved, the early tea soup was provided for evaluation (Fig.S1). To quantify the taste qualities, standard solutions were prepared in deionized water: quinine monohydrochloride dihydrate for bitterness, tannic acid for astringency, monosodium glutamate for umami, sucrose for sweetness, and citric acid for sourness. After the tea infusion was brewed, quickly filtered and cooled to 40 ± 2 °C. Samples were presented to the experts to score after random three-digit coding. A 10-point scale was utilized to assess flavor intensity, with designations as follows: 0–2 for “extremely weak,” 2–4 for “weak,” 4–6 for “moderate,” 6–8 for “strong,” and 8–10 for “extremely strong”42. The experts involved tasted two samples at five-minute intervals, with each sample being assessed three times.

The traditional sensory evaluation of samples with different fixation degrees referred to the GB/T 23776-2018 standard43. Tea soup was provided to experts for evaluation after brewing. Experts evaluated the appearance, soup color, aroma, taste, and leaf bottom of samples treated with different fixation parameters. Each attribute was scored on a 100-point scale, with weights as follows: appearance (25%), soup color (10%), aroma (25%), taste (30%), and leaf bottom (10%).

According to the differences of astringency, the 20 tea samples were categorized into three groups: low (LS), middle (MS), and high (HS) astringency. To investigate the key astringent compounds in early tea with different astringency, we referred to the metabolomics analysis methods outlined in related studies17,44to preliminarily screened the potential astringent substances in the three groups of early tea samples with different astringency intensities. Briefly, 50 mg tea samples were weighed, added 600 μL methanol and vortexed for 30 s. Placed in a tissue grinder at 55 Hz for 60 s and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane before LC-MS detection.

An ACQUITY UPLC® HSS T3 (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) chromatographic column was used with flow a rate of 0.3 mL/min, temperature of 40 °C and injection volume of 2 μL. In the positive ion mode, the mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B1) and 0.1% formic acid in water (A1). The gradient elution program was as follows: 0–1 min, 8% B1; 1–8 min, 8%-98% B1; 8–10 min, 98% B1; 10–10.1 min, 98%-8% B1and 10.1–12 min, 8% B1. In the negative ion mode, the mobile phase included acetonitrile (B2) and 5 mM ammonium format in water (A2). The gradient elution program for the negative mode was: 0–1 min, 8% B2; 1–8 min, 8–98% B2; 8–10 min, 98% B2; 10–10.1 min, 98%-8% B2 and 10.1–12 min, 8% B245.

The positive ion spray voltage was 3.50 kV, while the negative ion spray voltage was −2.50 kV. The sheath gas flow rate was 40 arbs, and the auxiliary gas flow was 10 arbs. The capillary temperature was 325 °C, and the first-order full scan was 70,000. The first-order ion scanning range was m/z 100–1000, The collision energy for second-order cleavage conducted was 30 eV, and the second-order resolution was 17,500.

Accurately weighed 0.2 g tea powder was combined with 5 mL of 70% methanol. After leaching in a water bath at 70 °C for 10 min, centrifugated at 3500 rpm for 10 min and collected the supernatant. Repeatedly extracted and combined supernatant to constant a volume of 10 mL, and filtered by 0.22 μm membrane filters for the determination of hyperin, rutin, vitexin, EC, GC,GA, and EGC.

The contents of hyperin, rutin and vitexin were measured according to Liu21with minor modifications. 20 μL of the filtrate was injected into a TC-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) of LC-1220 HPLC (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) instrument. UV detection at 360 nm, a mobile phase comprising acetonitrile/formic acid/water (3:0.15:96.85, v/v) for phase A and acetonitrile/formic acid/water (30:0.15:69.85, v/v) for phase B; a flow rate of 1 mL/min; a column temperature of 25 °C; and an injection volume of 20 μL. The gradient elution program was as follows: 0% B,0–20 min; 0–50% B, 20–28 min; 50–100% B, 28–37 min; 100% B, 37.8–65 min; 100-0% B, 65–68 min; and 0% B, 68–70 min.

The contents of EC, GC, GA, and EGC were detected using the method referred to Zeng47. 20 μL filtrate was injected into the TC-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). The flow rate, column temperature, injection volume and detection wavelength were 0.9 mL/min, 35 °C, 20 μL, and 278 nm.

The recognition threshold in distilled water at 25 °C was determined using the 3-Alternative Forced Choice (3-AFC) method49. Using the panel in 2.2, in the first test, the experts were familiarized with the experimental method by simple instructions. In each subsequent experiment, the experts were simultaneously given three cups of randomly numbered samples, one of which was the sample to be tested and the other two were distilled water. The test sample was an aqueous solution of astringent substance. Each sample was tested three times in a different order, and each expert had to correctly identify the test sample at least two times and score the astringency of the identified sample. The recognition threshold was calculated using the formula:Y=a+bX, where Y represents the correct recognition rate and X denotes the logarithm of the mass concentration of the compound. When Y reached 66.7%, the corresponding X concentration indicated the recognition threshold for the compound50.

The astringency recombination experiment was referred to the method of Zhang51. The panel in section 2.2 was selected. Three samples (ZC6, ZC14, and ZC31) were randomly chosen from each group (Group I, Group II, and Group III). Distilled water served as the blank matrix, while the recombinant solution was prepared based on the natural concentrations of hyperin, rutin, GC, EGC, and ellagic acid in the selected samples. Three tea samples were paired with their corresponding recombinant sample. Astringency intensity in the recombinant samples was assessed in relation to that of the tea samples.

After the recombination experiment, a taste omission experiment was conducted. ZC31 was selected due to its pronounced astringency and easy observation. The experimental method was adapted from Peng52. By omitting each individual substance from the fully recombinant sample of ZC31, partial recombinant samples of the five astringent substances were created. Each group of samples was provided to experts, who were tasked to identify the samples with distinct tastes from three options (1 partially reconstructed sample and 2 fully reconstructed samples) and to compare the astringency of which fully reconstructed sample used the 3-AFC method.

The addition experiment was conducted with the method of Wei17. The tea infusion of the low astringency group (ZC34, ZC21, ZC29, ZC6, ZC1, ZC4, ZC2) was prepared. Selected astringent substances (hyperin, rutin, GC, EGC, and ellagic acid) were incorporated to assess the taste intensity of the tea infusion, based on the average concentration derived from 20 early tea samples. The tea infusion was randomly assigned to a trained panel of experts for sensory evaluation, under the method in section 2.2.

The EGC taste concentration experiment was referred to Xu10and briefly modified. A series of concentration solutions were prepared using the average concentration (942.26 μg/mL) of 20 tea samples and 0.5,1,2,3,4,5,6 times of the EGC astringency threshold concentration (83.91, 167.82, 335.64, 503.46, 671.28, 839.10, 1006.92 μg/mL). Experts compared and evaluated the bitterness and astringency of different concentrations and the same concentration of EGC solution. Each sample was repeated three times with an interval of 5 min.

The experimental design was referred to Wang6. Fu ding Da bai Cha single buds were utilized as the raw material. The processing flow and parameters were referred to the renowned early tea manufacturers in the Chuanyu region. An orthogonal test design consisted of three factors at three levels was employed, with fixation temperature, time, and leaf amount served as the experimental factors, while other process parameters remained constant.

Spreading: Fresh leaves were spread in a spreading trough (6CWD-5, Quzhou Mingcha Tea Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) at room temperature for 8 h until the leaf moisture content reached approximately 70%.

Fixing: A rotary cylinder (6CST-50, Zhejiang Shangyang Machinery Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) was used. The specific fixation parameters were detailed in Table6.

Shaping: After cooling the fixed leaves for 1 h, a shaping machine (6CLZ-80, Zhejiang Shangyang Machinery Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) was employed, followed the sequence: 240 °C for 3 min at 1000 rpm, added 1 kg press bar at 930 rpm for 4 min and then processed at 220 °C for 3 min at 900 rpm.

Drying: A tea flavoring machine (6CHT-7, Zhejiang Chunjiang Tea Machinery Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) was used. The tea was initially dried at 95 °C for 15 min and then re-dried at 85 °C for 1 h.

The cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), PLS-DA (partial least square-discriminate analysis), and permutation test were performed by SIMCA-P 14.1 (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden). Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way ANOVA using SPSS statistics software (Version 23.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
