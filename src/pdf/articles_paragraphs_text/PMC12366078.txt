Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a critical diabetes complication that raises mortality risk, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) settings where metabolic disturbances are more pronounced. The prevalence and economic burden of DN are growing globally, posing a major public health challenge. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and serum calcium (SC) levels, which frequently exhibit significant alterations in critically ill patients, are linked to DN progression. However, the role of the RDW to SC (RCR) ratio in predicting mortality among critically ill DN patients remains understudied. This study aims to explore the RCR index’s relationship with mortality in ICU patients with DN, aiding high-risk patient identification and prognostic strategy formulation in critical care settings.

Data was sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were categorized into four groups based on their RCR index. Primary endpoints were 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints were 90-day and 180-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to visualize outcomes by quartiles. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) methods assessed the RCR index’s impact on prognosis. Subgroup analyses were also conducted.

Among 1,265 participants (median age: 73.00 years; 64.27% male), higher RCR index values were associated with increased all-cause mortality risks at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days (Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rankP< 0.01). Cox regression revealed higher mortality risks for patients in the highest quartile. RCS analysis showed a linear relationship between the RCR index and all-cause mortality, with inflection points at 2.361 (30-day mortality) and 2.098 (365-day mortality). Specifically, each unit increase below 2.361 in the RCR index was associated with a 414.0% increased 30-day mortality risk (P< 0.001; 95% CI: 3.041–8.688). For 365-day mortality, each additional unit below 2.098 increased risk by 494.2% (P< 0.001; 95% CI: 3.733–9.458).

The RCR index exhibits a linear relationship with all-cause mortality in DN patients. It may serve as a useful indicator for assessing disease severity and guiding ICU treatment decisions, enhancing clinician decision-making and patient outcomes.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) represents a complex clinical syndrome and one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), characterized by diverse histological manifestations including glomerular basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, nodular sclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions), and advanced diabetic glomerulosclerosis [1]. As a clinical diagnosis that encompasses this spectrum of pathological changes, DN significantly increases mortality risk in affected patients [2]. Epidemiological statistics demonstrate a dramatic rise in both the incidence and prevalence of DN over the past decade [3]. Among patients with diabetes, approximately 30%-40% will develop DN. This Kidney lesion directly caused by diabetes has become a key component of the Disease burden of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) [4–7]. Notably, about 30% of type 2 diabetes patients may eventually develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [8], with the substantial costs of renal replacement therapy further exacerbating socioeconomic burdens [9,10]. More seriously, the epidemiological data of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States from 1999 to 2020 indicated that the number of deaths related to DN continued to increase significantly [11]. This clinical scenario becomes particularly critical in intensive care settings. Critically ill diabetic patients frequently develop more severe metabolic disturbances, where the complex interplay between systemic metabolic abnormalities and renal microenvironment dysfunction leads to significant hematological alterations, substantially increasing the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) [12]. When considering the high incidence and mortality rates of DN, its substantial economic burden, and the further exacerbated clinical risks in critical conditions, these compounding factors collectively represent a pressing public health challenge that urgently requires the development of precise prognostic tools tailored for critically ill patients.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), reflecting erythrocyte size variability, shows a strong association with systemic inflammatory status as inflammation disrupts erythropoiesis and shortens erythrocyte lifespan [13,14]. On the other hand, serum calcium (SC) participates in crucial physiological processes including neuromuscular excitability, cardiac electrophysiology, glandular secretion, and coagulation [15]. Previous studies have established hypocalcemia as a validated predictor of poor outcomes in critically ill patients [16]. RDW and SC, as conventional and simple detection parameters, can be obtained through simple venous blood collection. Recently, the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to serum calcium (RCR) has emerged as an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcomes across various diseases due to its clinical accessibility [17,18]. However, the prognostic significance of the RCR in critically ill patients with DN remains unexplored. This vulnerable population exhibits substantially elevated mortality risk compared to their stable DN counterparts [19,20], underscoring the critical need for reliable risk stratification tools in intensive care medicine. The present study, therefore, aims to systematically evaluate the association between RCR and all-cause mortality in this high-risk population, with the potential to offer clinically relevant biomarkers for early identification of at-risk patients and inform targeted therapeutic strategies.

This study is a secondary analysis of existing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV). MIMIC-IV is the result of a collaboration between Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Data collected at BIDMC as part of routine clinical care are de-identified, transformed, and made available to researchers who have completed training in human research and signed a data use agreement [21]. A researcher who has completed the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative exam (certification number 61042076 for author Huang) can access this database. The institutional review boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved Consent for data collection in the MIMIC project. Therefore, patient informed consent and ethical approval were exempted from this study.

We first obtained raw data using Structured Query Language (version 14.0) with Navicat Premium software (version 15.0.12). Structured Query Language was used to extract patient data, including socio-demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory parameters, complications, and microbiological information [22]. Patients in the database who met the following criteria were selected for the present study: [1] fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for DN. ICD-9 (24940 and 24941) and ICD-10 (E0921, E1021, E1029, E1121, E1122, E1129, E1321, and E1329) codes were used to identify patients with DN in the MIMIC-IV database; [2] first ICU admission at first hospitalization; [3] length of hospital stay > 48 h and length of ICU stay > 24 h; [4] age > 18 years; [5] elimination of duplicate patient data. Finally, 1,265 patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into four groups based on quartiles of RCR (Fig.1).

Variables with > 30% missing data in MIMIC-IV, such as C-reactive protein, height, and human serum albumin, were excluded from the present study. A total of 44 variables were extracted. The predictors included: (a) demographic information: age and gender; (b) comorbidities: myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease and obesity; (c) first day ICU vital signs: mean heart rate, mean blood pressure (MBP), mean respiratory rate and mean temperature; (d) first day ICU laboratory results: Mean glucose level, minimum and maximum anion gap levels, minimum and maximum bicarbonate levels, mean serum calcium level, minimum and maximum serum chloride levels, minimum and maximum serum sodium levels, minimum and maximum serum potassium levels, mean creatinine levels, mean blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, haematocrit, haemoglobin level, platelets count, white blood cells (WBC) count, red blood cells (RBC) count, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), maximum and minimum partial thromboplastin time (PTT), maximum and minimum prothrombin time (PT), maximum and minimum international normalised ratio (INR) and urine output; (e) organ scores: Simplified Acute Physiology Score Ⅱ (SAPS-Ⅱ), Acute Physiology Score Ⅲ (APS-Ⅲ), Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary endpoints of this study were 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included 90-day and 180-day all-cause mortality.

Data were analyzed using SPSS 27.0 software. In this study, 1265 participants were evenly divided into four groups based on the baseline calculated RCR to make the numbers approximately equal. Normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilks test. Continuous variables with normal distribution are presented as mean (SD, standard deviation) and compared using Student t-tests or one-way ANOVA. Non-normally distributed data were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were expressed as percentages and compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Variables with > 20% missing values were excluded from further analysis, while those with ≤ 20% were filled. The missing values in the continuous data were imputed using the mean, while the counting data were imputed using the mode. The variables are presented and compared in Table1.

With stratification by RCR index, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves were used to determine the incidence rate of primary and secondary outcomes. Univariable Cox analyses were performed to assess the relationships between the RCR index and 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 365-day mortality. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model included variables that were clinically relevant or had a univariate relationship with the outcome. Our regression analysis included four different models to provide a comprehensive assessment of the relationship under investigation. Model 1 included only the RCR index. Model 2 adjusted for glucose_mean, sodium_min, hematocrit_mean, and rbc_mean. Model 3 adjusted for glucose_mean, sodium_min, creatinine_mean, hemoglobin_mean, hematocrit_mean, rbc_mean. For three models, the lowest quartile of the RCR index was used as the reference. To further investigate the relationship between SC and mortality across RCR quartiles, we performed a comprehensive analysis including: (1) univariate Cox regression (Model 1) to assess crude associations; (2) multivariate-adjusted Models 2 (adjusted for glucose_mean, sodium_min, hematocrit_mean, and rbc_mean)and Model3 (adjusted for glucose_mean, sodium_min, creatinine_mean, hemoglobin_mean, hematocrit_mean, rbc_mean) to evaluate SC-mortality relationships at 30, 90, 180, and 365-day timepoints; and (3) interaction analysis with trend testing to examine potential synergistic effects between SC and RCR. This stratified analytical approach allowed us to determine whether SC’s prognostic value varied by RCR levels while controlling for potential confounders. Finally, we performed time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to compare the predictive performance between serum calcium and RCR.

The RCR index was also analyzed as a continuous variable using RCS to allow flexibility in exploring potential non-linear relationships between RCR values and in-hospital mortality. If the association was non-linear, a recursive algorithm was used to determine the inflection point between the RCR index and mortality at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days. To further explore the relationship between the RCR index and mortality at these time points, a two-stage Cox proportional hazards model was applied on either side of the inflection point.

Furthermore, we also used subgroup analyses to evaluate different groups of patients. These subgroups included gender, age, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, and obesity.

All statistical analyses were performed utilizing SPSS version 27.0 and R software (package version 4.3.2), with the significance level established atP< 0.05.

A total of 1,265 patients diagnosed with DN were finally included in our study. The mean age of patients enrolled in the study was 73.00 (65.00,80.00) years, and the percentage of males was 64.27%. Based on the quartiles of the RCR index at enrolment (Q1: < 1.58, Q2: 1.58–1.73, Q3: 1.73–1.95, Q4: ≥1.95), the baseline characteristics of the study participants were analyzed and are presented in Table1. Participants in the highest RCR index group showed distinct clinical characteristics compared to the lower group, including: (1) higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and obesity; (2) elevated heart rate and body temperature with lower mean blood pressure; (3) increased anion gap levels (both minimum and maximum values), serum creatinine, and BUN levels, along with decreased bicarbonate levels (both minimum and maximum values); (4) prolonged PT and INR (both minimum and maximum values); (5) reduced hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, WBC count, RBC count, and urine output; and (6) higher severity scores (APS-III, SAPS-II, LODS, and OASIS). Meanwhile, in the group Q4, 30-day mortality (8.97% vs. 11.48% vs. 18.21% vs. 25.31%,P< 0.001), 90-day mortality (15.06% vs. 17.38% vs. 25.00% vs. 37.69%,P< 0.001), 180-day mortality (19.23% vs. 20.66% vs. 30.25% vs.45.37%,P< 0.001), and 365-day mortality (24.04% vs. 25.90% vs. 38.89% vs. 54.94%,P< 0.001) were all higher than in the other three groups.

Kaplan-Meier curves (Fig.2) showed differences in survival rates among the four RCR quartile groups for 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 365-day mortality. Patients in the highest RCR index group (Q4) had significantly lower 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 365-day survival rates than those in the lower RCR index groups (log-rankP< 0.0001). Except that there was no difference in survival rate between Q1 and Q2 groups, there were differences in 30-day, 90-day, 180-day and 365-day survival rate among other groups (P< 0.05).

Four Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the independent effects of the RCR index on mortality (Tables2and3; Supplementary Tables1and2). After adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates including glucose_mean, sodium_min, hematocrit_mean, rbc_mean (Model 2), the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the RCR index categories (Q1: < 1.58, Q2༚1.58–1.73, Q3༚1.73–1.95, Q4༚≥1.95) for 30-day all-cause mortality were as follows: 1.000 (reference), 1.389(0.849–2.272), 2.303(1.461–3.631), and 3.516(2.270–5.446), respectively. In model 3, glucose_mean, sodium_min, creatinine_mean, hemoglobin_mean, hematocrit_mean, and rbc_mean were adjusted, and the HR and 95% CI of the RCR index classification of 30-day all-cause mortality were obtained as follows: 1.000 (reference), 1.397(0.850–2.294), 2.333(1.454–3.745), and 3.587(2.239–5.745), respectively. For 365-day all-cause mortality, the HRs in Model 2 were 1.000 (reference), 1.107(0.809–1.515), 1.935(1.452–2.579), and 3.274(2.487–4.310), respectively. In Model 3, the HRs were 1.000 (reference), 1.062(0.775–1.457), 1.767(1.310–2.383), and 2.886(2.141–3.890), respectively. These findings suggest that patients with an RCR index of ≥ 1.95 have a significantly higher risk of both 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality compared to those with an RCR index of < 1.95. Similar trends were observed for 90-day and 180-day all-cause mortality.

Moreover, we conducted comprehensive analyses to evaluate the association between serum calcium levels and mortality across RCR quartiles. In the unadjusted model (Model 1), we observed a distinct RCR quartile-specific relationship: serum calcium showed significant associations with 30-day (HR 0.481, 95% CI 0.276–0.836,p= 0.009), 90-day (HR 0.493, 95% CI 1.05–1.49,p= 0.003), and 180-day mortality (HR 0.570, 95% CI 0.372–0.874,p= 0.010) exclusively in Q3, while the remaining 13 subgroup comparisons were non-significant (allp> 0.05). This pattern persisted in multivariable analyses: Model 2 (adjusted for glucose_mean, sodium_min, hematocrit_mean, and rbc_mean) and Model 3 (further adjusted for creatinine_mean and hemoglobin_mean) yielded consistent results (Supplementary Tables3–6). Subsequent interaction analysis demonstrated significant time-dependent effects of calcium-rcr levels in the third quartile (Q3) across evaluated time points (90-day, 180-day, and 365-day mortality;p= 0.015, 0.025, and 0.048, respectively). Notably, this interaction effect in the fourth quartile (Q4) reached statistical significance only for 365-day mortality (p= 0.046). Trend analysis indicated that the time-interaction effect was statistically significant solely at the 365-day follow-up (p= 0.002).

We performed time-dependent ROC curve analyses to compare the predictive performance between serum calcium and RCR. The results demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy of RCR across all timepoints, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.651 (30-day), 0.655 (90-day), 0.656 (180-day), and 0.661 (365-day mortality), compared to SC alone (AUC: 0.597, 0.574, 0.564, and 0.559 for corresponding timepoints, respectively). These findings consistently indicated that RCR exhibited significantly better predictive capability than isolated SC measurements (Supplementary Fig.1).

The analysis using RCS revealed a linear relationship between the RCR index and all-cause mortality at various time points: 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 365-day (Fig.3A, B and C, and3D). To further threshold effect analysis, both Cox proportional hazard models and two-piecewise Cox proportional hazard models were utilized, with significant results from the log-likelihood ratio tests (P< 0.05 for both models) (Tables4and5; Supplementary Tables7and8).

The analysis identified inflection points of 2.361 for 30-day all-cause mortality, 2.349 for 90-day all-cause mortality, 2.205 for 180-day all-cause mortality, and 2.098 for 365-day all-cause mortality. When the RCR index was below these thresholds, each unit increase in the RCR level was associated with a significant rise in the risk of all-cause mortality. Specifically, for 30-day mortality, each additional unit increase in the RCR index below 2.361 was associated with a 414.0% increase in risk (P< 0.001; 95% CI: 3.041–8.688). For 365-day mortality, a RCR index below 2.098 correlated with a 494.2% increased risk per additional unit (P< 0.001; 95% CI: 3.733–9.458). Similarly, for 90-day and 180-day mortality, each unit increase in RCR below 2.349 and 2.205 was associated with a 407.8% and 439.7% increase in risk, respectively (P< 0.001; 95% CI: 3.282–7.857 for 90-day andP< 0.001; 95% CI: 3.425–8.053 for 180-day mortality).

To further investigate the consistency of the relationship between RCR levels and all-cause mortality at 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 365-day intervals across various conditions, subgroup analyses were conducted based on gender, age, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, and obesity. The results showed that in the subgroup analysis with 30-day all-cause mortality as the outcome event, except for peripheral vascular diseases, the RCR levels and all-cause mortality of DN patients in the remaining subgroups were statistically significant (P< 0.05). In the analyses with mortality rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days as the outcome times, all subgroups were statistically significant (P< 0.05) (Fig.4A, B, C and D). Meanwhile, the interactive analysis showed that based on age (greater than or less than 65 years old), gender, the presence of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, liver disease and history of obesity, there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality at 30 days, 90 days, 180 days and 365 days (Fig.4A, B, C and D).

This study constitutes the inaugural retrospective analysis examining the association between RCR levels and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with DN. Our findings indicate that patients in the highest RCR index quartile (Q4) exhibited significantly reduced survival rates at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days compared to those in lower quartiles. Additional analyses identified partial quartile-dependent associations, demonstrating that serum calcium showed statistically significant correlations with 90,180,365-day mortality exclusively in Q3 (p< 0.05), while no significant associations were observed in other quartiles. Moreover, time-dependent interaction analysis revealed differential patterns across quartiles: calcium-RCR interactions showed statistically significant associations at multiple timepoints in Q3 (90-day, 180-day, and 365-day mortality), while in Q4, a significant association was only observed at the 365-day endpoint. Most crucially, comparative ROC analysis unequivocally demonstrated RCR’s superior prognostic value, with consistently higher AUC values (0.651–0.661) than isolated serum calcium measurements (0.559–0.597) at all timepoints, thereby establishing RCR as a more reliable predictive biomarker.

Further investigation revealed a linear relationship between RCR index levels and all-cause mortality at these time points. Threshold analysis demonstrated that below a certain threshold, there was a significant correlation between RCR index levels and an elevated risk of mortality in DN patients; each unit increase in the RCR index corresponded to a multiplicative rise in the risk of all-cause mortality. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted on gender, age, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, and obesity. The results showed that, except for the fact that there was no statistically significant correlation between the 30-day all-cause mortality rate and the RCR level in patients with peripheral vascular disease (P≥ 0.05), the RCR levels of the remaining subgroups at different time points were significantly correlated with all-cause mortality (P< 0.05). These results may inform the development of clinical guidelines to mitigate mortality rates in this patient population.

Multiple studies have confirmed that the RCR index, as a simple and readily available clinical indicator, is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in various diseases. Existing research evidence indicates that this indicator has significant prognostic value in cardiovascular and digestive system diseases: it is not only significantly correlated with the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with acute myocardial infarction [17], but also can effectively predict the disease severity of patients with acute pancreatitis [18]. Based on the previous research foundation, this study applied the RCR index to the prognosis assessment of patients with DN for the first time. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between this index and the all-cause mortality rate of DN patients. This finding provides a new clinical idea for the risk stratification of DN.

Firstly, stratified analysis based on RCR index quartiles revealed statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days across quartile groups (p< 0.05). Compared to lower RCR quartiles, patients in the highest quartile (Q4) exhibited significantly reduced short-term and long-term survival rates (Fig.2). Secondly, RCS analysis further demonstrated a consistent linear positive correlation between RCR levels and all-cause mortality across all evaluated time points (Figs.3A-D). Finally, threshold effect analysis identified inflection points for mortality risk at 2.361 (30-day), 2.349 (90-day), 2.205 (180-day), and 2.098 (365-day), below which each unit increase in RCR was associated with a significant elevation in mortality risk. In fact, the predictive value of RCR may be mechanistically explained by the synergistic effect of elevated RDW and hypocalcemia. Previous studies have established that increased RDW significantly augments the risk of diabetic complications [23]. Supporting this, Magri and Fava’s multivariate analysis of 196 diabetic patients demonstrated a significant association between elevated RDW and diabetic nephropathy occurrence (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.15–2.35) [24]. Concurrently, hypocalcemia has been independently linked to renal function deterioration in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and increased risk of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) [25,26]. These findings collectively suggest that the combined impact of elevated RDW and reduced serum calcium levels likely underlies the robust predictive capacity of the RCR index.

The association between elevated RDW and adverse outcomes in DN may involve three key pathophysiological mechanisms: (1) glucose metabolism dysregulation-induced erythrocyte heterogeneity, (2) erythrocyte damage secondary to altered renal hemodynamics, and (3) oxidative stress and inflammation-mediated erythropoietic dysfunction.

First, as a central driver of DN, chronic hyperglycemia can impair renal function through various pathways, such as the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) [27]. Studies demonstrate that hyperglycemic conditions significantly increase erythrocyte volume heterogeneity, with elevated RDW showing a strong correlation with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [28]. This bidirectional relationship suggests RDW may serve as a critical biomarker linking glucose metabolism dysregulation and renal injury.

Second, the characteristic hyperfiltration state in early DN leads to abnormally elevated glomerular capillary pressure, exerting multiple pathological effects [29]. Increased intraglomerular pressure not only accelerates microvascular complications [30] but also reduces erythrocyte deformability through excessive shear stress. Notably, DN patients exhibit significantly impaired erythrocyte deformability compared to non-diabetic kidney disease patients [31]. These alterations, along with the increased tension of the filtration barrier, jointly promote mechanical damage to erythrocytes and subsequent peripheral RDW elevation [32,33], positioning RDW as a sensitive indicator of glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities.

Third, oxidative stress in DN pathogenesis impacts the erythrocyte system through multiple mechanisms. Chronic inflammation elevates RDW by suppressing bone marrow function, promoting erythrocyte apoptosis, inducing erythropoietin resistance, and reducing iron bioavailability [14,34]. Concurrently, oxidative stress shortens erythrocyte lifespan and accelerates premature release of reticulocytes into circulation [35]. Importantly, erythrocyte fragmentation and relative erythropoietin deficiency—both common in DN—independently contribute to RDW elevation [28,36]. Collectively, these findings establish RDW as an integrative marker of oxidative stress and microenvironmental changes in DN.

These interconnected mechanisms form the pathophysiological basis linking RDW with poor DN outcomes, suggesting RDW not only reflects disease activity but may also serve as a robust predictor of disease progression.

The potential mechanisms underlying the association between hypocalcemia and adverse outcomes in diabetic nephropathy (DN) may involve two key aspects: (1) cardiovascular effects of hypocalcemia, and (2) the complex interplay between hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) levels.

First of all, calcium ions play a critical role in neuronal and synaptic excitability as well as myocardial cell contraction [14]. Although the precise effects of hypocalcemia on myocardial cells remain incompletely understood, existing evidence demonstrates its association with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [37]. Furthermore, Lim et al. revealed that lower serum calcium levels correlated with reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), suggesting this relationship may elevate renal replacement therapy risk and accelerate renal function decline [25].

In addition, in chronic renal failure patients, hypocalcemia triggers increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, enhanced PTH mRNA stability, and parathyroid cell proliferation, collectively contributing to SHPT development [38]. While the SHPT-renal progression relationship requires further clarification, studies have shown that SHPT associates with higher CKD progression rates in predialysis diabetic patients [39], and with increased mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients [40,41] and male CKD stages 3–5 patients [42]. Moreover, SHPT plays a pivotal role in increasing FGF-23 expression. PTH promotes FGF-23 expression in osteoblast-like cells in vitro by activating protein kinase A and Wnt signaling pathways [43]. Multiple studies demonstrate that elevated FGF-23 levels not only significantly correlate with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) risk [44] but also serve as an independent ESRD predictor [45]. Notably, FGF-23 can also act on the kidneys to further reduce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3) synthesis in kidneys, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates both hypocalcemia and SHPT in CKD patients [43].

This evidence collectively suggests that hypocalcemia, SHPT, and FGF-23 form a pathophysiological triad that synergistically increases adverse outcome risks in DN patients. The intricate crosstalk between these factors creates a self-perpetuating cycle that accelerates renal and cardiovascular deterioration.

To further investigate the stability of the association between RCR index and all-cause mortality across different time points in DN patients, we conducted comprehensive subgroup analyses stratified by gender, age, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, and obesity. The statistical results demonstrated that RCR levels were significantly associated with all-cause mortality at all evaluated time points (P< 0.05) across all subgroups, with the sole exception of the 30-day mortality in patients with peripheral vascular disease (P≥ 0.05). Importantly, interaction analysis revealed no significant interaction effects between the RCR index and any of the examined subgroups. These findings indicate that none of the evaluated variables significantly modified the relationship between RCR and mortality risk at any time point, supporting the robustness of RCR as an independent prognostic factor in DN patients. This consistent association across diverse clinical subgroups reinforces the potential utility of RCR as a reliable and generalizable biomarker for mortality risk stratification in DN populations, irrespective of comorbidities or demographic characteristics.

While our study benefits from a comprehensive real-world dataset that robustly demonstrates the association between RCR and mortality in DN patients, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, as a single-center ICU study using the MIMIC-IV database, our findings may lack generalizability to non-ICU populations and require validation through multicenter prospective studies. Second, we were unable to determine the precise causes of death or assess DN-specific mortality due to database constraints. Third, several critical clinical parameters were unavailable: (1) AKI occurrence and CKD staging in higher RCR quartiles, which could have provided important mechanistic insights; (2) dialysis status, despite its well-established mortality association in DN; and (3) the ability to fully account for the known pathophysiological relationship between AKI/decreased GFR and hypocalcemia in critically ill patients, which may represent an important confounding factor. Furthermore, this study experienced data missingness, leading to the exclusion of approximately 20% of variables with incomplete data. We attempted to mitigate these challenges through interpolation using SPSS 27.0 software. Finally, as a retrospective analysis, our study is inherently limited in establishing causal relationships. These limitations underscore the need for future prospective studies that: (1) incorporate detailed renal function parameters and dialysis data; (2) investigate the RCR-calcium-AKI relationship; and (3) include broader population representation to confirm RCR’s prognostic utility in DN.

This study reveals a significant association between elevated RCR index and increased all-cause mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The findings suggest that incorporating RCR assessment into clinical practice may potentially aid in mortality risk evaluation and treatment decision-making for these patients. As a readily available biomarker derived from routine laboratory tests, RCR could offer supplementary prognostic information to complement existing risk assessment tools. However, these observations require confirmation through larger, multicenter prospective studies to better establish the clinical utility of RCR across diverse diabetic nephropathy populations. Such validation studies would help determine whether RCR monitoring could contribute to improved risk stratification and patient management in real-world clinical settings.
