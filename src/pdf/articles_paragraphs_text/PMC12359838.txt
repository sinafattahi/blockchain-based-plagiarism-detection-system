Sarcopenia is an age-related loss of muscle mass and strength that affects quality of life in older adults and may also increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal association between sarcopenia and the components of MetS. Data for this study were derived from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS).

The sample included 3,758 participants aged ≥ 60 years who were included in the baseline survey of CHARLS (2011) and followed up until 2015. Sarcopenia status was defined according to the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS2019). The diagnostic components of MetS were assessed according to the clinical criteria outlined in the 2022 expert consensus on the management of MetS in older adults in China. Cox proportional hazards regression (HR) models were used to evaluate the effect of sarcopenia the risk factors of MetS.

In this study, 1,252 individuals with sarcopenia and 2,506 individuals without sarcopenia were included. During follow-up, 489 MetS cases were observed among those without MetS at baseline. Participants with sarcopenia exhibited significantly lower body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triglycerides (TG), and blood glucose levels (allp< 0.001) compared to those without sarcopenia. After adjusting for sex, age, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity, hazard ratios (HR) in the sarcopenia group were significantly elevated for abdominal obesity (HR 8.24, 95% CI 6.56–10.27;p< 0.001), hypertriglyceridemia (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.40–3.20;p< 0.05), and MetS (HR 5.33, 95% CI 4.01–7.08;p< 0.001). In the BMI subgroup, the risk of sarcopenia was found to increase in elderly individuals within the low BMI of 18.5–23.9 kg/m2(HR 5.16, 95% CI: 4.91–5.36;p< 0.001) and < 18.5 kg/m2(HR 6.06, 95% CI: 5.98–6.51;p< 0.001).

Sarcopenia was significantly associated with specific components of MetS, particularly abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, low BMI emerged as a key factor related to sarcopenia development among older adults.

According to the most recent data from the Seventh National Census conducted in 2020, China has 264 million individuals aged 60 and above, accounting for 18.70% of the total population, of whom approximately 190 million are aged 65 and older (13.50%) [1]. By 2050, this number is projected to rise to 400 million people over 65 and 500 million over 80 years old [2]. With the rapid pace of population aging, promoting healthy aging has become a pressing public health priority in China. Age-related lifestyle changes, such as physical inactivity and nutritional decline, contribute to alterations in body composition, notably reductions in skeletal muscle mass and function [3,4].

Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive and age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, has been increasingly recognized as a major geriatric condition. It significantly increases the risks of disability, frailty, falls, fractures, hospitalization, and mortality, thereby severely compromising quality of life in older adults [5,6]. In China, with a growing elderly population, the burden of sarcopenia is expected to rise correspondingly. Its development is multifactorial, involving aging, malnutrition, chronic diseases, reduced physical activity, and certain medical interventions [7].

In recent years, sarcopenia has also been implicated in the development of various metabolic disorders, particularly metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS comprises a cluster of interrelated metabolic abnormalities, including central obesity, elevated blood pressure, hyperglycaemia, and dyslipidaemia, which together contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality [8,9]. Skeletal muscle plays a central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, accounting for approximately 80% of insulin-mediated glucose uptake under normal physiological conditions [10]. Consequently, muscle mass loss contributes to insulin resistance and impairs lipid and glucose metabolism [9]. Moreover, muscle contractions stimulate the release of myokines, which positively regulate metabolic functions and suppress systemic inflammation [11].

A growing body of epidemiological evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between muscle health and metabolic status. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated that individuals with sarcopenia are at greater risk of developing MetS and its components [12–14]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies involving over 35,000 non-obese middle-aged and older adults reported a MetS prevalence of 36.45% among those with sarcopenia [13]. Similarly, a Japanese cohort study of older adults showed a particularly strong association between sarcopenia and MetS in men aged 65–74 years (OR = 4.99) [14]. Longitudinal findings further indicate that increases in skeletal muscle index (SMI) are associated with lower MetS risk, whereas reductions in SMI are linked to elevated risks of MetS, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension [13,15–17]. These findings underscore the crucial role of skeletal muscle in metabolic regulation and suggest that sarcopenia may directly contribute to the pathophysiology of MetS.

Given the shared risk factors and underlying biological mechanisms, previous studies have suggested a potential link between sarcopenia and MetS. However, the specific pathways linking these two conditions remain poorly understood, particularly in older adults. In addition, there is a lack of large-scale, population-based research in China, and few studies have explored the relationship between sarcopenia and the individual components of MetS. Although sarcopenic obesity is also of clinical interest, the present study focuses specifically on sarcopenia alone to clarify its independent association with MetS components. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between sarcopenia and MetS among Chinese adults aged 60 years and older, using data from the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The findings are expected to provide scientific evidence to inform early identification, targeted intervention, and prevention strategies for sarcopenia and MetS in aging populations. Although sarcopenic obesity is also of clinical relevance, the present study focuses specifically on sarcopenia alone to clarify its independent association with MetS components.

The study population was drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS), a prospective cohort study featuring a population-based sample of individuals aged 45 years and older from 28 provinces across China. The survey collected comprehensive data on demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, retirement status, and health conditions [18]. The CHARLS datasets can be downloaded at the CHARLS homepage athttp://charls.pku.edu.cn/en. The CHARLS survey project was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Peking University (IRB00001052-11015), and all participants were required to sign informed consent.

Data from CHARLS waves 1 through 3 (2011–2015) provided the anthropometric and functional performance assessments necessary to evaluate sarcopenia status and metabolic syndrome-related indicators. The 2011 wave (Wave 1) served as the baseline survey for this study, which followed participants through Waves 2 (2013) and 3 (2015). For the present analysis, participants were included if they were aged ≥ 60 years at baseline and had complete data on sarcopenia and MetS components. Individuals with missing follow-up information or incomplete demographic variables were excluded. In addition, to assess the incidence of MetS, participants with MetS at baseline were excluded from the analytic sample. After applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3,758 participants were eligible for the final analysis. The participant selection flowchart is presented in Fig.1.

According to the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS2019), sarcopenia is defined when participants experienced low muscle mass coupled with low muscle strength or poor physical performance [19]. Skeletal muscle strength was assessed using grip strength measurements, conducted by trained examiners with a Yuejian TM WL-1000 dynamometer (Nantong Yuejian Physical Measuring Instruments Co., Ltd., Nantong). The average of the maximum available values for two repeated measurements were adopted. A cutoff point of < 18 kg for women and < 28 kg for men as the threshold for low muscle strength was implemented. Physical performance was assessed by a gait speed test, the criteria for low physical performance are gait speed < 1.0 m/s [19].

Muscle mass was estimated through the calculation of appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) using a validated anthropometric Eqs. [20,21]. The strong correlation between ASM obtained through this equation and those derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the Chinese population has been proven [22].

Height-adjusted muscle mass (ASM/Ht2) was calculated by dividing the ASM value by the square meters of height. The cut-off value for defining low muscle mass was based on the sex-specific lower 20th percentile of ASM/Ht2in the study population. Consistent with previous studies, the sex-specific lowest 20% of the height-adjusted muscle mass was employed as the threshold for low muscle mass after ASM calculation [23,24]. In our study, low muscle mass was considered when ASM/Ht2< 5.16 kg/m2in females and < 6.90 kg/m2in males.

The components of MetS were assessed based on the clinical diagnostic criteria recommended in the 2022 Chinese expert consensus on the pharmacological treatment of MetS in older adults [25]. The five components included: (1) elevated waist circumference (> 90 cm for men, > 85 cm for women); (2) elevated triglycerides (> 150 mg/dL); (3) reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (< 40 mg/dL); (4) elevated blood pressure (> 130/85 mmHg) or a prior diagnosis of hypertension; and (5) elevated fasting plasma glucose (> 100 mg/dL) or a prior diagnosis of diabetes. Each component was evaluated separately, and the number of abnormal components per participant was also recorded.

At baseline, trained interviewers used a structured questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographic status and health-related factors. Socio-demographic variables included age, sex, education level (elementary or below, secondary school, college or above), marital status (married and others). Health-related factors included smoking (no/yes) and drinking status (no/yes). Physical activity was further classified into three intensity levels based on reported daily activities: light physical activity (such as walking at work or at home and walking for recreation, exercise, or leisure), moderate physical activity (such as carrying light things, cycling at regular speed, mopping, tai chi, brisk walking, etc.) and vigorous physical activity (such as carrying heavy loads, digging, plowing, aerobic exercise, fast cycling, bicycling with cargo, etc.) according to the time and type of daily exercise. BMI is classified into three categories: underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 ~ 23.9 kg/m2), and overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2) according to Chinese classification.

To compare sociodemographic, health status, and functional characteristics between participants with and without sarcopenia, Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. For continuous variables, the Shapiro–Wilk test was applied within each group to assess normality. Variables following a normal distribution were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, while those with non-normal distributions were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Continuous variables are presented as means with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association between baseline sarcopenia status (exposure) and the incidence of MetS over the follow-up period. To establish a clear temporal relationship, only participants without MetS at baseline were included in this analysis. Time-to-event was defined as the interval from baseline to the first diagnosis of MetS or censoring at the end of follow-up. Two models were constructed: Model 1 adjusted for age and sex, and Model 2 further adjusted for education level, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were reported, with the non-sarcopenic group serving as the reference. Associations with all-cause mortality were analyzed as a secondary outcome. Subgroup analyses were also performed to explore potential effect modifications across key demographic and health-related variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A two-sidedp-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Detailed participant characteristics are presented in Table1. A total of 3,758 participants were included in this study, comprising 1,252 individuals with sarcopenia and 2,506 without sarcopenia. Of the total sample, 70.54% were male and 27.46% were female. Individuals with sarcopenia were more likely to be underweight (28.99%), live alone (11.1%), and have attained only a primary school education or below (56.87%). Additionally, significant differences were observed between groups in grip strength and ASM/Ht² (p< 0.001).

Metabolic indicators stratified by sarcopenia status are summarized in Table2. Compared with individuals without sarcopenia, those with sarcopenia exhibited significantly lower levels of BMI (p< 0.001), waist circumference (p< 0.001), triglycerides (TG) (p< 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (p< 0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p< 0.001), glucose (p< 0.001), and hemoglobin (p< 0.05). Conversely, higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p< 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p< 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (p< 0.001) were observed in the non-sarcopenia group. Notably, both groups exhibited glucose and systolic blood pressure levels above the normal range (glucose > 100 mg/dL; systolic blood pressure > 130 mmHg).

During the four-year follow-up, 489 cases of MetS were identified among participants without MetS at baseline. We further examined the association between baseline sarcopenia and the risk of developing individual MetS components (Fig.2). In Model 1 (adjusted for age and sex), sarcopenia was significantly associated with increased risks of abdominal obesity (HR 12.41, 95% CI: 7.33–21.07;p< 0.001), hypertension (HR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.35–2.57;p< 0.01), hypertriglyceridemia (HR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.41–3.23;p< 0.001), low HDL-cholesterol (HR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15–1.72;p< 0.001), and overall MetS (HR 15.33, 95% CI: 6.62–40.35;p< 0.001). In Model 2, which additionally adjusted for education, marital status, smoking, drinking, and physical activity, the associations with abdominal obesity (HR 8.24, 95% CI: 6.65–10.27;p< 0.001), hypertriglyceridemia (HR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.40–3.20;p< 0.05), and MetS (HR 5.34, 95% CI: 4.01–7.08;p< 0.001) remained statistically significant.

Subgroup analyses for sarcopenia and MetS were performed based on demographic and lifestyle characteristics to explore potential effect modification (Table3). The risk of sarcopenia was significantly higher among individuals aged 70–79 years (HR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.57–2.48;p< 0.001) and ≥ 80 years (HR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.18–1.85;p< 0.001), compared to aged 60–69 years. Female participants had a significantly lower risk of sarcopenia compared to males (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77–0.99;p< 0.05). With respect to BMI, underweight (< 18.5 kg/m²) and normal-weight (18.5–23.9 kg/m²) individuals exhibited markedly elevated risks compared to those classified as overweight or obese (HRs 6.06 [95% CI: 5.98–6.51] and 5.16 [95% CI: 4.91–5.36], respectively; bothp< 0.001).

During the follow-up period, female participants had a significantly higher risk of developing MetS compared to males (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05–1.24;p< 0.001). Moreover, individuals with a lower BMI (< 18.5 kg/m² and 18.5–23.9 kg/m²) exhibited a significantly increased risk of MetS compared to those with BMI ≥ 24 kg/m² (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38–1.76 and HR 1.46, 95% CI: 1.34–1.58, respectively; bothp< 0.001). In addition, increased physical activity intensity was inversely associated with sarcopenia risk, with moderate activity showing an HR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.81–0.93) and vigorous activity an HR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80–0.92), both statistically significant (p< 0.001).

As a supplementary analysis, we also examined whether baseline MetS components predicted the subsequent development of sarcopenia. Notably, abdominal obesity (HR 4.18, 95% CI: 2.32–7.53), hypertriglyceridemia (HR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.04–4.68), and overall MetS (HR 2.98, 95% CI: 1.46–6.08) were significantly associated with increased sarcopenia risk in multivariable-adjusted models (Supplementary Table 1).

This study investigated the longitudinal association between sarcopenia and MetS in a nationally representative cohort of older Chinese adults over a four-year follow-up. Our findings revealed that sarcopenia was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing MetS, particularly in relation to elevated blood pressure and fasting glucose. Notably, subgroup analysis demonstrated that this association was more pronounced among individuals with a BMI below 24 kg/m², suggesting that sarcopenia may contribute to metabolic risk even in non-obese older adults. These results highlight the importance of considering muscle health as a key determinant of metabolic status in aging populations.

Our findings align with previous studies suggesting that sarcopenia is associated with a lower BMI in older adults [26,27]. Specifically, older individuals with sarcopenia had a significantly lower BMI than recommended rang of 20.0–26.9 kg/m² outlined in the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents (2022) [25]. This is consistent with study conducted in Taiwan, China, which found lower BMI levels among sarcopenic older individuals compared to without sarcopenia group [5,28]. This relationship may be attributed to the fact that sarcopenia, which leads to the loss of muscle mass, often results in an overall decrease in body weight. This is particularly relevant in older adults, who may already be experiencing reduced appetite or inadequate protein intake [29]. However, our study also found a significant association between sarcopenia and the MetS in individuals with a BMI below 24 kg/m². This suggests that low BMI alone may not fully explain the development of MetS in sarcopenic older populations. Indeed, individuals with a lower BMI may fact increased risk due to malnutrition or protein deficiency, which further exacerbates muscle wasting and increased susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction [30]. On the other hand, higher BMI typically correlated with increased fat mass, which is a well-established components of MetS [31]. However, in older populations, increased fat mass may have a less detrimental effect on metabolic health if it accompanied by adequate muscle mass and physical activity [32]. Thus, maintaining a healthy balance of muscle mass and fat mass, rather than focusing on BMI alone, may serve as a better strategy for reducing MetS risk in older adults.

Our analysis further showed that individuals with sarcopenia had significantly higher levels of fasting glucose and systolic blood pressure. These findings are consistent with studies from South Korea and other countries, which also report elevated glucose and blood pressure levels in sarcopenic older adults [33]. The underlying mechanism may involve impaired glucose uptake due to reduced muscle mass, given that skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 80% of postprandial glucose disposal [34]. Loss of muscle tissue compromises insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, potentially leading to hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, both of which are key features of MetS and type 2 diabetes [35,36]. Sarcopenia has also been associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, which further exacerbates insulin resistance and elevates blood pressure [8,37]. These mechanisms highlight the importance of addressing sarcopenia not only for musculoskeletal health but also for preventing metabolic complications. In supplementary analyses, we further explored the reverse association between baseline MetS components and the subsequent development of sarcopenia. Notably, abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia were independently associated with increased risk of incident sarcopenia. These findings suggest a potential bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and metabolic dysregulation, underscoring the need for integrated strategies that simultaneously address muscle health and metabolic risk in older populations.

Physical activity is increasingly recognized as a modifiable factor in the prevention and management of sarcopenia [30,32]. In our study, moderate and vigorous physical activity were inversely associated with the risk of sarcopenia. Exercise enhances mitochondrial function, suppresses catabolic pathways, and stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Resistance training is considered a particularly effective intervention for the prevention and reversal of muscle loss. Additionally, nutritional factors such as sufficient intake of protein, vitamin D, and calcium are essential for preserving muscle mass and function [38]. Physical activity also improves metabolic profiles, lowering the risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Therefore, promoting regular and tailored exercise, especially resistance training, should be prioritized in older populations to reduce both sarcopenia and MetS risk [39].

Several shared pathophysiological mechanisms may explain the association between sarcopenia and MetS. MetS comprises five main components: abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C [26], all of which are influenced by insulin resistance and systemic inflammation [22]. Skeletal muscle plays a central role in glucose homeostasis and produces muscle-derived cytokines (myokines) such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, FGF21, irisin, and myostatin [28]. These myokines modulate glucose and lipid metabolism and help reduce inflammation when stimulated through exercise [5,8]. Hence, the loss of muscle mass may impair these regulatory functions, contributing to metabolic dysfunction.

Although this study was conducted in a Chinese older adult population, the association between sarcopenia and MetS is of global relevance. Variations in cultural, dietary, and physical activity patterns across populations may influence the strength and direction of this association. Studies from Western countries have shown similar trends, although differences in body composition, dietary protein intake, and exercise habits warrant further cross-cultural comparisons. Such research is critical for developing population-specific strategies to prevent sarcopenia and its metabolic consequences in aging societies.

This study has several limitations. First, as an observational cohort study, the associations observed between sarcopenia and metabolic syndrome (MetS) may be influenced by residual confounding. To address this, we applied multivariable Cox regression models with progressive adjustment for key demographic and lifestyle factors, which strengthens the internal validity of the findings. Second, although the anthropometric equation used to estimate appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) has been validated against dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in Chinese populations, some measurement bias may persist due to indirect estimation. Third, only approximately 40% of participants in CHARLS Waves 1–3 were randomly selected to complete the physical activity questionnaire. Consequently, physical activity could not be included as a covariate in the full analytic sample, which limits the assessment of its potential moderating effect on the sarcopenia–MetS relationship. However, the random selection of this subsample reduces the likelihood of systematic bias. Additionally, although all-cause mortality is an important outcome in aging research, the limited number of death events within the 4-year follow-up period in our analytic cohort precluded a robust time-to-event analysis. Future studies using updated CHARLS waves with longer follow-up and greater event counts are warranted to address this endpoint.

Despite these limitations, this study has notable strengths. It utilized data from a large, nationally representative sample of older Chinese adults with high response rates, allowing for generalizability to a broader population. The longitudinal design, combined with rigorous statistical modeling, provides valuable epidemiological evidence on the role of sarcopenia in the development of MetS and its components. These findings may inform future public health strategies aimed at preserving muscle health and reducing cardiometabolic risk among aging populations.

In conclusion, this study longitudinally examined the association between sarcopenia and MetS in a large sample of older Chinese adults. The findings demonstrate that sarcopenia is significantly associated with specific components of MetS, particularly abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia, even after adjusting for confounders. Additionally, low BMI was identified as an important contributor to sarcopenia among older individuals. These results underscore the importance of maintaining adequate muscle mass and a healthy body composition through balanced nutrition and regular physical activity to prevent both sarcopenia and metabolic disorders in aging populations.
