Addressing the dual challenges of industrial contamination in wastewater and antimicrobial resistance is crucial for environmental preservation and global health, aligning with sustainable development goals. This study investigated the biological and photocatalytic potential of pure bimetal oxides, nanocomposites (NCs) and their counterparts incorporating graphene oxide (GO) and nitrogen- and sulfur-doped GO. A set of samples, namely Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs, was synthesized using the hydrothermal method. The synthesized NCs underwent comprehensive structural and compositional analyses using XRD, FTIR, EDX, SEM, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Their photocatalytic performance was evaluated for methylene blue (MB) dye degradation under direct sunlight at varying pH levels, dye concentrations, and reaction times. The photocatalytic tests revealed a significant enhancement in methylene blue (MB) degradation efficiency, which generally increased with rising pH, albeit with some deviations. Among all samples, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NC exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, achieving maximum degradation at 240 min. The biological properties of NCs were assessed through protein kinase inhibition studies and antimicrobial assays, while hemocompatibility was determinedviahemolytic activity. All samples exhibited both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, as indicated by the presence of a bald zone alongside a clear zone. The Fe2O3–Ag2O NC demonstrated the most notable antibacterial activity, achieving the MIC of 12.5 againstS. aureus. The antibacterial assay further demonstrated enhanced inhibitory effects against both resistant and non-resistant bacterial strains, confirming that iron- and silver-doped composites exhibited superior antibacterial properties. Among all the NCs, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO NC displayed significant antifungal activity against five different strains, with the highest effectiveness againstAspergillus nigerandMucor, achieving a zone of inhibition of 9 ± 0.01 mm. The hemolytic assay indicated that all NCs exhibited hemolysis levels below 1%, confirming their safety for biological applications. This study highlighted the potential of these NCs for enhancing the photocatalytic degradation of MB dye in water while also demonstrating their biological significance.

Addressing the dual challenges of industrial contamination in wastewater and antimicrobial resistance is crucial for environmental preservation and global health, aligning with sustainable development goals.

Graphene and graphene-based materials have unique characteristics that make them extremely valuable in fields such as biology and environmental science. A recent development has attracted graphene based nanomaterials, demonstrating their applicability in a range of sustainable applications. Additionally, graphene oxide–semiconductor hybrid nanomaterials have been extensively employed for the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics, organic dyes, pharmaceutical compounds, phenolic substances, as well as for photocatalytic hydrogen production and disinfection processes.5,6Various strategies have been explored to enhance the chemical activity and electrical properties of graphene derivatives.7–9Among these, doping has emerged as a highly effective technique for improving the photocatalytic degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants.10The chemical modification of graphene oxide with heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulfur is recognized as a promising approach to enhancing its electrical and mechanical properties.11Nitrogen/sulfur-doped GO-based materials have gained significant attention due to their wider bandgap which arises from the electron-withdrawing effects of sulfur and nitrogen. These doped carbon-based materials exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. Furthermore, the incorporation of sulfur or nitrogen into GO sheets has been shown to significantly improve their electrical conductivity, making them highly suitable for the photocatalytic process.12Moreover, the incorporation of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) into graphene oxide (GO) significantly enhances its functional properties, making it a powerful material for catalytic, environmental, and biomedical applications. N/S doping introduces electron-rich sites, reducing GO's bandgap and improving charge carrier mobility. Moreover, the N/S atoms create defects and catalytic centers that boost photocatalytic degradation of pollutantsviaROS generation (˙OH, ˙O2−).

The rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the limited efficacy of conventional antimicrobial agents have necessitated the development of novel nanomaterials with enhanced biological activity. Nanosized Fe2O3and Ag2O have garnered significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, including high surface area, tunable bandgap, and excellent catalytic activity.16,17When combined to form bimetallic Fe2O3–Ag2O NC, these materials exhibit enhanced functionalities, such as improved charge separation, synergistic catalytic effects, and superior redox properties, making them highly effective for applications in photocatalysis, sensing, and environmental remediation.18,19However, their standalone applications often face challenges, including aggregation, limited biocompatibility, and insufficient targeting efficiency. To address these limitations, integrating these nanomaterials with nitrogen/sulfur doped GO has been proposed, as N/S-GO can enhance dispersion, stability, and biocompatibility while introducing additional active sites for improved biological interactions.12,20–22The incorporation of GO not only improves the electrical conductivity and stability of the NC but also introduces additional active sites and defects that facilitate better adsorption and catalytic activity. This hybrid system, combining the advantages of bimetallic oxides and doped graphene oxide, represents a promising avenue for advanced materials with tailored properties for energy, environmental, and biomedical applications.23Despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of their antibacterial, antifungal, protein kinase inhibition, and hemolytic activities had remained underexplored.

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the biological efficacy of Fe2O3–Ag2O NC and its N/S-GO doped counterparts, addressing critical gaps in their application for combating microbial infections, inhibiting cancer-related protein kinases, and assessing biocompatibility through hemolytic studies. Despite the potent properties of Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs, no comprehensive study had demonstrated their efficacy in environmental and biological applications. Therefore, the novelty of this project was in exploring the photocatalytic and biological potential of these bimetal oxide NCs, along with their N- and S-doped GO-based counterparts, and comparing them with typical GO-based materials and those without GO. The study explored and compared the biological and environmental applications of the synthesized NCs. It substantiated the potential of GO-based bimetallic iron and silver oxides doped with nitrogen and sulfur in wastewater treatment and biological efficacy improvements. The findings underscored the importance of continued research in this field for environmental and public health benefits.

To prepare required NCs, silver nitrate hexahydrate, iron(iii) nitrate nonahydrate, ammonia, sodium sulphide, sulfuric acid (98%), potassium permanganate (0.1 N), potassium persulfate (5% (w/v)), hydrogen peroxide (30%), ethylene glycol (1.113 g mL−1at 25 °C), sodium nitrate (15-N), graphite powder black (2.2 g mL−1at 25 °C) and urea (powder) were used. These reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification, prepared and applied as instructed by the supplier. Moreover, deionized water (DIW) was used to thoroughly wash the prepared NCs.

To prepare sulphur doped graphene (GS), 500 mg of GO was dissolved in DIW (100 mL) and kept in a sonicator for half an hour. Afterward, 5 g of sodium sulphide (Na2S) was slowly added while stirring and the mixture was sonicated again for half an hour. Then, entire mixture was transferred to a stainless steel autoclave lined with Teflon, where it was subjected to heating at 150 °C for 12 h. Once the autoclave reached ambient temperature, the blackish powdered material obtained was thoroughly washed with DIW and subsequently oven-dried at 60 °C.

The synthesis of NG began by dissolving 1.12 g (4 mmol) of GO in distilled water, followed by 30 min of sonication. A mixture of this GO dispersion and urea (at a 1 : 300 mass ratio) was then prepared and ultrasonically stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The complete mixture was subsequently transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and held at 180 °C for 12 h. Following the high temperature phase, mixture was cooled to room temperature. After cooling, the prepared black powder was rinsed multiple times with DIW before being placed in an oven to dry overnight. After drying, the amount of the prepared nanomaterial was determined.

A pre-determined amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and AgNO3·6H2O (1 : 1 molar ratio) was dissolved in distilled water under continuous stirring. A precipitating agent, NH3solution, was added dropwise to adjust the pH at 11. The homogeneous mixture was subsequently transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 6 h. Following cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was washed thoroughly with DIW, dried at 80 °C for 6 h, and then calcined at 380 °C in a muffle furnace to yield Fe2O3–Ag2O NCs.

Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs were synthesized following separate but similar procedures. GO, GN, and GS (0.5 g each) were individually dispersed in DIW (10 mL) and ethylene glycol (20 mL), followed by sonication for 20 min to achieve homogeneity. Separately, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and AgNO3·6H2O (1 : 1 molar ratio) were dissolved in distilled water and added to each dispersion under constant stirring for 30 min. NH3solution was then added dropwise until the pH reached 11, ensuring proper precipitation of metal oxides onto the respective GO-based materials. The mixtures were then transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves and heated at 140 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting NCs were thoroughly washed with DIW and dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The dried sample was then subjected to calcination at 380 °C. The final products, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs, were weighed and stored in sealed vials for further characterization and application studies.

To thoroughly characterize the prepared Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs, a series of physicochemical investigations was employed. In order to determine the maximum absorbance (λ) of prepared NCs, a UV-1601 SHIMADZU model spectrophotometer was used. By using FTIR-8400S SHIMADZU spectrophotometer, surface moieties between 4000 and 500 cm−1were examined. For the quantification of crystallite size, the Debye–Scherrer equation was applied. The crystalline structure of the materials was characterized by XRD using a Philips X'Pert diffractometer. Surface morphology of all synthesized NCs was assessed with a JEOL/EO JSM-6510 scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating at 15 kV. Elemental composition was investigated through EDX spectroscopy, performed on a JSM-6490 (JEOL) system.

The photocatalytic activity of all the synthesized samples, consisting of Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs was assessed in the decomposition of MB. A 50 mg L−1standard solution of MB was prepared using distilled water. Subsequently, 20 mg of the prepared catalyst samples were added to separate reaction vessels each containing 20 mL of this MB solution. To establish adsorption–desorption equilibrium, the mixtures were stirred in darkness for 30 min. Following this, the samples were exposed to simulated solar radiation for predefined time intervals, and their degradation was systematically monitored using a double beam UV-vis spectrophotometer. The variations in the absorbance maxima were monitored over time. Different parameters were checked such as the effect of pH, time and initial concentration.

The pH study was conducted by taking 20 mL dye solution at the concentration of 50 mg L−1and 20 mg catalyst. The beaker was marked to the point where the stirrer was submerged in the solution as the reference point was used to add DIW to compensate for water loss due to accelerated evaporation due to sunlight. The study was carried out by adjusting the pH of the dye solution using 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M HCl, with the pH range selected between 4 and 11. The samples were analyzed using a double-beam spectrophotometer to determine the optimum pH.

The kinetic study was conducted by taking a 100 mL solution of the dye at a concentration of 50 mg L−1and a 100 mg catalyst. The beaker was marked to the point where the stirrer was submerged in the solution as this reference point was used to add DIW to compensate for water loss due to accelerated evaporation under sunlight. The study was conducted using the finite bath method. The sample were taken at different time intervals and was analyzed using a double-beam spectrophotometer to determine the optimum time.

The concentration study was conducted by taking a 20 mL solution of the dye at different concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 200 mg L−1, with 20 mg of catalyst used. The beaker was marked to the point where the stirrer was submerged in the solution and this reference point was used to add DIW to compensate for the water loss due to accelerated evaporation due to sunlight. The samples were analyzed using a double-beam spectrophotometer to find the optimum concentration.

The inhibitory potential of NCs was evaluated using protein kinase derived fromStreptomyces85E strain. TheStreptomyces85E strain was cultured in tryptone soya broth media. Afterwards, the bacterial lawn was prepared by streaking a loopful of bacteria onto pre-sterilized Petri plates containing ISP4 media. A 5 mm disc impregnated with 20 μg of NCs was then placed on those prepared plates which were incubated for 72 h. The inhibitory effects were assessed by measuring the zone of inhibition (ZOI) in millimeters using a vernier caliper. The presence of clear and bald inhibition zones surrounding the nanocomposites and control discs was recorded to determine their inhibitory potential.

The antifungal activity of the Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O/GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O/N-GO and Fe2O3–Ag2O/S-GO NCs againstMucorspecies (FCBP-0300),Aspergillus fumigatus(FCBP-66),Fusarium solani(FCBP-0291),Aspergillus niger(FCBP-0198) andAspergillus flavus(FCBP-0064), and was evaluated using disc diffusion method.31Prior to use, fungal strains were suspended in a sterilized 0.02% Tween-20 solution. Pre-autoclaved Petri plates were taken and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) was poured into them. Once solidified, 100 μL of each fungal suspension, adjusted to match the 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard, was evenly spread across the agar surface. Subsequently, sterile discs were impregnated with 5 μL of each NC sample (4 mg mL−1in DMSO). Amphotericin B served as the positive control, while DMSO was used as the negative control. The plates were then incubated at 28 °C for 48 h. After incubation, the antifungal activity was assessed by measuring the average diameter of the inhibition zones (in mm) around the discs. These results were recorded and analysed to compare the effectiveness of the prepared NCs against the selected fungal strains.

The hemolysis assay was done to evaluate the hemolytic potential of prepared samples using method existing in literature.26Initially, human donor blood was collected in an EDTA tube. Blood was first centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate RBCs. The supernatant was then carefully removed, and the RBCs were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to ensure complete removal of plasma and other components. A 5% RBC suspension was subsequently prepared by resuspending the washed cells in PBS. For the assay, 150 μL of each NC sample was added to separate Eppendorf tubes, followed by the addition of 350 μL of the RBC suspension. The Eppendorf tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, centrifugation was performed at 10 000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the intact RBCs. Finally, 200 μL of the supernatant from each tube was carefully transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated by given formula.

XRD analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of graphene oxide (GO), sulfur-doped GO (S-GO), and nitrogen-doped GO (N-GO) and the diffractograms (S1) are reported in our previous study (Zafaret al.,242024). Pure graphite showed a peak at 2θ≈ 26°, while GO exhibited a peak at 2θ≈ 10.5°, indicating oxidation and increased interlayer spacing due to oxygen functional groups. In the sulfur- and nitrogen-doped samples, this peak shifted to 25.3° and 24.2°, respectively, suggesting effective reduction of GO and successful doping under hydrothermal conditions (Kumaret al.,262020).

Fig. 1displays the XRD patterns of Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs which exhibited characteristic peaks corresponding to the reference code 96-901-3477 (for Fe2O3NPs) and reference code 96-901-2432 (for Ag2O NPs). XRD data from Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs indicated that the composition of the 2θdiffraction features was dominant with matching Bragg's reflections at 37.21° (111), 44.50° (Fe2O3011, GO 022), 65.61° (Fe2O3002, GO 220) and 78.92° (Ag 113).27–30The assimilated oxides of metals demonstrated significant crystalline characteristics, and the XRD data aligned well with reference codes of both elements. In Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs, no carbon related diffraction peaks were detected. The presence of magnetite might have been responsible for this, as it reduced the aggregation of graphene sheets resulting in the formation of more monolayer graphene.31Consequently, carbon peaks appeared weaker. Alternatively, this could have resulted from the overwhelming intensity of the strong signals from iron and silver oxides, which suppressed the weak carbon peaks in XRD data. This observation suggested that GO sheets were exfoliated due to the sufficient loading of NCs on their surfaces.32This study demonstrated that interaction between GO and NCs was very effective. The XRD crystallite size was estimated using Debye–Scherrer formula.33According to the calculations, Fe2O3–Ag2O NC exhibited crystallite size of 58 nm while Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO, and Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO NCs had 53 nm, 22 nm, and 39 nm, respectively.

FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify functional groups in GO, S-GO, and N-GO, confirming the successful incorporation of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen functionalities (S2). GO showed characteristic peaks at 1725 cm−1(CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O stretching), 1917 cm−1(epoxy C–O–C), and broad C–O bands between 1000–1400 cm−1, indicating carboxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl groups. Peaks at 1571 and 1725 cm−1correspond to CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O stretching in GO. In N-GO, reduced peak intensities suggest removal of oxygen groups during reduction. A peak at 1154 cm−1confirms C–N bonding, and the 1558 cm−1peak corresponds to altered CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C structure (Hamidet al.,332021). A broad peak around 3400 cm−1indicates O–H stretching (Bibiet al.,332020). In S-GO, peaks at 1720 cm−1and 1160 cm−1represent –COOH and –C–O–C– groups, while peaks at 3420 and 1130 cm−1confirm S–H and C–S vibrations, indicating successful sulfur doping (Haqet al.,332018).

Fig. 2presents the FT-IR spectra, displaying distinct bands at various wavenumbers (cm−1), which correspond to specific infrared radiation absorption events. Notably, the band observed at 1660 cm−1is attributed to the bending vibrations of adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups.34The spectra revealed two strong absorption bands at 570 cm−1and 688 cm−1. These bands are attributed to the (Fe–O) stretching vibrations originating from the tetrahedral sites and the (Fe–O) torsional vibration mode of Fe in the octahedral sites of magnetite, respectively.35The bands at 1725 cm−1for (C–O), 1553 cm−1for aromatic (C–C), and 1215 cm−1for epoxy (C–O) were observed in Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO, and Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, but not in Fe2O3–Ag2O NC, confirming the synthesis of required NCs.36As the bands of all four prepared NCs were analyzed, shifts in various bands became evident. The intensity of certain bands gradually increased from Fe2O3–Ag2O NC to its GO-, N-GO-, and S-GO-doped counterparts, reaching an even higher intensity in Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO NCs. Additionally, some minor bands began to appear in these NCs. These shifts can primarily be attributed to the interactions between the metal oxides (Fe2O3and Ag2O) and graphene-based materials (GO, N-GO, S-GO), along with doping effects, surface plasmon resonance, and changes in crystallinity. These all factors contribute to modifying the electronic and structural properties of the NCs, leading to these modifications in the bands.

UV-visible spectroscopy was used to characterize the synthesized SZ-GO, N-GO, and S-GO and S3 presents the UV-visible spectra of GO, N-GO, and S-GO. GO exhibits two distinct absorption peaks at 230 nm and 300 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition of CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C bonds in the aromatic ring and the n–π* transition of CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O bonds, respectively. In the spectra of S-GO and N-GO, the absorption peak shifts from 300 nm to 297 nm and 294 nm, respectively. This blue shift toward lower wavelengths suggests stronger bonding interactions, likely due to the removal of most oxygen-containing functional groups and the partial restoration of the conjugated CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C network, resulting in enhanced electron delocalization (Kashifet al.,292024).

Fig. 3depicts the UV-visible spectra of Fe2O3/Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3/Ag2O@S-GO and Fe2O3/Ag2O@N-GO NCs. The absorption peaks were observed between 200 and 440 nm. The peak at 440 nm in Fe2O3/Ag2O@S-GO confirmed the presence of Ag2O in NCs, while the Fe2O3exhibited a peak at 240 nm. The absorbance of Fe2O3/Ag2O@GO NC revealed three prominent peaks between 200 and 350 nm, indicating the transformation of GO into Fe2O3/Ag2O@GO nanoparticle. Fe2O3/Ag2O@S-GO and Fe2O3/Ag2O@N-GO displayed similar peaks to those of Fe2O3/Ag2O@GO NC.

EDX analysis was performed, and the corresponding elemental distributions are shown in S4. For the GO, only carbon and oxygen were detected, as presented in S4(A). In S-GO (S4(B)), sulfur was observed along with carbon and oxygen, confirming successful doping, with carbon remaining the predominant element. The presence of sulfur is attributed to the use of sodium sulfide as the doping agent. In the N-GO (S4(C)), nitrogen was detected alongside carbon and oxygen, confirming effective nitrogen incorporation. The presence of sulfur and nitrogen in their respective samples confirms the successful heteroatom doping of GO.

The EDX analyses of the synthesized Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO and Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO NCs are shown inFig. 4. In the synthesized NCs, the EDX spectrum documented that the assimilated metal oxide NCs were stoichiometric and comparable to ordinary configuration. The distinguishing X-ray peaks of the carbon, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, iron and silver atoms were visible in the spectrum of these NCs. All the respective constituent elements were present in the EDX spectra of the samples. In sample A, a carbon peak appeared, likely due to the use of carbon tape during the analysis. In samples B to D, the presence of carbon confirmed the incorporation of GO in all the NCs. In sample B, the atomic percentage of carbon was observed to be the highest, indicating a higher concentration of GO in this particular sample. Additionally, some contamination was evident in all the samples. This could be attributed to trace amounts of impurities in the precursor salts, environmental contamination, or other sources such as the experimental setup or handling during the synthesis process.

Fig. 5(a–d)displays the SEM micrographs of Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO and Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO NCs.Fig. 5(a)shows that the Fe2O3–Ag2O NC exhibited close packing, leading to the formation of agglomerates. Particles were unevenly distributed, resulting in the formation of several cavities throughout the sample. Upon the incorporation of GO, the morphology of the sample changed significantly with a sheet- or flake-like structure observed, likely due to the presence of GO sheets. Closer observation revealed that the Fe2O3–Ag2O NCs were unevenly distributed over the GO sheet. Additionally, N and S doping further altered the morphology of the samples. In case of pure GO incorporation, the granular morphology was replaced by sheets-like or flakes like structures, whereas in the case of S-GO the granular morphology was mostly retained with slight modifications. Due to agglomeration, individual grain boundaries were not visible, and the particles exhibited irregular shapes with many voids and porous structures.

In this study, Fe2O3–Ag2O, Fe2O3–Ag2O@GO, Fe2O3–Ag2O@N-GO, and, Fe2O3–Ag2O@S-GO NCs were prepared by the hydrothermal method. This method offers controlled morphology, high purity, scalability, eco-friendliness, and efficient doping, making it ideal for synthesizing advanced nanomaterials. The physicochemical analyses revealed that the crystallinity and morphology were significantly affected by the interaction among bimetal oxides, graphene oxide, and nitrogen- and sulfur-doped GO. The incorporation of nitrogen- and sulfur-doped GO enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency of the NCs against MB dye. The optimization process indicated that the pH, time, and dye concentration significantly influenced the photocatalytic process. Both, bacteriostatic and bactericidal, effects were shown by all samples. Moreover, inhibitory effects against both resistant and non-resistant bacterial strains were also observed. GO doped NC displayed the highest antifungal activity while hemolytic assay confirmed the safety of all NCs for biological applications. These findings make these NCs promising candidates for photocatalysis and biological applications to achieve the sustainable development goals.
