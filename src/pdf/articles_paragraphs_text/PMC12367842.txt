Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD-TN) poses a significant challenge in the surgical management of trigeminal neuralgia. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of microvascular decompression (MVD) and percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) in patients with VBD-TN.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive VBD-TN patients treated at a tertiary hospital in China between September 2013 and August 2022. Participants were stratified by the intervention (MVD vs PBC), with systematic evaluation of postoperative pain control efficacy and complication rates.

This study enrolled 107 patients with VBD-TN, with a mean age of 64.8 ± 10.0 years and a mean follow-up duration of 3.9 ± 1.9 years. The cohort comprised 64 patients undergoing MVD and 43 receiving PBC. Both groups achieved excellent initial pain control (The Barrow Neurological Institute scoring system (BNI) pain score I or II). The recurrence (BNI Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ) rates were 12.5% (8/64) in the MVD group versus 20.9% (9/43) in the PBC group (p= 0.242) at the last follow-up, showing no statistically significant difference. Early postoperative assessment revealed significantly higher incidences of trigeminal dysfunction including facial numbness, dry eye symptoms, and masticatory muscle weakness in the PBC group compared to the MVD group (p< 0.05 for all). Conversely, the MVD group demonstrated more diverse complications, with craniotomy-related adverse events including intracranial infection (4.7%), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (3.1%), and incision infection (3.1%), while cranial nerve complications comprised diplopia (3.1%), facial palsy (1.6%), hearing loss (7.8%), and tinnitus (9.4%). At the final follow-up, the PBC group exhibited significantly higher BNI numbness scores than the MVD group (p= 0.001). The PBC group showed advantages in healthcare utilization metrics, with significantly shorter postoperative hospital stays and lower hospitalization costs compared to the MVD group (p< 0.001).

Both MVD and PBC are safe and effective therapeutic options for VBD-TN. MVD is associated with higher hospitalization costs, prolonged hospital stays, and a greater incidence of cranial nerve complications, though most of these complications are treatable. The main disadvantage of PBC lies in the long-term facial numbness.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is commonly caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve root by intracranial vessels[13]. Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) is a condition characterized by ectasia, elongation, and tortuosity of the vertebrobasilar arteries. When VBD affects the trigeminal nerve, it can lead to trigeminal neuralgia secondary to vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD-TN)[15]. VBD-TN is very rare, accounting for 2% to 7.7% of cases in previous TN series [1].

Microvascular decompression (MVD) is currently established as the preferred neurosurgical intervention for classical TN[12,13]. However, the technical complexity escalates significantly when addressing VBD-TN cases, where the tortuous and hypertrophic vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) presents greater surgical challenges compared to conventional neurovascular conflicts[5,16,19]. Percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) is a minimally invasive technique that achieves pain control by mechanical compression of the trigeminal ganglion via a percutaneous approach, offering a relatively simpler procedural complexity compared to alternative interventions[8,25].

Notably, the existing literature contains limited comparative data regarding the application of these techniques specifically for VBD-TN, with particularly scarce evidence directly contrasting their therapeutic outcomes. The detailed search strategy and keywords can be found in the Supplementary File1. We conducted a comprehensive retrospective cohort analysis to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety profiles of MVD versus PBC in the management of VBD-TN.

We collected the clinical data of patients with trigeminal neuralgia at the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from September 2013 to August 2022, identifying patients with VBD-TN who underwent MVD or PBC treatment. This study was conducted by the Helsinki Declaration and received approval from the ethics committee of our institution (IEC-FOM-013–2.0). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, patient informed consent was not sought. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) meeting the diagnostic criteria for trigeminal neuralgia, 2) conducting a three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) examination and meeting the diagnostic criteria for VBD[7,18], 3) The trigeminal nerve on the side of pain is closely related to VBD (Fig.1), 4) Undergoing either MVD or PBC treatment during this hospitalization. Exclude cases that have secondary factors causing trigeminal neuralgia or cases that have undergone MVD or PBC surgery in the past for recurrence. All cases were operated on by the same experienced surgeon.

Patients with only relative contraindications for PBC (e.g., abnormal foramen ovale structure, active inflammatory lesions on the operative side of the craniofacial region) underwent MVD. Conversely, patients with only relative contraindications for MVD (e.g., local skin or soft tissue infection at the incision site, frail constitution, or contralateral hearing impairment) underwent PBC. In the absence of contraindications for both MVD and PBC, patients who refused of craniotomy-related risks or had a high tolerance for postoperative numbness were selected for PBC, whereas those who could accept the risks associated with craniotomy or had low tolerance for postoperative numbness underwent MVD. (Fig.2).

After endotracheal intubation and general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral prone position. We conduct a straight incision behind the ear and proceed with the surgery through the retrosigmoid approach. Combined microscope-endoscope-assisted (Operate under the microscope, exploration under an endoscope) techniques were employed. Cut the dura mater, and fully release the cerebrospinal fluid. Gently pull on the cerebellum, loosen the arachnoid membrane, and expose the trigeminal nerve and associated vessels. After thoroughly dissecting the trigeminal nerve and the surrounding arachnoid membrane, place a Teflon pledgets between the associated blood vessel and the trigeminal nerve. If neurovascular decompression proves difficult during surgery, selective partial posterior rhizotomy (SPPR) is performed, with partial sectioning of the second and third nerve branches based on the preoperative pain distribution.

After endotracheal intubation and general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position with the head slightly tilted back. The puncture point was located approximately 2-3 cm from the outer corner of the mouth. Under image guidance (C-arm machine, digital subtraction angiography), the puncture needle was directed towards the same side pupil and the posterior third of the zygomatic arch (3 cm in front of the ear) for foramen ovale puncture. First, the puncture in the anterior oblique view, and then the depth of the puncture needle in the lateral view. Inserted the needle core into FO at the tip, removed the needle core, and placed the balloon catheter into the Meckel’s cavity along the puncture needle lumen through the oval hole. According to the estimated Merkel cavity volume, 0.2 ~ 1.6 ml of iodinated contrast medium into the balloon. Stopped pushing when there was noticeable resistance felt by hand. Verified the position and shape of the balloon through a perspective view. The optimal shape for the balloon was pear-shaped. After being compressed for 120–180 s, the contrast agent from the balloon, was withdrawn the balloon cathete. Pressed down on the puncture site for 5 min to halt the bleeding, then placed sterile gauze over it for protection.

Data were extracted by trained researchers. Consult the electronic medical record system and imaging system, as well as gather follow-up data, to obtain information such as age, gender, side of pain, pain distribution, pain level, major offending vessel, past medical history, past treatment history, duration of postoperative hospital stay, and hospitalization expenses. Both surgical details and relevant parameters were thoroughly documented in the surgery records. Document the postoperative efficacy and perioperative complications (including intracranial infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, incision infection, perioral herpes, facial numbness, etc.) in the postoperative course notes and discharge summary. Patients will be followed up at the outpatient clinic at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Thereafter, annual follow-ups will be conducted via telephone or video call. Assessed and recorded the level of pain relief, as well as complications such as facial numbness, facial paralysis, dry eyes, double vision, hearing loss, or tinnitus. The Barrow Neurological Institute scoring system (BNI) was used to assess the levels of pain and numbness[17]. BNI pain scaleⅠ, no pain, no medication; Ⅱ, Occasional pain, no medication; Ⅲ, some pain, controlled with medication; Ⅳ, some pain, not controlled with medication; Ⅴ, severe pain or no pain relief. BNI numbness scaleⅠ, no numbness; Ⅱ, slightly numbness, not uncomfortable; Ⅲ, numbness, uncomfortable. Ⅳ, very numbness, very uncomfortable. Satisfactory result was defined as BNI pain score grade ⅠorⅡ while recurrence was defined as BNI pain score grade Ⅲ-Ⅴ at the last follow-up visit.

The data analysis was conducted by SPSS (version 26.0, IBM Corp). Continuous variables were described using the mean ± standard deviation, while categorical variables were described using frequencies. Continuous variables were tested using independent samples t-test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. Level data such as the BNI scale can be analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U-test. The Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons. The efficacy of MVD and PBC was compared through Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). A p-value of less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.

Among the 1577 patients who sought treatment at our hospital for trigeminal neuralgia from September 2013 to August 2022, 107 cases of VBD-TN patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, there were 56 males (52.3%) and 51 females (47.7%), with an average age of 64.8 ± 10.0 years, ranging from 29 to 87 years old. 64 cases underwent MVD, while 43 cases underwent PBC. The mean follow-up period was 3.9 ± 1.9 years.

Baseline characteristics were compared between the two groups (Table1). Demographic parameters (age, gender), clinical profiles (duration, side, branch, BNI score, offending vessels, prehospital therapy), and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease) all showed no significant differences (allp> 0.05). Notably, two cases in the MVD group presented with concomitant hemifacial spasm. Follow-up time did not differ significantly between cohorts."(p> 0.05).

The efficacy and complications of both groups are presented in Table2. All patients achieved complete or substantial pain relief (BNI pain score grade I-II) on the first postoperative day. At the final follow-up, the PBC group showed higher recurrence rates without statistical significance.

The PBC group had significantly higher incidences of facial numbness, dry eye symptoms, and masticatory muscle weakness compared to the MVD group (p < 0.05). All cases of masticatory muscle weakness resolved spontaneously within 3 months. Although numbness gradually improved, 11 patients (25.6%) still reported clinically significant residual numbness (BNI grade III) affecting daily life at the final follow-up. The MVD group exhibited more diverse complications, including craniotomy-related adverse events such as intracranial infection (4.7%), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (3.1%), and incision infection (3.1%), along with cranial nerve complications comprising diplopia (3.1%), facial palsy (1.6%), hearing impairment (7.8%), and tinnitus (9.4%). Following treatment and rehabilitation, two patients developed permanent hearing loss while all other aforementioned complications of the MVD group were resolved.

Within the MVD group, 14.1% (9/64) of patients underwent combined MVD + SPPR. Subgroup analysis comparing MVD alone versus MVD + SPPR revealed no significant between-group differences. Similarly, prognostic outcomes showed no statistically significant difference when comparing MVD alone with PBC (Table3).

The long-term efficacy between the two cohorts was further validated by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, demonstrating no statistically significant difference (Log-rank test:p= 0.326, Fig.3). To control for potential confounding factors, we statistically adjusted for four clinically suspected predictors of recurrence in the Cox proportional hazards analysis: surgical method (either MVD or PBC), duration of TN, age, and the major offending vessel. The analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in recurrence risk between the two surgical methods (MVD vs. PBC) (HR 1.623; 95% CI 0.624–4.218;p= 0.321; Table4).

The duration of postoperative hospital stay and hospitalization expenses for the MVD group were significantly higher than those for the PBC group (p< 0.001, Table5). In the MVD group, the longest postoperative hospital stay was 24 days for a patient due to intracranial infection and cerebrospinal fluid leakage, while the maximum hospitalization duration in the PBC group was 6 days postoperatively.

Although MVD is established as first-line intervention for classical TN with 62–89% long-term efficacy[12], outcomes specifically for VBD-TN remain less documented. Existing small cohorts report 74–100% pain-free rates after MVD (n = 10–46, follow-up 2–7.8 years) [3,16,19,26]. While PBC achieved 74% 5-year recurrence-free survival in limited series (n = 23) [22] In our cohort, MVD showed a non-significantly higher 5-year recurrence-free survival than PBC (86.8% vs 71.3%,p> 0.05).

PBC provides a safe alternative for elderly/comorbid VBD-TN patients or complex MVD case[20,24]. Its efficacy depends on optimal trigeminal ganglion compression, though technical parameters (balloon shape/duration/pressure) show no proven correlation with vascular etiology[10,25]. Given VBD’s elevated stroke risk[19], stringent intraoperative blood pressure control is critical to prevent cerebrovascular events. The primary limitation remains unavoidable trigeminal complications: while masticatory weakness and dry eyes are typically transient, persistent facial numbness affects 25.6% of patients in our cohort. Reducing numbness while maintaining efficacy is a key research priority [14].

The VBD is more complex than other responsible vessels, so the MVD for VBD-TN is more challenging. Key challenges include: (1) Significant vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) elongation, dilation, and tortuosity restricting operative space[2,4]; (2)atherosclerotic changes reducing vascular pliability and limiting mobilization[7,19,23]; (3) Critical brainstem perfusion via VBA perforators vulnerable to injury during manipulation, potentially causing brainstem infarction.

Given these characteristics, we emphasized three technical pillars: larger surgical space, superior visualization, and decompression strategies.

To increase more surgical space, we advocate fully releasing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dissecting the arachnoid membrane between the lower cranial nerves and the tentorium cerebelli. While ensuring perforating arteries are not injured, displace the VBA slightly toward the skull base direction. Furthermore, in the literature, some scholars have performed cutting and splitting of the tentorium to expand the space between TN and VBA [2].

Superior visualization enables comprehensive identification of neurovascular relationships and perforating arteries[11]. In this study, we employed a hybrid microscope-endoscope approach, wherein endoscopic visualization augmented the microscopic field of view, while microscopic instrumentation compensated for endoscopic blind spot.

Regarding decompression strategies, beyond the classical insertion technique [6], numerous centers have reported vessel transposition with or without biological adhesives [4,5,9,21], Our center advocates the insertion technique as the primary decompression strategy, because significant transposition or manipulation of offending vessels may potentiates risks of vascular wall injury and perforator ischemia. Our standardized protocol involves initial placement of larger Teflon pledgets toward the skull base (proximal to the compression site), followed by gradual insertion of smaller pledgets for precise decompression, thereby avoiding compression at the root entry zone (REZ). When adequate tension reduction remains unachievable despite exhaustive decompressive maneuvers, we proceed to SPPR[19,23].

Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. First, although this study represents one of the larger cohorts reported for VBD-TN given the rarity of this pathology, the statistical power remains constrained by the limited absolute sample size. Future efforts to expand the cohort through continued enrollment and multicenter collaboration will be imperative to enhance statistical robustness and validate our findings. Second, the choice between MVD and PBC was patient-driven rather than randomized. Such self-selection could confound outcome comparisons between the two interventions. Future prospective studies employing randomization or propensity score matching would help mitigate this bias. Third, although standardized in-person evaluations were conducted within the first postoperative year, long-term follow-up primarily relied on telephone interviews due to logistical barriers (e.g., geographical constraints, travel burdens). While structured questionnaires were administered to maintain consistency, this approach inherently limits the detection of subtle neurological deficits and objective signs that require physical examination. Fourth, within the context of contemporary clinical studies on surgical management of trigeminal neuralgia, the follow-up duration in this investigation is relatively long. However, more reliable results would emerge if most patients could be monitored for 5 years or even extended to 10 years. Furthermore, we will continue longitudinal follow-up of these patients.

Both MVD and PBC are safe and effective therapeutic options for VBD-TN. MVD is associated with higher hospitalization costs, prolonged hospital stays, and a greater incidence of cranial nerve complications, though most of these complications are treatable. The main disadvantage of PBC lies in the long-term facial numbness. The choice of surgery depends on the patient’s preference.
