The extensive application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has resulted in them ending up in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) facilities at concentrations varying between 0.13 and 20.02 mg L−1. Soluble microbial products (SMPs) in activated sludge systems can form the first barrier against AgNPs before attached metabolites and microorganisms react with these biotoxicants. Based on this, the present study investigated the adsorption and bonding resistance mechanisms of AgNPs on SMPs in activated sludge systems and analysed the typical influencing factors. Analysis using quasi-second-order kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm model revealed that the adsorption of AgNPs onto SMP is chemisorption-controlled, with multi-layer adsorption being the main mechanism, and the adsorption capacity reached 263.9 mg g−1at 35 °C. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicated that aldehydes, carbonyl groups, and amide groups in SMPs were able to interact with AgNPs through electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and chelate-forming, metal-bound organometallic complexes (M–CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOHCCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOH–M), resulting in conformational changes in SMP proteins. An increase in pH and ionic strength favoured the resistance of SMPs to AgNPs, and as the valence of the metal cation increased, the enhancement of this resistance became more significant. This study confirmed that SMP functions as an effective natural adsorbent for immobilizing AgNPs in activated sludge systems and provides a mechanistic foundation for developing targetedin situbioremediation strategies.

Research process on the resistance mechanism of soluble microbial products to silver nanoparticles in activated sludge.

During microbial defence against AgNPs, SMP in activated sludge systems first reacts with biotoxicants, then binds to microorganisms to form the first resistance barrier.16Luet al.17demonstrated the adsorption capabilities of SMP, tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances (TB-EPS), and bacterial cells on Pb2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+in theDesulfovibrio vulnificussystems, where the adsorption capacity followed the order: SMP > TB-EPS > bacterial cells. In subsequent experiments, Sunet al.18investigated the binding affinity of Zn2+and Co2+with EPS in an aerobic sludge system, where the results revealed that SMP exhibited stronger binding properties compared to TB-EPS.

The presence of AgNPs in activated sludge systems compromises the operational stability,25primarily by inducing structural damage to microbial cells during biological treatment,26,27thereby impairing the system performance and pollutant removal efficiency. Consequently, elucidating the mechanisms of SMP resistance against cytotoxic AgNPs is critical. Currently, the adsorption and bonding mechanisms governing SMP resistance to AgNPs in activated sludge systems are still unclear. In this study, SMP was initially extracted from an activated sludge system and the kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption of AgNPs on SMP were systematically investigated. Furthermore, multivariate analyses were employed to characterize the changes in the chemical structure of SMP during its interaction with AgNPs. Based on this, the effective mechanisms by which SMP resists AgNPs under different pH conditions and Na+, Ca2+ionic strengths were investigated. This study aims to provide theoretical and strategic support for thein situmanagement and control of SMP in relation to AgNPs in activated sludge systems.

The aerobic activated sludge used in the experiments was obtained from the aeration tank of the Wangxinzhuang Wastewater Treatment Plant in Zhengzhou, Henan Province. A 50 mL sample of aerobic activated sludge mixture was collected and centrifuged at 4000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the supernatant obtained was filtered using 0.45 μm organic filter membranes to obtain the SMP solution.

Citric-acid-coated AgNPs were synthesizedviaa chemical reduction technique. Briefly 0.5 mL of a 50 mM AgNO3solution and 0.75 mL of a 50 mM C6H5Na3O7solution were introduced into 100 mL of distilled water (maintained at 45 °C). After sufficient stirring, 10 mL of a 5 mM NaBH4solution was added drop-by-drop to the mixture with high-speed stirring for 30 min, yielding a yellow-brown sol containing AgNPs.

The prepared AgNPs sol was removed from the water-bath, then sonicated for 20 min to disperse the nanoparticles and prevent oxidative aggregation. After cooling, the solution was stored at 4 °C and kept away from light.

The SMP solution after reaction with AgNPs was subjected to freeze-drying, followed by characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),29Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

The apparent morphology of the SMP before and after reaction with the AgNPs was observed using SEM (Nova Nano SEM 450, FEI, Netherlands). The accelerating voltage was set to 10 kV. The freeze-dried samples were attached to conductive adhesive on the sample stage and then sputter-coated with gold. SEM images were acquired at magnifications ranging from 500 00× to 1 000 00×.

Infrared spectral characterization was performed using a FTIR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with the KBr pellet method. The samples were freeze-dried for 48 h and ground, mixed with KBr in a ratio of 1 : 100, then pressed into pellets. Spectra were recorded in the range of 500–4000 cm−1.

XPS (Escalab 250 Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to analyse the elemental composition of C, N, and O in SMP before and after interaction with the AgNPs. The pass energy was 20 eV for the narrow scan and 100 eV for the broad survey scan, with step sizes of 0.05 eV and 1 eV, respectively. The obtained spectra were fitted and analysed using Avantage software.

In the experiment evaluating the effect of pH, the initial concentrations of the SMP and AgNPs were 8.4 mg L−1and 3.774 mg L−1, respectively. The solution pH was adjusted to 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 using HNO3and NaOH. After shaking for 90 min, the samples were analysed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The absorbance of the AgNPs in the solution was measured, and the adsorption capacity for the AgNPs on SMP was subsequently calculated.

In the experiment evaluating the effect of Na+and Ca2+, the pH was maintained at 6.0 ± 0.1. The initial concentrations of the SMP and AgNPs were 8.4 mg L−1and 3.774 mg L−1, respectively. The concentrations of Na+and Ca2+were set at 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 mM. After shaking for 90 min, the samples were analysed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–500 nm. The absorbance of the AgNPs in the solution was measured, and the adsorption capacity for the AgNPs on SMP was subsequently calculated.

A zeta potential (ζ) analyser (ZETA-check, Anton Paar, AT) was used to measure the surface charge of the AgNPs. Prior to measurement, an appropriate volume of AgNPs solution was taken, and the pH was adjusted to 7 using HCl and NaOH. The surface charge was determined using a He–Ne laser (633 nm) as the light source, with the detection angle set at 90°.

The results of the kinetics experiments were fitted using quasi-first-order and quasi-second-order kinetics models, the fitting curves and relevant parameters are shown inFig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. The quasi-second-order model had a higher correlation coefficient (R22= 0.9948) than the quasi-first-order model (R12= 0.9473). Moreover, the theoretical equilibrium adsorption capacityqepredicted by the quasi-second-order model was in better agreement with the experimental valueqexp. These results suggest that the adsorption of AgNPs onto SMP in activated sludge predominantly follows quasi-second-order kinetics, indicating that the process is mainly governed by chemisorption, with physical adsorption also contributing.

The changes in the adsorption capacity of the AgNPs on SMP at 15 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C and the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process are shown inFig. 3(c)andTable 3, respectively. ΔH0> 0 indicates that the adsorption of the AgNPs on SMP is an endothermic process. ΔG0< 0 and ΔS0> 0 suggest that the adsorption process is spontaneous and leads to an increase in the entropy. Moreover, the absolute value of ΔG0increased with rising temperature, indicating that elevated temperatures enhanced the spontaneity of the adsorption reaction.

In summary, the adsorption of AgNPs onto SMP in activated sludge was characterized as a spontaneous, endothermic process accompanied by increased system disorder. Elevated temperature facilitated the adsorption reaction. The maximum adsorption capacities of SMP for the AgNPs were 238, 245, and 270 mg g−1at 15, 25, and 35 °C, respectively. Previous studies have reported that Fe3O4−loaded activated carbon derived from pistachio shells exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 119.04 mg g−1for Cd2+,37while magnetically modified halloysite showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 67.9 mg g−1for AgNPs.38These comparisons highlight that SMP is an effective adsorbent for AgNPs. As a soluble adsorbent surrounding the microorganisms in activated sludge systems, SMP can mitigate the cytotoxicity of AgNPs through adsorption, acting as the first line of resistance.

The changes in the XPS spectra (C spectra, N spectra and O spectra) before and after the reaction of SMP with the AgNPs are shown inFig. 4.

After the interaction of SMP with the AgNPs (Fig. 4(b) and (c)), the peak areas corresponding to C–C, π–π, and CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O/C–O decreased by 51.8%, 16.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. These changes, in combination with the alteration of the half-peak widths, suggest a significant shift in the chemical environment of the C elements. The data indicate that all three C-containing bonds were involved in the interaction with the AgNPs.48During the interaction, O in the functional groups donated electrons to the AgNPs, leading to a decrease in the electron density of the C-containing bonds.49Consequently, the binding energies of CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O and C–O increased from 288.8 eV to 288.96 eV.

The N spectrum of SMP (Fig. 4(d) and (e)) displayed two peaks (C–N and N–H), which disappeared after interaction with the AgNPs, where new peaks appeared: (i) N–O at 407.58 eV; (ii) –NO3at 406.93 eV; (iii) M-CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOHC = NOH structure at 339.85 eV. The findings suggest that both C–N and N–H in proteins participated in reactions with Ag+released by the AgNPs, donating electrons to Ag+. This electron donation increased the binding energy, leading to the disappearance of the original C–N and N–H peaks and formation of N–O and –NO3.50Moreover, N–O and –NO3participated in chelation with the metal as the ligands, and the M–CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOHCCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOH structure was formed, which supported the close association between M–CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOHCCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOH formation and chelation.51Taken together, the peptide bonds and amide compounds in SMP played a pivotal role in counteracting the AgNPs,52converting 42.43% of the nitrogen-containing groups into metal chelates and thereby facilitating AgNP removal, consistent with the FTIR analysis.

The adsorption amount of the AgNPs on SMP, the absorbance of the AgNPs and theζof the solution at different pH values are shown inFig. 5.

Theζof the AgNPs was −6.3 mV and −44.2 mV at pH 2 and 3, respectively. Because stabilization of theζof AgNPs requires |ζ| > 40 mV,56the AgNPs were unstable at pH = 2 to 3, with most existing as precipitates.57,58Consequently, the absorbance of the AgNPs in solution was as low as 0.16 and 0.34 at these pH values. Despite this, the adsorption amounts of the AgNPs on SMP reached 52.9 mg g−1and 178.2 mg g−1. Correspondingly, the absorbance decreased by only 0.08 and 0.18 after the adsorption process.

At pH 4–10, theζof the AgNPs was in the range of 47.4–47.8 mV, indicating that the AgNPs were in a steady state.59As the pH increased, the adsorption capacity of the AgNPs on SMP gradually rose from 234.1 mg g−1at pH 4 to 263.9 mg g−1at pH 10. This trend is attributed to the fact that SMP interacted with the AgNPs primarily through adsorption and complexation, particularly involving phenolic hydroxyl groups, which required the participation of OH−.60While AgNPs were consumed by the action, the ionic equilibrium was shifted towards the direction of increasing concentration, resulting in the absorbance of the AgNPs in solution fluctuating within the range of 0.34–0.35, maintaining a relatively stable state.

Relevant studies have shown that the pH range of urban combined domestic wastewater in China is 6.5–8.5.55Within this pH range, the adsorption capacity of the AgNPs on SMP was 249.8–253.2 mg g−1, indicating relatively high adsorption performance. Therefore, SMP can be considered an excellent natural adsorbent for mitigating AgNPs in activated sludge systems, thereby enhancing thein situremoval efficiency of AgNPs.

According to the above analysis, the AgNPs were adsorbed onto the surface of SMP through physical interactions such as van der Waals force, forming a multimolecular adsorption layer (Fig. 7). The functional groups in SMP, including –OH, –COOH, and –CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O, provided binding sites for metal ions, enabling the adsorption of the AgNPs on SMP to reach 245 mg g−1at 25 °C. Beyond physical adsorption, these groups (such as C–C, CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O/C–O, OCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C–O, C–N, π–π, and N–H) chemically interacted with the AgNPsviahydrogen bonding and specific chemical interactions. Among these, N–H and further chelated into oxides in the metal-bound form of M–CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOHCCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOH–M, resulting in conformational changes in the SMP-derived proteins. In addition, both elevated pH and ionic strength in solution led to a higher adsorption affinity of SMP for the AgNPs. Compared with low-valence metal ions, high-valence metal ions were more effective in promoting the interaction between SMP and the AgNPs.

(1) The adsorption of AgNPs on SMP conformed to the quasi-second-order reaction kinetic equation. This process was primarily dominated by chemical adsorption and multilayer adsorption, with concurrent physical adsorption. The adsorption is characterized by “fast adsorption–slow equilibrium.” The maximum adsorption amount of the AgNPs on SMP was 238 mg g−1, 245 mg g−1, and 270 mg g−1at 15 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C, respectively. These results demonstrate that SMP is a significant, naturally occurring adsorbent in activated sludge systems, capable of effectively adsorbing and removing AgNPs.

(2) SMP underwent a chemical reaction with the AgNPs through various functional groups (including C–C, π–π, CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019O/C–O, OCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019C–O, C–N, and N–H), where hydrogen bonding mediated the primary mechanism. Following the reaction, the C–N and N–H groups within SMP were oxidized, forming N–O and –NO3compounds. This was accompanied by chelation processes, resulting in the formation of metal–organic chelates with the structure M–CCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOHCCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019NOH–M. These transformations ultimately induced conformational changes in the proteins present within SMP.

(3) Increasing the pH and ionic strength of the metal ion enhanced the adsorption of AgNPs by SMP. Compared with Na+, Ca2+led to more pronounced enhancement of the adsorption capacity of SMP for the AgNPs. Thus, SMP in activated sludge systems can effectively retain AgNPs under typical pH conditions of municipal wastewater in China.
