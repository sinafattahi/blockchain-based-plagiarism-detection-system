Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) program has been a cornerstone in the fight against (Human immunodeficiency virus) HIV, aiming to reduce the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding in Ethiopia. Geographic barriers, particularly in remote and underserved regions, significantly hinder access to healthcare facilities and essential programs. These challenges contribute to the suboptimal uptake of PMTCT services, leading to higher rates of vertical HIV transmission and exacerbating health inequities. Despite these, geographical variations in knowledge about PMTCT remain poorly understood, with limited efforts made to quantify the geographic heterogeneity in knowledge across Ethiopian regions. Therefore, this study aims to examine and explain the geographic variations in knowledge about PMTCT among Ethiopian mothers, using nationally representative data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS).

This study utilized the 2016 EDHS dataset, which was cross-sectional by design. A weighted sample of 4,476 mothers was included. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted to assess whether maternal care utilization followed patterns of dispersion, clustering, or random distribution. Hotspot analysis using the Getis-Ord Gi statistic, identified geographic concentrations of poor PMTCT knowledge. Additionally, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was employed to determine factors influencing geographic variation, while Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) assessed the spatial variability in associations between PMTCT knowledge and selected predictor.

Statistically significant hotspots of poor PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV) knowledge were identified in the Somali, Afar, Southwest Oromia, and Northeastern SNNPR regions. Spatial regression analysis revealed that geographical disparities in PMTCT knowledge were primarily influenced bywealth status, media access, employment status, and proximity to health facilities.

This study revealed significant geographic and sociodemographic disparities in PMTCT knowledge among Ethiopian women. Targeted strategies are needed to improve knowledge in low-performing regions, particularly in Somali and Afar, by leveraging media, improving access to education, and integrating PMTCT messages into maternal health services. These findings can inform policy makers and program designers aiming to achieve the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission in Ethiopia. Targeted community-based interventions, mass media campaigns, and integration of PMTCT education into maternal healthcare are essential, particularly in hotspot regions. Policymakers should prioritize resource allocation to improve health facility accessibility and reduce barriers related to distance and affordability. Strengthening education and digital health initiatives can further bridge knowledge gaps. Addressing these challenges will enhance PMTCT awareness, reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission, and improve maternal and child health outcomes nationwide.

Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains one of the leading causes of pediatric HIV infections globally [1], despite significant advancements in preventive interventions [1]. In Ethiopia, the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) program has been a cornerstone in the fight against HIV, aiming to reduce the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding [2]. However, the success of PMTCT programs heavily relies on the awareness and knowledge of mothers regarding the available interventions and services [3,4]. Limited awareness of mother-to-child HIV transmission and its prevention significantly hinders women’s use of PMTCT services [5].

Globally, only about 50% of women in some Sub-Saharan African countries are fully aware of PMTCT interventions [6]. Studies indicate that 8.8% of HIV-positive mothers had poor knowledge about PMTCT [7], while in South Sudan, 20.4% of women had poor knowledge about mother to child transmission (MTCT) [8]. In Ethiopia, approximately 48% of women had limited knowledge about PMTCT [9].

Knowledge about PMTCT is influenced by a variety of factors, including socio-economic determinants such as wealth, education, media exposure, and geographic location [10–14]. Geographic disparities, such as living in rural or hard-to-reach areas, further exacerbate these inequalities by limiting access to healthcare facilities and outreach programs.

Despite significant global and national efforts to eliminate PMTCT, gaps in knowledge and the utilization of PMTCT services remain prevalent, especially in resource-limited settings. Geographic barriers, particularly in remote and underserved regions, significantly hinder access to healthcare facilities and essential programs [2]. These challenges contribute to the suboptimal uptake of PMTCT services, leading to higher rates of vertical HIV transmission and exacerbating health inequities. Overcoming these barriers is essential for improving maternal and child health outcomes, achieving global HIV reduction targets, and advancing health equity. Despite these, geographical variations in knowledge about PMTCT remain poorly understood, with limited efforts made to quantify the geographic heterogeneity in knowledge across Ethiopian regions. Additionally, there is a scarcity of evidence regarding the factors associated with the geographic clustering of PMTCT knowledge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aims to examine and explain the geographic variations in knowledge about PMTCT among Ethiopian mothers, using nationally representative data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS). It focuses on identifying regions with limited knowledge of PMTCT and determining the factors contributing to the spatial clustering of this knowledge gap. The findings aim to provide geographically tailored evidence to assist policymakers and planners in designing targeted strategies and interventions to reduce pediatric HIV infections in Ethiopia.

Unlike previous studies that analyze PMTCT awareness using traditional regression models, this study employs Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to uncover localized determinants, offering more precise, data-driven insights for policymakers. By identifying specific regions with critical knowledge gaps, this study provides actionable recommendations for tailoring health education programs, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing targeted interventions to improve maternal and child health outcomes. These findings can inform government agencies, NGOs, and public health stakeholders in designing evidence-based, location-specific strategies to strengthen Ethiopia’s response to PMTCT.

The study followed a cross-sectional design and utilized data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016. This comprehensive survey collects detailed health, demographic, and socio-economic information from households across Ethiopia. The EDHS 2016 covers all regions of the country, including both urban and rural areas, providing a national-level dataset. This broad geographical coverage allows for the analysis of regional disparities in knowledge about PMTCT of HIV. The inclusion of diverse settings (urban and rural) helps capture variations in access to health services, education, and awareness across different parts of Ethiopia.

The study population consisted of all reproductive-age women (aged 15–49) who had given birth in the five years preceding the survey. A total of 4,476 reproductive-age women were included in the analysis, based on the weighted sample from the survey. To ensure proportional representation, sample weights were applied during the analysis.

The dependent variable in this study is knowledge about PMTCT of HIV among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia. Knowledge of PMTCT was measured using four items: (1) knowledge of HIV transmission during pregnancy, (2) during delivery, (3) during breastfeeding, and (4) awareness that the risk of mother-to-child transmission can be reduced by taking special drugs. A woman who correctly answered all four items was considered knowledgeable. It was categorized as knowledgeable: Women who correctly identified all three modes of HIV transmission and method of prevention. Poor Knowledge: Women who failed to identify all three modes of transmission or lacked awareness of prevention methods [12].

Age, educational status, employment, wealth status, gravidity, media exposure, marital status, and distance from the health facility is the dependent variables of this study. The independent variables considered in the analysis include sociodemographic, economic, reproductive health, and health information accessibility factors. Sociodemographic factors include educational status, categorized as no formal education, primary, secondary, or higher education, and marital status, classified as single, married, widowed, or divorced. Economic factors encompass employment status, categorized as employed or unemployed, and wealth status, which is originally divided into five quintiles (poorest, poorer, middle, richer, and richest). However, for Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis, the poorest and poorer categories were combined into a single category labeled as poor to enhance statistical stability and interpretation.

The study utilized Stata version 17 and ArcGIS version 10.7 for tasks such as data extraction, coding, and statistical analysis. To improve the representativeness of the findings, all analyses were conducted using weighted data, accounting for the complex sampling design of the 2016 EDHS.

Spatial analysis was conducted using ArcGIS version 10.7 and included multiple techniques to assess spatial patterns in PMTCT knowledge. Global Moran’s I was used to evaluate spatial autocorrelation, determining whether maternal knowledge about PMTCT exhibited clustering, dispersion, or a random distribution. A statistically significant positive Moran’s I indicated clustering, while a significant negative value suggested a dispersed pattern [15].

where: N = total number of spatial units, Xi, Xj = values at locations iii and jjj, Xˉ = mean of the variable, and wijw = spatial weight between locations iii and jjj.

where: Gi ​ = Getis-Ord Gi statistic at location I, Xj​ = value of the variable at location j, and wij​ = spatial weight between locations i and j.

To estimate PMTCT knowledge levels in unsampled areas, spatial interpolation was applied using the ordinary Kriging method. Among available deterministic and geostatistical interpolation techniques, ordinary Kriging was selected for its ability to account for spatial autocorrelation and optimize weight assignments statistically.

For spatial regression, an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model was initially fitted to select explanatory variables influencing the spatial variation in poor PMTCT knowledge. Before proceeding to Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), the OLS model was evaluated using exploratory regression, a data mining tool that ensures all necessary diagnostic criteria are met. The Koenker statistic (p< 0.05) was used to assess heteroscedasticity and spatial non-stationarity, confirming whether relationships between variables varied across different locations. A significant Koenker statistic indicated the need for localized models like GWR, which account for spatial variations.

In the GWR model, explanatory variable coefficients varied across different geographic locations, allowing for localized insights into PMTCT knowledge disparities. To compare OLS (global model) and GWR (local model), adjusted R-squared and corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) were used. The best-fitting model was determined by the highest adjusted R-squared and the lowest AIC, ensuring robust spatial analysis.

A total of 4,476 weighted samples were included in this study, with a median age of 29 years (IQR = 10). The majority of the participants, 3,704 (82.77%), reside in rural areas. Over half of the population, 2,442 (54.55%), has no formal education, while 12.55% have attained secondary education or higher. Socio-economic categorization shows that 36.78% of the participants fall under the poor category, while 21.01% are in the middle-income group. Most participants, 2,721 (60.79%), reported having no media exposure. Additionally, more than half (52.45%) indicated that distance to health facilities posed a significant problem. Geographically, the largest proportion of participants is from Oromia (39.31%), followed by Amhara (21.94%) and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR) (21.84%) (Table1).

About 40.47% (95% CI: 39.04%, 41.92%) of women had poor knowledge about PMTCT. The highest proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT is found in the Somali region (52.83%), followed closely by Afar (49.62%), SNNPR (49.43%), and Benishangul (48.48%). In contrast, the lowest proportion is in Addis Ababa, where only 15.04% of women have poor knowledge. Regions such as Oromia (44.31%) and Harari (40.39%) exhibit intermediate levels of poor knowledge, suggesting substantial gaps in awareness that require attention (Fig.1).

Somalia, Afar, Gambela, SNNPR, Benishangul-Gumuz, and portions of Eastern Oromia had the highest prevalence of poor knowledge about PMTCT (Fig.2).

There was notable spatial variation in the level of poor knowledge about PMTCT across the country, reflected by a global Moran’s I value of 0.71 (p-value < 0.001). This suggests that poor knowledge about PMTCT among women of reproductive age exhibited a clustered distribution (Fig.3).

The areas identified as hotspots for poor knowledge about PMTCT are Somali, Afar, Southwest Oromia, and the Northeastern region of SNNPR (Fig.4). In Fig.5, the red color represents areas with a higher predicted proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT while the green color indicates areas with a lower predicted proportion of women with poor knowledge about PMTCT. According to the Kriging interpolation analysis, regions such as Somali, Afar, southwest Oromia, Western Gambela, and Western Benishangul-Gumuz are predicted to have a higher proportion of poor PMTCT knowledge. In contrast, areas in the central parts of Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa and North Shewa of Oromia, as well as the Amhara and Tigray regions, are predicted to have better knowledge about PMTCT.

A global ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis was carried out using Exploratory Regression to examine all potential combinations of explanatory variables. This approach identified the OLS model that best described the dependent variable. With an AICc value of 98.65, the model explained approximately 27% of the variation (adjusted R2= 0.27) in the lack of knowledge about PMTCT. The Koenker statistic (p< 0.0001) reveals significant spatial heterogeneity or non-stationarity in the relationship between the dependent and independent variables across the study area. This implies that Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) should be used, as the Koenker statistic confirms the non-stationary nature of the relationship, and GWR assumes that these relationships change spatially (Table2).

The GWR analysis provided a significant improvement over the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, indicating that accounting for spatial heterogeneity enhanced the explanatory power of the model. The AIC value decreased from 98.65 in the OLS model to 96.23 in the GWR model, reflecting a better model fit. Additionally, the adjusted R² improved from 0.27 in the OLS model to 0.39 in the GWR model, suggesting that spatial variations play a crucial role in explaining poor knowledge about PMTCT. This improvement implies that the GWR model captures localized effects that the global model fails to detect, making it a more suitable approach for understanding the geographical disparities in PMTCT knowledge.

The proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT increases as the proportion of mothers with a poor wealth index rises across all regions of Ethiopia. This suggests that economic barriers significantly hinder knowledge acquisition regarding PMTCT interventions. Regions with the highest proportion of mothers in lower wealth categories, particularly in Afar, Somali, and parts of Oromia, exhibit stronger associations with poor PMTCT knowledge, as highlighted by the GWR coefficients. The visualization in Fig.6illustrates these geographic variations, with red and pink points marking areas where poverty strongly correlates with poor awareness.

Access to mass media (radio, television, newspapers, and digital platforms) is a critical factor influencing awareness and knowledge of PMTCT. The GWR results indicate that poor PMTCT knowledge is significantly higher in regions where media exposure is limited. This pattern is most pronounced in rural areas of Amhara, Oromia, and the Ethiopian-Somali region, where access to information remains a challenge. Figure7visualizes these disparities, with red points highlighting areas where lack of media exposure corresponds to lower PMTCT knowledge. These findings emphasize the need for targeted communication strategies to bridge the information gap in underserved regions.

Geographical accessibility to health facilities plays a crucial role in determining maternal health knowledge. The GWR model reveals that regions where women face difficulties accessing health facilities exhibit higher rates of poor PMTCT knowledge. This is particularly evident in remote areas of Afar, parts of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR), and certain districts in Oromia, where long travel distances limit interactions with healthcare providers. Figure8highlights these areas, where red and pink points mark the highest GWR coefficients, reinforcing the spatial impact of healthcare accessibility on PMTCT awareness.

This study evaluated the extent of poor knowledge about PMTCT, its spatial patterns, and the factors contributing to this variation using GWR. Approximately 40.47% (95% CI: 39.04%, 41.92%) of women were found to have poor knowledge about PMTCT. Using GWR enable this study to enhances traditional regression analysis by allowing variable relationships to differ across locations, making it particularly valuable for spatial data analysis. Unlike standard methods that assume consistent relationships across all areas, GWR captures local variations, providing deeper insights into how these relationships change geographically. The proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT increases as the proportion of mothers with a poor wealth index, no media exposure, and big problem related to distance from the health facility rises in all regions of Ethiopia.

The prevalence of poor knowledge about PMTCT in our study is consistent with reports from East Africa (40.59%) [12], and Indonesia (41.4%) [16]. However, this finding is higher than the pooled estimate of previous studies in Ethiopia (37.85%) [17], Rwanda (34.9%) [18], Southwestern Nigeria (8.4%) [19], Zimbabwe (29.5%) [20], Ghana (31.69%) [21]. Conversely, it is lower than the studies conducted in (Tanzania) 54% [22], Morocco (75.8%) [23]. The differences observed could be explained by variations in the research methodologies, study settings, socio-demographic profiles of the participants, and the quality and accessibility of health service infrastructure.

The Moran’s I statistic revealed significant geographic variation in poor knowledge about PMTCT across Ethiopia, emphasizing the critical influence of location in shaping disparities. The results indicate that poor PMTCT knowledge is not randomly distributed but instead exhibits spatial clustering. This clustering suggests that certain regions face greater educational gaps regarding PMTCT, which could have serious implications for maternal and child health outcomes. Identifying these spatial patterns underscores the need for targeted interventions to bridge knowledge gaps in the most affected areas.

A distinct spatial pattern of high prevalence of poor PMTCT knowledge was consistently observed in the Somali, Afar, Gambella, SNNPR, Benishangul-Gumuz, and parts of Eastern Oromia regions. The hotspot analysis further supports these findings, aligning with previous research on inadequate HIV/AIDS knowledge in Ethiopia [24]. This pattern may be attributed to limited health infrastructure in these regions, which restricts access to essential PMTCT information and services. Additionally, lower literacy levels compared to other parts of Ethiopia [25], along with cultural beliefs and traditional practices, may deprioritize formal healthcare and limit discussions on HIV and maternal health, thereby affecting awareness and understanding.

The proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT increases with the rising proportion of mothers with a poor wealth index across all regions of Ethiopia. This finding supported by other previous studies [12–14]. This could be due to as the wealth index of mother’s declines, their access to resources such as education, healthcare services, and health information tends to decrease, which can lead to poorer knowledge about essential health interventions like PMTCT [26]. The proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT increases as the proportion of mothers with no media exposure rises in all regions of Ethiopia. This finding supported by other previous studies [10,11]. This could be explained by mothers who engage with media content are more likely to be informed about PMTCT guidelines, leading to better health-seeking behaviors and adherence to recommended practices. The proportion of poor knowledge about PMTCT increases as the proportion of mothers facing significant challenges related to the distance from health facilities rises across all regions of Ethiopia. This finding supported by other previous studies [17,27]. This may be due to mothers who live farther from health facilities often experience difficulties in accessing essential health information and services, which can significantly hinder their understanding of PMTCT strategies.

This study underscores the need for targeted interventions to address disparities in knowledge and access to maternal health information. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, particularly in hotspot regions, is crucial to improving PMTCT awareness and service utilization. Expanding community-based education programs by engaging local leaders and healthcare workers in culturally sensitive awareness campaigns can help overcome traditional barriers to HIV education. Furthermore, improving media outreach through mass communication platforms, such as radio and mobile technology, in local languages can enhance access to accurate information, particularly in remote and underserved areas.

This study utilized nationwide representative data, which improves the generalizability of its findings. The results from the spatial and geographically weighted regression analyses can assist policymakers and program planners in developing targeted public health strategies to reduce MTCT. Although this study provides important insights, it has several limitations. First, the use of cross-sectional DHS data precludes causal inference. Second, the data was collected in 2016. For privacy reasons, the geographic locations of enumeration areas were shifted by up to 2 km in urban areas, 5 km in most rural areas, and 10 km for 1% of rural clusters. This displacement may have influenced the estimated cluster effects in the spatial regression analysis.

This study revealed significant geographic and sociodemographic disparities in PMTCT knowledge among Ethiopian women. Targeted strategies are needed to improve knowledge in low-performing regions, particularly in Somali and Afar, by leveraging media, improving access to education, and integrating PMTCT messages into maternal health services. These findings can inform policy makers and program designers aiming to achieve the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission in Ethiopia. Targeted community-based interventions, mass media campaigns, and integration of PMTCT education into maternal healthcare are essential, particularly in hotspot regions. Policymakers should prioritize resource allocation to improve health facility accessibility and reduce barriers related to distance and affordability. Strengthening education and digital health initiatives can further bridge knowledge gaps. Addressing these challenges will enhance PMTCT awareness, reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission, and improve maternal and child health outcomes nationwide.
