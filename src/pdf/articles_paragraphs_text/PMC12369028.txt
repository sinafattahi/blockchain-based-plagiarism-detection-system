Urban malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa is often underestimated, emphasizing the need for research on vector distribution, abundance, behavior, and infectivity in cities. Urban malaria transmission has been on the rise across sub-Saharan Africa since 2003. Also, monitoringAnophelespopulations is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study examined the biting and resting habits, distribution, abundance, andPlasmodiuminfection of malaria vectors in Accra. Adult malaria vectors were collected using human landing catch (HLC) and Prokopack aspiration (PPK) at ten sites in Accra, categorized into five groups: sites with Irrigated Urban Farming (IUF), Lower Socioeconomic Status (LS), Middle Socioeconomic Status (MS), High Socioeconomic Status (HS), and Peri-urban (PU) areas. Biting patterns and entomological transmission indices of malaria vectors were assessed. Molecular methods were used to detect sporozoite infection, bloodmeal sources, vector species, and insecticide resistant mutation genes. A total of 41,747 mosquitoes were collected. Of these, 95.49% (39,863/41,747) were host-seeking collected through human landing catch (HLC), consisting ofAnopheles(52.54%, 20,945/39,863),Culex(42.00%, 16,742/39,863),Aedes(3.74%, 1,491/39,863), and Mansonia (1.72%, 685/39,863). The remaining 4.51% (1,884/41,747) were resting mosquitoes collected using a Procopack aspirator, comprisingAnopheles(31.26%, 589/1,884),Culex(57.21%, 1,078/1,884), andAedes(11.52%, 217/1,884). Overall, the IUF site category had the highest abundance ofAn. gambiaes.l. (48.63%, 10,466/21,520), followed by the PU (18.06%, 3,887/21,520), HS (16.42%, 3,533/21,520), MS (13.74%, 2,956/21,520) and LS (3.15%, 678/21,520) in both HLC and Procopack collections. IndoorAn. gambiaes.l. had higher sporozoite infectivity (4.56%, 16/351) than outdoor (3.78%, 9/238) (χ2= 6.78,P= 0.009). Tuba, an urban irrigated site, had the highest sporozoite infectivity (6.41%, 10/156), with higher indoor (6.82%, 6/88) than outdoor (5.88%, 4/68) rate. This study showed that irrigated urban Agriculture drives urban malaria transmission in Accra, with high human bloodmeal indices and sporozoite infectivity, especially indoors. Targeted indoor control and management of immature vector habitats in IUF areas is essential to reduce transmission.

Urbanization is significantly altering malaria vector dynamics worldwide [1], consequently increasing urban malaria transmission in many sub-Saharan African countries [2]. Despite this, urban malaria transmission remains underestimated, highlighting the need for research into vector distribution, abundance, and behaviour in urban environments. Rapid and often unplanned urbanization in many cities across sub-Saharan Africa, characterized by the encroachment into lowland areas for housing, inadequate drainage systems, and poor road infrastructure, create ideal breeding grounds for malaria vectors. Additionally, practices such as irrigated urban farming and the adaptation ofAnophelesmosquitoes to polluted breeding sites are contributing to increased malaria vector populations in cities [1,3].

The fight against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa has benefited significantly from two key interventions: Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) [4]. However, in Ghana's urban areas, these tools face important limitations. IRS programs are confined to rural regions [5], while urban residents are reluctant in LLINs installation and use [6,7]. The urban environment presents additional challenges: widespread use of agricultural chemicals on urban farms, combined with household insecticide sprays and mosquito coils, has led to increase in insecticide resistance [8–11].

In Accra and other African cities, most people reside in urban slums characterized by lower socioeconomic conditions and poor housing infrastructure [12]. Due to overcrowding and inadequate ventilation, residents in these areas often spend part of their sleeping hours outdoors. Generally, people in urban areas go to bed later and thus spend more time outside at night compared to those in rural areas. Therefore, this shift is particularly concerning given the common urban practices of outdoor sleeping and nighttime activities, which increase residents'vulnerability to malaria transmission [13].

Given the behavioural plasticity ofAn. gambiaes.l. [14], adult malaria vectors in urban areas are likely to exhibit different behaviours compared to their rural counterparts due to varying ecological and social conditions. Understanding ofAnophelesmosquito behaviour, including resting and biting patterns, is increasingly complex in urban settings, necessitating a more nuanced investigation. The unique behaviours of mosquitoes in urban landscapes challenge conventional malaria control strategies, underscoring the need to re-evaluate and adapt interventions to address the diverse resting sites favoured by urban vectors [15]. Continuous surveillance of urban anopheline populations is essential for gathering critical data to design effective and sustainable interventions aimed at disrupting vector proliferation and malaria transmission in urban areas [2].

The study was conducted across ten [10] sites, categorized into five distinct socio-economic status and environmental settings. Eight [8] of the sites were in urban areas categorized into four (4) distinct areas, as well as two sites in the peri-urban area in the city of Accra. The urban sites consisted of irrigated urban farming (IUF) sites with irrigated farming, low (LS), middle (MS), and high (HS) socioeconomic status sites, which were selected based on levels of planned development, drainage infrastructure, and sanitation conditions. There were two sites in each urban category. The peri-urban (PU) category comprised two sites located on the outskirts of Accra. The purpose of the sampling was to understand the malaria vector densities and disease transmission in each categorical site (Fig.1).

Sites selected in the irrigated urban farming category were Opeibea (5°35′52.8"N 0°10′48.2"W) and Tuba (5°30′47"N 0°23′16"W). These sites have irrigated vegetable farms in low-lying areas of the city that create all-year-round breeding habitats for the malaria mosquitoes. Furthermore, farmers in these areas use various agricultural chemicals that may contribute to insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.

The low socioeconomic (LS) sites were Nima (5°35′0″N 0°12′0″W) and Chorkor (5°31′39″N 0°13′55″W), which are slums characterized by dilapidated and overcrowded structures on poorly demarcated plots, lacking proper drainage and sanitation systems.

The middle socioeconomic (MS) sites were Dansoman (5°33′0″N 0°16′0″W) and Teshie (5°35′0″N 0°6′0″W). These areas have standard housing on well-demarcated plots, with most roads either tarred or untarred, and they possess designed but poorly managed drainage and sanitation systems. High socioeconomic (HS) sites were East Legon (5°38′16.39"N 0°9′40.33"W) and Tantra Hill (5°34′44.0148"N 0°13′46.812"W), feature the highest quality housing in Ghana, with well-planned environments, best-managed drainage, and sanitation systems, and well-maintained roads with few potholes to serve as mosquito breeding habitats.

The peri-urban areas were Oyarifa (5°46′14″N 0°10′50″W) and Medie (5°45′43"N 0°19′20"W). These areas, just outside the city, were characterized by new settlements with many roads and buildings under construction and higher vegetation cover. The land use type in these areas creates numerous breeding habitats during the rainy season. Differences in landscape, drainage systems, sanitation, and land use (agriculture/non-agriculture) among these sites will aid in understanding their impact on urban malaria transmission and mosquito resistance to insecticides.

Accra, within the Greater Accra region, had a total population of about 2,557,000 in 2021, a population growth rate of 24.13% from 2010, and a land area of 225.67 km2[17]. The region experiences two rainy seasons, with an average annual rainfall of 730 mm and an average temperature of 27.6 °C. The relative humidity is generally high, ranging from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The rainfall pattern, combined with poor drainage, supports the formation of stagnant waters, while the temperature and humidity create a favorable environment for mosquitoes.

The human landing catch (HLC) method was employed to collect host-seeking mosquitoes. Twelve (12) houses were selected from each study site for this collection during dry and rainy season. Each day, outdoor of four (4) houses were chosen for three consecutive nights. Two trained volunteers at each house were stationed outdoors in the dark from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM to catch mosquitoes landing on their legs. Each collector was equipped with a falcon tube and a flashlight to assist with mosquito capture. To attract mosquitoes, collectors exposed their lower limbs to increase the skin surface area. Using the flashlight, the collectors trapped mosquitoes that landed on their skin by guiding them into the falcon tubes. Once a mosquito entered the tube, the collector quickly covered the open end with their thumb and transferred the mosquito into a pre-labeled collection cup. Different locations were chosen each night to ensure a representativeAnophelesvector population for the study site [18].

To ensure the quality of collections, supervisors conducted regular rotations between different groups throughout the night. Mosquitoes captured each hour were either killed by placing them in a −20 °C freezer or exposing them to chloroform. They were then stored in individual tubes with silica gel, labeled with study site, date and time of collection, and transported to the laboratory for identification. Mosquito biting patterns were classified into the following categories: early evening (EE) (18:00–21:00), late evening (LE) (00:00–04:00), and early morning (EM) (05:00–06:00).

Resting mosquitoes, both indoors and outdoors, were collected using Prokopack (PPK) aspirators from 15 houses per day at each site. Sampling was conducted each morning from 5:30 AM to 8:00 AM over a three-day period. Households were requested the night before the sampling not to open their doors and windows when they wake up the next morning to avoid mosquitoes exiting. Adult mosquitoes were then sampled each morning of collection (5:30am to 8:00am) using the prokopack aspirator. The aspirator was used to hoover the ceiling, under tables and beds, wall and all possible resting surfaces. Aspirated mosquitoes were then put into holding cups and transported to the laboratory for identification and further processing [19].

These mosquito collections were undertaken during the dry season (February–March) and the rainy season (May–June) of 2023.

All captured mosquitoes were sorted into genera (Anopheles,CulexandAedes), sex and gonotrophic stages (unfed, fully fed, semi-gravid, and gravid), andAn. gambiaes.l. mosquitoes were identified based on morphological characteristics under a stereomicroscope (Olympus, SZ60, Japan) using the identification keys developed by Maureen Coetzee [20]. Identification of sibling species within theAnopheles gambiae s.l.complex was achieved through rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [21]. Furthermore, the specific identification ofAn. gambiaes.s. andAn. coluzziiwas carried out using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis [22].

To genotype for the kdr mutation, DNA was extracted from mosquito legs using the ZR DNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research), following the manufacturer's instructions. Standard PCR assays were employed to detect the presence of the L1014F and L1014S kdr alleles, using a modified protocol as described by [23]. Additionally, the G119S mutation in the ace1 gene was assessed through PCR analysis, following the protocol outlined by [24].

The abdomens of the blood-fed restingAnophelesmosquitoes were cut into transverse sections. Genomic DNA was extracted from the mosquito abdomens using the ZR DNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. One universal reverse primer and five animal-specific (human, cow, goat, pig, and dog) forward primers were used for amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to test for specific host blood meal origin using conventional PCR [25]. Positive controls were included for each host in the PCR analyses, and laboratory-reared unfedAn. gambiaewere used as the negative control.

DNA extracted from the head and thorax of each mosquito sample was analyzed for the presence ofPlasmodium falciparumsporozoites using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) following the method described by Echeverry et al. [26]. This assay was conducted on all restingAnopheles gambiaes.l. (n= 589) collected, as well as a subsample of host-seekingAn. gambiae s.l.(n= 2,472) representing samples from all study sites in both seasons.

Descriptive analysis was performed to compare adult mosquito abundance between different study sites, indoor and outdoor. This was presented in the form of tables, bar charts and graphs. The association of Blood meal sources, sporozoites infection rate and the abundance of malaria vectors resting indoor and outdoor as well as across sites were tested using Chi-square. The sporozoite infection rate (IR) was expressed as the proportion of mosquitoes positive forPlasmodiumsporozoite, that is the number of sporozoite positive mosquitoes divided by total number of mosquitoes tested. Human Biting Rate (HBR) was calculated as the total number of mosquitoes collected by HLC per the total number of collectors per nights collected. The Entomological Inoculation Rates (EIR) was calculated as the product of the human biting rate and the sporozoite rate. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was performed to compare the means of the biting rates across seasons and among site categories: irrigated urban farming (IUF), low socioeconomic (LS), middle socioeconomic (MS), high socioeconomic (HS) and peri-urban (PU).

Where RR is the number of homozygote resistant mosquitoes, RS is the number of heterozygotes resistant mosquitoes, and n is the total number of mosquitoes analysed [27]. The human blood index (HBI) and bovine blood index (BBI) was calculated as the proportion ofAnophelesmosquitoes that had taken a blood meal from human or other vertebrates respectively. Maps were downloaded from google and modified with Adobe Photoshop CS6 to show locations of study sites.

This study was granted scientific and ethical approval by the Ethical and Protocol Review Committee (EPRC) of the College of Health Sciences, University of Ghana, Korle-Bu Campus. Informed consent (verbal and written) was acquired from opinion leaders of selected study sites and house/household heads. To reduce the risk of mosquito bites collectors were trained to catch mosquitoes. To get the support of residence and safety supervision within the night volunteers were selected from study sites.

A total of 39,863 mosquitoes consisting of four different genera were collected using HLC across all study sites during the sampling period:Anopheles(52.54%, 20,945/39,863),Culex(42.10%, 16,742/39,863),Aedes(3.74%, 1,491/39,863) andMansonia(1.72%, 685/39,863). About 41.75% (16,642/39,863) of mosquitoes were collected during the dry season [Anopheles(30.47%, 5,071/16,642),Culex(64.46%, 10,727/16,642),Aedes(1.44%, 240/16,642),Mansonia(2.55%, 424/16,642)] and 58.25% (23,221/39,863) in the rainy season [Anopheles(68.36%, 15,874/23,221),Culex(25.90%, 6,015/23,221),Aedes(4.61%, 1,071/23,221),Mansonia(1.12%, 261/23,221)]. Overall,Anophelesdominated (52.54%, 20,945/39,863), followed byCulex(42.00%, 16,742/39,863),Aedes(3.74%, 1,491/39,863), andMansonia(1.72%, 685/39,863). Among theAnopheles, the highest abundance wasAn. gambiaes.l. (99.93%, 20,931/20,945), with smaller proportions ofAn. funestuss.l. (0.02%, 4/20,945),An. pharoensis(0.03%, 6/20,945), andAn. rufipes(0.02%, 4/20,945) (Table1).

Among the site categories, irrigated urban farming (IUF) had the most abundant ofAn. gambiaes.l. (48.85%, 10,224/20931), followed by peri-urban (PU) (17.86%, 3738/20931), and the lowest was from low socioeconomic (LS) (2.84%, 595/20931). The rainy season had a higher abundance ofAnopheles gambiaes.l. in all sites categories when compared to the dry season [IUF (dry = 3,067, rainy = 7,157), PU (dry = 805, rainy = 2,933), LS (dry = 127, rainy = 468), MS (dry = 469, rainy = 2,402) and HS (dry = 598, rainy = 2,905)]. Among the individual sites, Tuba in the irrigated urban farming category recorded the highest abundance ofAn. gambiaes.l. in both dry and rainy season [dry (47.55%, 2,409/5,066), rainy (38.20%, 6,061/15,865)], whereas Chorkor in the LS categories had the lowest abundance of mosquitoes in both seasons [dry (1.11%, 56/5,066), rainy (1.32%, 210/15,865)].An. funestusspecies were exclusively collected from Medie in the peri-urban site category (Table1) during the dry season.

Among the sampled anophelines collected, only 0.07% (14/20,945) comprised of otherAnophelesspecies (Table1). These species consist ofAn. rufipes(28.57%, 4/14),An. funestus(28.57, 4/14) andAn. pharoensis(42.86%, 6/14).An. pharoensisspecies were exclusively collected during the rainy season, whereas,An. funestuswere sampled during the dry seasons.

A total of 1,884 resting mosquitoes were collected from all sites. The most abundant genera of mosquitoes sampled were the culicines (57.22%, 1,078/1,884), followed by the anophelines (31.26%, 589/1,884) and then Aedines (11.52%, 217/1,884). MoreAnopheles gambiaes.l. were sampled during the rainy season (77.08%, 454/589) compared to the dry season (22.92%, 135/589) (t = −0.0405, df = 587,P= 0.48). Tuba, from the irrigated urban farming site category, had the highest abundance of restingAn. gambiaes.l., 26.49%, 156/589 (rainy = 116, dry = 40), with the least sampled from East Legon from the HS site category, 1.70%, 10/589 (rainy = 7, dry = 3).

Of the total (n= 589) restingAnopheles gambiaes.l. mosquitoes that were sampled during the study period, significantly abundantAnopheles gambiaes.l were collected indoors (60.44%, 356/589) as compared to outdoors (49.56%, 233/589) (t = 1.9103, df = 587,P= 0.03). Among the sites, Tuba (IUF) had the highest abundance ofAn. gambiaes.l. in both indoor (24.72%, 88/356) and outdoor (29.18%, 68/233), whereas the least indoor (1.40%, 5/356) and outdoor (2.15%, 5/233) abundance were recorded in East Legon (HS) (Table2).

From the host-seekingAn. gambiaes.l. collected, a subsample of 2,232 from all the study sites in both seasons were randomly selected and used to discriminate the sibling species.An. gambiaes.s (68.86%, 1,537/2,232) was the most abundant species followed byAn. coluzzii(27.24%, 608/2,232), and hybrids ofAn. gambiae s.s. andAn. coluzzii(3.90%, 90/2,232) (Table3). With respect to socioeconomic characterization, moreAn. coluzziiwas collected from LS [An. gambiaes.s. = 26.14% (40/153);An. coluzzii= 67.97% (104/153); hybrids = 5.88% (9/153)] and MS [An. gambiaes.s. = 36.65% (103/281);An. coluzzii= 62.28% (175/281); hybrids = 1.07% (3/281)] site categories. However,An. gambiaes.s. was more abundant in the other site categories [PU, HS, IUF] (Tables3).

With resting mosquitoes, the totalAn. gambiaes.l. (n= 589) from all the study sites were used to discriminate the sibling species.An. coluzzii(64.52%, 380/589) were the most abundant, followed byAnopheles gambiaes.s, (26.99%, 159/589) and then Hybrids ofAn. coluzziiandAn. gambiaes.s. (8.49%, 50/589). During both seasons,An. coluzziiwas the most abundant sampled, Dry [indoor (48); outdoor (41)]; Rainy [indoor (164); outdoor (127)], followed byAn. gambiaes.s, Dry [indoor (24); outdoor (9)]; Rainy = [indoor (85); outdoor (41)], and then hybrids; Dry [indoor (8); outdoor (5)] Rainy = [indoor (22); outdoor (15)], (Fig.2).

An. gambiaes.l. exhibited the highest biting activity during the late evening (LE) at 71.64% (14,995/20,931), followed by the early morning (EM) at 17.56% (3,675/20,931), and the lowest during the early evening (EE) at 10.80% (2,261/20,931). This pattern was consistent across all sites and site categories. Notably, significantly higher biting activity was recorded in the LE for both the dry (72.21%, 3,658/5,066) and rainy seasons (71.45%, 11,337/15,865) [F (2, 27) = 6.03, P = 0.019, 95% CI 135.2691–1388.731] (Fig.3).

Biting activity varied across site categories, with a non-significant trend of higher activity observed in the irrigated urban farming site category, particularly during the late evening, peaking between 02:00 and 03:00 h [F (4,10) = 1.36, P = 0.176, 95% CI −793.9493–3781.949].

The human-biting activity ofAn. gambiaes.l. displayed a similar pattern across all study sites, showing a bimodal distribution. The first and highest peak occurred between 02:00 and 03:00 h (15.52%, 3,248/20,931), while a secondary peak was observed in the early morning between 04:00 and 05:00 h (12.09%, 2,530/20,931). Although biting activity was higher in the early morning hours compared to the early evening hours, biting activity steadily declined from 05:00 to 06:00 h.

Out of the 589An. gambiae s.l.mosquitoes collected, 70.63% (416/589) were found to have fed on blood from various sources. The Human Blood Index (HBI) was consistently higher across all site categories and species at 86.30% (359/416), compared to the Bovine Blood Index (BBI), which was 29.33% (122/416). Hybrids collected indoors at the Peri-Urban (PU) site exhibited the highest HBI of 100% (2/2), while the highest BBI, 50% (5/10), was observed among hybrids collected outdoors at the Irrigated Urban Farming (IUF) site.

Mixed blood meal sources were recorded sporadically, with the highest occurrences at irrigated urban farming and peri-urban site categories.An. gambiae s.s.exhibited consistently high HBI across all site categories, particularly for indoor feeding: LS (indoor = 57%, outdoor = 57%), MS (indoor = 52%, outdoor = 100%), HS (indoor = 100%, outdoor = 0%), IUF (indoor = 54%, outdoor = 46%), and PU (indoor = 82%, outdoor = 79%).

Similarly,An. coluzziidemonstrated strong anthropophilic tendencies with high HBI across all site categories: low socioeconomic (indoor = 66%, outdoor = 65%), middle socioeconomic (indoor = 47%, outdoor = 0%), high socioeconomic (indoor = 100%, outdoor = 72%), irrigated urban farming (indoor = 52%, outdoor = 45%), and peri-urban (indoor = 88%, outdoor = 68%) (Table4).

A subsample of 2,472 [dry = 1,670; rainy = 802]An. gambiaes.l. mosquitoes collected through HLC were also tested forPlasmodium falciparumcircumsporozoite protein (CSP). Overall, 2.1% (54/2,472) were positive forP. falciparumCSP. There was higher sporozoite rate in the rainy season compared to the dry season [dry = 1.25% (21/1,670); rainy = 4.11% (33/802)] (χ2= 14.8, df = 13,P= 0.320). The highest sporozoite rate was recorded in Dansoman (MS) (5.8%, 7/121) and Medie (PU) (4.3%, 8/184), whereas the least was recorded in Tantra hill (HS) (0.5%, 1/216). Among the sites categories, sporozoite rates did not vary significantly (χ2= 59.0, df = 52,P= 0.235) (Table5).

All the restingAnopheles gambiaes.l sampled (n= 589) were analyzed for the presence ofPlasmodium falciparumcircumsporozoite protein (CSP). Of the 4.24% (25/589) that tested positive, those collected from indoors had higher sporozoite infectivity (4.56%, 16/351) as compared to those collected from outdoors (3.78%, 9/238) (X2= 6.7818, df = 1,P= 0.009). Tuba from the IUF site category recorded the highest frequency of CSP positiveAnopheles gambiaes.l. (5.77%, 9/156), [indoor = 6.82% (6/88); outdoor = 5.88% (4/68)]. And the least was recorded in Dansoman (2.70%, 1/37) [indoor = 2.94% (1/34); outdoor = 0.00% (0/3)] (Table6).

The study identified significant variations in malaria transmission indices across different study sites. The overall average Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) was 1.526 infective bites per person per night (ib/p/n). Seasonal differences were observed, with EIR values of 0.191 ib/p/n during the dry season and 2.862 ib/p/n during the rainy season (χ2= 18.80, df = 15, P = 0.331).

During the rainy season, Tuba, an irrigated urban farming (IUF) site, recorded the highest transmission risk, with an estimated 12.787 infective bites per person per night (ib/p/n), while Chorkor a lower socioeconomic (LS) site had no infective bite. In the dry season, Oyarifa, a peri-urban (PU) site, had the highest entomological inoculation rate (EIR) with 0.602 ib/p/n, whereas Nima (LS), Teshie and Dansoman (MS), and Tantra Hill (HS) had no infective bites.

Overall, the highest malaria transmission risk was recorded in Tuba (IUF), with the highest Human Biting Rate (HBR) of 176.458 and EIR of 2.647 ib/p/n, followed by the two Peri-urban (PU) sites, Medie (HBR: 30.792, EIR:1.324 ib/p/n,) and Oyarifa (HBR:47.083, EIR:1.224 ib/p/n). In contrast, Nima (HBR: 6.854, EIR: 0.110 ib/p/n) and Chorkor (HBR: 5.542, EIR: 0.188 ib/p/n) in the low socioeconomic (LS) category had the lowest malaria transmission risk (Table5).

AllAnopheles gambiae s.l.samples (n= 589) collected from indoor and outdoor environments were genotyped to detect insecticide resistance mutations: L1014F, L1014S, and G119SAce-1.

The L1014F allele was present at a frequency of 100% across indoor and outdoor environments and allAn. gambiae s.l.species, except inAn. gambiae s.s., where it was observed at a slightly lower frequency of 90%. The L1014S mutation was detected at a very low frequency (10%) and was limited toAn. gambiae s.s.and hybrids.

For the G119SAce-1mutation, the allele frequency was 70% in indoor samples and 60% in outdoor samples. Among the species, G119S was observed at a frequency of 70% in bothAn. coluzziiandAn. gambiae s.s., and 50% in hybrids (Table7).

To effectively control and eliminate malaria in urban environments, it is essential to thoroughly understand vector-human interactions and resting behaviors in these areas [15]. The intricate relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution and biting patterns of malaria vectors is crucial for designing targeted control measures. This study reveals notable patterns in the resting and host preference behaviors of urban malaria vectors, while also examining biting patterns and the infectivity rate ofPlasmodium falciparumcircumsporo zoite protein (PfCSP) in Accra, Ghana. Findings from this study indicated that irrigated urban farming significantly contributes to the proliferation of malaria vectors and may enhance transmission risk within urban settings.Anophelesmosquitoes were found resting indoors at higher densities and exhibited significantly higher Human Blood Index (HBI), and PfCSP infectivity compared to outdoor resting. These insights are important to provide crucial knowledge on malaria in the urban environments.

This study found a high abundance of malaria vectors in irrigated urban farming (IUF) sites. These farms are predominantly located in low lying areas, where irrigation activities create stagnant water, providing ideal breeding habitats forAnophelesmosquitoes throughout the year. Additionally, the ability of malaria vectors to adapt to breeding in heavily polluted urban environments, as reported by Sabtiu et al. [28] and Kudom [29], may also contribute to the rising urban vector population. This combination of factors likely explains the increased vector abundance in urban areas, especially in the IUF areas. Similar patterns have been documented in various cities in Ghana and other African countries [2–8].

Sporozoite rates varied among restingAnophelesacross site categories, reflecting differences in malaria transmission. Irrigated urban farming (IUF) sites had the highest rates, with greater indoor mosquito infections, suggesting sustained indoor human-vector interactions. These were higher than the peri-urban areas where infection rates have been known to be higher than in urban sites emphasizing the contribution of irrigated urban farming to the growing malaria transmission in the city of Accra and other cities with similar settings in Africa.

The Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) is a key indicator for assessing malaria endemicity and transmission intensity [30,31], with studies across Africa reporting EIR estimates ranging from 0 to 884 infectious bites per person annually in rural areas, while urban environments typically range from 0 to 43 [32,33]. However, this study had a significantly higher urban annual EIR ofAn. gambiae s.l.compared to the average urban EIRs reported across sub-Saharan Africa. The EIR is comparable to rural areas in Ghana such as Dodowa in [34].

Significantly, more mosquitoes were found resting indoors and many of these have fed on humans including those that were resting outdoors. An ongoing work shows the widespread use of aerosol sprays and coils in the city of Accra (Sabtiu et al., unpublished). Despite these insecticides in the indoor space there was still high indoor resting mosquito densities that had fed on humans more than on animals. This might have been due to the high insecticide resistance mutation found in them. A study that was done in some of the sites showed high phenotypic and metabolic resistance in these sites [35].

Insecticide resistance mutations inAnopheles gambiaes.l. present a significant challenge for malaria control. This study investigates the frequency of three key mutations, L1014F, L1014S, and G119S Ace-1 across indoor and outdoor restingAn. gambiaes.l. The L1014F mutation is nearly fixed in populations, likely due to extensive insecticide use, while L1014S occurs at low frequencies, possibly due to its recent emergence, lower fitness advantage or geographic variations in insecticide use. The G119S Ace-1 mutation shows moderate prevalence, varying by species and environment. The presence of insecticide resistance mutations inAnopheles gambiaes.l.populations highlight the ongoing challenge of controlling malaria vectors in urban and rural settings. Similar patterns of coexisting mutations have been observed in other studies, highlighting the species'genetic adaptability to insecticide pressures and the critical need for ongoing resistance monitoring [9,18,36–38].

This study showed the influence of irrigated vegetable farms to the transmission of malaria in the city of Accra with high vector densities and infection rates culminating in high EIRs. Continuous vector surveillance and monitoring are crucial for understanding vector dynamics and informing targeted interventions.
