Pediatric laparoscopic surgery often induces atelectasis due to pneumoperitoneum, postural changes, and immature respiratory physiology, increasing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Fixed PEEP may fail to address perioperative variability. This study evaluated whether dynamic PEEP adjustment reduces atelectasis and improves oxygenation.

Children at moderate or high risk of PPCs undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery were randomized into two groups. Group A had driving pressure-guided individualized PEEP titration at three specified time points: after intubation, before pneumoperitoneum initiation, and after pneumoperitoneum completion. Group B had individualized PEEP titration only after intubation, with this PEEP maintained until the end of ventilation. Both groups received alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs). Observations were conducted at 5 min after tracheal intubation (T1), 20 min post-pneumoperitoneum (T2), 60 min post-pneumoperitoneum (T3), at the end of surgery (T4), and at extubation (T5). The primary outcome were intraoperative lung ultrasound score. Secondary outcomes included incidence of atelectasis, oxygenation index, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, PEEP, driving pressure, dynamic lung compliance, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate.

At T4 and T5, Group A showed significantly lower subpleural consolidation scores, total lung ultrasound scores, and atelectasis rates versus Group B (P< 0.05). Oxygenation indices in Group A were higher at T3–T5 (P< 0.05). Post-pneumoperitoneum, Group A’s median PEEP increased to 8 cmH2O (vs. Group B), with lower driving pressure and higher dynamic compliance (P< 0.05). Hemodynamic parameters showed no intergroup differences (P> 0.05).

Driving pressure-guided dynamic PEEP titration reduces postoperative lung ultrasound abnormalities and atelectasis while improving oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in pediatric laparoscopy, without compromising hemodynamic stability. This strategy supports personalized PEEP optimization.

Laparoscopic surgery, being minimally invasive, facilitates rapid recovery and rarely results in complications, making it the most widely adopted minimally invasive surgical treatment [1]. However, due to the effects of pneumoperitoneum and specific positions such as Trendelenburg positioning, patients often experience reduced lung compliance and alveolar collapse or atelectasis in the lung bases [2], which can lead to postoperative pulmonary complications that are closely associated with postoperative mortality in pediatric patients [3]. Current conventional protective ventilation strategies appear insufficient for optimal lung protection, particularly as routine PEEP seems inadequate to meet the PEEP requirements of these surgical patients [4]. The optimal PEEP for minimizing atelectasis, improving oxygenation, limiting significant intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations, and reducing PPCs remains unclear and may vary among individuals.

Growing evidence suggests perioperative lung protection depends not just on PEEP application, but on individualized PEEP [4,5]. Defining fixed optimal PEEP is impractical; it represents an individualized value requiring frequent reassessment based on patient factors (age, BMI, pulmonary status), surgical factors (phase, site, positioning), and disease progression [6]. Current individualized PEEP research is limited to single-time titration, overlooking the impact of dynamic perioperative changes like pneumoperitoneum and positional shifts on respiratory physiology. The potential benefit of dynamic titration of individualized PEEP throughout the perioperative period to adapt to these changes remains unvalidated.

Children’s smaller functional residual capacity (FRC) (approximately 25–33% of adult values) and larger closing volume predispose them to alveolar collapse and atelectasis during anesthesia. Pneumoperitoneum further compresses lung tissue, worsening ventilation/perfusion mismatch [3]. Higher oxygen consumption (> 200% of adults), weaker muscles, and lower compliance exacerbate pneumoperitoneum-induced oxygenation impairment [7], necessitating PEEP for alveolar patency [8]. Thinner septa and insufficient surfactant increase ventilator-induced injury susceptibility [9]. Fixed PEEP risks overdistension or collapse; personalized settings may mitigate injury [4]. Optimal pediatric PEEP levels remain undefined.

This study aims to investigate the lung-protective effects of a driving pressure-guided dynamic PEEP titration ventilation strategy in pediatric laparoscopic surgery. Specifically, it seeks to demonstrate that dynamically adjusting individualized PEEP based on specific intraoperative conditions, such as pneumoperitoneum, can more effectively prevent atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and enhance lung protection. The results will provide valuable evidence for optimizing respiratory management during pediatric laparoscopic procedures.

This study was a randomized controlled study, approved by the Ethics Committee of Kunming Children’s Hospital (Approval No. 2022-03-396-K01). Informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians of the subjects, and the informed consent forms were signed. The study subjects were 68 cases of patients who underwent elective general anesthesia laparoscopic surgery in our hospital from September 2022 to January 2023.

No restriction on gender; aged 2–8 years; classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II; scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic surgery; anticipated pneumoperitoneum duration greater than 60 min; complete clinical data available.

Children with congenital heart disease, concurrent respiratory diseases (pneumonia, bronchial asthma, etc.), previous history of pulmonary surgery, family members of the children refused to participate in this clinical study.All participants were screened for recent respiratory illness (within 4 weeks), cardiac conditions, and neuromuscular disorders through structured medical history interviews and preoperative physical examinations.Only children with normal cardiorespiratory findings and no active comorbidities were enrolled.

Anesthesia induction was performed using Sufentanil 0.2–0.5 µg/kg, Propofol 2.5–3.5 mg/kg, and Cisatracurium 0.1–0.2 mg/kg. Anesthesia maintenance included Remifentanil 0.1–0.5 µg/kg·min, Propofol 4–10 mg/kg·h, and Sevoflurane 0.8–1.3 MAC, with dosages adjusted based on anesthesia depth. Cisatracurium 0.1–0.2 mg/kg was administered intermittently via intravenous injection. After intubation, volume-controlled ventilation was employed with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PEtCO2) between 35 and 45 mmHg, with I/E = 1:2 and FiO2at 40-45%. PEEP was adjusted according to the experimental protocol (see below).

The 12-region method was used to perform ultrasound scans on 12 lung zones (6 per lung). A modified lung ultrasound score was applied (Appendix Fig. 4). Atelectasis was considered present if any region scored ≥ 2 points, with higher scores indicating more severe atelectasis. Lung ultrasound examinations and atelectasis scoring were performed by a trained senior attending physician who was blinded to group allocation. The first lung ultrasound scan was performed immediately after anesthesia induction and intubation, before the first individualized PEEP titration. The second scan was conducted after surgery completion and prior to PACU admission. The third scan was performed immediately after extubation.

The study protocol is outlined in Fig.1(Observation time points for outcome indicators: T0: 5 min after entering the operating room; T1: 5 min after intubation; T2: 20 min of pneumoperitoneum; T3: 60 min of pneumoperitoneum; T4: end of surgery; T5: extubation). Patients were randomly divided into the dynamic titration group (Group A) and single titration group (Group B) using a random number table, with PEEP values set according to group allocation.

In Group A, alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) and driving pressure-guided PEEP titration were performed at three stages: post-induction intubation, pneumoperitoneum initiation, and pneumoperitoneum termination, with dynamic PEEP adjustments based on titration results. PEEP was sequentially decreased from 10, 8, 6, 4, to 2 cmH2O. Each PEEP level was maintained for 10 respiratory cycles, and the driving pressure (Pplat-PEEP) corresponding to the last respiratory cycle was recorded. The PEEP associated with the lowest driving pressure was selected as the optimal PEEP upon completion of titration. If multiple PEEP values corresponded to the lowest driving pressure, the lower PEEP value was selected as the optimal PEEP. Group B received ARMs and driving pressure-guided PEEP titration only after induction intubation, maintaining this PEEP value until extubation. At pneumoperitoneum initiation and termination phases, only ARM was performed (using the vital capacity method: 30 cmH2O pressure applied for 10 s, repeated 3 times).

(1) Lung ultrasound scores: B-line score, subpleural consolidation score, total LUS score, and incidence of atelectasis at T1, T4, and T5.

Oxygenation status: Radial arterial blood was collected for blood gas analysis at T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 to record oxygenation index (OI), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and related ventilation parameters such as arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2).

Indicators related to PEEP titration: Driving pressure (DP), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and SpO2during individualized PEEP titration in both groups after induction and intubation.

Respiratory mechanics: Peak pressure (Ppeak), plateau pressure (Pplat), DP, and Cdyn at T1, T2, T3, and T4 were observed and recorded; PEEP values in both groups at T1-T4 were documented.

Hemodynamic indicators: Heart rate (HR) and MAP at5 minutes after entering the operating room (T0) served as baseline values. HR and MAP at T1,T2, T3, and T4 were observed and recorded. The occurrence of HR or blood pressure fluctuations exceeding ±20% of baseline at each time point was documented.

Given the scarcity of similar clinical studies in the literature, we conducted a pilot study including 16 cases per group (32 cases total) to estimate the required sample size, we defined atelectasis as LUS score ≥ 2. The pilot data revealed an atelectasis incidence of 31.25% (5/16) in Group A versus 68.75% (11/16) in Group B, demonstrating a 37.5% absolute difference. Using R software (v4.3.0) with the pwr package (v1.3.0), we performed a two-sided Z-test for two independent proportions. With α = 0.05 and power = 80%, the analysis indicated a requirement of 27 cases per group (total 54 cases) to detect this clinically significant difference (Cohen’s h = 0.771). Accounting for an anticipated 10% dropout rate, we recommend enrolling 30 cases per group (60 cases total) in the formal study.

In this study, patients were randomized into the dynamic titration group (Group A) and the single-dose titration group (Group B) using a computer-generated random number table method with block randomization (block size of 4). The random sequence was generated by an independent statistician using SPSS 27.0 software and concealed through sealed, opaque envelopes. These envelopes were centrally managed by the study coordinator prior to patient enrollment and only opened after anesthesia induction to ensure allocation concealment. Although the intervention (dynamic PEEP adjustment) required real-time operation, the anesthesia team, who were aware of the grouping information, did not participate in data collection or outcome assessment. Pulmonary ultrasound examinations and atelectasis scoring were performed by a senior attending physician who had undergone standardized training and remained blinded to the grouping information. Ultrasound images and scoring results were recorded anonymously to minimize subjective bias. After de-identification of the original data, an independent statistician conducted the analysis using a blinded approach.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0 software. Normally distributed measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD), with intergroup comparisons analyzed by independent samples t-test and intragroup comparisons analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Non-normally distributed measurement data were expressed as median (M) and interquartile range (IQR), with intergroup comparisons analyzed using nonparametric tests. Categorical data were analyzed by Chi-square test. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

This study initially enrolled 68 children, with 3 cases excluded from each group. Ultimately, 62 participants were included, with 31 cases in each group (Fig.2). Comparisons between the two groups showed no statistically significant differences in gender, age, BMI, surgical types, operative duration, pneumoperitoneum duration, pneumoperitoneum pressure, or mechanical ventilation duration (Table1).

Both groups had a median PEEP of 6 cmH2O during individualized post-intubation titration. At 6 cmH2O PEEP, DP reached its lowest value, while Cdyn peaked. Compared to PEEP 2 cmH2O, PEEP levels of 4, 6, 8, and 10 cmH2O significantly reduced DP and increased Cdyn. Notably, SPO2significantly decreased at PEEP 8 and 10 cmH2O (P< 0.05). No statistically significant differences in mean MAP were observed across PEEP levels during titration (P> 0.05) (Table2).

(1) Lung ultrasound scores: Compared with group B, the subpleural consolidation score and total LUS score in group A were significantly decreased at T4 and T5 (P< 0.05). Compared with T1, the B-line score in group A significantly decreased at T5, while the subpleural consolidation score and total LUS score significantly decreased from T4 to T5 in group A (P< 0.05) (Table3; Fig.3a).

Incidence of atelectasis: Lung ultrasound assessment at T1 (post-induction) revealed atelectasis in 23 cases (74.2%) in group A and 24 cases (77.4%) in group B. The incidence of atelectasis in group A was significantly lower than that in group B at T4 (end of surgery) and T5 (extubation) (P< 0.05) (Table3; Fig.3e).

Oxygenation status: Compared with group B, there was no significant difference in OI between groups during T1-T2 (P> 0.05), while group A showed significantly higher OI than group B during T3-T5 (P< 0.05). Compared with T1 (post-intubation), group A maintained stable OI without significant differences from T2 to T5, whereas group B demonstrated significant OI reductions at T3, T4 and T5 (P< 0.05) (Table3; Fig.3b).

Respiratory Mechanics: The median value of individualized PEEP titration in both groups before pneumoperitoneum was 6 cmH2O. After pneumoperitoneum initiation, the median individualized PEEP titration values in Group A at T2 and T3 were 8 cmH2O, significantly higher than those in Group B (P< 0.05) and significantly higher than the pre-pneumoperitoneum T1 value (P< 0.05). At T4 after pneumoperitoneum conclusion, the median individualized PEEP titration value in Group A was 6 cmH2O, showing no significant difference compared to Group B (P> 0.05) but significantly lower than the PEEP levels at T2 and T3 after pneumoperitoneum initiation (P< 0.05).

Compared to Group B, Group A exhibited significantly lower DP and significantly higher Cdyn at T2 and T3 after pneumoperitoneum (P< 0.05). Compared to T1, both groups showed significant increases in Ppeak, Pplat, and DP, along with significant decreases in Cdyn at T2 and T3 after pneumoperitoneum (P< 0.05). Compared to T2 and T3 after pneumoperitoneum, both groups demonstrated significant reductions in Ppeak, Pplat, and DP, and significant increases in Cdyn at T4 after pneumoperitoneum conclusion (P< 0.05) (Table 3, Fig.3c, d).

Extubation Time: The postoperative extubation time in Group A (28.81 ± 7.62 min) was significantly shorter than that in Group B (36.84 ± 6.67 min) (P< 0.001) (Table3; Fig.3f).

Hemodynamics: No statistically significant differences in MAP or HR were observed between the two groups at any time point (P> 0.05). Compared to T0, both groups showed significant decreases in MAP and HR at T1, and significant decreases in HR at T3 and T4 (P< 0.05), though none exceeded 20% of baseline values (Table3).

This study demonstrates that driving pressure-guided dynamic PEEP titration at key intraoperative phases (post-intubation, pneumoperitoneum initiation, and pneumoperitoneum conclusion) significantly reduces atelectasis incidence, improves oxygenation, and enhances respiratory mechanics in pediatric laparoscopy compared to single-titration PEEP. Specifically, Group A showed significantly lower total lung ultrasound scores and atelectasis rates, higher oxygenation indice with lower driving pressure and higher dynamic compliance sversus Group B during the operation and in the early postoperative period.Therefore, it is essential to dynamically adjust individualized PEEP in real-time based on the pneumoperitoneum status.

During laparoscopic surgery, pneumoperitoneum elevates intra-abdominal pressure, leading to diaphragmatic elevation, restricted thoracic movement, and alveolar collapse, thereby increasing the risk of atelectasis [3,8]. In this study, Ppeak, Pplat, and DP all increased significantly after pneumoperitoneum initiation, while lung compliance decreased markedly. The individualized PEEP value required post-pneumoperitoneum was significantly higher than pre-pneumoperitoneum levels, indicating that pneumoperitoneum increases PEEP requirements in pediatric patients [10]. This suggests that fixed PEEP settings cannot adapt to the dynamic respiratory changes induced by pneumoperitoneum [11]. In our study, the dynamic titration group not only optimized PEEP post-intubation but also adjusted PEEP at the beginning and end of pneumoperitoneum. The results showed that DP was significantly reduced, lung compliance was significantly improved, and the oxygenation index was more stable and significantly higher compared to the single-titration group. Ultimately, LUS scores and atelectasis incidence were significantly lower in the dynamic titration group at the end of surgery and extubation, with earlier extubation times. This indicates that adjusting PEEP post-pneumoperitoneum in the dynamic titration group aligns with the needs of laparoscopic surgery, where a higher PEEP is necessary to counteract the reduction in lung compliance caused by pneumoperitoneum [12]. Our data indicate that fixed PEEP is insufficient to prevent pneumoperitoneum-induced atelectasis and respiratory mechanics deterioration; however, we did not evaluate risks of overdistension, which remains an important consideration in lung-protective ventilation. Although the lung protection effect of individualized PEEP has been greatly improved [13], real-time dynamic adjustment of individualized PEEP is still needed to adapt to various changes during the perioperative period for more precise lung protection.

Current research on individualized PEEP remains limited to single titration, neglecting the impact of pneumoperitoneum establishment and changes in body position on respiratory physiology during the perioperative period [14]. Compared with single PEEP titration, dynamic adjustment of individualized PEEP (optimization at the beginning and end of pneumoperitoneum) significantly reduces DP (8.84 ± 2.31 vs. 10.00 ± 2.1 cmH2O), maintains higher lung compliance and stable oxygenation. The single titration group only temporarily improved alveolar recruitment through ARMs, but maintaining the original PEEP led to alveolar collapse again, increased DP, and continuous oxygenation decline. Dynamic adjustment avoids these issues by matching the pneumoperitoneum state in real-time [12], consistent with studies on elderly laparoscopic patients [15]. Additionally, the dynamic adjustment group had a lower incidence of postoperative atelectasis (32.3% vs. 61.3% after extubation) and shorter extubation times (28.81 ± 7.62 vs. 36.84 ± 6.67 min), confirming its perioperative lung protection advantages.

Due to their unique anatomy and physiology, children have low functional residual capacity, high closing capacity, and high oxygen consumption, making them more prone to perioperative atelectasis and hypoxemia, and more likely to develop severe respiratory complications [12,16–18].Lung ultrasound was selected for its high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (96%) in detecting perioperative atelectasis in children [16]. Atelectasis was defined as LUS score ≥ 2 (subpleural consolidation > 5 mm), a threshold validated to correlate with clinically significant gas exchange impairment [16]. In this study, the incidence of atelectasis after anesthesia induction in children without preoperative respiratory abnormalities was as high as 74.2 − 77.4%, consistent with previous studies [19]. Currently, the appropriate PEEP level for children remains undefined [18], with significant interindividual variability [20]. Children have high chest wall compliance and a significant tendency for airway closure, requiring higher PEEP (such as 8–10 cmH2O) to maintain alveolar opening [21]. However, high levels of PEEP may negatively affect hemodynamics, limiting PEEP settings [22]. In this study, the individualized PEEP value (8 cmH2O after pneumoperitoneum) was significantly higher than the traditional empirical value (4–5 cmH2O), with the highest individualized PEEP titration reaching 10 cmH2O. Notably, no significant fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate were observed, and patient hemodynamics remained stable throughout the titration process, consistent with existing literature [15]. The titration method guided by driving pressure is an ideal choice due to its simplicity, non-invasiveness, and association with reduced postoperative complications [23,24]. By optimizing driving pressure, this study achieved precise lung protection while mitigating the potential risks of high PEEP on circulation [25].

Although PEEP alone can improve intraoperative oxygenation, studies have demonstrated that combining alveolar recruitment maneuvers with PEEP more effectively improves oxygenation and reduces the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications compared to either method alone [4,18]. In our dynamic adjustment group, ARMs combined with PEEP titration after pneumoperitoneum corrected alveolar collapse and avoided barotrauma, restoring lung compliance to preoperative levels. Conversely, the single titration group exhibited lower postoperative lung compliance compared to baseline (23.63 ± 14.88 vs. 26.99 ± 16.48 mL/cmH2O). This suggests that simple recruitment maneuvers without dynamic PEEP adjustment may not adequately maintain alveolar stability. While some studies have optimized ventilation strategies hourly during surgery, the benefits and drawbacks of this approach require further validation through high-quality clinical trials [11,26]. Our study specifically optimized PEEP at the initiation of pneumoperitoneum, addressing the adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum on lung function at this critical stage.Continuing with the previous PEEP may not adequately open the lungs, and combining ARMs can maximize the reopening of collapsed alveoli. Appropriate PEEP levels subsequently maintain optimal alveolar expansion [27]. At the end of pneumoperitoneum, to prevent excessive alveolar distension and barotrauma from using high PEEP, the ventilation strategy should be re-optimized.

Limitations of this study include its single-center design and the use of decremental rather than incremental PEEP to determine the optimal PEEP. These two methods may yield different optimal PEEP values and driving pressures; however, there is currently insufficient robust clinical trial evidence to conclusively determine which method is superior. Additionally, our study did not investigate whether dynamic individualized PEEP can reduce lung injury by examining related inflammatory markers. We did not grade the severity of atelectasis beyond the semi-quantitative Lung Ultrasound Score, nor did we systematically collect data on postoperative pulmonary complications. Finally, we have not explored the frequency of dynamic PEEP adjustments during prolonged pneumoperitoneum, such as whether multiple optimizations are necessary during long surgeries and whether these adjustments could potentially cause additional lung injury. These issues warrant further investigation.

In conclusion, The dynamic driving pressure-guided individualized PEEP adjustment strategy effectively mitigates respiratory mechanics deterioration caused by laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum, reduces the risk of atelectasis, improves oxygenation, and promotes faster postoperative recovery without compromising circulatory stability. This approach offers a potential option for lung-protective ventilation in pediatric laparoscopic surgery and holds significant clinical value. Future research should verify its long-term benefits through multi-center studies and explore the potential of automated closed-loop titration systems.
