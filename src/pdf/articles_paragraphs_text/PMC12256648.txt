A diverse panel of 320 winter wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) genotypes was evaluated for yield‐related parameters under control and high night‐time temperature (HNT) stress using custom‐designed, movable field‐based heat tents over 2 years. Genome‐wide association mapping identified several significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across environments, with SNPs under HNT conditions, based on absolute trait values and stress tolerance indices, grouped into 19 HNT quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Additionally, significant SNPs identified under both (control and HNT) conditions contributed to seven condition‐independent QTLs. Thirteen haplotype blocks, derived from some of these QTLs, significantly influenced traits, with nine specific to HNT stress and four shared across conditions. Candidate gene mining identified 17 high‐confidence genes involved in the HNT response, including those encoding ATP‐dependent RNA helicase, GCN5‐related N‐acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase FAD/NAD(P)‐binding, RNA recognition motif, and sugar/inositol transporter. Gene‐based haplotype analysis identified four haplotypes with significant differences under HNT conditions and one block with differences under both conditions. For instance, Hap1TraesCS1A02G305700exhibited higher biomass and spike number under HNT, Hap1TraesCS2B02G599800showed higher biomass under HNT, and Hap2TraesCS4B02G264300demonstrated higher biomass under both conditions. This study elucidates the genetic control of traits contributing to HNT stress responses in wheat, supporting the selection of lines with favorable alleles for crosses and enabling marker‐assisted and genomic selections for HNT stress tolerance. The identified candidate genes and haplotypes provide valuable targets for functional validation, breeding strategies, and gene‐editing approaches to enhance HNT resilience in wheat.

These findings can support breeding programs in developing wheat varieties that sustain high yields despite warm nights.

Bread wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) serves as a crucial staple grain, providing a significant portion of the world's population with essential calories. Global wheat yield is increasing at just 0.9% annually, significantly below the 2.4% required to double production by 2050, which may result in only a 38% increase, which is insufficient to meet projected demand (Ray et al.,2013). As we strive to meet the demands of a growing population, the changing climate poses a significant risk to the future productivity of important staple crops like wheat. Since the pre‐industrial era, the global average surface temperature has increased by 1°C, and projections suggest it will rise by an additional 0.2°C per decade, with average warming anticipated to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 (Ogunbode et al.,2020). Studies indicate that with every degree rise in global mean temperature, there will be corresponding decreases in yields of wheat, rice (Oryza sativaL.), maize (Zea maysL.), and soybean (Glycine max(L.) Merr.) by 6%, 3.2%, 7.4%, and 3.1%, respectively, posing a significant threat to food security (Zhao et al.,2017). Retrospective analyses have indicated that night temperature has risen at a faster pace than day temperature in recent decades (Alexander et al.,2006; Sillmann, Kharin, Zhang, et al.,2013). Multi‐model ensembles project a higher increase in the frequency of warm nights compared to hot days, suggesting ongoing asymmetric warming (Sillmann, Kharin, Zwiers, et al.,2013).

Warm nights have been observed in different cropping regions, predominantly in temperate regions, including the Argentinean Pampas and the Australian wheat belt in the Southern Hemisphere (Alexander et al.,2007; Fernández‐Long et al.,2013), as well as in the North American wheat belt and Central and South Asia in the Northern Hemisphere (Klein Tank et al.,2006; Vincent & Mekis,2006). Consequently, most of the crops, including wheat, are presently exposed to, and are likely to continue to face, warm nights during their growing seasons. This rapid nocturnal temperature increase poses a considerable challenge for maintaining crop yields, impacting wheat (Hein et al.,2019; Impa et al.,2020; Kundu et al.,2024), rice (Bahuguna et al.,2017; S. Peng et al.,2004; Sharma et al.,2025), and barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) (García et al.,2016;2018), among others. Selecting and/or breeding for resilience to high day‐time temperature (HDT) stress will not compensate for losses induced by high night‐time temperature (HNT), given the distinctiveness in adaptive mechanisms for these two conditions (Impa et al.,2021; Prasad et al.,2008; Shi et al.,2017).

In wheat, the post‐flowering period is particularly vulnerable to HNT, which accelerates senescence, shortens grain‐filling duration, and reduces yield and quality by up to 4% per degree Celsius increase (García et al.,2016; Hein et al.,2020). Contrastingly, some studies suggest that HNT during early spring delays senescence, enhancing grain‐filling rate and duration (Djanaguiraman et al.,2020). While wheat can adapt to HDT by initiating flowering early in the morning to escape or employ transpiration cooling (Aiqing et al.,2018; Jagadish,2020), it lacks similar mechanisms to counteract the adverse effects of HNT. Studies conducted both in controlled environments and field settings have shown that HDT stress adversely affects reproductive processes in wheat, leading to spikelet sterility (Bergkamp et al.,2018; Bheemanahalli et al.,2019; Mirosavljević et al.,2021). Surprisingly, subjecting wheat to HNT from panicle initiation to physiological maturity in field conditions did not significantly increase spikelet sterility or reduce grain number compared to HDT (Narayanan et al.,2015). However, any decrease in grain number could result from fewer spikes per square meter, potentially leading to a 7% reduction in grain yield per degree Celsius increase in night temperature (García et al.,2015).

Based on extensive literature, it is concluded that the accelerated growth rate induced by post‐flowering HDT stress fails to compensate for the reduction in growth duration, ultimately leading to decreased dry‐matter accumulation (B. Liu et al.,2020; Ullah et al.,2022). Reductions in biomass accumulation due to HNT have also been observed in wheat experiments conducted across controlled environment chambers, with reductions ranging from 2% to 46% (Impa et al.,2019; Narayanan et al.,2015; Posch et al.,2022; Prasad et al.,2008) and field‐based studies (with reductions ranging from 8.5% to 23.4%; García et al.,2015; Parveen et al.,2022). However, some studies suggest that HNT promotes wheat biomass accumulation by increasing tillering, grains per spike, photosynthetic activity, and/or pre‐anthesis respiration (Y. Fan, Qin, et al.,2024; Lazăr & Lazăr,2010; G. Xiao et al.,2010). Similarly, a meta‐analysis by Jing et al. (2016) found that HNT exposure during vegetative stages in rice accelerated development without adversely affecting total biomass. Also, rice exposed to HNT during vegetative stage exhibits significant leaf blade growth stimulation compared to lower temperature, leading to higher biomass accumulation (Kanno et al.,2009). These findings highlight a lack of consensus regarding the effects of HNT on biomass accumulation and effective tillers/spikes per unit area. Overall, these findings suggest that while trait mapping has made strides in addressing HDT stress in wheat, the same strategies may not directly translate to mitigating HNT stress.

Furthermore, genetic mapping for traits contributing to HNT tolerance will require the evaluation of a large number of genotypes under HNT stress conditions. Previous studies on HNT stress in wheat mainly utilized controlled environment growth chambers (Impa et al.,2019;2020; Narayanan et al.,2015) or small chambers under field conditions (García et al.,2015,2016). However, these facilities struggled to capture large genetic diversity and faced challenges such as variations in light, wind speed, and humidity compared to field conditions. Until 2019, there was no large mobile infrastructure for imposing controlled HNT stress on crops. We addressed this by developing a field‐based prototype for winter wheat (Hein et al.,2019) and subsequently a scaled‐up version incorporating an advanced cyber‐physical system to apply post‐anthesis HNT stress until physiological maturity (Hein et al.,2020), enabling phenotyping under real‐world field conditions. On the other hand, genome‐wide association study (GWAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for unraveling the genetic architecture of complex traits, especially with the advent of high‐density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and next‐generation sequencing technologies (Saini et al.,2022). Moreover, GWAS is highly efficient at identifying numerous natural allelic variations across diverse individuals, surpassing traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods (X. Huang & Han,2014; Saini et al.,2025).

A panel of 320 winter wheat genotypes was assessed under control and high night‐time temperature (HNT) stress.

Genome‐wide association mapping revealed significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to HNT response, grouped into 19 HNT‐specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs).

Thirteen haplotype blocks significantly influenced traits, with nine specific to HNT and four shared across conditions.

These findings can support breeding programs in developing wheat varieties that sustain high yields despite warm nights.

Over 2500 genes/QTLs/meta‐QTLs/marker‐trait associations have been identified in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat through various approaches, including GWAS and interval mapping, covering traits related to HDT stress (WheatQTLdb,http://www.wheatqtldb.net/; S. Kumar et al.,2024,2021; Singh et al.,2022). However, HNT stress in wheat has received limited attention. In a previous study, we conducted GWAS on a diverse indica rice panel, identifying 20 significant SNPs associated with HNT tolerance traits, and prioritized 20 causal genes through network‐based models based on their expression patterns under HNT stress (Bheemanahalli, Knight, et al.,2021). By contrast, the genetic basis of HNT tolerance in wheat remains largely unexplored, with only one study on spring wheat (Kahlon et al.,2024) identifying 19 QTLs for yield‐related traits under greenhouse conditions. However, controlled environments like greenhouses create microclimates distinct from field conditions, limiting the applicability of these findings (Langstroff et al.,2022). Further, this study prioritized candidate genes (CGs) based on functional domains associated with HDT stress and tissue‐specific expression under HDT conditions. However, since the tolerance mechanisms for HNT and HDT are shown to differ (Impa et al.,2021; Prasad et al.,2008; Shi et al.,2017), the selected genes may not be suitable candidates for HNT tolerance. Furthermore, no superior haplotypes were identified that could be utilized for haplotype‐assisted forward breeding.

This study seeks to address these gaps by identifying key QTLs, CGs, and haplotypes associated with HNT tolerance under field conditions, facilitating the development of resilient wheat varieties suited to current and future climates. Specifically, a Hard Winter Wheat Association Mapping Panel (HWWAMP) was phenotyped for yield‐related traits such as spike number, spike weight, and plant biomass per unit area using custom‐designed, movable, field‐based heat tents. The specific objectives of this study were to (i) measure the phenotypic responses of wheat genotypes for various yield traits under both control and HNT conditions; (ii) identify QTLs and superior haplotypes linked to yield traits under both conditions, and assess the overlap of genetic loci across environments; (iii) evaluate the effects of individual and combined alleles on traits; and (iv) identify and prioritize CGs and CG‐based haplotypes contributing to natural variation for HNT tolerance in wheat.

A total of 320 genotypes were considered for this study, comprising winter wheat genotypes that are part of the HWWAMP (consisting of 299 winter wheat genotypes developed under the USDA Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project [TCAP]), as well as wheat varieties extensively grown in Kansas, breeding lines from the Kansas Wheat Breeding Program, and exotic accessions previously demonstrated to exhibit differential responses to heat stress (Guttieri et al.,2015; Hein et al.,2019,2020). HWWAMP includes 258 hard red and 41 hard white winter wheat types, comprising landraces, advanced breeding lines, and varieties developed between 1874 and 2014 through public and private breeding programs across Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas (Grogan et al.,2016). Additional information regarding the HWWAMP genotypes can be found in the T3/Wheat database (https://triticeaetoolbox.org/wheat/).

Custom‐designed and movable tents were utilized to evaluate the winter wheat genotypes. Details regarding field infrastructure, temperature control system, and operation of the tents, along with stress impositions, have already been provided (Hein et al.,2020). In brief, these tents, measuring 9.1 m wide, 14.6 m long, and 4.4 m tall, feature 1.9‐m‐tall sidewalls joined by vertical trusses and are mounted on 15.2‐m‐long skids for effortless relocation via tractor. To regulate temperature, motorized roll‐up systems (Advancing Alternatives) are installed on sidewalls, end walls, and roofs, enabling ventilation control to mitigate HDT. Additionally, heating systems equipped with propane heaters (Modine HDB100 Hot Dawg propane heaters; Ferguson Plumbing and Heating), convection tubing, and circulation fans facilitate temperature adjustment within the tents. Control tents with similar setups but without heat imposition serve as comparison environments, utilizing power tube fans and convection tubing to replicate air movement observed in stress tents. Electricity is supplied by a centrally located electric generator (Caterpillar XQ30 electric generator; Foley Power Solutions), with diesel tanks and distribution systems ensuring power availability to each tent. The thermostat controller system, comprising a Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi Foundation), six MCP9808 temperature sensors (Adafruit), and one DS3231 Real‐Time Clock module (Adafruit), monitors the temperature in real‐time within each tent. It employs wireless transmission to ensure consistent conditions are maintained across both control and stress environments.

HNT stress was applied at night (from 8:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.), after 50% anthesis, and continued until physiological maturity. During this period, the tents were sealed, heaters activated, and stress levels monitored wirelessly, and the system was shut down in the morning. Multiple sensor sets tracked temperature, relative humidity, and CO2levels inside the tents, providing comprehensive data for detailed analysis. The system recorded a 0.6°C differential between six temperature sensors within the stress tents. HOBO UA 002–64 Pendent data loggers confirmed uniform heat distribution, measuring a 0.2°C temperature difference at any given time within both control and stress tents. Genotypes in stress tents were exposed to HNT conditions, averaging +3.8°C compared to the average night‐time temperature of the control tents (Hein,2022; Hein et al.,2020). The average temperature during the stress period was 22.1°C in the stress tents and 18.4°C in the control tents. Temperature divergence started at 6:00 p.m., reaching +2.8°C and +3.5°C by 7 and 8:00 p.m., respectively, and maintained at ∼3.8°C from 10:00 p.m. until the stress imposition ended the next morning and tents were opened at 6:00 a.m. (Hein,2022; Hein et al.,2020).

A total of six custom‐designed movable tents (three control tents and three heat tents), located at the Kansas State University Agronomy North Farm in Manhattan, KS (39° 12′ 47.3″ N, 96° 35′ 35.0″ W), were utilized. Each tent consisted of eight blocks accommodating all 320 genotypes, with 40 rows per block. Each genotype was planted in a single row across three control and HNT stress replications in the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 seasons. The tent space measured 8.2 m × 10.7 m, with each block containing 40 rows, spaced 19.1 cm apart and with a 0.5‐m alley between blocks. Trenches were dug to a depth of 3.8 cm using a tool with eight equally spaced prongs to ensure uniform depth and spacing throughout the blocks and tents. Seeds were hand‐planted at a rate of 88 seeds per row or 383 seeds/m2, equivalent to 4.45 million seeds per ha, after treatment with a seed mixture. Prior to planting each year, 47.07 kg N/ha of urea ammonium nitrate solution was applied. Post‐planting, 0.88 L/ha of MCPA herbicide and 2.19 cL/ha of Finesse Cereal and Fallow herbicide were applied, followed by 57.16 kg N/ha of urea ammonium nitrate solution. Additionally, 0.49 L/ha of Approach Prima fungicide was applied to manage Fusarium head blight. The stress period started when nearly all genotypes reached 50% anthesis, with only a 12‐day difference between the earliest and latest flowering genotypes (data not shown), and continued until physiological maturity. Optimal water levels, maintained through irrigation and rainfall, prevented water‐limited stress throughout both seasons.

Spike numbers per line were recorded by counting the spikes in each row. Additionally, a 0.5 m central strip of each genotype was hand‐harvested at physiological maturity (Feekes 11.4). Spikes were separated from the stem and dried at 40°C for 96 h, while the biomass (all plant parts except spikes) was dried separately at 60°C for 168 h. Spike weight was measured, and the dried biomass was then combined with the spike weight (excluding grains) to determine the total biomass.

Furthermore, the broad‐sense heritability (H2) for the three traits under control and HNT stress was estimated separately for both years as follows:H2=σ2g/(σ2g+σ2e/nRep), whereσ2gandσ2eare the estimated genotype and residual variance components, respectively, andnRepis the number of replicates.

Incorporating stress tolerance indices (STIs) alongside absolute trait values enhances trait mapping by integrating performance across control and stress environments, capturing genotype × environment (G × E) interactions, minimizing environmental noise, and improving the detection of adaptive QTLs linked to resilience and stability (Fernandez,1992; MajidiMehr et al.,2024). Therefore, STIs for different genotypes were also calculated using the iPASTIC toolkit (Pour‐Aboughadareh et al.,2019), which utilizes the following formula: (YS×YP)/(XP)2, whereYPis the trait value under control conditions,YSis the trait value under HNT conditions, andXPis the grand mean of the trait in the control environment.

Overlapping histograms were generated for trait data collected over two growing seasons using the R package “ggplot” (https://cran.r‐project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html). Additionally, the estimated BLUEs were used to calculate correlations for various combinations between (i) traits within and across environments and (ii) the same traits across different environments. Correlation analysis was performed using the “corrplot” package (https://cran.r‐project.org/web/packages/corrplot/index.html) in R. Further, the percentage changes in phenotypic values under HNT stress compared to the control were calculated to assess its impact on the phenotypic performance of the genotypes.

Winter wheat genotypes used in the study were previously genotyped using the wheat Infinium 90K iSelect array (Illumina Inc.) as part of the USDA–TCAP initiative. Genotypic data were acquired from the T3 Toolbox (https://wheat.triticeaetoolbox.org/). The dataset was filtered to exclude SNPs with >10% heterozygosity, over 30% missing data, and a minor allele frequency of <5%. Following filtration, the genotypic dataset comprised 15,913 high‐quality SNPs, which were subsequently imputed using TASSEL v5.0 (Bradbury et al.,2007). The physical positions of these imputed high‐quality SNP markers were retrieved from the IWGSCv1.0 genome assembly, accessible at Wheat‐URGI (https://wheat‐urgi.versailles.inra.fr/). SNPs that were unassigned to any chromosomes were eliminated, as were those lacking physical positions. Ultimately, 261 genotypes were selected for further analysis based on the availability of high‐quality genotypic data and the presence of phenotypic data across both treatments and years.

The imputed genotypic data were utilized for principal component analysis (PCA) in R to investigate population structure, using the Genomic Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) version 3.0 (J. Wang & Zhang,2021). Population structure was also assessed using STRUCTURE version 2.3.4, a Bayesian model‐based clustering program assuming an admixture model (Pritchard et al.,2000). Ten subgroups (K= 1–10) were analyzed, with each undergoing five independent runs. Each run included a burn‐in period of 10,000 iterations followed by 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations. To determine the most probable number of subpopulations, an ad hoc statistic (i.e., DeltaK) was utilized, which assessed the rate of change in log probability across successive K‐values (Evanno et al.,2005) with STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl & VonHoldt,2012).

Genome‐wide association analyses were conducted using a panel of 261 genotypes with physically anchored high‐quality SNPs to identify significant SNPs associated with different traits across nine conditions under two scenarios: (i) using absolute trait values (Control_2018‐2019, Control_2019‐2020, Control_combined, HNT_2018‐2019, HNT_2019‐2020, and HNT_combined) and (ii) using STI values of genotypes (STI_2018‐19, STI_2019‐20, and STI_combined). Initially, we employed three different single‐locus and three multi‐locus GWAS algorithms: single‐locus models including generalized linear model (Price et al.,2006), mixed linear model (Yu et al.,2006), and compressed mixed linear model (Z. Zhang et al.,2010); and multi‐locus models including multi‐locus mixed linear model (Segura et al.,2012), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU; X. Liu et al.,2016), and Bayesian‐information and linkage‐disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (M. Huang et al.,2019). FarmCPU outperformed the other five methods in controllingp‐value inflation (as visualized by quantile–quantile plots) and in detecting significant SNPs that overlapped with known loci. Therefore, we selected FarmCPU to report the GWAS results in this study. Previous studies utilizing the HWWAMP panel and genotypic data from the wheat Infinium 90K iSelect array also concluded that FarmCPU outperforms other GWAS algorithms (AlTameemi et al.,2021; Halder et al.,2023). FarmCPU, an improved multiple‐locus model, effectively controls false positives by incorporating the associated markers identified from iterations as cofactors for marker tests within a fixed‐effect model (X. Liu et al.,2016; Saini et al.,2022).

FarmCPU‐based GWAS analysis was performed using the GAPIT version 3.0 in the R environment (J. Wang & Zhang,2021). Additionally, to address population structure, the first two principal components were included based on visual examination of the scree plot, the DeltaK statistic from STRUCTURE analysis, and PCA results obtained from PCA analysis. The Bonferroni correction‐based threshold for declaring a significant association is generally considered overly stringent because it accounts for all SNPs in the dataset rather than independent tests. Therefore, many studies opt for either an exploratory threshold or a corrected Bonferroni threshold based on independent tests (AlTameemi et al.,2021; Bheemanahalli, Wang, et al.,2021; Halder et al.,2023; Kaur et al.,2023; Reddy et al.,2023). In our study, we utilized an exploratory threshold of −log10(P) = 3.00, which is generally considered appropriate for a multi‐locus model that typically does not require multiple corrections (Y. M. Zhang, Jia, et al.,2019). Significant SNPs that passed the threshold were categorized as (i)multi‐trait SNPsassociated with two or more traits under a condition; (ii) SNPs detected in at least two control environments (absolute values); (iii) SNPs identified using both absolute values (control) and indices. SNPs from categories (ii) and (iii) were grouped asQTLs under control; (iv) SNPs detected in at least two HNT environments (absolute values); (v) SNPs identified using both absolute values (HNT) and indices. SNPs from categories (iv) and (v) were grouped asHNT QTLs; and (vi) SNPs identified using both absolute values (control and HNT) and indices, grouped ascondition‐independent QTLs.

Alleles from significant SNPs clustered within HNT QTL and environment‐independent QTL regions, identified through post‐GWAS analysis, were used to assess their effects on the traits of interest. For each significant SNP, trait values for two groups of alleles (favorable and unfavorable) were compared using two‐tailedt‐tests. We also aimed to analyze the impact of accumulated favorable alleles on trait phenotypes. Genotypes were grouped based on the alleles of significant SNPs identified for different traits, considering all significant SNPs for each trait collectively. Groups were compared using the “ggstatsplot” R package (Patil,2021) with the WelchF‐test to identify significant differences between means, addressing unequal variances effectively (Delacre et al.,2019). Following this, the Games–Howell test, a post hoc analysis similar to Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) but not assuming equal variances or sample sizes, was used to identify significantly different means (S. Lee & Lee,2018).

Furthermore, the significant SNPs clustered within HNT QTL and environment‐independent QTL regions were utilized for detecting QTL‐based haplotypes. To generate and visualize linkage disequilibrium (LD)‐based haplotypes in specific regions, Haploview version 4.2 software (Barrett et al.,2005) was used. The wheat genotypes were grouped according to the identified haplotypes. Trait data for each haplotype were analyzed using the “ggstatsplot” R package (Patil,2021) to test the statistical significance of effect sizes, utilizing the WelchF‐test and Games–Howell test, as mentioned above. For this analysis, combined phenotypic datasets (Control_combined and HNT_combined) were utilized.

A common approach for identifying CGs associated with significant SNPs is either to mine gene models within the LD regions of the SNPs on different chromosomes separately (Gudi et al.,2023; Pang et al.,2020) or to mine CGs in fixed genomic regions surrounding the SNPs (Halder et al.,2023; Kaur et al.,2023). In the present study, gene models located within 1 Mb upstream and downstream of the peak positions of both HNT‐specific and condition‐independent QTLs were extracted using the BioMart tool from the EnsemblPlants database (http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html), based on the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 genome assembly of wheat. Functional annotations of the gene models were conducted based on the domains found in their corresponding protein sequences, obtained from the InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).

Once genes are identified, candidates for each locus are typically prioritized by examining their functional roles reported in the available literature and conducting in silico expression analyses using transcriptomics datasets generated under targeted stress conditions. However, research on genes influencing the genetic architecture of traits under HNT stress in wheat is limited, and no expression databases provide in silico data for wheat tissues under HNT. Therefore, we employed a different yet more reliable approach to prioritize high‐confidence CGs. A cross‐species genomic analysis was first conducted, focusing on transcriptomics and genetic studies on HNT in rice (Bheemanahalli, Knight, et al.,2021; Desai et al.,2021; J. Fan, Zhang, et al.,2024; Glaubitz et al.,2017; A. Kumar et al.,2021; Liao et al.,2015; Yang et al.,2024). This analysis explored whether orthologs of the identified genes regulate HNT responses in the mentioned rice studies and compared their functional annotations with those of previously characterized rice genes. Next, the expression patterns of the shortlisted gene models were examined using the WheatOmics database (http://wheatomics.sdau.edu.cn/) across various developmental stages, along with an analysis of transcript abundance in the target tissue. The shortlisted gene models were subjected to CG‐based haplotype analysis. For this, we considered the SNPs available within each gene and developed haplotypes based on their allelic variations across genotypes. Wheat genotypes were grouped according to the identified haplotypes, and trait data for each haplotype were analyzed using the “ggstatsplot” R package to assess the statistical significance of effect sizes, utilizing the WelchF‐test and Games–Howell test. Gene structures for the targeted CGs were retrieved from the EnsemblPlants database.

All traits under control and HNT conditions exhibited a broad range of phenotypic variations, with continuous, near‐normal distributions across both years (TableS1; Figure1). The histograms showed overlapping patterns with shifts toward lower values under stress. Under HNT stress, wheat genotypes showed 4.2%–13.6% reductions in biomass, 6.7%–14.4% fewer spikes, and 12.1%–13.4% decreases in spike weight compared to the control, across different years (FigureS1). Combined ANOVA revealed highly significant genotype effects for all three traits, along with significant treatment × genotype and year × treatment × genotype interactions (TableS2). The coefficient of variation (CV%) for each trait varied across environments (TableS3). All traits exhibited moderate to high broad‐sense heritability, ranging from 0.56 to 0.81 under HNT conditions and 0.61 to 0.85 under control conditions, with spike number showing the highest values across years (TableS3). Significant positive correlations (P< 0.001) were observed between traits within and across years, with slightly stronger correlations under HNT conditions compared to control. Similarly, significant correlations (P< 0.001) were found between the same traits across different conditions (TableS4). The STIs indicated variation in trait distribution among genotypes across years, with biomass ranging from 0.25 (2019–2020) to 3.84 (2018–2019), spike number from 0.28 (2018–2019) to 2.09 (2019–2020), and spike weight from 0.30 to 1.98 (2019–2020) (TableS5).

Overlapping histograms showing the distribution of (A–C) biomass, spike number, and spike weight per unit area in wheat genotypes under control and high night‐time temperature (HNT) stress during 2018–2019, and (D–F) the same traits during 2019–2020. Dark gray columns represent phenotypic data under control conditions, white columns under HNT stress, and light gray areas indicate an overlap between the two conditions.

Genotypic data for 261 genotypes, consisting of 16,058 SNPs, were obtained from the T3 wheat database. After filtering out 145 SNPs with an MAF < 5% and 3,632 SNPs without chromosomal assignments or physical positions, 12,281 high‐quality SNP markers were retained for further analysis. These SNPs covered approximately 13,424 Mbp across all 21 wheat chromosomes, with an average marker density of one SNP per 1.09 Mbp. The sub‐genomes A, B, and D contained 4,649, 5,234, and 2,398 SNP markers, respectively. Marker distribution per chromosome ranged from 47 markers on 7D to 1,041 markers on 5B (TableS6). PCA indicated substantial genotype admixture, with the first two PCs explaining the majority of the variance (FigureS2A). The DeltaK statistic from the STRUCTURE analysis revealed a single peak atK= 2, suggesting the presence of two subgroups within the association panel (FigureS2B).

Genome‐wide association mapping identified 479 significant SNPs, with some SNPs detected multiple times, linked to three traits across nine conditions: (i) 46 SNPs under control_2018‐2019, (ii) 70 SNPs under control_2019‐2020, (iii) 42 SNPs under control_combined, (iv) 34 SNPs under HNT_2018‐2019, (v) 109 SNPs under HNT_2019‐2020, (vi) 26 SNPs under HNT_combined, (vii) 40 SNPs under STI_2018‐19, (viii) 67 SNPs under STI_2019‐20, and (ix) 45 SNPs under STI_combined (Table1). These SNPs were distributed across all wheat chromosomes (except 7D), with a minimum of 5 SNPs located each on 5B and 5D and a maximum of 109 SNPs detected on 4B (TableS7). The number of significant SNPs also varied by trait (Table1). Of the 479 SNPs, nine were linked to multiple traits in the same environment, such as BS00012081_51, which was associated with spike weight and biomass under HNT in 2018–2019 (TableS8). Overall, a total of 158 SNPs were associated with traits under control conditions, 169 SNPs under HNT conditions, and 152 SNPs were identified using STIs.

Abbreviations: HNT, high night temperature; STI, stress tolerance index.

A total of 29 unique SNPs were detected in at least two control conditions (absolute values), while 24 unique SNPs were identified using both absolute trait values (under control) and STIs, resulting in 20 control QTLs (Q1–Q20) (TableS9). In a similar manner, two unique SNPs were detected in at least two HNT conditions (absolute values), and 37 unique SNPs were identified using both absolute trait values (under HNT) and STIs, leading to the identification of 19 HNT QTLs (Q21–Q39) (Table2). Furthermore, 28 SNPs were identified using both absolute trait values (under both control and HNT conditions) and STIs, which were grouped into seven condition‐independent QTLs (Table2). Among the 19 HNT QTLs, five were associated with biomass, five with spike number, and two with spike weight. Seven QTLs were linked to two or more traits:Q24to biomass and spike number,Q27,Q32,Q34, andQ36to biomass and spike weight,Q22to spike number and weight, andQ31to all three traits. The −log10(P) values for these QTLs ranged from 3.02 to 7.67 (Table2). Among the seven condition‐independent QTLs, two (Q42andQ46) were associated with biomass, four (Q40,Q41,Q44, andQ45) were associated with both biomass and spike weight, and one QTL (Q43) was linked to all three traits. The −log10(P) values for these QTLs ranged from 3.02 to 9.77 (Table2).

High night‐time temperature (HNT) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and condition‐independent QTLs are identified in the present study.

Abbreviations: SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms; STI: stress tolerance index.

The study also examined how different alleles of SNPs within various HNT and condition‐independent QTLs influence trait variation. Two‐tailedt‐tests revealed significant mean trait differences for most SNPs in HNT and condition‐independent QTLs (P≤ 0.001), except for a few SNPs in some QTLs (TableS10). The frequency of favorable alleles across different loci ranged from 8.81% to 94.25%, with over 60% of loci showing favorable alleles in <50% of the genotypes (TableS10). Genotypes were further grouped based on the number of favorable alleles per trait to evaluate their cumulative effect. In some cases, significant SNPs clustered in proximal QTLs showed similar distributions of favorable and non‐favorable alleles among genotypes (TableS10). For biomass, the mean trait value was 55.1 g without any favorable allele. The presence of one favorable allele increased the mean to 67.9 g, reaching 98.5 g with 33 favorable alleles. However, the increase in mean value was not linear with the number of favorable alleles; for instance, no consistent rise was observed when the number of favorable alleles increased from 10 to 20 (Figure2A). A similar pattern was observed for spike number, with mean values increasing from 77.9 (no favorable alleles) to 112.1 (18 alleles), though additional alleles did not always correspond to higher trait values (Figure2B). For spike weight, the mean value increased from 61.4 g (no favorable alleles) to 69.5 g with one favorable allele, peaking at 83.4 g with 22–23 favorable alleles (Figure2C).

Effect of accumulating favorable alleles from high night‐time temperature (HNT) and condition‐independent quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on various traits: (A) plant biomass; (B) spike number; (C) spike weight. Joint effect analysis included QTLs detected in at least two HNT conditions (Q21,Q22,Q23,Q24,Q28,Q31,Q32,Q33,Q34,Q36, andQ39) and those found in both CNT (control) and HNT across at least two environments each (Q42). Thex‐axis represents favorable allele count, and they‐axis represents the corresponding phenotypic value. In some cases, significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) clustered in proximal QTLs showed similar distribution of favorable and non‐favorable alleles among genotypes. For instance, in panel (A), alleles 12–20 exhibited identical patterns across the genotypes. Significantly different groups are indicated with asterisks (above the boxplots) based on the Games–Howell post hoc test:*P≤ 0.05,**P≤ 0.01, and***P≤ 0.001.

Initially, all significant SNPs from 19 HNT and 7 condition‐independent QTLs were considered for haplotype analysis. Some SNPs were not in LD with others, while some were in LD with only one SNP, leading to their exclusion. Nine haplotype blocks with 48 unique SNPs from nine HNT QTLs were identified, eight of which showed significant associations with trait variations under HNT conditions (P‐values < 0.05 to < 0.001) (TableS11). Five haplotype blocks were identified from five of the seven condition‐independent QTLs, with four showing significant associations under both conditions and one only under HNT. Some multi‐trait QTLs resulted in haplotype blocks linked to multiple traits, though not all associations were significant (TableS11).

Some of the key haplotypes are as follows: (i) TheQ24‐based haplotype block (involving four SNPs within the 498,536,695–498,048,808 bp region) associated with biomass and spike number had three haplotypes (Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3), occurring at frequencies of 19.2%, 64.4%, and 12.6%, respectively. Hap2 exhibited the highest average biomass (69.2 g) and spike number (90.2), while Hap3 had the lowest biomass (59.9 g) and spike number (78.1) under HNT conditions (TableS11). (ii) TheQ31‐based haplotype block on chromosome 4B (involving 12 SNPs within the 14,110,534–14,124,098 bp region), linked to all three traits, had three haplotypes with frequencies of 30.7%, 43.3%, and 25.3% (Figure3A). Hap2 showed the highest average biomass (70.8 g), spike number (89.4), and spike weight (71.3), whereas Hap1 had the lowest biomass (61.7 g), spike number (83.7), and spike weight (64.5) under HNT conditions (Figure3B–D). (iii) Another haplotype block on chromosome 4B (involving nine SNPs within the 534,736,640–535,085,059 bp region), based on a condition‐independent QTL (i.e.,Q42), included three haplotypes (Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3), occurring at frequencies of 26.2%, 64.2%, and 8.1%, respectively (Figure3A). Hap3 had the highest average biomass (85.7 g under control; 80.0 g under HNT), followed by Hap1 (81.8 g under control; 74.6 g under HNT) and Hap2 (67.0 g under control; 61.0 g under HNT). These superior and inferior haplotypes were significantly different from each other, mostly atP< 0.001 (Figure3E,F).

An in silico search within QTL regions identified 766 gene models: 623 associated with HNT QTLs and 143 associated with condition‐independent QTLs. Among the 766 gene models, 652 had functional annotations, while 114 were uncharacterized (TableS12). These gene models were unevenly distributed across the different chromosomes, with the minimum number of genes (15) on 4A and the maximum number (115) on 6A (TableS12). Several gene models with similar functional descriptions were repeatedly identified across different QTL regions, including 36 F‐box domain proteins, 33 protein kinases, 15 BTB/POZ domain proteins, 15 cytochrome P450s, 12 glycoside hydrolases, 12 SANT/Myb domain proteins, 12 zinc finger proteins, and 10 RNA recognition motif domain proteins (TableS12).

Wheat–rice comparative genomics analysis identified 176 gene models as potential contributors to HNT response, showing functional similarities to previously characterized HNT stress genes in rice (TableS12). Expression patterns across different wheat tissues narrowed this list to 44 genes with at least 2 TPM expression in one tissue. Among these, 17 genes (13 from HNT QTLs and four from condition‐independent QTLs) were designated as high‐confidence CGs based on two criteria: (i) very high expression in target tissues, such as spikes for genes available from HNT QTL linked to spike weight and (ii) highly effective under HNT stress response based on corresponding rice gene studies. These 17 genes encode key proteins, including ATP‐dependent RNA helicase DEAD‐box, GCN5‐related N‐acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase FAD/NAD(P)‐binding, protein kinases, ribose 5‐phosphate isomerase, RNA recognition motif domain proteins, and sugar/inositol transporters (Table3). The expression patterns of these selected high‐confidence CGs across various tissues are shown in FigureS3.

Of the 17 genes analyzed for haplotypes, six were excluded due to lack of SNPs or having only one SNP. Six genes with two to four SNPs each resulted in the identification of six gene‐based haplotype blocks (TableS13). Haplotypes from four blocks (based on genesTraesCS1A02G305700,TraesCS2B02G599800,TraesCS2B02G600200, andTraesCS3B02G089200) showed significant differences under HNT conditions, while one block (based onTraesCS4B02G264300) exhibited significant differences under both control and HNT conditions (P‐values < 0.05 to < 0.001). In contrast, another block showed no significant difference in either condition (TableS13). Focusing on the haplotype block based onTraesCS1A02G305700, two haplotypes were identified: Hap1TraesCS1A02G305700and Hap2TraesCS1A02G305700, with frequencies of 68.2% and 31.8%, respectively. Hap1 exhibited higher biomass (68.8 g) and spike number (89.6), while Hap2 recorded lower biomass (60.8 g) and spike number (81.7) under HNT conditions (Figure4A). Similarly, theTraesCS4B02G264300block comprised two haplotypes: Hap1TraesCS4B02G264300and Hap2TraesCS4B02G264300, with frequencies of 64% and 34.1%. Here, Hap2 demonstrated higher biomass (82.7 g under control and 75.9 g under HNT), whereas Hap1 had lower biomass (67.0 g under control and 61.0 g under HNT) (Figure4B).

Representative gene‐based haplotypes identified in this study: (A)TraesCS1A02G305700, located in theQ24region, encodes an oxidoreductase FAD/NAD(P)‐binding protein. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within its genic region were used to develop two haplotypes, whose effects on biomass and spike number under high night‐time temperature (HNT) are presented. (B)TraesCS4B02G264300, found in theQ42region, encodes a GCN5‐related N‐acetyltransferase protein. Four SNPs within its genic region were used to create two haplotypes, with their effects on biomass under both control (CNT) and HNT conditions shown. Gene structures were retrieved from the EnsemblPlants database (https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html). *P≤ 0.05, **P≤ 0.01, *P≤ 0.001.

Adapting crop yield to climate change is crucial for food security and environmental sustainability. Understanding crop responses to environmental variations is essential for effective adaptation strategies (Lobell,2014; Raza et al.,2019). Studies in controlled and field environments have shown significant wheat yield losses under HNT conditions (Hein et al.,2019,2020; Impa et al.,2019,2020,2021; Narayanan et al.,2015; Prasad et al.,2008). Grain yield relies on the combined effects of traits like spike and grain characteristics, and breeders are keen to identify novel genes and QTLs linked to these traits. The genetic basis of yield traits contributing to HNT tolerance in wheat remains largely unexplored, with only one recent study (Kahlon et al.,2024) available, which was not conducted under field conditions. To address this gap, we investigated the genetics of key yield‐contributing traits, including biomass, spike number, and spike weight, under HNT stress using a diverse panel from US Great Plains hard winter wheat programs. This panel, carefully curated by breeders in the region, includes genotypes significant in production or foundational to contemporary germplasm pedigrees (Grogan et al.,2016).

Wheat genotypes exhibited significant variation in all traits under control and HNT conditions, with HNT stress leading to marked reductions in biomass, spike number, and spike weight, consistent with previous studies (García et al.,2015; Impa et al.,2019; Narayanan et al.,2015; Parveen et al.,2022; Posch et al.,2022; Prasad et al.,2008). A 4.2%–13.6% reduction in biomass under HNT stress was observed, consistent with earlier reports of 2%–46% reductions under controlled and field conditions (García et al.,2015; Impa et al.,2019; Narayanan et al.,2015; Parveen et al.,2022; Posch et al.,2022; Prasad et al.,2008). Similarly, a 6.7%–14.4% reduction in spike number (or effective tillers per unit area) aligns with reports of reduced tillers in different crops (Bahuguna et al.,2022; Xu et al.,2020). These reductions likely result from increased night‐time respiration (Bahuguna et al.,2017; Shi et al.,2013), accelerated senescence, and disrupted carbon allocation (Impa et al.,2019,2020; Sadok & Jagadish,2020). Reduced spike weight (12.1%–13.4%) under HNT stress may be attributed to limited carbohydrate availability from increased respiration and reduced assimilate supply to grains (Impa et al.,2021,2019; McAusland et al.,2023). Warmer nights impair starch synthesis by affecting key enzymes, reducing grain size, while also accelerating chlorophyll degradation and inhibiting its biosynthesis (Abdelrahman et al.,2020; Bahuguna et al.,2017; Schaarschmidt et al.,2020). These disruptions in source‐sink balance deplete reserves essential for optimal grain development under HNT stress (Impa et al.,2019,2020). However, not all genotypes showed reductions; some maintained or even increased trait values, suggesting inherent genetic resilience or adaptive mechanisms. Previous studies have also reported increases in biomass, tillering, grains per spike, photosynthetic activity, and pre‐anthesis respiration in some wheat and other crop genotypes under HNT stress (Y. Fan, Qin, et al.,2024; Jing et al.,2016; Kanno et al.,2009; Lazăr & Lazăr,2010; Mohammed & Tarpley,2010; Parveen et al.,2022; G. Xiao et al.,2010).

A positive correlation (withP< 0.001) was observed between spike number and spike weight, but increasing spike number can reduce individual spike weight, affecting yield and quality (Guo et al.,2017; Philipp et al.,2018). Despite this, the total spike weight per unit area can increase if the spike number increases while the individual spike weight remains constant or changes minimally (Gaju et al.,2009). Biomass was positively correlated with both spike number and weight (P< 0.001). Increased spike number or weight per unit area contributes to higher biomass (Deng et al.,2011; Ding et al.,2023). A strong positive correlation was also found between traits under control and HNT conditions, indicating consistent genetic characteristics, though variability in stress response was observed (TableS4).

A total of 19 HNT QTLs and seven condition‐independent QTLs were identified during the current study (Table2). While rice studies have identified genomic regions for different yield‐related traits under HNT stress (Bheemanahalli, Knight, et al.,2021; A. Kumar et al.,2021; A. Kumar et al.,2023), only one study has focused on wheat (Kahlon et al.,2024), highlighting a gap in research. Importantly, none of the HNT QTLs or condition‐independent QTLs identified here overlapped with those in Kahlon et al. (2024). However, both studies mapped QTLs on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 3B, 5D, and 7B, along with additional QTLs on other chromosomes. The lack of overlap may be attributed to several factors: (i) the previous study (Kahlon et al.,2024) used greenhouse conditions, which generally differ from field environments in light, wind speed, and humidity, creating a distinct microclimate that can alter plant responses through strong G × E interactions (Langstroff et al.,2022).In contrast, this study employed movable field‐based heat tents that better replicate real‐world conditions (Hein et al.,2019,2020), providing more reliable insights into the genetic control of HNT tolerance traits; (ii) the previous study applied stress from planting, while our study applied it when nearly all genotypes reached 50% anthesis; (iii) the two studies utilized different plant materials and there were variations in the measured traits; (iv) interval mapping and GWAS have varying sensitivities to detect genetic variants, leading to different QTL results due to differences in statistical power and the ability to capture genetic diversity. Future research should validate these QTLs in diverse genetic backgrounds and environments for potential utilization in breeding programs.

In this study, QTLs such asQ6andQ7(spike weight under control),Q37(spike weight under HNT), andQ43(all traits under both conditions) clustered within the 0.63–5.36 Mb region on chromosome 6A (Figure5). Some clusters were near known genes (TableS14) with potential functional relevance, such asTaDWF4‐1,TaDWF4‐2(carbon assimilation), andWPCL1‐3D(flowering time) in the 603.6–614.2 Mb region on chromosome 3D (Milner et al.,2022; Mizuno et al.,2016). Similarly,Q15(biomass under control),Q31(all traits under HNT), andQ32(biomass and spike weight under HNT) were located within the 13.97–26.49 Mb region on chromosome 4B, near genes likeTaGRP2(days to anthesis; J. Xiao et al.,2014),FLO6‐4B(starch synthesis; Chia et al.,2020),TaTB1‐4B(inflorescence architecture; Dixon et al.,2018), andRht‐B1(plant height; J. Peng et al.,1999). In the homoeologous 4D region,Q34(biomass and spike weight under HNT) mapped close toFLO6‐4D(starch synthesis; Chia et al.,2020),TaTB1‐4D(inflorescence architecture; Dixon et al.,2018), andRht‐D1(plant height; J. Peng et al.,1999).Q28(biomass under HNT) on chromosome 2B was in close proximity to genes such asTaARF12‐2B(plant height, spike length, seeds per spike, and grain weight; A. Li et al.,2022) andTaSTT3b‐2B(grain weight; Zhu et al.,2022).Q22(spike number and spike weight under HNT) was close toTaPIL1‐5D, which regulates tiller number in wheat (L. Zhang, He, et al.,2022). Additionally,Q38(biomass under HNT) andQ39(spike number under HNT) on chromosome 7A were near genes likeWAPO1‐7A(spikelets per spike, Paraiso et al.,2024),TaCol‐B5‐7A(spike architecture and grain yield; X. Zhang, Jia, et al.,2022), andPinb2‐1,Pinb2‐2, andPinb2‐3(grain hardness and kernel texture; X. Li et al.,2020).

Phenogram plot displaying high night‐time temperature (HNT) and condition‐independent quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (distinguished using blue font and slightly enlarged text) alongside previously identified major genes that govern yield‐related traits across different wheat chromosomes. Each QTL and gene is represented by a distinct color. Horizontal bands indicate their genomic positions on chromosomes, with the start and end positions of each chromosome labeled. Rectangular boxes highlight the locations of clusters containing known genes and QTLs. Details of these known genes, including their IDs and genomic positions, can be found in TableS14. This figure was created using Phenogram (https://visualization.ritchielab.org/phenograms/plot).

These QTL clusters offer targets for breeding stable‐yield varieties under optimal and stress conditions, though functional studies are required to explore their roles and potential trade‐offs under HNT stress. For instance,Q27(biomass and spike weight under HNT) is located near theRht8gene, which is associated with reduced plant height, spike length, and grain number (Chai et al.,2022; Kowalski et al.,2016). Consequently, the overlapping QTL may lead to a trade‐off, where increases in biomass and spike weight could come at the expense of spike length or number, ultimately impacting yield components.

Out of 19 HNT QTLs, seven were associated with multiple traits, and five of the seven condition‐independent QTLs showed similar associations (Table2). This suggests possible pleiotropy and shared pathways, offering breeding opportunities to improve multiple traits simultaneously (A. Li, Hao, et al.,2022). Alternatively, these QTLs may be located in regions with linked genes, facilitating the co‐inheritance of desirable traits (Taagen et al.,2022). The detection of condition‐independent QTLs suggests several possibilities: these QTLs may contribute to plasticity, adapting their effects based on environmental conditions and influencing traits differently under stress compared to control (Lacaze et al.,2009; X. Li et al.,2018). Alternatively, they could have stable effects, consistently impacting traits regardless of environmental changes (Simmonds et al.,2014). These QTLs may also participate in adaptive mechanisms that help plants manage stress while maintaining performance under optimal conditions (Mao et al.,2023; Pinto et al.,2010).

The frequency of favorable alleles ranged from 8.81% to 94.25%, with most loci present in few genotypes. If a favorable allele is both major and prevalent, it may already be fixed, limiting further genetic improvement through traditional breeding (Khalid et al.,2019). In contrast, minor favorable alleles offer more potential for selective breeding or genetic manipulation (Malosetti et al.,2021) to enhance performance under HNT stress. Changes in allele frequencies at significant SNPs may indicate shifts in QTL allele frequencies due to selection, but these SNP alleles are not necessarily causative; they are assumed to be in coupling phase with the causative (unobserved) favorable QTL allele. Integrating multiple favorable loci into the same genetic background can optimize plant traits (Figure2), making it an effective approach for modern wheat improvement. Genotypes with more favorable alleles generally showed better performance under HNT stress, though some inconsistencies were observed, possibly due to gene interactions (epistasis) or the influence of the overall genetic background on trait expression.

Validating the causal gene for each GWAS‐identified locus is crucial, but experimentally testing all genes in these regions is impractical, necessitating the prioritization of target genes. Although several genetic and transcriptomic studies, particularly in rice, have identified and characterized numerous genes for HNT tolerance (Bheemanahalli, Knight, et al.,2021; Desai et al.,2021; J. Fan, Zhang, et al.,2024; Glaubitz et al.,2017; A. Kumar et al.,2021; Liao et al.,2015; Yang et al.,2024), only limited research has been conducted in wheat. We prioritized 17 high‐confidence CGs from 766 genes through a cross‐species genomic analysis of rice genes for HNT responses, expression analysis across developmental tissues, and gene‐based haplotype development from SNP variations.

Among these genes,TraesCS6A02G416700, which encodes an ATP‐dependent RNA helicase (DEAD‐box), corresponds to the riceTOGR1gene (D. Wang et al.,2016). Regulated by temperature and the circadian clock,TOGR1’s helicase activity is promoted by heat, which supports rRNA homeostasis and improves plant growth under high temperature (D. Wang et al.,2016). Similarly, RNA‐binding proteins are known to play a key role in post‐transcriptional RNA metabolism during plant growth, development, and stress responses (K. Lee & Kang,2016).TraesCS4D02G018500, which encodes glycine‐rich RNA‐binding proteins, is orthologous to rice genesOsGRP3andOsGRP162, respectively (Yang et al.,2024).OsGRP3andOsGRP162are vital for night‐time thermotolerance in rice, peaking at midnight and increasing under HNT stress, regulated byOsELF3‐2(Yang et al.,2024). Double mutants show reduced survival and seed‐setting rates, with increased sensitivity to night‐time heat stress and lower expression of heat‐stress‐responsive genes (Yang et al.,2024). Similarly,TraesCS4B02G264300encodes a GCN5‐related N‐acetyltransferase. In rice, the corresponding gene shows differential expression under HNT stress and is associated with circadian clock components, potentially disrupting the plant's natural rhythms and physiological processes (Desai et al.,2021; Kim et al.,2017).TraesCS4B02G035400corresponds to the rice geneOs03g0387100(TT1locus), encoding the α2 subunit of the 26S proteasome. This gene is known to protect cells from heat stress by efficiently eliminating cytotoxic denatured proteins and maintaining heat‐response processes (X. M. Li et al.,2015).

Additionally, glycoside hydrolases, such as those encoded byTraesCS2B02G599800,TraesCS2B02G600200, andTraesCS4B02G020100, which promote cell size increase, were significantly upregulated in rice panicles under HNT stress, underscoring their role in the stress response (Liao et al.,2015; Minic & Jouanin,2006). A rice GWAS study identified an F‐box protein‐associated SNP under HNT stress (Bheemanahalli, Knight, et al.,2021). Similarly, our study identifiedTraesCS3B02G089200, encoding an F‐box protein, known for critical roles in abiotic stress responses (X. Zhang, Gonzalez‐Carranza, et al.,2019).TraesCS6A02G009200encodes an oxidoreductase FAD/NAD(P)‐binding protein, corresponding to theOJ1353_F08.4gene, which was differentially expressed between HNT‐tolerant and sensitive rice genotypes (Liao et al.,2015). This protein, crucial for nitrate reduction and redox balance, supports nitrogen metabolism and energy homeostasis, potentially enhancing wheat's resilience and yield under HNT stress. The geneTraesCS7B02G432900, encoding a sugar/inositol transporter, may play a role in maintaining sugar transport and osmotic balance under HNT stress. A similar transporter in rice (P0567H04.25) was upregulated in both HNT‐tolerant and susceptible lines, with higher expression in the sensitive genotype, suggesting that its regulation may influence stress sensitivity (Liao et al.,2015). In wheat, this transporter could impact energy allocation and stress response, potentially contributing to differential tolerance under HNT conditions. The prioritized high‐confidence CGs are key targets for further characterization and functional validation under HNT stress in wheat.

Haplotype blocks with more than two SNPs in strong LD are more informative than biallelic SNPs due to their multiallelic nature (Brinton et al.,2020). Haplotype‐assisted forward breeding, which combines superior haplotypes to develop tailor‐made varieties, has emerged as a new approach in crop improvement programs (Varshney et al.,2021). In this study, we identified 13 haplotype blocks significantly affecting the traits, with nine associated with HNT conditions and four with both control and HNT conditions (TableS11). Genotypes carrying superior haplotypes are believed to have higher HNT tolerance, as they maintained higher trait values under stress conditions compared to genotypes with non‐favorable haplotypes.

TheQ31haplotype block, associated with all three traits, comprised three major haplotypes. Hap2, with the highest average values, was found in ∼40% of genotypes, mainly from the Southern region, indicating potential for breeding efforts to enhance its frequency in Northern genotypes. TheQ42block, containing Hap3, which performed best under both conditions, was found in only 8% of genotypes, evenly distributed between the Northern and Southern regions. This presents a valuable opportunity to enhance its prevalence and improve yield stability under HNT stress in both regions. Additionally, gene‐based haplotypes from four blocks exhibited significant differences under HNT conditions, while one block showed notable differences under both conditions. In theTraesCS1A02G305700block, linked to biomass and spike number, Hap1TraesCS1A02G305700showed higher values under HNT and was present in over 50% of genotypes, mainly from the Southern region. In theTraesCS4B02G264300block, Hap2TraesCS4B02G264300exhibited higher biomass in ∼30% of genotypes, slightly more prevalent in the Northern region. These regional differences in haplotype prevalence may reflect adaptation to environmental conditions, with cooler Northern regions experiencing less selection pressure for HNT tolerance (Webb,2022). In contrast, warmer Southern regions, characterized by warmer days and nights, may have exerted greater selection pressure for HNT tolerance (Webb,2022). These adaptations may have been shaped by underlying genetic variation (Haasl & Payseur,2016; Sertse et al.,2023). Haplotype‐based genomic selection offers greater information than biallelic SNPs and can improve prediction accuracy and selection gains by capturing complex genotype‐phenotype relationships more effectively (Weber et al.,2023).

Further, to validate the identified haplotypes, we selected the top 20 contrasting genotypes based on STI scores and phenotypic values. Genotypes common across all three traits in each group were then analyzed for haplotype distribution from blocks with significant trait differences. HNT‐sensitive genotypes often carried inferior haplotypes, while tolerant genotypes predominantly had superior ones (Figure6A). This analysis validated the haplotypes and identified key genotypes: sensitive genotypes included Arlin, Overley, Shocker, TX01M5009‐28, TX03A0148, and TX99A0153‐1, while tolerant genotypes included Arapahoe, Century, Crimson, Genou, and Rose. Sensitive genotypes consistently exhibited lower trait values, while tolerant genotypes consistently displayed significantly higher trait values across all three traits (Figure6B). HNT‐tolerant genotypes can serve as valuable donors in developing HNT‐tolerant wheat varieties. By crossing these tolerant genotypes with HNT‐sensitive ones, researchers can also develop trait‐focused biparental populations to facilitate more effective trait mapping. Furthermore, these contrasting sets of genotypes can be utilized for further omics studies and functional validation of key QTLs and CGs.

Figure illustrating the analysis of haplotype distribution among contrasting genotypes. (A) Quantitative trait locus (QTL)‐based and gene‐based haplotypes are classified as superior, intermediate, or inferior based on their effects on traits, represented by green, light blue, and dark orange font colors, respectively. Sensitive genotypes include Arlin, Overley, Shocker, TX01M5009‐28, TX03A0148, and TX99A0153‐1, while tolerant genotypes consist of Arapahoe, Century, Crimson, Genou, and Rose. (B) Trait values of susceptible and tolerant wheat genotypes. Susceptible genotypes exhibited lower trait values across all three traits, whereas tolerant genotypes consistently showed higher trait values.

HNT stress significantly reduced wheat biomass, spike number, and spike weight. However, some genotypes exhibited genetic resilience that enabled them to maintain or improve yield‐related traits under HNT stress, likely due to adaptive physiological and molecular mechanisms. Significant genetic variation and strong correlations between these traits suggest they can be jointly selected to improve yield under HNT stress. This study is the first of its kind in wheat to dissect the genetic control of traits for HNT tolerance under field conditions, identifying key QTLs, superior QTL‐based and gene‐based haplotypes, and high‐confidence CGs linked to yield‐related traits under HNT stress. Further validation and functional studies of the identified genomic regions could pave the way for their use in breeding programs to improve HNT tolerance in wheat. Developing kompetitive allele‐specific PCR assays for candidate SNPs can streamline their use in early‐stage breeding through marker‐assisted selection. Superior haplotypes can enhance breeding for HNT stress tolerance, and genomic data from this study can improve genomic prediction models for selecting resilient wheat varieties. Overall, this study advances understanding of HNT tolerance in wheat and guides future research and breeding for climate resilience.
