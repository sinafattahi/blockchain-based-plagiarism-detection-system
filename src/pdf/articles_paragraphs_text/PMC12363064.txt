Burnout can be defined as a serious work-related syndrome characterized by depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and reduced personal accomplishment, particularly among healthcare practitioners such as medical students. It can adversely affect academic performance and compromise vital professional values, including altruism, honesty, and empathy. While some studies have suggested that there is no connection between burnout and professional behavior, other studies have highlighted this relationship. This systematic review seeks to clarify the link between burnout and professionalism.

A comprehensive search was performed across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase to identify studies examining the association between burnout and professionalism among medical students and residents. The inclusion criteria required studies to use validated measures, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Two authors screened and extracted data from eligible studies, resolving disagreements through a third reviewer. The quality of the studies was examined through the risk of bias tool named the Cochrane Collaboration.

A total of twenty-nine studies were analyzed, comprising approximately 14,974 participants, which included 4,242 medical students and 10,732 residents. The majority of the studies reported a negative correlation. Additionally, most studies reported negative correlations between burnout and professionalism, patient care practices, and medical knowledge, whereas some reported negative correlations with lifelong learning and communication skills.

The association between burnout and professionalism among medical trainees is complex and has considerable implications for patient care, trainee well-being, and medical education. Increased levels of burnout can lead to a decline in empathy and professionalism, resulting in a cycle of emotional exhaustion and disengagement. To address this challenge effectively, a holistic approach is essential, encompassing mental health resources, professional training, and systemic modifications aimed at fostering supportive environments.

The term burnout was first introduced in the 1960s [1]. It is a work-related syndrome characterized by depersonalization and physiological or emotional stress, as perceived by healthcare practitioners [2]. Work-related stressors can lead to diminished personal accomplishments [3]. Burnout is notably prevalent among medical students, with studies reporting rates varying between 10% and 76% [4,5]. The epidemiology of burnout also varies by region, with a considerably increased prevalence in the Middle East [6]. Burnout is often investigated via the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which has three aspects: depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and personal accomplishment. Emotional exhaustion refers to emotional depletion or fatigue caused by academic stress [7]. Personal accomplishment refers to feelings of reduced performance and a decline in academic efficacy and is often linked to self-evaluation processes. Depersonalization represents a sense of detachment, highlighting the interpersonal aspects of burnout [8].

Professionalism is defined in many ways. The American Board of Internal Medicine defines professionalism as the commitment to service, commitment to excellence and duty, accountability, altruism, respect, and honor for others [9]. Arnold and Stern et al. defined empathy as altruism, excellence, humanism, and accountability, with empathy also considered a fundamental aspect [10]. Various instruments can be used to measure professionalism; different questionnaires, such as the Professionalism Climate Instrument (PCI) or the Self-Conduct Professionalism Questionnaire (SCPQ) [11]; other instruments, such as medical exam scores, for excellence; and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy Questionnaire (JSPE) for altruism or empathy and other developed questionnaires [12–14].

The association between professionalism and burnout has been investigated in the literature, albeit with varying definitions of professionalism. The role of empathy in this context has been particularly emphasized [15]. Burnout negatively impacts the academic existence of medical students, which can undermine the excellence component of professionalism [16]. Burnout can disturb altruism and honesty, further affecting respect, which is a component of professionalism [17].

Research in this area has revealed inconsistencies. Kwah et al. reported no significant associations between professionalism and burnout [18]. Other studies have shown an association between professional components and burnout [11,19]. This systematic review investigates the interplay between burnout and professionalism while also addressing the existing discrepancies in findings.

We conducted a comprehensive search of four databases, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, to identify studies investigating the associations between burnout syndrome and professionalism among medical residents and students. The search was performed on May 16, 2024. We used the PICO framework to structure our search strategy, focusing on medical students and residents (population), burnout syndrome (intervention), and professionalism, including professional behavior, identity, empathy, and communication skills (outcome). The following terms were used across databases to capture relevant articles: “medical student,” “medical resident,” “burnout syndrome,” “professionalism,” and their synonyms. The detailed search strategies for each database are available in the Supplementary Materials. The systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO: CRD420251023342.

The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) studies must examine burnout syndrome related to professionalism in medical residents and/or students; (2) validated instruments such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) questionnaire must be used to measure burnout; (3) a tool must be used to define and evaluate professionalism; and (4) only full-text peer-reviewed articles published in English must be considered. We excluded studies that (1) focused on populations other than medical students or residents; (2) lacked a clear assessment of professionalism or burnout; and (3) were reviews, commentaries, or editorials.

Two researchers (SB and SMrM) screened titles and abstracts independently using a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full texts of the included articles were reviewed to ensure that they met the eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third author (SS). A standardized form was used to extract key data, including study characteristics (author, year, country), population (medical students, residents), burnout measurement, professionalism measurement, and outcomes reported. A meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of methods used to investigate professionalism.

The quality of the studies included was evaluated on the basis of the risk of bias, which was assessed via the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Two reviewers, SB and SMrM, independently examined the risk of bias across the studies. In cases where they did not reach an agreement, a third reviewer, SS, served as a moderator. The studies were classified on the basis of their risk of bias in several categories: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. A “high risk” designation was given when notable biases could significantly influence the study outcomes due to its design, an “unknown risk” label was applied when the studies had unclear risks due to insufficient detail, and a “low risk” classification was assigned if the studies effectively addressed potential risks due to clearly defined designs.

The search resulted in a total of 2846 articles. After removing duplicates, 1839 records remained. These studies were investigated by title and abstract, reducing the number of potentially included studies to 145. Furthermore, a full-text screening of these studies led to the inclusion of 25 studies. The details of the screening process are presented in the PRISMA flow chart (Fig.1).

The number of participants across the 25 studies was approximately 14,974, which included 4,242 medical students and 10,732 residents. The detailed demographics are presented in Table1.

The studies reviewed focused on burnout, primarily employing the MBI questionnaire. Eleven articles reported burnout prevalence rates, which varied from 25 to 76%, with higher rates among residents. Three articles provided MBI total scores (sum of three subscales), which varied from 37 to 61, with a mean of approximately 54.44. Additionally, fourteen articles reported on the following MBI subscales: depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and personal accomplishments. Each subscale of the MBI is categorized into low, moderate, and high. In the Brazeau study, emotional exhaustion is defined as 0–16 for low, 17–26 for moderate, and 27 or higher for high. The depersonalization subscale was defined as 0–6 for low, 7–12 for moderate, and over 12 for high. Personal accomplishment was also defined as over 38 for low, 32–38 for moderate, and below 32 for high. Additionally, some studies reported percentages that included high scores for the depersonalization subscale (cynicism) and emotional exhaustion with low scores for personal accomplishment (academic proficiency). The degree of emotional exhaustion ranged from 18 to 25.92, excluding the Cofers (considering its considerable differences from other studies), with a mean level of 20.84. The depersonalization subscale scores varied from 6.65 to 29.9, again excluding the Cofer scores, and the mean score for this subscale was 9.43. For the personal accomplishment subscale, scores ranged from 6.77 to 36.11, excluding the Cofer subscale, with a mean score of 22.86. Smeds used the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) for burnout, with exhaustion and disengagement scores ranging from 1 to 4. Thomas et al. reported that burnout levels can be categorized as low (≤ 18 for emotional exhaustion, ≤ 5 for depersonalization), moderate, or high (≥ 27 for emotional exhaustion, ≥ 10 for depersonalization), with correspondingpvalues indicating significant group differences, particularly for depersonalization (p< 0.001) and personal accomplishment (p< 0.001).

The reviewed articles assessed professionalism through various methods. On the basis of these findings, two primary categories were identified: the empathy subscale and additional subscales. Brazeau utilized the PCI subscales, reporting scores of 33.98 for medical students and 33.54 for residents. Across these studies, six subscales of professionalism, derived from the SCPQ questionnaire, were examined: respect, altruism, honesty and integrity, justice, responsibility, and excellence.

Many articles have addressed the relationship between burnout and empathy, identifying empathy as the sole subscale of professionalism in this context. Eight of these studies utilized the JSPE subscale, whereas the remainder noted correlations without extensive analysis. In total, eight studies reported JSPE scores, which varied from 102.13 to 120.61, with a mean of 118.87. Additionally, three studies referenced specific JSPE subscales. The perspective-taking subscale scores varied from 17.54 to 28.32, with a mean score of 19.85. The compassionate care/empathic concern subscale scores ranged from 17.54 to 21.31, with an average of 19.85. The scores related to the “walking in the patient’s shoes/personal distress” subscale were 11.46 and 9.64, respectively. One article assessed altruism via an SCPQ scale, achieving a score of 9.67. However, a significant difference between medical students and residents has not been reported. The details of the JSPE total score and subscales, perspective-taking subscale, compassionate care/empathic concern subscale, and walking in the patient’s shoes/personal distress subscale are presented in Table3.

Honesty and integrity, respect, responsibility, and justice subscales were mentioned in two articles. The Honesty and Integrity scores were reported as 20.94 and 29.4, respectively, on the basis of the AIBM and SCPQ questionnaires. The AIBM, which is a questionnaire provided by the American Board of Internal Medicine, comprises three subscales designed to assess different aspects of professional ethics: (1) excellence and privilege, (2) honesty, and (3) respect and altruism. Each item within the questionnaire is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 9 (always). The scores from the three dimensions are summed to generate an overall ethics score, with a maximum possible total of 170. The SCPQ is a 25-item questionnaire that uses a 5-point Likert scale to assess self-reported adherence to professionalism principles. The respective scores were 17.54 and 42 according to the AIBM and SCPQ questionnaires, respectively. Responsibility was discussed in only one study, yielding a score of 13.36 according to the SCPQ questionnaire. Justice was similarly mentioned in a single article, with a score of 5.83 according to the SCPQ questionnaire. Detailed data on honesty and integrity, respect, responsibility, and justice according to the AIBM or SCPQ questionnaire for these measures can be found in Table4.

Multiple metrics were employed to evaluate professionalism and competence among healthcare professionals, with varying scores reflecting different levels of proficiency across specific domains. Beckman, Cofer, Staples, and Gradiski assessed communication skills, with Beckman utilizing the Clinical Performance Examination (CFV) and Interpersonal and Communication Skills (ICS), while Gradiski applied the Jefferson Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician–Nurse Collaboration (JSAPNC). Cofer and Staples evaluated medical knowledge, and Cofer, Staples, and Gradiski assessed practice-based learning and improvement (PBL), with Gradiski employing the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JeffSPLL). Additionally, Shanafelt, Staples, and Gradiski examined PBL, patient care (PC), where 53% of residents demonstrated suboptimal performance, and system-based practice (SBP). Seven articles utilized grading methods to assess excellence, and these data informed analyses regarding their relationship with burnout. Comprehensive data related to excellence are provided in Table5.

Two categories were defined on the basis of the results: the empathy subscale and other subscales.

A correlation between empathy and burnout was identified in 10 articles. All these articles reported a negative correlation. Additionally, three articles examined the association between the depersonalization subscale of empathy and burnout. All the articles utilized the JSPE for measurement, except for one article by Pitanupong, which employed the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), which is a questionnaire used to assess empathy [20]. A summary of the correlations outlined in the articles is presented in Table6.

A correlation between empathy and burnout was identified in 16 articles. The articles used a variety of questionnaires. Samadi reported a positive association between burnout and respect and a negative association with justice [21]. Shanafelt reported a negative association between burnout and optimal patient care practices [22]. Gradiski reported a negative correlation between global scores of burnout and lifelong learning [23]. Beckman reported a negative association between burnout and communication skills [24]. Smeds [25], Staples [26], and Heppe [27] mentioned a contrasting association between burnout and grades used as a means of excellence, whereas Ilic [28], Cofer [29], and Davis [30] Reported that there is no correlation. Burr explained a negative correlation between emotional exhaustion and grade [31]. Among the excellence criteria of MK, ICK, patient care, PBLI, and SBP are strongly correlated with burnout (p= 0.01) [26]. Davis reported a negative correlation between burnout and professional accountability [30]. The detailed correlation in each article is presented in Table7.

This systematic review aimed to examine the association between burnout and professionalism, with a particular focus on empathy in medical residents. Burnout, characterized by symptoms such as diminished personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization, negatively impacts both empathy and professionalism. Burnout is most commonly evaluated via the MBI tool. It is a prevalent and escalating concern among medical students and residents, with some studies indicating burnout rates as high as 76%. Addressing this issue is highly important [32].

Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization are the most important factors that define the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals [33–35]. This phenomenon is particularly evident among healthcare staff, who often face high-stress environments and high emotional demands [36]. Depersonalization, which is identified by emotional detachment and a sense of disconnection from patients, serves as a coping mechanism for healthcare providers facing overwhelming emotional demands [37]. These consequences combine to weaken important components of professionalism, such as altruism and interpersonal effectiveness.

The JSPE has consistently shown decreases in empathy ratings among physicians suffering from burnout, indicating empathy’s vulnerability to the pressures of medical school [13,20,38–41]. However, in a study performed by Lafreniere et al., increased burnout was correlated with more professional behaviors from physicians in the clinic [42]. Physicians who pay close attention to their interactions with patients might also be more aware of any feelings of emotional change they experience, which may also facilitate the recognition of lapses in care or unprofessional behaviors. While this increased awareness could contribute to burnout and a subsequent reduction in empathy, it may also lead to higher reported levels of depersonalization without necessarily indicating a true increase in such experiences. This could help to account for the differences observed between our findings and those reported in prior research. This possibility may help explain the differences between our findings and those reported in previous studies [42].

Furthermore, the effects of burnout are not limited to empathy; they also influence various aspects of professionalism. A meta-analysis reported that the mental health state of healthcare workers affects professionalism [43]. The impact of burnout on professional behavior differs across these areas. While empathy, honesty, and respect tend to be negatively impacted by burnout, the associations between burnout and academic achievement, as well as between burnout and communication skills, yield inconsistent results. Additionally, studies have identified a positive association between academic achievement and burnout, whereas others have reported a negative association. These heterogeneities may be related to differences in institutional support systems, cultural factors, or assessment methodologies [30]. This heterogeneity reflects the complexities of burnout’s effect on medical trainees and highlights the need for nuanced approaches to understanding and mitigating its effects [44]. Furthermore, research has shown no significant correlation between burnout and grade point average (GPA) or performance on other examinations [40,44]. However, notably, higher exam scores can enhance students’ self-confidence and contribute to a greater sense of personal achievement, as measured by the MBI survey, which may act as a confounding factor in this relationship [40].

Burnout affects medical trainees differently depending on their career stage. Many studies have indicated that medical trainees in their clinical years are more prone to experience burnout than are those in their preclinical years. This disparity is most likely due to the intensive, long hours of work and limited autonomy associated with residency training [45,46].

The competitive nature of medical schools creates anxiety and stress, which frequently results in emotional exhaustion and lower professionalism. Students usually emphasize academic performance over well-being, which escalates burnout [47]. Medical trainees’ tight schedules restrict leisure time and social interaction, resulting in poor work‒life balance, which contributes significantly to burnout and low professional engagement [6]. Exposure to negative role models or inadequate mentorship further undermines trainees’ adherence to professional values [48]. Individual resilience, coping mechanisms, and the presence of supportive networks modulate the relationship between burnout and professionalism. Those with effective coping strategies and strong support systems are better equipped to manage burnout [49,50].

Furthermore, the psychological burden of burnout can extend beyond academic performance, affecting students’ mental health and overall well-being. Research has shown that medical trainees who are experiencing burnout are likely to develop psychological issues such as depression and anxiety, which can affect professionalism [6,51]. The cyclical nature of burnout and professionalism is clear; as students become more burned out, their capacity to participate professionally declines, resulting in a feedback loop that can be difficult to break and might require external help and attention [51,52].

Addressing burnout requires a comprehensive approach that combines individual-level strategies, such as mindfulness and resilience training, with systemic interventions, such as workload management and institutional changes. Ferreira et al. stressed the importance of organizational approaches to promote work‒life balance, particularly for residents [40]. Davis et al. reported that systematic self-care and resilience-building programs contribute to lowering burnout and improving career achievements [30]. However, ensuring the sustainability of these programs is challenging. To achieve long-term benefits, systemic factors such as mentorship, institutional culture, and equal workload distribution must be addressed. Tailored techniques that incorporate culture- and sex-specific considerations are also essential for increasing intervention efficacy.

This review outlines the detrimental effects of burnout on empathy and accountability among medical trainees, with a particular emphasis on residents who face significant challenges due to high workloads and insufficient support. Addressing burnout necessitates comprehensive mental health initiatives, professional training programs, and systemic reforms aimed at fostering supportive learning environments. However, the review acknowledges certain limitations, including its narrative approach, potential selection bias, and the absence of quantitative data synthesis, as well as reliance on diverse studies with varying methodologies. Most studies reviewed were cross-sectional, indicating a critical need for further research to investigate the causal association between burnout and declines in professionalism in medical trainees. Future investigations should utilize standardized assessment tools, examine longitudinal effects, and consider cultural and gender-specific factors to gain a deeper understanding of burnout’s impact on empathy. This review underscores the urgent need for holistic strategies to cultivate resilient, empathetic physicians who can maintain professionalism in contemporary healthcare settings. We also recommend the use of various instruments to evaluate the medical professionalism climate while assessing their impact on burnout levels, as has been previously conducted in specific subgroups of medical trainees [53].

The relationship between burnout and professionalism among medical trainees is multifaceted, with profound implications for patient care, trainee well-being, and medical education. High burnout levels erode empathy and professionalism, perpetuating a cycle of emotional exhaustion and detachment. Addressing this issue demands a holistic approach that integrates mental health support, professional training, and systemic reforms to foster supportive environments. By mitigating burnout effects, medical institutions can ensure the development of competent, compassionate, and professional physicians equipped to meet the demands of modern healthcare.
