Several studies have suggested a potential link between cardiovascular health, inflammation, and cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). However, the exact mechanism by which inflammation affects the relationship between cardiovascular health and CRS remains unclear. CRS refers to a syndrome in which dysfunction in either the heart or kidneys leads to acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. Life’s Crucial 9 (LC9) is a recently proposed cardiovascular health assessment tool. The neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) is a novel inflammatory-nutritional composite biomarker that integrates neutrophil-mediated immune activation with the nutritional status reflected by albumin levels. This study aimed to explore the relationship between LC9 and CRS and assess whether NPAR modulates this association.

This study employed subgroup analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS), threshold effect analysis, and multivariable logistic regression to investigate the relationships between LC9 and CRS, and NPAR and CRS. Additionally, mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential role of NPAR in the relationship between LC9 and CRS.

A total of 25,610 participants were included in the study, of whom 1,240 experienced CRS events. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that for every 10-unit increase in LC9 score, the risk of CRS decreased by 36% (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.76). For each 1-unit increase in NPAR, the risk of CRS increased by 12% (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.17). After grouping LC9 and NPAR by tertiles, the highest LC9 tertile (T3) showed a 52% reduction in CRS risk compared to the lowest tertile (T1) (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.88), while the highest NPAR tertile (T3) had a 2.07-fold increase in CRS risk compared to the lowest tertile (T1) (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.54–2.78). RCS analysis demonstrated a linear negative correlation between LC9 and CRS risk, whereas NPAR was non-linearly associated with CRS risk, with an inflection point at 13.66. Mediation analysis indicated that NPAR mediated 8.14% (P< 0.001) of the association between LC9 and CRS.

LC9 is significantly negatively associated with CRS risk, and this relationship is partially mediated by NPAR. Given the limitations of this cross-sectional study, further prospective studies are needed to confirm the causal relationship and explore the potential mechanisms.

Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) refers to a condition where dysfunction in one organ, either the heart or the kidneys, leads to acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ [1]. Due to the bidirectional pathological interactions between these organs, CRS is more complex, difficult to treat, and associated with higher mortality compared to single-organ diseases. A study on acute heart failure in the United States revealed that approximately one-third of patients had chronic renal insufficiency [2]. Another study found that in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the incidence of acute kidney injury reached 55%, and it was one of the independent risk factors for cardiogenic shock [3]. The high incidence of CRS poses significant challenges to public health and healthcare systems [4]. Despite existing treatments such as diuretics and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors [5], identifying modifiable risk factors for CRS remains an area of concern. Therefore, exploring potential modifiable biomarkers and mechanisms for the onset and progression of CRS is crucial for developing early prevention strategies.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a strong association between CRS and cardiovascular health (CVH). As a key framework for CVH assessment, the American Heart Association (AHA) introduced Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) in 2010, which integrated seven lifestyle and biological indicators, such as smoking and diet, to establish a quantitative evaluation standard for cardiovascular health [6]. With accumulating research evidence, the AHA released the upgraded Life’s Essential 8 (LE8) in 2022, which includes sleep health as part of the assessment [7]. Studies have shown that poor sleep duration and quality are closely related to various cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases [8]. The latest revision of Life’s Crucial 9 (LC9) in 2023 further incorporated a psychological health module [9], creating a multidimensional health monitoring model encompassing physiological, behavioral, and psychological dimensions [10]. Investigating the potential link between LC9 and CRS not only helps deepen the understanding of CRS mechanisms but also holds significant clinical implications for improving cardiovascular health.

Previous studies have suggested that inflammation and certain biochemical markers are potentially associated with cardiovascular and renal diseases [11–14]. The neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) is an emerging inflammatory-nutritional composite marker that reflects both neutrophil-mediated inflammation and the antioxidant capacity regulated by albumin. Research has shown that neutrophil count can independently affect atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease [15]. Elevated neutrophil levels can affect blood viscosity and hypercoagulability, interact with platelets and endothelial cells, and induce microvascular and reperfusion injuries [16]. Serum albumin concentration is a classic indicator of nutritional status and is also influenced by inflammation [17]. Lower serum albumin levels are associated with poor outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease [18,19]. When patients experience malnutrition combined with infections, inflammation, kidney disease, or congestive heart failure, they typically exhibit reduced serum albumin levels [20]. NPAR has gained attention as a novel indicator that integrates two critical dimensions of CRS pathology: inflammation and nutrition. Neutrophils are key effectors of the innate immune response, contributing to vascular injury and tissue remodeling. In contrast, serum albumin reflects both nutritional status and systemic oxidative stress. When combined as a ratio, NPAR may capture the synergistic impact of these processes than either marker alone. Despite this, limited research has explored the potential mediating role of NPAR in the relationship between composite health metrics, such as LC9 and CRS. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether NPAR mediates the association between LC9 and CRS in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. By exploring this novel pathway, we sought to provide new insights into the mechanisms linking ideal cardiovascular health with cardiorenal outcomes.

This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to collect demographic, health, and nutritional data on the U.S. population. The study protocols were approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This secondary analysis followed the STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies [21] and did not require additional Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Detailed information on NHANES methodologies and ethical considerations is available on the CDC and NCHS websites (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

This study used nationally representative data from NHANES. Among 70,190 participants from seven NHANES cycles (2005–2018), a total of 39,038 individuals aged ≥ 20 years and not pregnant were included. Participants with missing data on Life’s Crucial 9 (LC9) and the neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) (n= 13,403) or cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) (n= 25) were excluded. Ultimately, 25,610 participants were included in the final analysis (Figure S1).

Based on our previous studies [22,23], LC9 consists of nine components: four health behaviors (healthy diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, and healthy sleep) and five health factors (weight management, cholesterol control, blood glucose management, blood pressure regulation, and mental health). The detailed methodology for calculating LC9 scores using NHANES data is presented in Table S1. In summary, each LC9 component is scored from 0 to 100, and the total LC9 score is determined by averaging the nine individual component scores. A healthy diet was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015), with its components and scoring criteria detailed in Table S2. Sleep health, smoking status, physical activity, and mental health were derived from standardized questionnaires, while body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured by trained professionals and obtained from the NHANES database (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

CRS was defined as the coexistence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on prior studies [24,25]. CVD was identified through self-reported diagnoses of coronary artery disease, angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke [26]. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines define CKD. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30 mg/g or higher was used to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD) [27]. The CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) equation was used to calculate eGFR [28].

Neutrophil and albumin levels were assessed using the Coulter WBC system, and NPAR was calculated using the following formula: NPAR = neutrophil percentage * 100/albumin [g/dL] [29]. Both WBC differential counts and albumin measurements were obtained from the same blood sample [30].

In this study, covariates were selected based on biological plausibility, and their potential roles as confounders in the associations among LC9, NPAR, and CRS.

We included demographic variables such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as these factors are known to influence both systemic inflammation and the risk of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Socioeconomic indicators (marital status, educational level, and poverty-income ratio [PIR]) were adjusted to account for disparities in healthcare access, dietary quality, and lifestyle behaviors.

Clinical biomarkers, including lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides), glycemic markers (HbA1c and fasting blood glucose), and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), were included because they are directly related to cardiometabolic health, which plays a critical role in the development of CRS and may also influence NPAR levels. Energy intake was included as a proxy for nutritional status and lifestyle behavior, which can affect systemic inflammation and albumin levels. Additionally, chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were included due to their strong association with CRS and their potential to confound the relationships under investigation. This comprehensive approach to covariate selection aimed to minimize residual confounding and enhance the robustness of our mediation analyses. Detailed descriptions of these covariates are provided in Table S3.

All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.3.1), incorporating sampling weights to ensure national representativeness. In this study, “WTMEC2YR” was used as the weight variable, and new weights for the 2005–2018 period were calculated as 1/7 × WTMEC2YR [31]. Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), withp-values derived from t-tests. Categorical variables were expressed as weighted frequencies (n, %) and analyzed using weighted chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to assess the associations of LC9 and NPAR with CRS. Three models were constructed: (1) Unadjusted model: No covariate adjustments. (2) Partially adjusted model: Adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, PIR, and race. (3) Fully adjusted model: Further adjusted for lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides), blood glucose levels (HbA1c and fasting blood sugar), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), Energy intake, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. A smoothing curve fitting approach was used to explore the linear or nonlinear relationship between LC9 and CRS. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine potential effect modifications. A mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the direct, indirect, and total effects of NPAR in mediating the association between LC9 and CRS. The proportion mediated was calculated as: Mediation proportion = (Indirect effect/(Indirect effect + Direct effect)) ×100%. The mediation analysis was conducted using the “mediation” package in R [31]. A two-sidedP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 25,610 participants aged ≥ 20 years were included, representing approximately 160.9 million U.S. adults. The prevalence of CRS was 3.3%, corresponding to approximately 12.4 million individuals. Significant differences were observed between CRS and non-CRS groups in age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, income level, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (P< 0.05). Furthermore, LC9 scores were lower in the CRS group compared to the non-CRS group, whereas NPAR levels were higher in the CRS group. Detailed characteristics are presented in Table1. To assess potential bias, we multiply interpolated missing data for LC9, NPAR, and CRS, and plotted baseline characteristics as detailed in Table S4.

As shown in Table2, LC9 was negatively associated with CRS prevalence across all three logistic regression models (allP< 0.001). In the fully adjusted model (Model 3), each 10-point increase in LC9 was associated with a 36% lower likelihood of CRS (odds ratio [OR]: 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55–0.76). When LC9 was categorized into tertiles, participants in the highest tertile (T3) had a 52% lower CRS prevalence compared to those in the lowest tertile (T1) (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26–0.88).

Similarly, a significant positive association was observed between NPAR and CRS across all models (P< 0.001). Higher NPAR scores were associated with an increased CRS prevalence (P< 0.05). The RCS analysis (Fig.1) revealed a significant linear negative association between LC9 and CRS prevalence (overallP< 0.001; nonlinearityP= 0.156). In contrast, NPAR exhibited a significant U-shaped nonlinear relationship with CRS (nonlinearityP< 0.01), with an inflection point at 13.66. Threshold effect analysis indicated a negative association between NPAR and CRS when NPAR was below 13.66 (OR: 0.827, 95% CI: 0.721–0.961). However, when NPAR exceeded 13.66, a significant positive association was observed (OR: 1.139, 95% CI: 1.110–1.182) (Table3). To assess potential bias, multiple imputation was performed for missing data on LC9, NPAR, and CRS, followed by reanalysis. The results remained robust, as presented in Table S5.

Subgroup analysis stratified by age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, PIR, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (Fig.2) consistently demonstrated a significant negative association between LC9 and CRS across all subgroups. Significant interactions were observed between LC9 and age as well as diabetes (P< 0.05). No significant interactions were found for NPAR.

In addition, sensitivity analysis yielded E-values of 2.5 and 1.49, respectively, indicating that to fully explain the observed odds ratios (ORs) of 0.64 and 1.12, an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both LC9 or NPAR and the outcome (CRS) with an OR of at least 2.5 and 1.49, respectively (Figure S2).

As depicted in Fig.3, LC9 was the independent variable, CRS the dependent variable, and NPAR the mediator. After adjusting for covariates, LC9 was significantly associated with NPAR (β = −0.41, 95% CI: −0.47, −0.34). Mediation analysis (Table4) revealed that NPAR partially mediated the LC9-CRS association (direct effect = −0.0414,P< 0.001; indirect effect = −0.00355,P< 0.001), with a mediation proportion of 8.14% (P< 0.001). Thus, NPAR was identified as a mediator in the relationship between LC9 and CRS.

This study, based on data from NHANES 2005–2018, including 25,610 adults, is the first to reveal a significant negative correlation between LC9 and the prevalence of CRS, while NPAR exhibited a U-shaped relationship with CRS risk. Mediation analysis indicated that NPAR partially mediates the relationship between LC9 and CRS. Notably, subgroup analysis further revealed significant interactions between LC9 scores and age as well as diabetes status, suggesting that older adults and non-diabetic individuals may benefit more from LC9 optimization.

Interaction analysis indicates that the association between LC9 and CRS may be significantly influenced by age and diabetes status. The protective effect of LC9 on CRS is more pronounced in older populations, potentially linked to the age-associated “inflammation-nutrient imbalance,” characterized by chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and decreased albumin synthesis capacity in the elderly [32]. LC9, through an anti-inflammatory diet and high protein intake (≥ 1.2 g/kg/d) [33], may synergistically inhibit NPAR levels while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. In non-diabetic populations, the CRS-preventive effect of LC9 is more prominent, likely due to enhanced insulin signaling that strengthens its anti-inflammatory efficacy [34]. Additionally, regular exercise (e.g., 150 min of aerobic exercise per week) further improves insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic individuals, fostering a positive metabolic-immune feedback loop [35]. Moreover, diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress [36], and endothelial dysfunction, all of which may attenuate the beneficial impact of healthy lifestyle behaviors encompassed in the LC9 framework. Even when optimal lifestyle factors are present, the underlying metabolic dysregulation in diabetes (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance) may continue to drive pathophysiological processes leading to CRS. Second, diabetic individuals often have pre-existing microvascular damage (e.g., diabetic nephropathy) [37], which may reduce the opportunity for lifestyle modification to reverse or mitigate disease progression. In contrast, non-diabetic individuals may retain greater physiological resilience, making them more responsive to interventions captured by the LC9 metrics. Additionally, pharmacologic treatments commonly used in diabetes management (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas) may have unintended effects on cardiovascular or renal outcomes, potentially confounding or attenuating the lifestyle-CRS relationship. In contrast, the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in diabetic patients may attenuate the intervention effect of LC9 [38], suggesting the need for stratified intervention strategies: elderly individuals should receive intensified anti-inflammatory nutritional support, while non-diabetic individuals could benefit more from metabolic-neuroendocrine regulation to achieve precise CRS prevention.

In our study, RCS analysis revealed a significant non-linear association between NPAR and the risk of CRS, demonstrating a clear threshold effect. Specifically, when NPAR was below 13.66, it was inversely associated with CRS risk (OR: 0.827, 95% CI: 0.721–0.961). However, once NPAR exceeded 13.66, the relationship became significantly positive (OR: 1.139, 95% CI: 1.110–1.182). This finding suggests a potential U-shaped physiological effect of NPAR, where lower values may reflect better nutritional status (higher albumin levels) and moderate inflammation, which could be protective against CRS. In contrast, higher NPAR levels likely indicate a dominant pro-inflammatory state and a disrupted inflammation-nutrition balance, substantially increasing CRS risk. This threshold phenomenon may reflect the complex interplay between systemic inflammation and nutritional status in the pathogenesis of CRS. At lower NPAR levels, serum albumin may exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [39,40], potentially slowing the progression of cardiac and renal dysfunction. However, elevated NPAR levels suggest persistent neutrophil-driven inflammation, which may exacerbate CRS through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis, and immune activation [41,42]. These results highlight the importance of considering both inflammatory and nutritional factors when evaluating CRS risk and suggest that NPAR may serve as a valuable stratification biomarker for identifying individuals at varying levels of risk.

LC9 is a comprehensive cardiovascular health metric that encompasses multiple modifiable lifestyle domains, including dietary quality. Dietary interventions within the LC9 framework, through multi-target modulation of gut microbiota and its metabolites, offer an important strategy for delaying the progression of CRS. Recent studies have shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., EPA and DHA) improve CRS directly by reducing blood lipids, inhibiting thrombosis, and alleviating immune damage [43]. They also reshape the gut microbiota composition, increasing beneficial probiotics (e.g., Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli) that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), while reducing pro-inflammatory bacteria, thereby systemically inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress [44]. In synergy, the Mediterranean diet, rich in polyphenols, monounsaturated fatty acids, and dietary fiber, regulates gut microbiota composition, reduces the atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) [45], and enhances cardiac metabolic function, thus lowering the risks of heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [46]. Notably, high dietary fiber intake (≥ 25 g per day) is significantly inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, with each additional 7 g of dietary fiber reducing CVD risk by 9% [47]. This protective effect partly depends on butyrate, a microbial metabolite, which alleviates systemic inflammation and proteinuria [48]. Moreover, low-carbohydrate diets (e.g., limiting refined carbohydrates) reduce the accumulation of AGEs, suppress endothelial oxidative damage mediated by the AGEs-RAGE signaling pathway, and improve glomerular filtration rate and vascular elasticity [49]. Foods rich in antioxidants (e.g., anthocyanins in blueberries, polyphenols in nuts) alleviate oxidative stress in cardiac and renal tissues by scavenging free radicals and activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway [50]. These multidimensional dietary strategies target the “gut microbiota-metabolism-immune” network, providing theoretical support for the collaborative management of CRS.

Poor mental health, including depression and chronic psychological stress, has been associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [51], increased inflammatory burden, and autonomic imbalance—all of which may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and progression of both cardiovascular and renal diseases. Furthermore, psychological stress has been shown to exacerbate systemic inflammation [52], which may further elevate NPAR, suggesting a plausible biological pathway involving this inflammatory marker. Similarly, inadequate or poor-quality sleep has been linked to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, impaired glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, and blood pressure variability [53]—all of which may elevate the risk of CRS. Sleep disturbances have also been associated with elevated neutrophil counts and reduced serum albumin levels [54,55], which directly impact NPAR and may further support its mediating role in the LC9–CRS association.

The imbalance of the neurohumoral system plays a key role in the development and progression of CRS [56]. When cardiac function declines, leading to reduced renal blood flow, compensatory activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) can maintain blood pressure. However, prolonged overactivation exacerbates the condition: Angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone not only cause vasoconstriction and sodium retention but also directly damage cardiac and renal tissues [57,58]. Psychological stress and sleep disturbances further exacerbate this process—anxiety and depression maintain high RAAS activity by stimulating adrenaline release [59], while sleep deprivation increases sympathetic excitability through inflammatory responses, accelerating cardiac and renal dysfunction [60]. Lifestyle interventions based on Life’s Crucial 9 (LC9) can disrupt this vicious cycle through multiple pathways. A reduced-sodium diet directly inhibits excessive RAAS activation, lowering Ang II levels [61]. Engaging in 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week improves vascular elasticity, reduces inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-6), and balances sympathetic activation through enhanced vagal nerve activity [62]. Ensuring adequate sleep (7–9 h/day) regulates melatonin secretion, reduces oxidative stress, and mitigates vascular damage [63]. Psychological interventions can lower stress hormones (e.g., cortisol), reducing renin secretion [64]. These integrated measures offer crucial non-pharmacological support for CRS management.

This study has several strengths: (1) It is the first to investigate the association between LC9 and CRS prevalence in the U.S. population, demonstrating the potential of LC9 as a diagnostic and assessment tool for CRS. (2) NPAR, as a novel inflammation-nutrition composite biomarker, offers a cost-effective and accessible screening tool for CRS in primary healthcare settings. (3) The large, nationally representative NHANES dataset (2005–2018) enhances the generalizability of findings. (4) Robust statistical analyses, including various models and subgroup analyses, adjusted for confounders and confirmed a strong inverse association between LC9 and CRS, supporting the credibility of results. (5) Subgroup analysis identified age and diabetes status as potential effect modifiers (p< 0.05), indicating their significant influence on CRS prevalence and highlighting the need for further investigation.

Despite these contributions, several limitations should be noted: (1) Our findings suggest that adherence to LC9 is inversely associated with the risk of CRS, and this association is partially mediated by NPAR, a marker of systemic inflammation. These results have meaningful implications for clinical practice and public health. LC9, as a composite measure of cardiovascular health, includes modifiable lifestyle and clinical factors such as diet quality, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure. Interventions targeting these components may not only improve overall cardiometabolic health but also mitigate inflammatory pathways contributing to the development of CRS. From a clinical perspective, implementing LC9-oriented lifestyle interventions—such as promoting plant-based diets, structured physical activity programs, smoking cessation initiatives, and sleep hygiene education—could help reduce inflammation and preserve renal and cardiovascular function. These interventions can be incorporated into chronic disease prevention programs or primary care settings. Moreover, community-based strategies, such as population health screening for LC9 scores and targeted education campaigns, may offer scalable solutions to improve population-level cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Future research should explore the long-term effectiveness of LC9-based interventions in reducing systemic inflammation and preventing CRS, particularly in high-risk groups. Our study supports the integration of LC9 assessment into routine clinical evaluation as a practical approach to identify individuals at elevated risk for CRS and to guide tailored preventive strategies. (2) NPAR may be influenced by unmeasured confounders (e.g., hepatic dysfunction or acute infections), necessitating the development of clinically adjusted models to enhance specificity. (3) Certain LC9 components (e.g., sleep quality, psychological stress) rely on self-reported data, which may introduce measurement bias; future studies should integrate wearable devices for objective assessments. (4) We acknowledge that the identification of CVD was based on self-reported physician diagnoses, which may be subject to recall bias, underreporting of asymptomatic conditions, or overreporting due to misdiagnosis. The lack of objective diagnostic tools, such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, or cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin levels), may limit the precision of CVD classification. (5) Although mediation analysis assumes a linear association between variables, our restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between NPAR and CRS. This nonlinearity may limit the interpretability of the mediation effect, as it remains unclear whether the mediating role of NPAR is consistent across all levels or concentrated around specific thresholds. (6) The mediation proportion of 8.14%, although statistically significant, represents a relatively modest effect size. This suggests that while the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) may play a role in the pathway linking LC9 to CRS, it accounts for only a small portion of the overall association. Therefore, other unmeasured mediators or pathways may contribute to this complex relationship and warrant further exploration. Future research should focus on: (1) randomized controlled trials to establish the independent effects of LC9 components (e.g., sodium restriction, physical activity) on NPAR and CRS; (2) investigating the temporal relationship between dynamic changes in NPAR and cardiorenal function deterioration to define predictive thresholds; and (3) leveraging multi-omics approaches (e.g., single-cell sequencing, metabolomics) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying LC9’s regulation of neutrophil function and albumin metabolism, thereby identifying precise intervention targets.

This study demonstrates that higher cardiovascular health scores (LC9) are significantly associated with a lower risk of CRS, with NPAR playing a partial mediating role in this relationship. These findings not only reinforce the pathophysiological interplay between cardiovascular-metabolic status and CRS but also highlight the central role of inflammation regulation in CRS development. By integrating lifestyle interventions (LC9) with biomarker monitoring (NPAR), this study provides novel insights into early CRS prevention. Optimizing multidimensional health management strategies—such as dietary modification, stress reduction, and inflammation monitoring—may serve as an effective approach to breaking the vicious cycle of cardiovascular-renal comorbidity.

We sincerely appreciate the NHANES database for all the data.
