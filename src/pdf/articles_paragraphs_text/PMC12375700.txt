In the context of China’s growing emphasis on digital finance and sustainable investing, this study investigates the factors influencing investors’ behavioral intentions to adopt FinTech solutions, specifically robo-advisors, for green investments. Drawing on responses from 393 investors and employing PLS-SEM analysis through SmartPLS-4, we examine the effects of robo-advisor usage, awareness of ESG factors, and personalization of ESG portfolios on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention, with perceived trust as a moderator. The results reveal that robo-advisor usage and awareness of ESG factors significantly influence perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, though not intention directly. Personalization of ESG portfolios positively impacts perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intention, underscoring the central role of personalization in ESG-oriented FinTech adoption. Both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use significantly predict behavioral intention. Additionally, perceived trust significantly moderates the relationship between personalization of ESG portfolios and behavioral intention, but not the relationships between awareness of ESG factors and intention or between robo-advisor usage for green investment and intention. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing personalization and perceived usefulness to drive investor engagement with green FinTech solutions. Practical implications are discussed for advancing sustainable finance through trusted and user-centered digital platforms.

The integration of technology with conventional banking and investment operations is causing a significant upheaval in the financial environment1. Financial Technology (FinTech) has emerged as a powerful catalyst for innovation, enabling more accessible and efficient investment opportunities, particularly in the perspective of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) integration2. As sustainability becomes a pivotal concern for investors and organizations alike, the adoption of FinTech solutions tailored for ESG investment is critical3. Among these innovations, robo-advisors have gained prominence as automated platforms that provide individualized investment plans based on a person’s willingness to take risks and financial objectives, with a growing emphasis on sustainable and responsible investing4.

The incorporation of ESG factors into investment decision-making is critical for fostering sustainable development and mitigating environmental risks5. However, the successful integration of FinTech for ESG purposes hinges on multiple dimensions, including the functionality of robo-advisors for green investments, the level of awareness among investors regarding ESG factors, and the degree of personalization available in ESG investment portfolios. Robo-advisors facilitate a streamlined investment process by utilizing algorithms to manage investment portfolios, thereby enabling investors to support their investments with their sustainability values without sacrificing returns6.

Green investments refer to financial activities that support environmentally friendly projects and sustainable business practices, aiming to reduce carbon footprints, promote renewable energy, and enhance environmental conservation7. These investments are a subset of the broader ESG framework, which guides responsible investment by evaluating a company’s performance not just in financial terms, but also in how it manages its environmental impact, social responsibilities, and governance practices. ESG criteria are increasingly being used by investors to identify long-term risks and opportunities, making them an essential component of sustainable finance8. The rise of global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality has intensified the demand for ESG-aligned financial products. Therefore, integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions, especially through green investment portfolios, not only aligns with ethical and environmental values but also contributes to long-term financial resilience.

While the technological capabilities of FinTech solutions have significantly evolved, the adoption of these tools for ESG integration is influenced by user perceptions, particularly through the lens of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This theoretical framework posits that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are crucial determinants in an individual’s decision to adopt new technology9. By enhancing the understanding of how these factors interplay in the context of FinTech for ESG integration, this study aims to shed light on the barriers and drivers that influence adoption.

Although the use of robo-advisors10, ESG awareness11and personalization has been explored individually in various financial contexts, such as wealth management, corporate green innovation, and marketing. Research that investigates how these features interact specifically in the domain of green investments remains limited. Existing studies have primarily examined the technological and financial benefits of FinTech tools, such as increased efficiency, cost reduction, and accessibility12,13. However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding how these features, when combined, jointly influence investor adoption behavior within ESG-focused investment frameworks. Additionally, few studies have applied behavioral models like the TAM to explore these interactions in the context of sustainable or green finance. Previous research has typically examined perceived trust as a predictor of technology adoption, highlighting its role in shaping users’ intentions to engage with digital financial platforms14. Some studies have also considered trust as a mediating factor between perceived risk and behavioral intention15. However, its role as a moderator, particularly in influencing the relationship between ESG-related features (such as personalization or robo-advisors) and FinTech adoption, remains underexplored. This lack of empirical insight restricts stakeholders from effectively designing FinTech solutions that align with sustainability goals while addressing investor concerns around trust and personalization.

Moreover, perceived trust emerges as a vital moderator in this relationship, as it significantly affects users’ willingness to engage with FinTech platforms, especially when personal and financial information is at stake16. Trust in technology can foster a sense of security among investors, thereby enhancing their confidence in utilizing FinTech solutions for ESG investments17. This study aims to investigate the complex interplay between robo-advisors, the personalization of ESG investment portfolios, and investor awareness, as well as the crucial role of perceived trust in shaping the adoption of FinTech for ESG integration.

By examining these interrelationships, this study aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the relationship between sustainability and FinTech, offering insights that can inform stakeholders, including policymakers, financial institutions, and investors, on how to enhance the adoption of FinTech solutions in promoting sustainable investment practices. Finally, this study aspires to prepare the ground for a more inclusive and responsible financial ecosystem that prioritizes long-term value creation while addressing pressing environmental challenges.

The format of the paper is as follows: In Sect.Theoretical background, theories regarding FinTech adoption for ESG integration are developed. The methodology is described in Sect.Methodology. The analysis’s conclusions are presented in Sect.Data analysis; Sect.Discussionexplores the findings, makes connections to the body of literature, and offers suggestions for how financial institutions and policymakers might improve sustainable investment practices by utilizing FinTech.

The integration of FinTech into the investment landscape is revolutionizing how individuals and institutions approach ESG investing17. FinTech is the technology advancements that simplify financial services and increase their usability, accessibility, and efficiency18. In this sense, ESG investing places a strong emphasis on incorporating sustainability standards into investment choices, enabling investors to support ethical company practices and match their portfolios with their moral principles19. Robo-advisors, a significant component of the FinTech ecosystem, leverage algorithms to provide automated, personalized investment strategies, enabling users to invest in green assets without requiring extensive financial expertise20.

FinTech has emerged as a key driver in facilitating sustainable investments by offering innovative platforms that cater to the growing demand for ESG integration23. Existing studies highlight the role of FinTech solutions in simplifying and expanding access to sustainable investing, especially through digital tools that enable investors to align their portfolios with ESG criteria2,24. Robo-advisors, in particular, have been instrumental in promoting green investments. These automated platforms use algorithms to create and manage portfolios that incorporate ESG factors, offering personalized and cost-effective investment solutions25. Robo-advisors not only simplify the investment process but also make ESG investments more accessible to a broader audience, including retail investors who may lack in-depth financial knowledge.

The TAM, introduced by Davis28, remains one of the most widely applied frameworks for understanding users’ acceptance of technology12,29. Grounded in the Theory of Reasoned Action, TAM emphasizes two key constructs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as primary determinants of users’ behavioral intentions toward adopting new technologies30,31. Its empirical robustness and simplicity make it a popular choice in examining FinTech adoption32,33. However, while TAM offers a solid foundation, its explanatory power may be limited when examining more complex, trust-sensitive contexts such as ESG-oriented FinTech adoption. Therefore, this study acknowledges the need to extend TAM by incorporating perceived trust as a critical moderator and recommends that future research consider integrating complementary frameworks, such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) or Trust Theory, to capture broader psychological, contextual, and social factors influencing technology adoption. A thorough visual representation of the study model used to identify the factors influencing investors’ acceptance of FinTech for ESG integration can be found in Fig.1.

Investors’ intention to adopt FinTech reflects their willingness and motivation to engage with technology-driven financial solutions for managing investments. This intention is shaped by several factors, including perceived usefulness, ease of use, trust, and personalization of services, as outlined in the TAM34. In the context of ESG investing, investors are increasingly drawn to FinTech platforms for their ability to offer automated, transparent, and personalized investment strategies that align with sustainability goals35. The intention to adopt FinTech is also influenced by the degree of awareness of the benefits these platforms provide, such as simplified decision-making, cost-effectiveness, and real-time access to ESG-related data36. As FinTech continues to evolve, understanding investors’ behavioral intentions is critical for encouraging broader adoption of technology-based sustainable investment solutions.

In this study, AESG refers to investors’ knowledge and understanding of environmental, social, and governance criteria and their relevance to investment decisions. It includes recognition of ESG risks and opportunities, which can influence how investors perceive the usefulness and ease of using FinTech platforms for green investments40. AESG influences investors’ behavior by providing insights into the long-term hazards and opportunities connected with companies’ ecological practices, social responsibility, and governance structures41. FinTech platforms play a pivotal role in increasing AESG by offering accessible tools, real-time data, and personalized information on ESG-related issues, helping investors recognize the value of integrating sustainability into their portfolios17,35. This growing awareness drives greater demand for ESG investments, promoting responsible and justifiable financial practices19. In light of these factors, this research hypothesized.

In our study, the questionnaire design and measurements were meticulously developed to capture relevant data for analyzing the adoption of FinTech for ESG integration. To ensure the questionnaire’s accuracy and relevance, we sought input from esteemed experts in the fields of Finance and FinTech, whose feedback helped refine and optimize the questions. The questionnaire was structured to evaluate key constructs: the use of robo-advisors for green investments, awareness of ESG factors through FinTech, personalization of ESG investment portfolios, and perceived trust. Additionally, PU and PEoU, derived from the TAM, were also included.

The starting of the survey clearly outlined the purpose of the study and assured respondents of secrecy and privacy. It also presents instructions for completing the survey. The initial section of the survey collected personal data such as age, gender, income, and education to create a distinct profile of the participants. The second part covered measurement items for each construct. Five items for RGI were modified from Yi, Rom46. Three items for AESG were taken from Al-Somali, Gholami54. These questions assessed the extent to which users perceived these technologies as facilitating better ESG integration, providing transparency, and enhancing decision-making.

For PESG, three items were modified from Tyrväinen, Karjaluoto55, focusing on users’ perceptions of the customization options available for ESG investments and how well they aligned with personal values and financial goals. Four items for PTST were adapted from Li, Teng56, and respondents’ confidence in the security, transparency, and integrity of FinTech platforms, particularly in managing ESG investments, was evaluated. Additionally, four items of PU and PEoU each were measured based on28to assess how these FinTech tools enhanced the ease and efficiency of managing ESG portfolios and how these perceptions influenced users’ intention to adopt FinTech solutions for sustainable investing. Finally, the questionnaire included questions measuring investors’ behavioral intentions to adopt FinTech for ESG integration, using five items from Hassan, Islam57, which examined their willingness to use and recommend these platforms based on their experiences. Table1presents all the measurement items along with scale reliabilities.

This study targeted investors in China who utilize FinTech solutions for ESG integration. Experience with FinTech services centered on ESG investing was a prerequisite for participation, ensuring informed responses regarding awareness, personalization, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and trust. The study utilized a stratified random sample technique to guarantee representation across significant demographic categories59. This approach facilitated the collection of a balanced sample that reflects the diversity of investors engaging with FinTech for ESG integration in China. We employed a 5-point Likert scale to rate our items (1 strongly disagree − 5 strongly agree)56,60–63. Data collection for this study utilized a reliable online survey platform, allowing for a wide reach and convenience for participants. The survey was circulated via email and social media channels to maximize participation among investors in China. Collaborations with financial service providers also facilitated the dissemination of the survey to their customers, further enhancing the response rate. We acquired informed consent from each individual.

The survey, which took place in late July or early August of 2024, was directed at Chinese investors who had prior experience integrating FinTech solutions for ESG. Following the removal of 23 incomplete responses, 393 of the 416 questionnaires that were received were judged legitimate. The details of the participants are displayed in Table2. Most respondents are male (58.02%), with a representation of females (41.98%). Age distribution indicates that the largest group falls within the 25–34 category (29.26%), suggesting a youthful investor base. In terms of income, the highest proportion of participants earn between ¥10,001 - ¥20,000 (33.08%), indicating a middle-income profile. The education level shows a predominance of bachelor’s degree holders (42.49%), reflecting a relatively well-educated group. Lastly, experience with FinTech services is notably varied, with the majority having over 1 year of experience, particularly those with more than 5 years (30.28%).

The data for this study were evaluated using the structural equation modeling-based (SEM) partial least squares (PLS) approach. Principal component analysis and multiple regression are used in the modern technique known as PLS-SEM45. Its use in the research is supported by multiple factors: First, PLS-SEM works well for intricate models that have several constructs and indicators, which makes it particularly suitable for our integrated framework that connects different theoretical models64. Second, PLS-SEM is frequently suggested for exploratory research because of its focus on discovering or predicting important driving or target factors65. Third, PLS-SEM is more adaptable when handling real-world data that isn’t always distributed normally than CB-SEM (covariance-based SEM), which makes strong assumptions about data distribution45. Common method bias (CMB) was assessed using statistical and procedural methods66. According to Harman’s single-factor test, the first component accounted for 43.80% of the total variation, which was much less than the 50% cut-off and suggested that there were no substantial CMB issues. Finally, PLS-SEM is capable of handling both formative and reflective measurement models with ease, which is important when researching complex variables like those in our study67.

The validity and reliability of the measuring model were estimated. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and composite reliability (CR) were used to measure the reliability. Cronbach’s alpha and CR values for all constructs exceeded the recommended threshold of 0.7068, indicating strong internal consistency. For convergent validity, both average variance extracted (AVE) and individual item loadings were examined. AVE values ranged from 0.640 to 0.754, exceeding the 0.50 minimum69. All item loadings ranged from 0.749 to 0.889, surpassing the 0.70 benchmark, thereby confirming acceptable indicator reliability. These values are presented in Table1, providing strong evidence of convergent validity45.

Finally, discriminant validity was verified using Fornell and Larcker’s criterion and HTMT. Table3demonstrates that all diagonal entries, or the square root of AVE, are greater than the corresponding correlation coefficients for each column and row, showing sufficient discriminant validity69. Henseler, Ringle70state that a degree of discriminant validity that is deemed satisfactory is indicated if the HTMT value is less than 0.90. Table3shows that all HTMT values are below the 0.90 cut-off, indicating that the constructs’ discriminant validity is acceptable. Moreover, multicollinearity is examined in the study using VIF71. The multicollinearity test establishes whether or not the structural model’s independent elements show statistically significant intercorrelations. The VIF cut-off number is less than five. Each element in our model has a VIF value that is within the constraints of what we have studied (Table1).

The relationships between latent and observable constructs are determined by the structural model. When integrated, these models enable researchers to evaluate and appraise complicated linkages observed in their data, providing insights into the underlying intricacies of the events they are researching71. It provides Q2, R2, t-values, f2, and path coefficient values68. The R2indicates the degree to which an independent variable influences the outcome variable72. The R² value for Adoption of FinTech for ESG Integration is 0.673, meaning 67.3% of the change in adoption intention is elucidated by the independent variables. This highlights the significant influence of these factors on investors’ decisions. Table4displays the range in which the R2, Q2, and f2values are placed.

The analysis used a 95% bias-corrected confidence interval and the bootstrapping method with 5,000 iterations to assess the impact of the structural path coefficients73. The bootstrapping procedure is used to determine the importance of the hypothesis. The direct correlations between the latent variables are shown in the route coefficient table along with t-statistics, beta values, and standard deviation. The p-values highlight the significance of the connections and pathways between the model’s variables71. To assess the goodness of fit index, the constructs’ SRMR values were computed74. The results of SRMR = 0.048 indicate that the model fits the data well. Table5displays other model fitness values.

Table6; Fig.2provide insights into the relationships between the key variables. The findings show that RGI does not significantly influence investors’ intentions to adopt FinTech for ESG integration (H1a: β = 0.017,p= 0.717), but it has a positive and significant impact on both PU (H1b: β = 0.214,p< 0.001) and PEoU (H1c: β = 0.232,p< 0.001). Similarly, AESG does not significantly affect intention (H2a: β = 0.036,p= 0.460), but it significantly influences PU (H2b: β = 0.223,p< 0.001) and PEoU (H2c: β = 0.297,p< 0.001).

In contrast, PESG positively and significantly impacts both intentions (H3a: β = 0.127,p= 0.005), PU (H3b: β = 0.323,p< 0.001), and PEoU (H3c: β = 0.245,p< 0.001). Furthermore, both PU (H4: β = 0.380,p< 0.001) and PEoU (H5: β = 0.135,p= 0.014) significantly influence investors’ intentions to adopt FinTech for ESG integration. Regarding PTST as a moderator, it does not significantly moderate the relationship between RGI and intention (H6a: β = 0.039,p= 0.352) or AESG and intention (H6b: β = 0.063,p= 0.150). However, PTST positively moderates the relationship between PESG and intention (H6c: β = 0.136,p< 0.001). These results highlight the importance of personalization and trust in enhancing investors’ intention to adopt FinTech for ESG integration.

The results of this study provide valuable insights into the determinants of investors’ behavioral intention to adopt FinTech for sustainable investing, particularly in the context of robo-advisors for ESG investment portfolios. The findings confirm that several factors, including robo-advisor for green investment, awareness of ESG factors, personalization of ESG investment portfolios, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust play critical roles in shaping investor behavior.

Contrary to expectations, RGI did not have a direct, significant impact on investors’ behavioral intention to adopt FinTech, which suggests that the mere availability of robo-advisors for green investment may not be enough to drive investors’ intent to adopt these platforms. In contrast to previous studies like Belanche, Casaló37, which found that robo-advisors positively influence adoption, our study reveals that robo-advisors for green investment do not significantly impact investors’ behavioral intention. This suggests that while earlier research emphasized the importance of robo-advisors, in our context, investors may prioritize other factors over the presence of robo-advisors when deciding to adopt FinTech platforms for ESG investments. However, RGI positively influenced perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, aligning with prior research that indicates technology-focused tools like robo-advisors enhance the perceived benefits of financial management75.

Unlike preceding findings that have revealed an encouraging association between awareness and behavioral intention76. Our findings indicate that AESG does not significantly impact investors’ behavioral intention to adopt FinTech platforms for ESG investments. This suggests that while investors may be aware of ESG factors, this awareness alone is insufficient to drive their decision-making, implying that other elements, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, may play a more critical role in influencing adoption behavior. However, awareness significantly affected perceived usefulness46and ease of use49, showing that awareness can improve investors’ perceptions of how useful and easy-to-use FinTech platforms are for ESG investments.

Predictably, investors’ behavioral intention was shown to be significantly predicted by perceived usefulness and ease of use79. These results are in line with the TAM proposed by Davis28, which holds that perceived utility and usability are important factors influencing technology adoption. Investors who perceive FinTech platforms as beneficial and easy to use are more likely to adopt them, particularly in managing ESG-focused investments.

Interestingly, perceived trust did not significantly moderate the relationships between robo-advisors for green investment or awareness of ESG factors and investors’ behavioral intention. This suggests that while trust is generally considered a key driver in technology adoption, it may not be sufficient to amplify the influence of ESG awareness or robo-advisor functionality alone in motivating adoption. One possible explanation could be that our respondents, many of whom may already rely on digital platforms or possess baseline awareness of ESG factors, view these features as standard expectations, rather than elements requiring high levels of trust to influence their decision-making. In contrast, perceived trust significantly moderated the relationship between the personalization of ESG investment portfolios and investors’ intention to adopt FinTech solutions. This underscores that personalized ESG offerings, which involve more tailored and sensitive financial decisions, require a stronger foundation of trust to be effective. For our sample, trust appears to enhance the credibility and relevance of personalized recommendations, making them more influential in encouraging FinTech adoption for green investments.

This study offers important theoretical contributions to the understanding of FinTech adoption for green investments. While the TAM remains a useful framework, our findings suggest it may require refinement in ESG-related contexts. Specifically, although perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use significantly influence behavioral intention, robo-advisor functionality and awareness of ESG factors do not show a direct significant impact on intention, contrary to assumptions in prior research. This challenges the linear assumption that awareness or technological availability alone leads to adoption. Instead, our findings highlight the critical role of personalization and the moderating influence of perceived trust, suggesting that trust-enhanced personalization is a key driver of FinTech adoption in sustainable finance. These insights advocate for expanding traditional adoption models by incorporating contextual variables such as ethical alignment, personalization relevance, and data trustworthiness. By doing so, this research enriches the theoretical discourse on FinTech and sustainable investment behavior, offering a more nuanced and behaviorally grounded view of technology acceptance.

From a practical standpoint, this study provides actionable insights for FinTech developers, financial institutions, and policymakers aiming to promote green investment through digital platforms. The significant impact of perceived usefulness and ease of use suggests that platform design should prioritize functionality, intuitive interfaces, and clear value communication to improve user engagement. Importantly, the non-significant effect of ESG awareness on intention indicates that simply disseminating ESG information is not enough; stakeholders should invest in interactive, experience-driven awareness campaigns that translate ESG knowledge into actionable investment behavior. Similarly, the non-significant direct role of robo-advisors in predicting intention implies that their adoption depends more on how personalized and trustworthy the recommendations feel to the user, rather than on the presence of the tool itself. Therefore, enhancing the customization capabilities of robo-advisors and ensuring data security and transparency can foster greater trust and ultimately higher adoption. By focusing on personalization, trust-building, and meaningful ESG engagement, FinTech platforms can play a more effective role in advancing sustainable investment behavior.

It is vital to acknowledge the diverse constraints of this research investigation. First off, the fact that only Chinese investors were included in the sample may limit the findings’ applicability to other geographical areas with distinct financial practices and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, respondents may misrepresent their intentions or knowledge levels due to social desirability, which introduces bias into the self-reported data. The study also focused on specific constructs related to FinTech adoption, potentially overlooking other factors that might influence investors’ behavioral intentions, such as economic conditions or regulatory frameworks. Lastly, because the study was cross-sectional, it was difficult to determine the cause of the variations’ long-term associations.

Future research could discover the applicability of the results in diverse cultural and geographical settings by conducting comparative studies across different countries. Longitudinal studies would also be beneficial to assess how perceptions of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and trust evolve and their subsequent impact on behavioral intentions toward FinTech adoption. A more thorough understanding of what motivates adoption might be obtained by looking into the impact of additional significant aspects, such as social influence and individual FinTech tool experience. Additionally, qualitative research approaches, such as interviews or focus groups, could assist in delving deeper into the underlying motives and barriers that investors encounter when adopting robo-advisors for green investing. Finally, expanding the focus to include the role of regulatory policies and their effect on investor trust and adoption intentions could offer valuable insights into how to better facilitate the integration of sustainable investment solutions in the financial market.
