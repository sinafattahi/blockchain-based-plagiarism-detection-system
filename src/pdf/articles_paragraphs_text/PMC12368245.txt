The study aimed to investigate the association between co-exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) or herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in a representative sample of the adult female population in the United States. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 4,284 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Logistic regression and stratified analyses were used to assess associations between individual PAH exposures and the prevalence of HPV and HSV-2 infection. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was applied to explore the association between combined PAHs exposures and infection outcomes. After adjusting for covariates (age, race, poverty-to-income ratio, education, physical activity, smoking status, and creatinine), logistic regression identified positive associations between exposure to 2-NAP, 1-PHE, and 1-PYR and HPV infection, and between 1-NAP, 3-FLU, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 1-PYR, 9-FLU, and 2&3-PHE and HSV-2 infection. Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations among younger women (20–39 years) and never smokers. WQS regression indicated that co-exposure to PAHs was associated with increased odds of HPV infection (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.06–1.57) and HSV-2 infection (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.40–2.34), with naphthol contributing the highest weight to the mixture effect. In conclusion, PAHs exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of HPV and HSV-2 infections in this cross-sectional study. These findings provide epidemiological evidence of a possible link between PAHs exposure and the prevalence of reproductive tract infections in women. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection are two common sexually transmitted infections (STIs)1,2. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 491 million people aged 15–49 years were living with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection globally3. According to GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates, approximately 342,000 women died from cervical cancer globally in 20204. Some STIs may cause stigmatization, infertility, certain cancers, and pregnancy complications, and have a direct impact on sexual and reproductive health, as well as are associated with an increased occurrence of HIV infection5. Factors associated with the spread of STIs include unprotected sexual contact with partners, sexual assault, prostitution, or a previous history of STIs6–9.In addition to behavioral and socio-economic factors, environmental exposures may indirectly or directly increase the infection of STIs by affecting the immune system, the endocrine system or other biological mechanisms10.

PAHs are organic compounds produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter. These pollutants are found in a variety of sources, including anthropogenic sources such as automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, cooking, and waste incineration, as well as natural sources such as volcanic activity and forest fires11. A population-based study has shown that exposure to heavy metals such as lead (a common environmental pollutant) during childhood is associated with an increased incidence of STIs in adulthood, supporting the view that there may be a link between exposure to environmental pollutants and the occurrence of STIs12. Some PAHs are known to be toxic, carcinogenic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic, while certain PAHs also exhibit immunosuppressive effects13,14. In addition, select PAHs demonstrate estrogen-like activity and may adversely affect the female reproductive system. Studies have shown that exposure to PAHs can damage oocyte DNA and disrupt ovarian function, leading to reproductive disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome, miscarriage, and preterm birth13,15,16. The endocrine-disrupting and immunosuppressive properties of PAHs may contribute to increased susceptibility to STIs via biological pathways. Mechanistically, PAHs exposure may compromise the integrity of the genital epithelial barrier and alter local hormonal homeostasis, potentially facilitating pathogen entry. Furthermore, PAHs have been shown to impair both systemic and mucosal immune responses, reducing host defense against pathogens responsible for STIs13. While direct epidemiological evidence on the relationship between PAHs exposure and non-HPV STIs remains limited, some studies have reported associations between PAHs exposure and HPV infection17,18, and experimental research suggests plausible mechanisms linking PAHs to an increased likelihood of infection, including immunosuppression and barrier dysfunction. Exposure to PAHs in the general population most frequently occurs as exposure to complex mixtures rather than to individual chemicals. Such co-exposure may lead to synergistic or additive health effects that cannot be captured by examining single compounds, and this approach more accurately reflects real-world exposure scenarios. This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate the relationship between co-exposure and the prevalence of HPV and HSV-2 infection. The analysis was stratified by age group and smoking status to account for potential differences in susceptibility and exposure patterns. Age and smoking status were included as stratification variables because both factors are known to influence infection risk and may modify the association between co-exposure and STIs.

The data for this research were sourced from the NHANES database. All NHANES procedures underwent ethical review and received the necessary approvals, with informed consent obtained from all participants. Further details can be found at:https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/.

This study utilized nationally representative data from the 2001–2016 NHANES cycles, comprising a total of 82,097 participants. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) male participants (n= 40,453), (2) participants with missing data on PAHs (n= 30,908), (3) participants lacking complete information on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (n= 5,703), (4) participants under age 20 (n= 485), and5participants with missing data for key covariates (n= 264). Consequently, the final sample included 4,284 eligible participants. Furthermore, there were 655 missing data on HPV infection and 981 on HSV-2 infection. The detailed screening process is presented in Fig.1.

Urinary monohydroxy metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) were measured in a randomly selected subpopulation of NHANES participants aged 6 years and older using capillary gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) with an Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph equipped with a ZB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film) interfaced to an Agilent 7000 A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Quality assurance procedures included the analysis of two levels of quality control materials (QCL and QCH) with each analytical batch, and run acceptance was determined using Westgard multi-rule criteria. Results were reported in ng/L of urine19. The analyzed PAHs included 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol, 2-fluorene, 3-fluorene, 9-fluorene, 1-phenanthrene, 2-phenanthrene, 3-phenanthrene, 4-phenanthrene, and 1-pyrene. Notably, before the 2013–2014 cycle, the reported values for 2& 3-phenanthrene corresponded to their combined concentration. Therefore, we used the sum of 2-phenanthrene and 3-phenanthrene prior to 2013–2014, resulting in a total of nine PAHs metabolites included in the subsequent analysis. To address the small sample size related to co-exposure analyses of individual PAHs and to improve statistical power, we grouped these nine metabolites into four categories according to the chemical structure of their parent compounds. Specifically, the classification was based on whether the metabolites were derived from naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, or pyrene. This grouping strategy reflects established chemical classifications of PAHs and is commonly used in previous epidemiological research.

The NHANES 1999–2016 Laboratory Data section provides comprehensive information on herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibody testing. Serum subsamples containing specific HSV-2 antibodies against glycoproteins (named gG-2) were identified using a highly sensitive and specific solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. The presence of positive antibodies was defined as an indicator of HSV-2 infection16. To obtain accurate data on HPV infections, the Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test was employed. This test was selected for its ability to accurately differentiate and detect HPV types, covering 37 in total (including types 6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, 89, and IS39). A positive result for any HPV type was categorized as an HPV infection.

The covariates selected in this study were determined based on previous literature, which indicated that factors such as age, race, smoking status, educational level, poverty income ratio (PIR), physical activity level, and creatinine levels are not only associated with PAHs exposure but also with the prevalence of HPV and HSV-2 infection20–23. These variables are typically considered potential confounders in epidemiological studies when assessing the association between environmental exposure and infectious diseases.

The educational level was categorized as below high school, high school, and above high school. The PIR was divided into two groups of PIR < 1.3 and PIR ≥ 1.3, reflecting eligibility for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits17. Smoking status was categorized as: never smokers (< 100 lifetime cigarettes), former smokers (> 100 lifetime cigarettes, currently non-smokers) and current smokers (> 100 lifetime cigarettes, occasional or daily smokers)18. Physical activity quantified by calculating the number of metabolic equivalent minutes per week (MET-min/week) for each participant based on the intensity, duration, and frequency of physical activity reported by the participant during the week. The metabolic equivalents (MET, 1 MET = 1 kilocalorie burned per kilogram of body weight per hour) corresponding to each intensity of activity were 4 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity24.Subsequently, participants were categorized into three groups according to the standard scoring criteria of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ): low (< 600 MET-min/week), moderate (600 to 3000 MET-min/week), and high (≥ 3000 MET-min/week). In addition, creatinine was included as a continuous variable to consider renal function.

The continuous variables were presented as medians (interquartile ranges) and compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The categorical variables were expressed as numbers (percentages), compared with the chi-square test. PAHs were categorized into quartiles, with the lowest quartile serving as the reference group, and we investigated potential associations between PAHs exposure and HPV infection and HSV-2 infection using logistic regression modeling. Three types of models were constructed in this study. The criteria for covariate inclusion were as follows: Model 1 was an unadjusted baseline analysis; Model 2 was adjusted for age, race, PIR, and education level, which were selected a priori based on previous literature as key demographic confounders; Model 3 was further adjusted for physical activity, smoking status, and creatinine, as these additional variables are established or potential confounders according to relevant studies. Subsequently, we performed subgroup analyses of PAHs exposure and HPV infection, HSV-2 infection by age group and smoking status.

Finally, this study used weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to examine the co-exposure effects of specific PAHs (naphthol, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene) on HPV infection and HSV-2 infection. WQS regression was adopted to address the limitations of traditional regression models in assessing mixture effects of environmental exposures, such as multicollinearity from highly correlated PAHs. WQS regression allows estimation of the overall mixture effect and identification of major contributing components. The main assumptions of WQS are: (1) all mixture components included in the index have effects in the same direction (e.g., all are harmful or all are protective); (2) there is a linear relationship between the WQS index and the outcome; and (3) exposure quantiles adequately capture the variability in exposure-response.

This approach is appropriate for our study because concentrations of PAHs are often highly correlated, and we hypothesized that these PAHs collectively increase HPV infection and HSV-2 infection, consistent with the model assumptions. All WQS models were adjusted for age, race, PIR, education level, physical activity, smoking status, and creatinine. WQS regression analysis was performed using the gWQS package in R. Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, including naphthol, fluoranthene, anthracene, and pyrene) were included as mixture components. The dependent variable was a binary variable (0/1). The data were randomly divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 6:4. The number of bootstraps was set to 1,000, weights of the mixture components were constrained to positive effects, and the number of quantiles was set to 4. The multiple interpolation method for chained equations (MICE) was employed to process the missing values of covariates. Statistical significance criteria were set at a two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05, and all data analyses were done via SPSS 27.0 and R software (version 4.4.1).

The study included 4,284 women older than 20 years, with a median age of 37 years. 29.65% (1076/3629) individuals had HPV infection and 26.10% (862/3303) individuals were determined to have HSV-2 infection. The majority were non-Hispanic whites (42.53%), had an above high school (59.10%), never smokers (63.68%) (Table1). The concentrations of 2-NAP, 3-FLU, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 1-PYR, 9-FLU, 4-PHE, and 2&3PHE were significantly higher in the HPV infection positive than in the HPV infection negative (Table2). Similarly, Table3showed that the concentrations of 2-NAP, 3-FLU, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 1-PYR, 9-FLU, and 2&3 PHE differed significantly between HSV-2 negative and HSV-2 positive infections, with positive infections having higher concentrations than negative infections.

The results of the unadjusted model (Model 1) and the partially adjusted model (Model 2) are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 (HPV infection) and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 (HSV-2 infection), respectively.

As shown in Figs.2and3, subgroup analyses were used to examine whether the association of PAHs exposure with HPV infection and HSV-2 infection was consistent across age subgroups in Fig.2and smoking status in Fig.3. No interaction of smoking status and age group stratification with PAHs exposure was seen in these associations(all P for interaction > 0.05). Compared to participants in the lowest quartile of 1-PYR, in the third to fourth quartile of 1-PYR, who aged 20–39 years, had a 47% (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.05–2.05) and 76% (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.20–2.58) increase in HPV infection (Fig.2C).Participants who aged 20–39 in the fourth of quartile of 9-FLU had a 94%(OR = 1.94, 95%CI: 1.16–3.27) increased the HSV-2 infection compared to participants in the lowest quartile of 9-FLU(Fig.2H, I). However in age subgroups, the highest quartile of 1-NAP 3-FLU and 2-FLU consistently demonstrated a higher HSV-2 infection ( Fig.2D, E,F).Additionally, in smoking status subgroup, participants who were never smokers in the highest quartile of 2-NAP and 1-PYR consistently demonstrated a higher HPV infection (Fig.3A, C) and participants who were never smokers in the highest quartile of 1-NAP 3-FLU 2-FLU 1-PYR 9-FLU and 2&3PHE also consistently demonstrated a higher HSV-2 infection(Fig.3D, E,F, H,I, J).

According to the logistic regression results, PAHs exposure was positively associated with both HPV infection and HSV-2 infection, so the assumptions for the WQS regression we used were positive. WQS regression was conducted to assess the co-exposure to four classes of PAHs on HPV infection and HSV-2 infection (Fig.4). The analysis adjusted all covariates. WQS regression indicated that co-exposure to PAHs was associated with higher prevalence of HPV infection (OR = 1.29, 95%CI:1.06–1.57) and HSV-2 infection (OR = 1.81, 95%CI:1.40–2.34). Among HPV infections and HSV-2 infections, NAP had the highest weighted contributions to the WQS index, ranging from 40 to 45%. These findings suggest that NAP is a major driver between PAHs co-exposure and HSV-2 infection and HPV infection.

The results of this study showed that three individual PAHs metabolites, 2-NAP, 1-PYR, and 2-FLU, were positively associated with HPV infection and HSV-2 infection by logistic regression analysis. Further stratified analyses found that this association was particularly significant in the non-smoking young female population. We further used WQS regression analysis to find that co-exposure to PAHs was also positively associated with HPV infection and HSV-2 infection, with NAP contributing the most to co-exposure to PAHs. These findings provide new epidemiologic evidence for the study of PAHs exposure affecting reproductive system infections.

There are relatively few studies on the relationship between PAHs and STIs. The results of a previous natural population-based cohort study established in a Chinese community support the conclusions of our current study, which suggested that high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) persistent infections and negative transitions were attributable to high exposure to PAHs in as many as 68.9% and 64.8% of women, and that the probability of persistent, homozygous persistent and negative transitions of HR-HPV occurred with increasing levels of exposure to PAHs showed a constant increasing trend, while the HR-HPV persistent negative rate showed a decreasing trend25.In vitro results also revealed that exposure to PAHs increased HPV titers, and that high concentrations of BaP favored enhanced HPV viral particle synthesis, while low concentrations of BaP favored increased HPV genome amplification26.

As far as we know, there are no studies on the association between PAHs exposure and infection with HSV-2. However, experimental studies have shown that black carbon containing PAHs and its aging products can exacerbate inflammatory responses in epithelial cells and disrupt the mucosal immune microenvironment27, indicating that environmental pollutants have the ability to regulate mucosal immunity. This finding provides biological evidence for exploring the association PAHs exposure and HSV-2 infection risk in large cross-sectional surveys.

First, PAHs can induce immunosuppression through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway28. The interaction between AhR and its newly discovered ligand-dependent interacting protein ARA9 enhances AhR signaling, suggesting that such protein complexes formed after ligand binding may regulate immune and other cellular responses29. Previous studies indicate that increased Treg differentiation and suppression of Th1/Th17 responses can weaken antiviral immunity30. Although there is currently no direct evidence that this mechanism affects the clearance of HPV or HSV-2, the results of this study suggest that immunosuppression may play a role in the association between increased environmental PAHs exposure and elevated viral infection risk.

In addition to their immunomodulatory effects, PAHs may also impair the integrity of the epithelial barrier in various mucosal tissues. For example, studies have shown that certain PAHs (such as benzo[a]pyrene) can induce acute pulmonary inflammation and damage respiratory epithelial cells through the Wnt5a-mediated signaling pathway, leading to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TSLP and IL-33) and reduced CC16 secretion31. Notably, similar mechanisms may also play a role in the reproductive tract. Experimental evidence suggests that PAH metabolites, such as BPDE, can induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in epithelial cells, disrupting the integrity of cervical mucosa and thereby promoting HPV infection and cervical lesions32. Overall, disruption of epithelial barriers in respiratory and reproductive tract mucosa may increase susceptibility to various STIs.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that air pollutants, including PAHs, may promote the development of lung cancer through mechanisms such as inflammation, DNA damage, and epigenetic regulation33. It is worth noting that studies on epigenetic changes induced by PAHs in lung cancer suggest that such mechanisms may also be involved in immune regulation. Based on this, we hypothesize that PAHs may increase susceptibility to viral infections (such as HPV and HSV-2) by interfering with the epigenetic regulation of antiviral immune genes—a hypothesis consistent with our epidemiological observations, but one that requires further experimental validation.

Another emerging mechanism may involve disruption of the reproductive tract microbiota. Recent experimental evidence suggests that exposure to PAHs (such as benzo[a]pyrene) can disrupt the balance of beneficial microorganisms in the intestinal microbiota of mice—specifically, a decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus spp34. Given the central role of Lactobacillus in maintaining mucosal defense, similar microbial disturbances may occur in the reproductive tract and may weaken the mucosal barrier, thereby promoting viral colonization. However, direct evidence is currently lacking; future studies should investigate whether PAH-induced microbial dysbiosis occurs in the reproductive tract and how this may influence viral susceptibility.

Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that PAHs may increase host susceptibility to infection through multiple pathways. For example, a recent cohort study of Middle Eastern populations showed that fetal exposure to PAHs was common among pregnant women and was associated with thyroid dysfunction in newborns, further highlighting the endocrine-disrupting potential of PAHs in humans35. In addition, experimental studies have shown that co-exposure PAHs can significantly enhance the activity of detoxification enzymes (such as CYP1A), alter biotransformation pathways, lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, and exacerbate developmental toxicity in aquatic organisms36. In summary, PAH-induced detoxification and biotransformation changes may lay the foundation for a series of downstream effects, including immune dysfunction, barrier function impairment, and microbial community changes, which collectively increase the host’s susceptibility to viral infection.

Finally, available evidence indicates that PAHs can alter the microenvironment of the reproductive tract by interacting with estrogen and its receptors, thereby affecting host susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections37. An animal study found that the lungs of young female mice were more sensitive to naphthalene toxicity38, suggesting that sex hormones may play an important role in the toxic effects of PAH exposure. This is consistent with our finding that NAP was the most significant contributor to the association between PAH co-exposure and both HPV and HSV-2 infections.

Overall, these interconnected mechanisms—including oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, immune suppression, epigenetic and microbial alterations, and endocrine disruption—collectively increase susceptibility to HPV and HSV-2 infection following exposure to PAHs. Therefore, the finding that exposure to PAHs (particularly combined exposure dominated by NAP) is associated with an increased prevalence of HPV and HSV-2 infections is biologically plausible.

The subgroup analysis of the current study also found that the association of PAHs exposure with HPV infection and HSV-2 infection was more pronounced in young adults (20–39 years of age) and never smokers. The likely mechanism is that young never smokers typically do not experience long-term tobacco exposure, so their immune systems may be more sensitive to PAHs. PAHs themselves are a harmful component of tobacco smoke, and prolonged smoking may cause a smoker’s immune system to develop some tolerance or adaptation to these substances. Previous studies have shown that long-term smokers have changes in the expression of immune response genes, and that these changes may allow them to develop some tolerance to the toxins in smoke39.However, the lack of this adaptive response in young never smokers when confronted with PAHs led to a more significant association.

Some strengths of this study are worth highlighting. First, we used a large, nationally representative sample and applied multivariable adjustment to minimize confounding, which enhances the generalizability and robustness of our findings. Second, the assessment of co-exposure to PAHs provides a more realistic evaluation of environmental risk, reflecting actual human exposure patterns.

Of course, this study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design precludes the establishment of causal relationships between PAHs exposure and HSV-2 or HPV infection. Second, due to the reliance on a single spot urine sample to assess PAHs metabolite levels, exposure misclassification may have occurred, as these measurements may not accurately reflect long-term exposure. Third, important behavioral confounders—including sexual activity, number of sexual partners, and use of protection—are not available in the NHANES database and thus could not be controlled for in the analysis. Fourth, although covariates were adjusted for, there remains the possibility of residual confounding from unmeasured factors, such as genetic polymorphisms influencing individual susceptibility to HSV-2 and HPV infection. Finally, this study focused solely on HSV-2 infection, primarily because HSV-2 is the predominant form of sexually transmitted herpesvirus, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other STIs.

In summary, public health policies should focus on reducing population exposure to PAHs, especially among susceptible populations. This includes not only strengthening regulation of industrial emissions and transportation pollution, but also promoting public education to raise awareness of the potential health risks of PAHs. Future studies should utilize prospective cohort designs to explore the long-term effects of PAHs exposure on sexually transmitted infections and their mechanisms.
