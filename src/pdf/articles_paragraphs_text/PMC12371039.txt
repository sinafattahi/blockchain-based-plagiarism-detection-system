High-sensitivity acceleration sensor detecting micro-mechanomyogram and deep learning approach for parkinson’s disease classification.

Application of high-sensitivity acceleration sensor detecting micro-mechanomyogram and deep learning for Parkinson’s disease classification.

Specifically, we developed an acceleration sensor with great sensitivity to vibration than commercial sensors.

Specifically, we developed an acceleration sensor with great sensitivity to vibration than commercial sensors as previously reported [21], [22].

Based on the developed high-sensitivity acceleration sensor, we implemented a sensor module for measuring MMG [21].
