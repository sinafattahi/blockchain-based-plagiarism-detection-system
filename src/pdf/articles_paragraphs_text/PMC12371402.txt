Sepsis, a potentially fatal illness marked by an abnormal host immune response to an infection, continues to be a major global health issue. This study explores the role of pyroptosis and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and their complex interactions, two dominant immune cell death, in the setting of sepsis. The review begins by explaining sepsis and its strong dependence on the immune system. It then delves into the basic mechanisms of neutrophil extracellular trap associated death (NETosis) and pyroptosis, examining their functions in inflammation and host defense. Going further, it looks at the dysregulated immune response in sepsis, with a focus on neutrophils and other immune cells and their critical role. We analyze in detail two types of cell death: pyroptosis and NETosis, both of which are closely examined for their roles in the development of sepsis, particularly the escalation of pathophysiology. Additionally, the study looks into the complex interactions between pyroptosis and NETosis, illuminating possible mechanisms for control as well as their cooperative effects. The report concludes with a summary of the major findings and recommendations for future therapy approaches and research prospects. This review adds to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of sepsis by thoroughly analyzing the roles of NETosis and pyroptosis in sepsis and providing possible directions for therapeutic intervention.

Pyroptosis is a lytic type of planned cell death carried out by gasdermins, which are proteins that generate pores in cells. Gasdermin A (GSDMA), GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, GSDME, and GSDMF (PJVK/DFNB59) are members of the gasdermin family.[19]Gasdermins have a linker connecting the C-terminal domain to the N-terminal domain, which is lipophilic and naturally makes pores. In a steady state, the C-terminal domain suppresses the N-terminal domain’s ability to produce pores. Specific proteases, activated in response to different signals, relieve intramolecular inhibition by cleaving the linker region that separates the N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain then translocates to the plasma membrane and attaches itself to the acidic phospholipids in the cytoplasmic leaflet, including phosphoinositides. Following this, the N-terminal domain oligomerizes and creates pores on the plasma membrane that resemble rings. The buildup of gasdermin pores ultimately causes cell lysis.

Immune cells use pattern recognition receptors to actively search for PAMPs, pathogen-induced cellular changes, and DAMPs in both the extracellular and intracellular compartments.[45]These receptors can trigger an inflammatory reaction by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Figure 2). They can also initiate homeostatic responses, such as autophagy, which helps remove PAMPs and destroy damaged organelles. In addition, inflammasomes, which are specialized sensors of the innate immune system, trigger pyroptosis. Inflammasomes are complex assemblies composed of various components, including sensor molecules such as the nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2), NLR family CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4), and others. These sensor molecules are accompanied by an adaptor protein called apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), as well as an effector protease known as caspase-1. These oligomeric complex acts as a platform to cleave pro-Caspase-1 zymogen into active form. The presence of microbial components or cellular disturbances caused by infection triggers the construction of inflammasomes, resulting in the self-cleavage of caspase-1 into its active form.[46,47,48]Activated caspase-1 leads to DNA fragmentation and to cell lysis through different signal pathways. Caspases can activate nuclease and subsequent DNA fragmentation independent of degradation of inhibitor caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (ICAD). Caspase-1 also facilitates the process of converting immature forms of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into their mature counterparts, which are released easily through cell lysis and promote inflammation. Significantly, GSDMD has been identified as the substrate of caspase-1.[49,50]GSDMD can also be targeted by other caspases, namely caspase-11 in rats and caspase-4/5 in humans. These caspases work as detectors for gram-negative bacterial LPS found in the cytosol.[51,52,53,54]The cleavage of GSDMD by Caspase-1/11/4/5 releases the N-terminal domain, leading to the perforation of the plasma membrane.[55,56]The development of pores by GSDMD results in the entry of ions, swelling due to osmotic pressure, and ultimately the lysis of cells, or pyroptosis, letting go of cellular contents such as proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), ATP and other alarmins.

Pyroptosis is an intensely inflammatory kind of programmed cell death that has a critical function in triggering inflammation and immunological responses. They are involved in regulating and activating caspase-1 or caspase-4/5/11, resulting in the formation of holes in the plasma membrane. This causes the cell to break down and release pro-inflammatory chemicals.[54]These are primarily associated with the innate immune system, serving as a safeguard against microbial infections.

In the end, the cell goes through pyroptosis, which let go of its internal contents. These include pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18, as well as warning signals like high-mobility group box 1.[57]These chemicals attract and stimulate immune cells, intensifying the inflammatory response and facilitating the elimination of infections. The secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 plays a crucial role in beginning and maintaining inflammation. These cytokines stimulate nearby cells, such as endothelial cells and immune cells, to produce a variety of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.[52]This enhances the inflammatory response and attracts immune cells to the location of infection or tissue damage. IL-1β additionally aids in the stimulation of adaptive immunity by facilitating the differentiation of T cells and the generation of antibodies. Pyroptosis can also directly aid in host defense by removing intracellular infections. The process of pyroptosis, which is initiated by caspase-4/5/11, is activated upon the recognition of cytosolic LPS originating from Gram-negative bacteria.[58]This type of pyroptosis enables the liberation of bacteria that are inside cells into the area outside the cells, which helps phagocytes identify and eliminate them.

Pyroptosis mainly happens in macrophage and dentric cells. However, research have identified other cell types going through pyroptosis, such as neutrophils through activating a non-canonical inflammasome pathway through P2X7 receptors. Neutrophils are highly microbicide with short life span. Through pyroptosis, chemo attractive capacity and phagocytosis, few pathogens can survive and replicate.

Although pyroptosis serves as a potent defense mechanism, its dysregulation can contribute to the development of different illnesses. Excessive or prolonged pyroptosis can result in tissue damage and the development of chronic inflammation.[59]Moreover, autoinflammatory diseases and immunodeficiencies have been associated with alterations in the genes that code for inflammasome components or pyroptosis-related proteins.

The term “crosstalk” describes the possible regulatory relationships and interplay between NETosis and pyroptosis, two types of immune responses and cell death. During NETosis, the recruited neutrophils release cytotoxic substances and enzymes in response to pathogens, phagocytose pathogens, and release NETs to carry out host defensive functions.[60]The activation of neutrophils triggers NETosis, which also coincides with changes in intracellular calcium concentration, an increase in ROS, and the activation of kinase signalling cascades that aid in the synthesis of NETs.[61]It has been documented that the same infections that cause NETosis can cause pyroptosis in different kinds of periodontal tissue cells.

However, while inflammasomes are mostly expressed in myeloid cells, such as macrophages and monocytes, there is mounting evidence that they are also essential components of the adaptive immune system, particularly in lymphocytes. Inflammasomes are expressed and activated in lymphocytes, and lymphocytes in turn regulate inflammasome activity in the adaptive immune system. This relationship between inflammasomes and lymphocytes acts as a bridge for communication between the innate and adaptive immune response, resulting in fine control of immune protection. This study examines the crosstalk that inflammasomes facilitate between the innate and adaptive immune systems, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between inflammasomes and lymphocytes.

On the other hand, pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death that is highly inflammatory. Inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that trigger the cleavage and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-18 and IL-1β, are what define them. In sepsis, these cytokines help to magnify the inflammatory response.[66]These cytokines can then trigger NETosis. Furthermore, researchers have suggested that pyroptosis is an upstream regulator of NETosis, and GSDMD, the key executive protein of pyroptosis, facilitates NETosis.[65,67]More pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, and pyroptosis is enhanced when NETs trigger inflammasomes., which can lead to an inflammatory cycle that amplifies itself again.[68]Moreover, NETs have the direct ability to cause immune cells to undergo pyroptosis, which intensifies the inflammatory response.[69]The interplay between NETosis and pyroptosis exacerbates sepsis-related immunological dysregulation.

Circulating NETs are observed in individuals with sepsis, which is often accompanied by severe multi-organ failure and unfavourable clinical outcomes.[72,73]In contrast, an unmanageable rise in NET formation, along with the failure to remove and break down debris and contents resulting from cell death, including cell-free DNA, results in heightened expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α in these individuals. There have been reports indicating that citrulline histones produced from NETs can function as DAMPs. They achieve this by stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines, impairing the function of endothelial cells through cytotoxicity, and increasing the formation of ROS. As a consequence, this leads to damage to multiple organs.[74,75]However, pyroptosis, which is a type of programmed cell death that is extremely inflammatory and is activated by inflammasomes, has a crucial function in protecting the host against intracellular pathogens. However, if it is not properly managed, it can worsen tissue damage and inflammation.[76]The dysregulation of NETosis and pyroptosis has been linked to the development of various diseases, such as autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), infectious diseases (e.g., sepsis), and inflammatory conditions (e.g., atherosclerosis, cancer).[77,78]As a result, there has been significant interest in using therapeutic strategies that focus on these pathways as prospective interventions to reduce disease severity and improve patient outcomes. NETs have been linked to the development of many inflammatory and infectious conditions. Strategies aimed at inhibiting NETosis have the potential to reduce tissue damage and inflammation associated with these disorders. Kennyet al. showed that various stimuli activate distinct pathways that result in the creation of NETs, indicating possible targets for inhibiting NETosis.[77]In addition, a study also discovered that inflammatory caspases can operate as innate immunological receptors for intracellular LPS. This finding implies that it may be possible to regulate NETosis by targeting caspase activation.[76]Overall, these results emphasize the need for establishing therapeutic ways to inhibit NETosis and decrease the inflammatory response in various illness scenarios. Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death that is highly inflammatory. It is important for the body’s defense against intracellular infections but can cause more tissue damage and inflammation if not well regulated. Shiet al. found that inflammatory caspases act as innate immunological receptors for LPS inside cells, highlighting their important role in starting pyroptosis.[76]Suppressing the activity of inflammatory caspases is a promising approach to controlling pyroptosis and reducing its harmful consequences. By focusing on certain caspases’ activation or activity, it might be possible to lower the inflammatory response connected to pyroptosis while still letting it do its important job of protecting the host.

In conclusion, sepsis remains a significant global medical challenge, causing high rates of illness and death. Our analysis emphasizes the crucial role of immune response dysregulation in sepsis. We have identified the interaction between two processes, NETosis and pyroptosis, which play a key role in the development of sepsis. NETosis involves the release of chromatin and antimicrobial proteins from neutrophils, while pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death. These processes contribute to tissue damage and systemic inflammation in sepsis. Understanding this interaction opens new avenues for targeted therapies, although further research is needed. Collaboration and translational research are essential to improving patient outcomes in sepsis.
