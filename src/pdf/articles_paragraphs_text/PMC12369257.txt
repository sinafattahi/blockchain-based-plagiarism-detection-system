Nursing supervision and delegation are essential components of healthcare delivery, significantly impacting patients’ care and outcomes. In low-resource settings, such as Africa, where shortage of professional nurses has been reported, effective delegation optimises task allocation and nursing workforce use, while supervision ensures safe care and promotes skill and knowledge transfer to less experienced staff. The review aimed to map existing evidence on the practice and challenges of supervision and delegation in the nursing profession across Africa.

This review adhered to the six steps outlined in the guidelines by Askey and O’Malley. Search was conducted across five main databases, including PubMed, JSTOR, Scopus, Dimensions AI, and Web of Science, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for PubMed and refined for other databases. Additional searches were performed in Google Scholar and university repositories. Reference lists of eligible records were also checked for other relevant articles. The last search was conducted in July 2024. Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were included. Search results were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extraction was done using a data extraction form. Thematic analysis and synthesis were carried out with evidence presented as narrations and summarized in tables.

A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, highlighting both practices and challenges in nursing supervision and delegation across Africa. Effective supervision practices included comprehensive orientation, continuous training, robust monitoring with feedback, and clinical assessments. Key components of effective supervision include clear communication, teamwork, and supportive environments. However, challenges such as inadequate supervisory skills, time-consuming, enormous administrative tasks, and resource constraints were identified. Delegation practices emphasized feedback, continuous instruction, worker empowerment, strength-based task allocation, and task evaluation and verification. Challenges in delegation were primarily related to staffing shortages, skill gaps, role misalignment, insufficient resources, and the complexity of tasks.

Addressing the challenges and improving supervision and delegation practices in nursing is critical for enhancing healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings like Africa. Implementing evidence-based strategies and developing clear policies will improve the effectiveness of supervision and delegation, ultimately enhancing patient care. Collaborative efforts focusing on staff training, resource allocation, and support systems are essential for overcoming these challenges.

Supervision and delegation are critical components in nursing practice, significantly impacting the efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery, particularly in low-resource settings such as Africa. The increasing complexity of healthcare demands that nursing leaders develop effective strategies for supervision and delegation to ensure optimal patient outcomes [1]. The World Health Organization advocates for clear policies and structured delegation protocols to improve healthcare delivery, especially in resource-limited settings, and to prevent the overburdening of nurses [2]. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) and National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) recommend that nurses must be trained in delegation and supervision skills to ensure safety, ethical standards, and quality care [3,4].

Supervision in nursing refers to the guidance, oversight, and monitoring provided by various nursing personnel; including but not limited to nurse leaders, to ensure that staff members adhere to professional standards and deliver safe, effective care [5]. Delegation, on the other hand, involves the transfer of responsibility for performing specific tasks from a registered nurse to another healthcare worker while maintaining accountability for the outcome [6]. In diverse healthcare contexts, especially in Africa, effective supervision and delegation are crucial. Africa faces significant nursing workforce shortages, high disease burdens, and under-resourced healthcare systems, making efficient task allocation and oversight indispensable [7]. Similarly, appropriate delegation allows for optimal use of available resources and personnel, ensuring that tasks are assigned based on competency and expertise [3].

Historically, supervision and delegation in nursing have evolved as nursing roles expanded. Traditionally, nurses were supervised directly by physicians [8], but as nursing became more autonomous, the need for internal supervision and delegation mechanisms within nursing teams became paramount [9]. In Africa, these practices have been shaped by colonial healthcare systems, where task-shifting and delegation were essential to compensate for workforce shortages [7]. Recent reviews highlight several facilitators to improve supervision and delegation in nursing, including the importance of leadership skills, the role of task-shifting, and the impact of cultural dynamics on delegation practices [10–12]. However, cultural barriers and hierarchical organizational structures have been noted to hinder effective delegation in many African countries [11].

Supervision and delegation skills are critical for all nurses, as they are responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of patient care. Nurses with strong supervision skills can mentor and guide junior and or unregulated staff, while effective delegation allows nurses to focus on complex tasks, improving efficiency. According to a study by Kurt et al. [13] in Turkey, nurses with developed supervision and delegation competencies demonstrated higher job satisfaction, reduced stress levels, and improved patient outcomes [14]. Furthermore, these skills were suggested to help mitigate burnout, a significant challenge in African healthcare settings [15]. Studies suggest that a lack of formal training in these areas often leaves nurses struggling to balance their responsibilities [16,17].

In contrast, research in the global north indicates the benefits of mentorship programs and structured delegation frameworks, which can be adapted to African settings to improve task management and enhance staff capacity [18]. However, many African countries lack comprehensive policies that guide delegation practices. While task-shifting is encouraged in many settings to mitigate the effects of workforce shortages, it often occurs without clear protocols, leading to role ambiguity and increased risk of errors [19]. Furthermore, effective supervision is also limited by the absence of robust regulatory frameworks, making it difficult to ensure consistency in practice across healthcare settings [20].

In the global south, the effectiveness of supervision and delegation in nursing practice may vary across public and private institutions [21]. In public hospitals, supervision is often hampered by resource constraints and overwhelming patient loads, whereas private institutions may have better structures for overseeing tasks [22]. The American Nurses Association (ANA) highlights that delegation should always prioritize patient safety and respect human dignity [9]. In African healthcare settings, ethical concerns often arise when nurses are overburdened or forced to delegate tasks to inadequately trained personnel. Effective supervision helps mitigate these risks by ensuring that all delegated tasks comply with ethical standards and respect patients’ rights [3].

An existing review on delegation in nursing often focuses on high-resource countries, where well-developed regulatory frameworks guide nursing practice [23]. However, limited reviews have explored delegation and supervision practices in African healthcare systems, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite the importance of supervision and delegation in nursing, there remains a significant gap in the literature mapping evidence on their implementation and impact in African healthcare settings. Most studies focus on high-income countries, with limited research addressing the unique challenges faced in Africa, such as task-shifting, cultural barriers, and limited regulatory frameworks [12,21]. This scoping review aims to map existing evidence on the practices and challenges of supervision and delegation in nursing across Africa. It seeks to identify research gaps, highlight best practices, and propose strategies to strengthen these essential components of nursing practice.

The scoping review utilized the six-stage framework established by Askey and O’Malley [24]. The steps of the framework are: 1) Identifying the research question, 2) Identifying relevant studies, 3) Study selection, 4) Charting the data, 5) Collating the data, and 6) Summarizing and reporting the results. The review was reported using the PRISMA-ScR. The protocol for this study has been registered at the Open Science Framework with registration number DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/K4Z7G.

The search for relevant studies was mainly conducted in PubMed, JSTOR, Scopus, Dimensions AI, and Web of Science. These key databases were selected for their comprehensive coverage of medical and nursing literature essential for capturing diverse research on supervision and delegation in nursing within Africa. With assistance from a qualified librarian, a detailed search strategy was developed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (see Table1). The search spanned from the inception of each digital database to August 2024. Additional hand search was conducted in Google Scholar and university repositories to ensure exhaustive coverage, including gray literature (thesis). Additionally, the reference lists of eligible studies were checked to identify additional eligible records. This comprehensive search strategy enhances the credibility, relevance, and rigour of the review by ensuring broad coverage across diverse sources, minimising publication bias, capturing context-specific and grey literature, and strengthening the evidence base for informed conclusions.

Articles identified through database searches were imported into Mendeley software for reference management and to remove duplicate records. The screening process adhered to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria (See Table2). Titles and abstracts were initially screened by postgraduate nursing students in the research team, supervised by independent researchers, GOB and SAA, to promote rigor through guided screening. This was done to select eligible full-text records for further screening. Subsequently, eligible full-text records were independently assessed by three researchers (AA, VLS, CB), who screened the records to determine their eligibility for inclusion. To ensure consistency, SAA reviewed the decision by the screeners to resolve any discrepancies and ensure adherence to the review standards. Where inconsistencies were not resolved, a third reviewer was consulted. This structured methodology ensured a thorough and reliable selection of studies, thereby enhancing the validity of insights into the practices and challenges of nursing supervision and delegation across African healthcare settings.

Data extraction was conducted on a template in Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet version 2021, which provided a firm ground for organizing, managing, and analyzing the extracted data. The data were charted on specifically calibrated forms, designed to capture essential information related to supervision and delegation practices and challenges in nursing. These included pre-developed forms with fields for study characteristics, such as author and year of publication, country, study design, population, key findings, and limitations. To ensure accuracy and completeness, the review team pre-tested the forms using a sample of studies. Data extraction was done independently by the authors (AA, VLS, CB). Discrepancies arising during the extraction process were resolved by a consensus procedure involving authors SAA and GOB. Where inconsistencies still prevailed, a third reviewer was consulted. Attempts were made to contact the original investigators when specific information from the published sources was ambiguous or missing. This methodical strategy guaranteed that the process of data extraction was comprehensive and dependable.

Data from the charted forms was collated into a master spreadsheet, using Microsoft Excel 2021. The assembled data were reviewed for completeness and accuracy to make certain that all relevant information was captured. An inductive thematic analysis was used to derive themes from the data, allowing patterns to emerge naturally from the findings [25]. Major findings were combined to provide an overview of the status of supervision and delegation practices in nursing, especially within the African context. The results were synthesized and presented in a tabular manner, outlining the main themes and challenges identified from the review. The presentation of results was done through a narrative approach supported by tables and charts to facilitate understanding and illustration.

A qualified librarian was also involved throughout the stages of searching and screening to help develop an appropriate search strategy, enabling him to identify relevant studies concerning nursing supervision and delegation within African contexts. Such consultations allowed a comprehensive review to take place through the inclusion of wide-ranging perspectives and expert reviews. Also, this approach enhanced the validity of the review, thus ensuring that the conclusions and recommendations derived from it are well-informed and relevant within the context of nursing supervision and delegation in African health care.

Most of the included studies were conducted in South Africa [9], followed by Egypt with four studies. Two studies from Namibia were included, while Ghana, Nigeria, and Benin recorded one study respectively. See details in Fig.2. Out of the 16 included studies, 13 were descriptive, exploratory, qualitative studies. See Fig.3for details. A total of 1727 participants were used in the included studies. Details on sample size according to study designs are presented in Fig.4.

Studies included in the review reported a diverse range of supervision strategies employed to enhance the effectiveness of supervision practices. Orientation and training emerged as a critical aspect, with initial orientation strategies being widely discussed. Studies highlighted the importance of providing clear explanations, preparing and supporting new supervisors, introducing necessary information, and employing visualization techniques to facilitate effective supervision [26–31]. Also, continuous training was emphasized, including ongoing in-service training, workshops, and opportunities for staff development. Key strategies included training staff members, performing clinical assessments, and capacity building, alongside self-directed learning initiatives [22,25]. Again, supervision and monitoring practices were thoroughly discussed, with monitoring and feedback being central themes. Effective supervision involves monitoring various activities and reports, providing feedback to the staff member who accepted the delegation, supervising activities, and employing tools and equipment for optimal performance. Debriefing sessions were also identified as a significant practice to ensure comprehensive supervision [6,22,27,28]. Support and guidance emerged as fundamental elements in creating a supportive supervision environment. Studies underscored the importance of good support, a positive atmosphere, trust, and respect, alongside providing guidance and ensuring the availability of clinical supervisors. Documentation and accountability were crucial for maintaining effective supervision. Proper documentation and reporting, including completing compulsory assessments and ensuring accountability, were emphasized as essential practices. Leadership and management strategies were noted as integral to successful supervision. Effective staff management, advocacy, assertiveness, and professional conduct were identified as key leadership practices. Problem-solving and clear objective-setting were also recognized as important for effective decision-making [27,32], as they enable supervisors to assign tasks with clarity, address emerging challenges promptly, and ensure that delegated responsibilities align with broader organizational goals. Meetings to assess the competence of the staff delegated to were discussed in terms of the supervisors role in providing advice and establishing the competence of community health workers (CHWs) (See Table3).

Numerous challenges have been identified in the supervisory role that hamper the ability of supervisors to fulfill their responsibilities effectively. Supervisors face significant challenges in their roles, as highlighted by the issues identified with supervisory responsibilities. Many supervisors reported being unprepared for their responsibilities as clinical supervisors, which impacts their effectiveness [22,23,32]. Other challenges included inadequate supervisory skills [36], time-consuming administrative tasks [31], and poor time management due to limited time available for supervisory duties [5,32]. Similarly, knowledge and training Issues emerged as a significant barrier to effective supervision, with supervisors frequently lacking knowledge about certain equipment [31] and outdated knowledge about supervision practices [37]. There was also a noted lack of guidelines for implementing policies and new practices [38] and inadequate training opportunities [5,39]. Also, time and resource management challenges were prevalent, with issues related to ineffective time management [37]. Supervisors faced challenges such as a lopsided supervisor-student ratio [37]. Failure to prioritize hospital duties was also noted as a challenge [25]. Likewise, knowledge and supervision skills deficiency included gaps in essential knowledge and clinical skills [27]. Supervisory challenges included inconsistencies in clinical skills instruction, limited supervisor competence [22], and insufficient access to essential information [27], all of which compromise the effectiveness of clinical oversight.

Resource constraints were evident, with shortages in material resources [27] and medical supplies [40]. Additionally, the lack of clinical supervisors [32,37], and financial constraints [36] critically impair supervision and delegation by limiting oversight capacity, disrupting accountability structures, and restricting the resources needed to support delegated tasks all of which pose risks to care quality and patient safety. Lack of resources and support encompassed various issues including inadequate resources for training supportive supervisors [5] and staff absenteeism [23,36]. There were also challenges with outdated information [27]. Again, interpersonal and organizational issues included poor communication [25,37,39], lack of advocacy [38], and poor interpersonal relationships [37]. Furthermore, environmental and structural issues involved inadequate infrastructure [5,27], lack of maintenance of teaching equipment [31].

Workload and stress issues included high workloads [34] and stress-related problems such as burnout [30]. Additionally, both supervisors and supervisees reported challenges related to emotional support [38] and anxiety or fear of the unknown [23,39]. Also, individual and motivational issues encompassed student-related challenges such as favoritism, ignorance, apathy [30], and absenteeism [31]. Issues related to student engagement, preparation for clinical procedures, and professional development were also noted [25–27]. Additionally, administrative and policy issues included failures in policy implementation [38], gaps between theory and practice [23,37], and resource diversion [29].

In terms of systemic issues, failures in analyzing and resolving problems [38], and ethnic racism [41]. Job conditions such as job insecurity, lack of remuneration were reported [40]. Administrative and procedural challenges included operational issues such as missed deadlines and inadequate assessment procedures [22,23], as well as logistical challenges like a lack of transport [25,28]. This scoping review reported educational and supervisory gaps, including a lack of knowledge and skills in supervision [5]. Workplace and interpersonal issues included staffing shortages [27,32,37]. Interpersonal conflicts, such as unequal staff treatment and community interference, were also reported [27]. Moreover, individual and motivational issues involved personal challenges like lack of motivation, demotivation, and dishonesty [27,32,39], as well as issues of respect and trust [37]. Finally, attitudes and behaviors included negative attitudes towards students and clinical practice [22,27], unprofessional behavior such as misuse of power and forging signatures [32], and community interference [30]. Challenges related to commitment and inadequate interest were also noted [37].

Studies on the practices of delegation in nursing reveal several strategies that enhance the effectiveness of this critical process. One prominent theme is instruction, highlighting the importance of providing continuous feedback and structured guidance to unregulated health workers to whom tasks are delegated. This ensures task clarity, promotes accountability, and supports safe clinical outcomes [42]. Another important theme is empowerment, which plays a critical role in delegation practice. When nurses are empowered through a strengths-based approach, they are more confident in assigning tasks, trusting others’ capabilities, and exercising sound judgment in matching responsibilities to team members’ skills. This fosters autonomy while maintaining accountability in clinical care [43,44]. Furthermore, the theme of assessment, specifically the evaluation of the competence of individuals to whom tasks are delegated, underscores the importance of rigorous evaluation and verification processes to ensure that nursing staff possess the competencies necessary for delivering high-quality care [45].

The challenges of delegation in nursing are deeply intertwined with supervision, as workforce shortages and resource gaps not only limit who tasks can be delegated to, but also constrain the ability of nurse supervisors to monitor, guide, and support those carrying out delegated responsibilities. Staffing challenges, including a shortage of personnel, significantly impede effective delegation, limiting the ability to assign tasks efficiently [46]. Additionally, skill gaps among nursing staff, particularly the presence of unskilled workers, further complicate delegation, as these individuals may struggle to perform delegated tasks competently, thereby compromising care quality [46]. Furthermore, inadequate resources hinder nurses’ ability to delegate tasks effectively, while the complexity of certain tasks may overwhelm staff, creating additional barriers to successful delegation [47].

The findings from this scoping review highlight both the practices and challenges of supervision and delegation in nursing across Africa. Effective supervision often involves structured orientation, clear communication, and regular feedback, supported by various study designs such as descriptive exploratory qualitative designs and cross-sectional descriptive studies. However, challenges persist, including inadequate infrastructure, high staff turnover, and insufficient training, as identified through descriptive exploratory and cooperative inquiry designs. In terms of delegation, effective practices include feedback, continuous instruction, worker empowerment, strength-based task allocation, and task evaluation and verification. Nonetheless, challenges such as staffing shortages, skill gaps, role misalignment, insufficient resources, and the complexity of tasks are significant.

The results revealed essential practices that contribute to effective workforce development, focusing on orientation, continuous training, supervision, communication, teamwork, and leadership. These practices are critical in building a supportive and productive work environment. Initial orientation and continuous training for supervisees, as discussed by Ursula & Hoffman [31], play a fundamental role in preparing nurses for their roles. Providing clear explanations of clinical procedures and introducing additional information through visualization, such as diagrams, demonstration videos, or illustrated checklists, are essential practices that equip employees with the necessary skills to perform their duties effectively. Similarly, continuous training was also revealed to foster capacity building and enhance professional growth, ensuring that staff members stay updated with evolving knowledge and practices [38]. Also, effective supervision and monitoring are key in maintaining accountability and ensuring adherence to procedures. According to Nasiru et al. [29] and Nkomazana et al. [36], regular monitoring, structured feedback, and supervisory visits are key strategies that help ensure consistent and high-quality service delivery in clinical settings. Feedback mechanisms are valuable in guiding performance improvement and fostering a culture of continuous learning. Supervisory visits reinforce accountability and enhance efficiency, especially when supported by reliable transport systems that facilitate timely access to peripheral or hard-to-reach facilities. As noted by Reginah [30] and Kok et al. [34], open communication and teamwork strengthen supervisory processes by promoting transparency, improving feedback flow, and supporting collaborative delegation within clinical teams. Open communication enables information sharing, builds transparency, and promotes staff involvement. Collaboration and teamwork encourage joint responsibilities, role modeling, and cross-learning, which enhance collective problem-solving and empower staff members. This shared learning environment strengthens the organization’s capacity to handle challenges collectively.

A supportive environment, as demonstrated by Donough [44], positively impacts employee morale and performance better supervision. Providing good support, a positive atmosphere, and trust promotes a culture of respect and teamwork. The guidance offered by clinical supervisors, as outlined by Donough & Van der Heever [48], helps build confidence among employees and ensures that they have the necessary resources to succeed. Strong leadership in areas like staff management, advocacy, and problem-solving directly supports supervision and delegation by empowering supervisors to assign tasks effectively, address barriers, and maintain team cohesion. As stated by Reginah [30], effective leadership is a critical enabler of supervision and delegation in African clinical settings, ensuring that staff are well-managed, supported, and motivated to carry out assigned tasks. Within supervisory roles, problem-solving highlighted by Kok et al. [34] is not just a leadership asset but a daily necessity, helping nurse supervisors resolve resource constraints, interpersonal conflicts, and task execution barriers. Assertive leadership supports supervisory nurses in setting clear expectations, making timely decisions, and advocating for their teams, especially in environments where hierarchical constraints and limited resources can hinder effective delegation.

The thematic analysis reveals several interconnected challenges related to supervisory roles, knowledge, resource management, and interpersonal dynamics in clinical and educational environments. Each theme presents specific issues that collectively highlight systemic gaps and deficiencies that could impact staff. Findings from the analysis indicate a lack of adequate preparation among supervisors for their responsibilities, as highlighted in studies [22,23]. Supervisors lack adequate skills and time management, which contributes to inefficiency. Similarly, the recurring issue of supervisors being overwhelmed with administrative tasks [28]. Coetzee [32] highlighted the structural imbalance in their roles. This dual burden of clinical duties alongside supervisory responsibilities creates a significant challenge for nurses, limiting their capacity to delegate effectively and maintain consistent oversight, as noted by Hoffman & Daniels [27]. This is further compounded by time constraints, a theme consistent across several studies [5,33]. Supervisors and clinical staff often struggle with outdated knowledge and insufficient training, an issue that not only affects their supervisory confidence and ability to delegate tasks but also limits their capacity to support others, including students, in the clinical setting. Sah et al. [5] and Nehuku & Amukugo [49] emphasized the outdated knowledge supervisors rely on, while inadequate training on supervision stated a failure in professional development systems [49]. The lack of guidelines for implementing new policies also leaves supervisors and staff unequipped to address modern challenges, causing systemic inefficiencies such as delays in decision-making and fragmented task execution[38]. Resource limitations, both material and human, emerge as a significant barrier to effective clinical supervision. Again, the shortage of medical supplies and human resources, as pinpointed by Magerman [40], Kaphagawani & Useh [50], complicates the ability of supervisors to ensure quality service delivery. Financial constraints and delays in allowance payments, as highlighted by Serapelwane [38], contribute to staff demoralization, which negatively affects nurses’ ability to perform supervisory and delegatory roles effectively. Burnout and dissatisfaction [51] reduce their capacity to provide consistent oversight and mentorship. Furthermore, interpersonal conflicts and poor communication reported by Neshuku [52] and Assegaai & Schneider [33] undermine trust and collaboration, both of which are essential for successful delegation and supervision. Inadequate guidance and a lack of constructive feedback foster a toxic environment for staff and students, making it difficult for nurses to model or enforce professional standards. As Reginah [30] notes, such conditions result in low motivation and negative attitudes toward clinical practice, thereby weakening supervisory influence and the effectiveness of delegated care. Furthermore, poor student engagement and apathy, as noted by Friddah [41], create additional challenges for nurses in supervisory roles, who are expected to motivate, mentor, and provide hands-on guidance. When students disengage, the supervisory process becomes strained, reducing the effectiveness of both supervision and delegation in clinical education. Again, infrastructure inadequacies and the lack of essential equipment, as evidenced by Ursula & Hoffman [31], exacerbate the workload for clinical supervisors, who are already grappling with high demands. Insufficient teaching equipment, Serapelwane [38], and poor facility performance create significant structural obstacles to effective supervision. High workloads, stress, and burnout Serapelwane [38], Coetzee [32] are recurrent themes that reveal a general dissatisfaction among clinical supervisors and staff. These pressures are associated with emotional and psychological distress, as well as anxiety [51]. Donough & Van der Heever [48] acknowledged that the fear of the unknown clinical environment also adds to the mental burden of both supervisors and students, contributing to a decline in their performance.

Our scoping review revealed that organizational practices related to instruction and empowerment consistently emphasized three core themes: feedback and learning, employee empowerment, and assessment mechanisms. These elements collectively contribute to enhanced organizational performance and the professional growth of staff. Feedback loops, as described by Etway & Elewa [43], play a pivotal role in enhancing learning outcomes by fostering a continuous cycle of feedback. This practice enables healthcare workers to receive constructive insights into their performance, promoting adaptive learning and ongoing improvement. By allowing all workers to learn, organizations create an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives and experiences contribute to collective knowledge, aligning with Younes et al [45], who emphasize the importance of accessibility in learning processes. Similarly, continuous instruction, another significant practice identified by Etway & Elewa [43], underscores the necessity of sustained engagement in the learning process. Regularly providing guidance ensures that workers remain equipped to navigate the complexities of their roles, thereby improving both confidence and competence. This is particularly crucial in fast-paced environments where change is constant. Also, Worker empowerment is vital for fostering a positive workplace culture [42,44]. Empowerment initiatives not only enhance job satisfaction but also motivate employees to take ownership of their responsibilities. This is because empowerment adopts a strength-based approach that focuses on the nurses’ capabilities and not on their deficiencies [42]. This shift in perspective not only boosts morale but also promotes collaboration, as the nurses feel valued for their contributions.

The analysis of workforce challenges revealed key issues related to staffing, skills, workload, and role clarity, which significantly affect organizational performance and employee well-being. A shortage of personnel, as highlighted by Jennings et al. [46], is a critical problem that limits the ability of organizations to maintain adequate service levels. This shortage creates an over-reliance on a limited workforce, leading to exhaustion and diminished productivity. Moreover, it affects the quality of care or service delivery, as fewer staff members are left to manage an increasing number of tasks. The presence of unskilled or undertrained workers in the clinical workforce poses a significant challenge for nurses in supervisory roles, as it limits their ability to delegate tasks effectively and safely [46]. Skill gaps among team members present a major challenge for nurses in delegatory roles, as they reduce confidence in assigning complex tasks and increase the risk of errors. This often forces supervisors to either perform the tasks themselves or invest time in additional on-the-job training, adding to their workload and stress. This issue is particularly pronounced in sectors requiring specialized knowledge, leading to further strain on existing skilled personnel who must compensate for the gaps. Role misalignment, where employees are assigned duties outside their scope of work, exacerbates workload challenges [53]. This lack of role clarity leads to frustration, burnout, and decreased job satisfaction. Employees may feel overwhelmed by increasing demand, which can lower morale and efficiency. In environments already strained by limited personnel, this issue compounds the negative effects of workforce shortages.

Additionally, resource gaps, as noted by Atta & Fekry [45], highlight the critical importance of adequate financial, technological, or material resources for effective personnel performance. Insufficient resources can severely limit employees’ ability to execute their roles, making it challenging to achieve organizational goals. Hospital administrators, health facility managers, and government health agencies must prioritize investment in critical resources not just to improve operational efficiency, but also to boost staff morale. When healthcare professionals have the tools they need, they can focus on delivering quality care rather than battling constant resource limitations. Furthermore, the complexity of tasks faced by employees can create additional stress and difficulty [47]. Challenging tasks require higher levels of critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration, which can overwhelm personnel lacking the necessary training or support. Organizations must ensure that employees are equipped with the skills and support systems needed to navigate these complexities effectively.

While this scoping review employed a structured framework and extensive search strategy, it utilized various study designs, including descriptive exploratory qualitative design, cooperative inquiry group design, cross-sectional descriptive studies, mixed methods, and quasi-experimental designs. Each design provided unique insights but also introduced specific limitations such as small sample sizes and limited generalizability in qualitative studies, self-report bias in cross-sectional surveys, potential researcher influences in cooperative inquiries, and lack of control groups in quasi-experimental designs. The review’s reliance on English-language studies may introduce language bias and exclude relevant research published in other languages. Additionally, publication bias could affect the review’s conclusions, as studies with significant or positive findings are more likely to be published. The quality of the included studies was not assessed, suggesting caution in interpreting the results. Furthermore, the focus on African contexts and timeframes might have restricted the inclusion of broader or more current perspectives, impacting the generalizability of the findings.

To address the challenges identified, it is crucial to implement robust training and development programs for clinical supervisors, with a particular focus on effective supervision and delegation. Policies should mandate comprehensive initial training and ongoing professional development, focusing on both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. This will ensure that supervisors are well-prepared for their roles and can handle the complexities of supervision effectively. Institutions should also provide mentorship and regular workshops to update supervisors on best practices and emerging trends, thereby enhancing their competencies and confidence in their roles.

Similarly, efficient time and resource management are essential for effective supervision. Also, policies should formally recognize the demands of supervisory roles by allocating dedicated time and resources for supervision. This includes structuring workloads to allow supervisors to balance clinical oversight with administrative responsibilities. Additionally, integrating time management tools and providing administrative support should be embedded in policy to enhance supervisory effectiveness and reduce burnout. Additionally, institutions must address resource constraints by conducting regular audits and ensuring the equitable distribution of essential resources, such as medical supplies and equipment. This will enable supervisors to perform their duties more effectively and reduce the likelihood of burnout. Also, creating a supportive and collaborative work environment is vital for overcoming supervisory challenges. Policies should promote effective communication, conflict resolution, and a positive workplace culture. Supervisors should receive training in communication skills and interpersonal relations to foster a supportive atmosphere. Additionally, motivational strategies, such as recognition programs and career development opportunities, can enhance supervisors’ engagement and commitment. Addressing personal and motivational issues through tailored support programs will further contribute to a productive and harmonious work environment, ultimately improving the quality of supervision and staff satisfaction.

Future studies should prioritize appraising the quality of research on supervisory practices to ensure the rigor and reliability of findings. Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal research that tracks the impact of supervisory training and development programs over time, assessing their long-term effects on supervisory effectiveness, staff performance, and overall clinical outcomes. Furthermore, future research should explore the influence of technological advancements on supervisory practices. Again, cross-cultural and contextual comparisons are essential to understanding how different settings impact supervisory practices. Finally, research should examine how socio-cultural factors, organizational structures, and regional variations influence supervisory effectiveness and resource management.

The findings of this review reveal both the effectiveness and persistent challenges of supervision in healthcare. While some practices improve clinical outcomes and staff performance, issues such as inadequate training, limited resources, and poor time management continue to hinder effectiveness. Addressing these requires systemic changes, including robust training programs, supportive environments, and improved communication strategies. Key obstacles such as unclear guidelines, knowledge gaps, and resource constraints must be tackled through targeted interventions and policy reforms. Incorporating technology and adapting practices to cultural contexts are also vital. To make meaningful progress, collaboration among researchers, healthcare providers, policymakers, and institutional leaders is essential. This integrated approach can help refine supervision frameworks and ensure they are both context-sensitive and sustainable.
