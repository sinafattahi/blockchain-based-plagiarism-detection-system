The columbine genus (Aquilegia) contains many species with horticultural and pharmaceutical importance. However, a well-resolved phylogeny for this genus remains lacking owing to recent and rapid radiation. We obtained plastomes of 75Aquilegiaspecies and six species of other genera in Thalictroideae to reconstruct a robust phylogeny forAquilegia. Within the phylogenetic framework, we investigated the evolutionary patterns of structural variations inAquilegiaplastomes.We also examined appropriate molecular markers for species identification of this genus.

Plastid phylogenomic analyses show thatAquilegiais monophyletic and divided into two major clades and eight subclades, largely in agreement with species geographical distributions.Aquilegiaplastomes have copy number variations (CNVs) of genes at the boundaries of IR/SC regions. An inversion was identified in the large single-copy region (LSC) plastomes ofAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysa. The inversion was adjacent to three distinct structures (type I-III) in LSC region, each characterized by presence or absence of different short inverted repeat (sIR) regions. The most recent common ancestor ofAquilegiaspecies was type III, and other two types were derived by shortening or loss of sIRs. Ten hypervariable regions were identified inAquilegiaplastomes.

We present a well-resolved phylogeny forAquilegia. The CNVs of genes were observed frequently at the boundaries of IR/SC regions and sIR regions in the genus, and the inversions and sIR in LSC regions have phylogenetic signal and lead to notable variations in gene content and length of plastomes. The new hypervariable regions can be used for phylogenetic analyses and molecular identification ofAquilegia. This study provides new insights into the structural evolution of plastome in angiosperms, and also have important implications for the conservation and utilization ofAquilegiaspecies.

Plastid genomes (plastomes) of angiosperms are generally recognized to be highly conserved in gene content and structure [1–3]. Typical angiosperm plastomes display a quadripartite circular structure, including two inverted repeat regions (IRs), a large single-copy region (LSC), and a small single-copy region (SSC) [4,5]. However, many studies have identified structural variations (SVs) in the plastomes of heterotrophic plants, i.e., parasites and mycoheterotrophs have more presence/absence variations (PAVs) in their plastomes causing by the loss of gene functions [6–9]. Increasing of reported plastomes in recent years, lots of SVs of plastomes have been widely reported in angiosperms [10]. The plastome SVs mainly focus on copy number variations (CNVs) resulting from the expansion/contraction of IR regions [11–13]. For example, large-scale IR expansions exceeding several kb results in increased gene copy numbers through duplication events, includingTetracentronOliv. andTrochodendronSiebold & Zucc. (Trochodendraceae) [6] andAnnonaL. (Annonaceae) [14]. Conversely, IR losses have been observed in the boundaries of IR/SC regions ofMyosurusL. andCeratocephalaMoench (Ranunculaceae) [15]. However, the evolutionary patterns of the variations within LSC region and/or IR region remain poorly understood.

In particular, SVs in the LSC region of plastomes have been reported and attracted significant attention [16,17]. Unprecedented SVs have been found in the LSC region of plastomes in Poales, in which one-third of the families have plastomes with inversions exceeding 1 kb in length [17]. A 51 kb inversion spanningrbcLtorpsl6in the LSC region was reported in theLotus japonicus(Regel) K. Larsen (Fabaceae) plastome [18]. Similar inversions were observed in the LSC region of Ranunculaceae plastomes, including six inversions in Anemoneae [19] and a single 42 kb inversion inAdonis aestivalisL. [20]. Although inversions in the LSC region lead to notable variations in the structure, gene content, and length of plastomes, the phylogenetic significance of SVs in the LSC region still needs to be assessed.

AquilegiaL. (Ranunculaceae), commonly known as the columbine genus, comprisesca.80 perennial herbaceous species and is widely distributed in the Northern Hemiphere [21,22]. Because petals base usually prolong into a spur, flowers ofAquilegiaare beautiful and unique, makingAquilegiaspecies excellent ornamental plants for gardens. SomeAquilegiaspecies are pharmaceutically important and have become traditional Chinese medicines [23]. In addition,Aquilegiahas been a new model for studying plant development, ecology, and evolution [24–27]. Among the genera with more than 15 species in Ranunculaceae, onlyAquilegialacks a infrageneric classification system [22]. This is may be because thatAquilegiaexperienced a recent and rapid radiation [28]. Hodges & Arnold (1994) first used molecular data (plastidatpB-rbcLand nuclear ITS) to investigate phylogenetic relationships withinAquilegia[29], where 14 species of this genus were sampled. In their phylogenetic tree, the monophyleticAquilegiawas recognized, but intrageneric relationships were poorly resolved [29]. Based on plastid (trnK-matKandtrnS-G) and nuclear (ITS) sequences, Bastida et al. (2010) sampled 32Aquilegiaspecies and did not resolved inter-species relationships based on maximum parsimony analysis. By sampling 62 recognized species and subspecific entities ofAquilegiaand 21 plastid DNA regions [30], Fior et al. (2013) dividedAquilegiainto six geographic groups, but a few species did not belong to any group and the relationships within Europea group were not resolved at all [31]. Recently, Zhang et al. (2021) built a well-supported phylogenetic framework for this genus based on complete plastome sequences, but only included 16 species [32].To reconstruct a robust phylogenetic framework forAquilegia, more species and plastome sequences of this genus need to be included.

Importantly, Zhai et al. [16] identified an inversion betweenaccDandclpP1 inAquilegiaand its allies (SemiaquilegiaMakino andUrophysaUlbr.), as compared to other genera in Ranunculaceae. However, only twoAquilegiaspecies (Aquilegia coeruleaE. James andAquilegia ecalcarataEastw.), as well as one species each ofSemiaquilegiaandUrophysa, were sampled by Zhai et al. [16]. It is unknown whether this inversion is of phylogenetic significance and widespread in the plastomes ofAquilegiaspecies, especially whether this SV is consistent or variable inAquilegia.

In this study, we sequenced complete plastomes of 75Aquilegiaspecies using the genome-skimming sequencing technique and performed the first comprehensively phylogenetic analysis ofAquilegiabased on plastome data. Our aims were as follows: (1) to reconstruct a robust phylogeny forAquilegia; (2) to identify SVs of theAquilegiaplastomes; (3) to investigate the evolutionary patterns of SVs inAquilegiaplastomes; (4) to identify hypervariable regions for efficient and accurate species identification in this genus. The study will enhance the understanding of the evolutionary patterns of plastome SVs in angiosperms, and will facilitate exploration and utilization ofAquilegiaplants.

The complete plastomes of 75Aquilegiaspecies and five species fromDichocarpumW.T. Wang & P.K. Hsiao,Semiaquilegia,ThalictrumL., andUrophysain Thalictroideae were assembled and annotated (Table S1). Including the plastome ofSemiaquilegia danxiashanensisL. Wu, J.J. Zhou, Q. Zhang & W.S. Deng previously reported, the plastomes of the 81 Thalictroideae species that were sampled in this study have the sizes of the plastomes from 153727 bp inDichocarpumto 164138 bp inUrophysa(Table S2). All plastomes exhibited the typical quadripartite structure (Fig.1), which comprises a pair of IRs (25853–27544 bp) separated by a LSC region (83381–91683 bp) and an SSC region (16702–17598 bp). The plastome sizes ofAquilegia(159782–162480 bp),Semiaquilegia(160548–162227 bp) andUrophysa(164138 bp) were larger than that of other Thalictroideae genera (153727–156258 bp). The plastome synteny of the subfamily in terms of the gene arrangement is generally high except for in the LSC region, which shows considerable SVs (Fig.1). Based on the structural differences in the LSC region, four types (I-IV) of plastome structures were recognized in Thalictroideae. The type I is present in sevenAquilegiaspecies, having anca.12807–12825 bp inversion (INV1) betweenaccDandclpP1 (Fig.1a; Table S2). The type II is present in 32Aquilegiaspecies, having a pair of short repeated regions (sIRs1) at both the edges of the 12662–12853 bp inversion, compared to type I (Fig.1b; Table S2). The type III is present in 36Aquilegiaspecies and inUrophysaandSemiaquilegia, having longer sIRs (including sIRs1 and sIRs2) at both the edges of the 12592–13121 bp inversion, compared to type II (Fig.1c; Table S2). The plastome ofS. danxiashanensispreviously reported have a complete sIR1 and an incomplete sIR2, we also identified it as type III although its sIR2 is very short.The type IV is present inDichocarpumandThalictrum, without the inversion and sIR regions (Fig.1d; Table S2).

To investigate the contraction and expansion events of plastomes of five genera in Thalictroideae, we compared the borders of the IR/SSC regions (Fig.2a). For the IRA/SSC region,ycf1spanned the junction region, while a pseudogene fragment (ψycf1) was located at IRBside of the IRB/SSC region in all sampled five genera of Thalictroideae. In the SSC region,Dichocarpumlacksrpl32gene, whereas other four genera have a pseudogene (ψrpl32). For the border of the IR/LSC regions,Aquilegiahas six copies oftrnICAUin the two IR regions, while other four genera have two copies oftrnICAU. Along with the IRs expansion inDichocarpumandThalictrum, the boundary of the IRB/LSC moved from intergenic region ofrpl2/rpl23to the coding region ofrps19, leading to a pseudogene fragment (ψrps19) at the IRAregion (Fig.2a).

For the LSC region, two copies ofclpP(clpP1 andclpP2) and one copy oftrnGGCC(trnGGCC2) were found inAquilegia,Urophysa, andSemiaquilegia. Notably, both two copies ofclpPare intronless, which are different in one copy ofclpPwith two introns inDichocarpumandThalictrum(Fig.2b). Additionally, theclpP1 gene ofAquilegiaandUrophysacontains an additional tandem repeat region, consisting of 9 and 6 repeats of a 15 bp special motif, respectively.

Final, we identified 137 predicted functional genes and three pseudogenes for the 75 plastomes ofAquilegia. These genes were summarized as 112 unique genes including 78 protein-coding genes, 30 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (Table S3). One protein-coding gene (ycf3) contains two introns, 15 genes contain a single intron, including nine protein-coding genes (atpF,ndhA,ndhB,petB,petD,rpl2,rpoC1,rps12, andrps16) and six tRNA genes (trnAUGC,trnGUCC,trnIGAU,trnKUUU,trnLUAA, andtrnVUAC) inAquilegia(Table S3). No function genes were found in the sIRs (including sIRs1 and sIRs2) across different species inAquilegia. The majority of the protein-coding genes (74/78) ofAquilegiacontain standard AUG as the initiator codon, three genes (ndhD,rps19, andycf1) contain GUG instead, andrpl2has ACG.

Phylogenetic relationships ofAquilegiawere reconstructed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses, which generated almost identical topologies based on the complete plastome sequences (Fig.3). The monophyleticAquilegiawas strongly supported [bootstrap support (BS) = 99%, posterior probability (PP) = 1.0], sister toUrophysawith weak support (BS = 58%, PP = 0.99).Aquilegiaincludes two major monophyletic groups (I and II) and eight well-supported clades, each defined largely by geography. Clade I-1 consists of one North American species, clade I-2 includes four species from Asia (BS = 100%, PP = 1.0), and clade I-3 comprises most North American species with one nested Italian species (Aquilegia nugorensisArrigoni & E. Nardi) (BS = 100%, PP = 1.0). Clade II-1 consists of five Asian species (BS = 99%, PP = 1.0), clade II-2 includes 15 Asian species with one nested European species (Aquilegia viscosaGouan) (BS = 93%, PP = 1.0), clade II-3 comprises six European species (BS = 68%, PP = 1.0), clade II-4 comprises six European species (BS = 96%, PP = 1.0), and clade II-5 comprises 20 European species (BS = 100%, PP = 1.0). The majority of interspecies relationships inAquilegiaare well resolved (Fig.3).

Seven plastid data subsets, including the CDS of 78 protein-coding genes, the 15 introns, the 117 intergenic spacer (IGS) regions, a combination of 15 introns and 117 IGS regions, the LSC region, the SSC region, and the IR region, were also used to perform phylogenetic analyses using ML and BI method. Phylogenetic analyses of seven plastid data subsets did not generate highly supported topological conflicts compared to the complete plastome dataset, except for the position of clade I (Figs. S1–S7). The 117-IGS and combined IGS and intron subsets recovered clade I-1 as basalmost in clade I with moderate support (BS = 82%, PP = 1.0; BS = 83%, PP = 1.0), the LSC subset recovered clade I-1 as sister to clade I-3 (BS = 79%, PP = 1.0), whereas the SSC subset recovered clade I-1 as sister to clade I-2 (BS = 98%, PP = 1.0).

To infer the evolutionary patterns of SVs of the LSC region, we coded the four types for LSC structures in Thalictroideae: type I with an inversion, type II with an inversion and sIRs1, type III with an inversion, sIRs1, and sIRs2, and type IV without an inversions and sIRs. By comparing the equal-rates (ER), the symmetrical (SYM), and all-rates-different (ARD) likelihood models, we identified ER as best-fit model for our data (Table S4).

Ancestral state reconstruction of the LSC structure is shown in Fig.4. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) ofAquilegiais type III, i.e., a 12592–13121 bp inversion neighbored with a pair of long sIRs including sIRs1 and sIRs2 (up to 876 bp). Within clade II, the entire sIR structure has lost once in clade II-2 (type III), and the sIR2 structure has lost once for the MRCA of clades II-3, II-4, and II-5 (type II). Interestingly, sIR1 and sIR2 sequences varies greatly acrossAquilegia, i.e., the length of all sIRs1 is 49 bp, while the lengths of the sIR2 range from 14 to 876 bp (Fig.4; Table S2).

To further investigate the sequence variation of the sIR regions, we selected 21 representative species ofAquilegia, covering all eight clades, all types of structure and all the mutations in the sIR regions (Fig. S8). Apart from the large insertions or deletions that lead to different structures in the sIR region, there also exist 11 small sequence variations in the variable sIR2 ofAquilegia(Fig.5), implying the unusual rich polymorphism of this region.

To identify the potential hypervariable regions in plastomes ofAquilegia, we calculated plastome nucleotide diversity for this genus. Nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the genes and intergenic regions consistently show that IR regions are more conserved than LSC and SSC regions (Fig.6). For genes, nucleotide diversity ranges from 0 (e.g.,trnHGUG,trnQUUG, andtrnSGCU) to 0.07967 (infA) with an average of 0.00118, whereby ten genes (i.e.,infA,trnICAU3,ψrpl16,trnSGGA,ccsA,atpH,ycf1,trnLCAA,psbH, andndhE) have remarkably high values (π >0.0017; Fig.6a; Table S5). For the exons of genes, nucleotide diversity ranges from 0 (e.g.,trnKUUU(matK),trnGUCC, andtrnLUAA) to 0.07967 (infA) with an average of 0.00107. For the IGS regions, nucleotide diversity ranges from 0 (e.g.,rpoC1–rpoB,trnYGUA–trnEUUC, andpsbD–psbC) to 0.03486 (rpl2–rpl23) with an average of 0.00223. Ten of IGS regions have considerably high values (π >0.00706), includingrpl2–rpl23,trnLCAA–trnGGCC3,trnNGUU1–infA,trnTGGU–psbD,trnHGUG–ψrpl16,rpl16–rps3,psbT–psbN,rpl14–rpl16,ccsA–ndhD, andrps19–rpl2(Fig.6b; Table S6). After removing the short hypervariable regions (< 100 bp), nine non-coding regions (rpl2–rpl23,trnLCAA–trnGGCC3,trnNGUU1–infA,trnTGGU–psbD,trnHGUG–ψrpl16,rpl16–rps3,psbT–psbN,rpl14–rpl16, andccsA–ndhD) and one gene (infA) of plastomes were identified as hypervariable regions inAquilegia. Phylogenetic analyses based on the ten hypervariable regions resolved the relationships among most species of this genus, and the sequence divergences of the combined ten hypervariable regions are >0 betweenAquilegiaspecies (Fig. S9).

All our phylogenetic analyses strongly supportedAquilegiaas monophyletic (Figs.3and S1–S7), in agreement with previous studies (e.g., Bastida et al. [30]; Fior et al. [31]; Ro & McPheron [33]).Aquilegiahas undergone a recent and rapid radiation [28,29,34], the interspecies relationships remain ambiguous using a wide variety of molecular data [29–31]. Based on the complete plastome data, we discover thatAquilegiacontains two major monophyletic groups and eight clades, largely consistent with their geographical distributions (Fig.3). We provide a well-resolved phylogenetic framework forAquilegiawith a more extensive sampling than in any previous study, which is a foundation for the future taxonomic revision for this genus.

The phylogenetic analyses ofAquilegiawere also conducted based on seven plastid subsets. Compared to other subsets as well as complete plastome dataset, the 78-CDS, 15-intron, and SSC subsets have a relatively weak resolution for the relationships withinAquilegia(Figs S1–2, S7). Overall, the phylogeny generated by the complete plastome dataset received higher support than those inferred from seven subsets, suggesting that the complete plastome sequences can resolve well phylogenetic relationships of taxa with recent and rapid radiation, such asAquilegia. The similar cases are also found forRubusL. (Rosaceae) [35] andSaussureaDC. (Asteraceae) [36].

The contraction and expansion in IRs are considered important evolution events, which can change plastome sizes and gene contents [37–39]. Our results show thatAquilegia,Urophysa, andSemiaquilegiahave one copy for each ofrpl2andrps19in the LSC regions, whileDichocarpumandThalictrumhave two copies for each ofrpl2andrps19in the IRs (Fig.2a). These CNVs may result from the contraction of IR regions inAquilegia,Urophysa, andSemiaquilegia. It is usual that CNVs caused by the expansion/contraction of IR regions. For example, one-copy loss ofrpl2andrpl23was found in the IR/LSC region ofMyosurus(Ranunculaceae) [15] and one-copy loss ofrbcLwas identified in the IR/LSC regions ofPelargonium transvaalenseR. Knuth (Geraniaceae) [11].

The length of IR regions ofAquilegia(25853–26834 bp) is similar to that ofUrophysa(27544 bp),Semiaquilegia(26640–26829 bp),Dichocarpum(26448 bp), andThalictrum(26480–26481 bp; Table S2). Especially, we foundAquilegiahad six copies oftrnICAUin the IR regions near the borders of IRA/LSC, while the other four genera in Thalictroideae only have two copies (Fig.2a). The CNVs oftrnICAUare resulted from the small direct repeats of plastomes, instead of expansion/contraction of IR regions. These SVs might have occurred along with the expansion/contraction of IR regions because they are located near the borders of IR/LSC. The small direct repeats of plastomes in IR regions lead to an increase in the length of IRs inAquilegia.Thus, the contraction of IRs inAquilegiado not result in its IR regions being shorter.

In fact, the size of plastomes inAquilegia(159782–162480 bp), as well asUrophysa(164138 bp) andSemiaquilegia(160548–162227 bp), is bigger than that inDichocarpum(153727 bp) andThalictrum(156211–156258 bp), as they have longer LSC regions (Table S2; Fig.2). We found thatAquilegia,Urophysa, andSemiaquilegiahave 12592–13121 bp inversions in LSC regions, whereasDichocarpumandThalictrumhave 12148–12743bp homology region. Additionally,Aquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysahave two copies of sIR near the inversion, whileDichocarpumandThalictrumhave one copy of homology region.Aquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysahave one copy oftrnGGCCand two copies ofclpPgene separately in the LSC regions near the inversion, whileDichocarpumandThalictrumhave one copy ofclpPgene. These CNVs of genes in LSC regions occur along with sIR as it is located near the borders of inversion inAquilegia, leading to the increase in the length of the LSC inAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysa.

For the CNV ofclpPgene, the intronlessclpPgene inAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysahave been duplicated in the LSC region, whileThalictrumandDichocarpumwith have only one copy ofclpPwith two introns (Fig.2b). Zhai et al. [16] inferred that the loss of the second intron likely occurred before the divergence ofAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysa, followed by the loss of the first intron before the gene was duplicated. Additionally, our results indicate that theclpP1 gene contained approximately nine and six tandem repeats of a special motif inAquilegiaandUrophysa, while the other copy are without (Fig.2b), suggested that CNV play an important role in evolution of plastomes inAquilegia.

In total,Aquilegiaplastomes have CNVs of genes at the boundaries of IR/SC regions and sIR regions. The small direct repeats in plastomes ofAquilegiainhibit contraction and shorten of IRs. The length ofAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysaplastome is bigger than that inDichocarpumandThalictrum, influenced on the inversion event occurring in the LSC region.

All plastomes inAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysacontain an inversion in the LSC region betweenaccD–clpP1 (Fig.2a). Inversion in the LSC region of the plastome has also been found in other taxa. For example,Adonis sutchuenensisFranch. in Ranunculaceae has an inversion betweenrps16andtrnTUGU[16]. Plastome inversion has also been reported in the LSC region ofLotus japonicusbetweenrbcL–rps16[18], and multiple inversions have been found in the plastomes of Poales [17,40].

Here, we found three types of LSC structures inAquilegiaplastomes, which were likely generated by a inversion event of and exhibited phylogenetic signals. The ancestral structure ofAquilegiais type III, having a pair of longer sIRs (including sIRs1 and sIRs2) at the edge of the inversion inAquilegia(Fig.4). The sIRs are shortened and lost at the edge of the inversion in Type II and Type I, respectively (Fig.1c), showing 11 small variations in the plastomes ofAquilegia(Fig.5). As the inversion could be probably induced by the neighbored sIR region, the large or small variations in the sIR regions (Figs.1and4) could contribute to the fixation of this inversion in the plastomes of theAquilegia. Extensive repeats in the plastomes were found to be positively correlated with the observed inversions and rearrangements in Poales [17]. We further found that the inversions in LSC regions were induced by repeats and possibly fixed by lose of repeats inAquilegia.

Inversions in the LSC regions also lead to notable variations in gene content and length of plastomes.Aquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysahad one extra copy oftrnGGCCand two copies of intronlessclpPgene in the LSC regions near the inversion, whileThalictrumandDichocarpumhad only one copy ofclpPgene with two introns in similar region. Additionally, althoughAquilegia,Semiaquilegia, andUrophysahave longer LSC regions owing to the inversions, their total plastid lengths are thus longer than those ofDichocarpumandThalictrum(Fig.2a). Thus, the inversions may contribute to the increased copy number of genes in near the inversions and have a strong impact on the length of plastome.

In all, the LSC structure with both the inversion and the longer sIR was estimated as the ancestral state, which have evolved independently into other structures with loss of different sIR regions. The plastid SVs have phylogenetic signals inAquilegia. The loss of distinct sIR regions led to notable variations in the structure, gene content, and length of the plastomes.

Highly polymorphic regions in plastomes are widely utilized as molecular markers for phylogenetic reconstruction [41–43] and species identification [44–46]. Phylogenetic analyses ofAquilegiabased on nuclear ITS sequences and one plastid region (atpB–rbcL; Table S6) [29] and ITS and two plastid regions (trnK–matK,trnS–G; Table S6) [30] have failed to effectively distinguish infrageneric relationships due to low nucleotide variability among different species. More plastid fragments, such asrpl32–trnLUAG,trnKUUU–rps16,psbM–trnDGUC,psaI–accD,ndhJ–trnF,rps16–trnQUUG,trnDGUC–trnTGGU,trnTGGU–psbD,trnCGCA–rpoB,trnCGCA–ycf6,atpH–atpI,psbE–petL,ycf6–psbM,trnSGUC–trnGUUC,ndhC–trnVUAC,trnSUGA–trnGGCC,psbB–psbH,rps4–trnFGAA,rps12–rpl20,matKand intron ofndhA, have also been applied to analyze intrageneric relationships ofAquilegiaand result in highly supported phylogenetic trees (Table S5–S6) [31]. Additionally, candidate molecular markers oftrnTGGU–psbDandpsbT–psbNwere identified based on 62 species of the genus by Fior et al. [31]. Therefore, additional data source beyond the commonly used markers are needed for phylogenetic analysis.

In the present study, the whole genome and non-coding regions manifested higher sequence divergence than protein-coding genes ofAquilegiaplastomes (Figs.3and S1-4), which was consistent with most higher plants [47,48]. After removing the short hypervariable regions (< 100 bp), nine non-coding regions (rpl2–rpl23,trnLCAA–trnGGCC3,trnNGUU1–infA,trnTGGU–psbD,trnHGUG–ψrpl16,rpl16–rps3,psbT–psbN,rpl14–rpl16, andccsA–ndhD) and one gene (infA) of plastomes were identified as hypervariable regions. Based on the ten identified hypervariable regions, the sisters of mostAquilegiaspecies can be recognized and all sequence divergences betweenAquilegiaspecies are >0 (Fig. S9), suggesting that the ten regions can serve as potential molecular markers forAquilegiaand have implications for molecular taxonomy, phylogeography, and genetic diversity assessment of this genus.

In this study, we present a well-supported phylogenetic framework forAquilegiabased on plastome data. We found the CNVs of genes are observed frequently for the contraction of IR and sIR regions, such asrpl2,rps19,trnGGCC,trnICAU, andclpP, indicating its important role to the plastome evolution ofAquilegia. In particular, we found a common inversion in plastomes ofAquilegiaand its allies. The inversion was divided into three distinct structure types (I-III) in the LSC region, each characterized by different short inverted repeat (sIR) regions. The type III with both the inversion and the longer sIR was inferred as the ancestral structure, which evolved into other structures with loss of different sIR regions. The inversions and sIR have phylogenetic signal and lead to notable variations in gene content and length of plastomes. We also identified potential molecular markers for species identification of this genus. This study provides new insights into the structural evolution pattern of plastome for one of the most diversified plant taxa in angiosperms.

We sampled 75 species ofAquilegia. Based on Ling et al. [49], we selected six species ofDichocarpum,Semiaquilegia,ThalictrumandUrophysain Thalictroideae as outgroups. Supplementary Table S1 documents the geographic origins and depository herbaria for all newly acquired samples. Their formal identification was undertaken by Wei Wang and Andrey S. Erst. No specific permissions or licenses were required for our collections and experiments. Total genomic DNA was extracted from about 1.5 g of silica geldried leaves of living plants or herbarium specimens using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [50] and purified using the Tiangen Isolation/Extraction/Purification Kit (Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd.). Short insert of 300–500 bp libraries were prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq X-Ten platform. Approximately 10 GB of raw sequencing data was generated for each sample. To obtain high-quality genome sequences, raw reads were processed using Fastp v0.19.7 [51] to remove adapter sequences and low-quality reads.

The complete plastomes were assembled from the genome-skimming sequencing data using GetOrganelle v1.7.6.1 [52] with the default parameters. The obtained plastid contigs were further visualized and scaffolded to complete circular genomes in Bandege v0.8.1 [53]. Highly accurate annotation of organelle genomes was performed by using the Organellar Genome GeSeq tool [54], with subsequent manual correction in Geneious v9.0.2 [55]. Four plastomes fromAquilegia barnebyiMunz (GenBank accession No.NC_053820),Aquilegia kansuensis(Brühl) Erst (NC_058528),Aquilegia rockiiMunz (NC_046738), andAquilegia yangiiY. Luo & L. Li (NC_058529) were used as reference sequences. The circular plastomes were visualized by using OGDRAW v1.3.1 [56], with subsequent manual editing.

To assess the expansion/contraction of the IR regions, we compared the boundaries between the IR/SC and their adjacent genes for the whole plastomes of five genera in Thalictroideae by IRscope [57], and then used the results to further manually modify the annotations.

For the purpose of reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships, multiple sequence alignments of 81 complete plastomes were implemented using MAFFT v7 [58] with standard parameters, and further adjusted manually in Geneious v8.0.4 [55]. Phylogenetic analyses ofAquilegiawere performed using ML and BI methods in RAxML v8.2.11 [59] and MrBayes 3.2.7 [60], respectively. The nucleotide substitution model was determined by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) via jModeltest 2.1.4 [61]. RAxML was conducted with the GTR + Γ substitution model, and the fast bootstrap option with 1,000 replicates. For BI analyses, two independent runs, each consisting of four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, were conducted with one tree sampled for every 1000 generations over 50 million generations. We assessed the convergence of the parameters of the two individual runs in Tracer 1.7.2 [62]. A majority rule (>50%) consensus tree was generated after discarding the first 25% of sampled trees as burn-in. Because molecular evolutionary rates of the different regions in plastome are diverse, analyses of phylogenetic relationships also were performed based on seven plastid subsets, including concatenation of 78 protein-coding genes, concatenation of 15 introns, concatenation of 117 IGS regions, concatenation of 15 introns and 117 IGS regions, a LSC region, an SSC region, and an IR region. Following the suggestion by Wang et al. (2014) [63], the thresholds BS ≥ 70% and PP ≥ 0.95 were used as an indication of significant incongruence between eight datasets.

We coded the different types of LSC structures as character states. We applied the fit-Discrete function in the R package ‘geiger’ to decide which likelihood models (ER, SYM, or ARD) should be used. Simulated stochastic character maps were obtained using themake.simmapfunction in the R package ‘phytools’ under the optimal likelihood model [64,65].

In addition, we randomly selected 21 species covering all clades and all types of LSC region SVs in these clades for comparative genomic analyses. The sequences of inversion and the sIRs in LSC region were further extracted in Bandege v0.8.1 [53] for three SV types inAquilegia. To found the conserved synteny, we performed sequence alignment using MAFFT v7 [57], and adjusted manually in Geneious v9.0.2 [55].

To identifying hypervariable regions, the sequence alignment ofAquilegiaplastomes without outgroups was subjected to a sliding window analysis in DNAsp v6.12.03 [66]. We evaluated the nucleotide diversity (Pi) of all genes, genes without introns, and IGS regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ten hypervariable regions identified in our study, we performed phylogenetic analyses for the 75 sampled species ofAquilegiausing ML and BI methods, withUrophysa rockiiUlbr. andSemiaquilegia adoxoides(DC.) Makino as outgroups.
