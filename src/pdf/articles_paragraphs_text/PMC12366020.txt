Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a specific type of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained easily from adipose tissue (AT). Compared with MSCs, ADSCs are easier to obtain, have fewer ethical issues, and have a higher proliferative capacity, which makes them a promising type of stem cell in regenerative medicine. ADSCs possess impressive capabilities in cell regeneration as well as differentiation, making them promising candidates for injury repair, tissue regeneration and alleviation of inflamed tissues. At present, most clinical studies on ADSCs focus on the treatment of wounds, multiple sclerosis, soft tissue trauma, aging, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, bone and cartilage regeneration, stroke, and spinal cord injury, while its clinical applications in the gastrointestinal tract are relatively few. Therefore, this review summarizes the findings of preclinical experiments, clinical trials, and areas that may require further development of ADSCs in the treatment of digestive disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), colorectal fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic fibrosis, gastric cancer (GC), gastrostomy closure and radiation-induced proctitis. The review is concluded by discussing the goals for improvement and future directions for ADSCs before large-scale clinical application.

ADSCs are simple to isolate and access, and they have few ethical issues for their application.

ADSCs can differentiate into various cell types, supporting their use in regenerative medicine.

ADSCs hold great promise for treating gastrointestinal diseases through modulation of immune response, anti-inflammation and tissue repair.

ADSCs effectively treat gastrointestinal diseases like IBD and colorectal cancer, and show potential for liver fibrosis and gastric cancer.

ADSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) mimic parental cells’ bioactivity and mitigate safety issues of live stem cell delivery, crucial for their application.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types, which play a key role in tissue healing and regenerative medicine. MSCs are adult stem cells residing in diverse tissues, including bone marrow, muscle, skin, adipose tissue (AT), and umbilical cord. They are termed according to their tissue sources: bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Although early MSC research predominantly focused on BMSCs, ADSCs have recently gained prominence in clinical applications due to their favorable ethical profile. The terminology for ADSCs has varied in different studies, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, ADSCs. In the following context, we will consistently use the term ADSCs as recommended by the International Federation of Adipose Therapeutics (IFATS).

Studies have demonstrated that ADSCs possess adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, myogenic, and cardiogenic differentiation potential. Moreover, ADSCs also exhibit low immunogenicity and have the capacity for self-renewal. They can migrate to damaged areas and function through autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways, which are key mechanisms in cell repair and regeneration. These cells have raised significant interest in therapeutic applications particularly in treating a wide range of conditions, including autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic disorders, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), bone/cartilage repair, as well as cardiovascular and muscle diseases [1].

ADSCs exhibit several fundamental characteristics shared by all MSCs, including multipotency, immunomodulatory capacity, and typical surface marker expression. However, ADSCs demonstrate superior advantages over BMSCs and UC-MSCs in several critical aspects: tissue accessibility, proliferative potential, viability maintenance, and clinical applicability. Collecting BMSCs is painful and challenging procedure due to their scarcity, comprising only 0.002% of total stromal cells [2], and the results are greatly influenced by the patient’s age, status, and other factors. BMSCs stop growing at the 11-12th generation of expansion culture and strongly express the senescence-associated proteins p53, p21, and p16 [1]. Compared to BMSCs, UC-MSCs are present at lower frequencies, but their pluripotency is maintained for a longer period, as evidenced by the significantly reduced expression of the senescence markers p53, p21, and p16 in UC-MSCs [1]. In addition, UC-MSCs show slightly positive for the embryonic stem cell markers Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and KLF4, suggesting that they are more primitive than adult stem cells [3]. In contrast, ADSCs can be quickly obtained in large quantities and exhibit high cellular activity, with a content of nearly 2% in the stromal vascular fraction [4]. The viability of BMSCs decrease with age, but the ability to differentiate ADSCs from aged donors can be maintained [5]. Table1; Fig.1illustrate both the similarities and differences between ADSCs and other MSCs (BMSCs and UC-MSCs) concerning their sources and application.

As a subtype of MSCs, ADSCs must fulfill the established criteria for MSC identification. One of the key criteria is the expression of specific surface antigens, including markers such as CD44, CD105, and CD90 expressed by MSCs [10]. Previous reviews reveal that human ADSCs share several common markers with other types of MSCs include CD13, CD29, CD34, CD44, CD54, CD58, CD71, CD90, CD105/SH2, CD166/SH3, Stro − 1 [11,12]. It is worth mentioning that ADSCs express the marker CD49d but do not express CD106, typically present in BMSCs [11]. In particular, the expression levels of certain markers vary between ADSCs and other MSCs. For instance, high levels of CD54 are observed in ADSCs compared to lower levels in BMSCs. Conversely, BMSCs exhibit higher levels of expression for CD34 than ADSCs [12]. Table2compares the surface marker of ADSCs and BMSCs and outlines their functional implications.

ADSCs are notable among stem cells due to their easy acquisition and minimal ethical issues [26]. In 2001,Zukand his team introduced the concept of differentiation plasticity in preadipocytes. They successfully obtained human AT by liposuction (suction-assisted lipectomy) and processed it to yield a fibroblast-like cells population known as processed lipoaspirate (PLA) [27]. Researchers digest lipoaspirate with collagenase to obtain the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which contains immune cells, ADSCs, endothelial progenitor cells, and other cell types. ADSCs can be purified from the SVF by culturing the adherent proliferating cells and discarding the non-adherent ones. The pioneering study conducted byZuk et al.. has laid an immense foundation for future investigations on ADSCs. Since then, several techniques for isolating ADSCs have emerged, including magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, both of which offering unique advantages. Notably, MACS provides benefits over traditional adherent culture purification due to its shorter processing time, which eliminates the need for extensive cell expansion while allowing rapid generation of specific cell population suitable for patient treatment within hours [28].

The general standard procedure for isolating ADSCs involves the following steps. First, AT is collected from the abdomen, waist, and inner thighs [29]. Second, the collected AT is centrifuged and washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The fat aspirate is then digested with 0.075% collagenase and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C [30]. Ultimately, the isolated and purified cells were cultured and subsequently passaged to obtain ADSCs for application. The procedure for isolating ADSCs, along with the expression of surface markers, is illustrated in Fig.2A.

Of concern is the absence of extensive guidelines for the standardization of ADSCs isolation and culture, which hampers their clinical utilization. Due to differences in cell sources, culture conditions, acquisition methods, and the number of cell passages, the viability and content of the obtained ADSCs were also different. For example, research indicates that human platelet lysate, serves as an effective supplement for in vitro cell expansion, enhancing the adhesion and proliferation rates of ADSCs while effectively promoting cell development [31]. In summary, the development of ADSCs in regenerative medicine is impeded by the lack of consistency between experimental results from fat transplantation and clinical outcomes, which can be attributed to the heterogeneity of ADSC collection techniques, donor locations, the initial health conditions of patients, and the absence of standardized methods for evaluate clinical outcomes [10].

ADSCs can develop into several cell types, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and neuro-like cells [32]. Investigating signaling pathways and associated proteins can lay the groundwork for clinical research and disease treatment.

Osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs can be mediated through the BMP, Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch and FGF signaling pathways, all of which are also crucial for skeletal development and maturation, and they significantly influence the differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts [33]. In addition, Notch and MAPK pathways are also signaling pathways involved in osteogenesis in ADSCs, with Notch acting both independently and through interaction with BMP [34,35].

Lipogenic differentiation of ADSCs involves the VRAC, Wnt/β-catenin, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Key proteins in the VRAC signaling pathway include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, which are also major regulators of adipogenesis. The main regulatory mechanism involves recruited transcription factors activating CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins and PPARγ, leading to conformational changes in the active sites of the target proteins, stimulating the lipogenesis of adipose stem cells [36]. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, on the other hand, is primarily a key pathway regulating the maturation of adipocytes and may play a role in inhibiting adipocyte proliferation. In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway also plays a vital role in adipogenic differentiation of ADSCs [37,38].

In terms of chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells, a large body of literature have depicted the signaling pathways involved in chondrogenesis, including Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, FGF, BMP, and TGF-β signaling pathway [39]. In the cardiomyogenic differentiation of ADSCs, in addition to the traditional Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β signaling pathway, which is recognized as a key pathway for cardiomyogenesis, the ROCK pathway is also involved in the differentiation process to cardiomyocytes. ROCKs are one of the key downstream effectors of Rho GTPase that regulate stress fiber contraction. It has been also documented that differentiation of ADSCs to cardiomyocytes involves changes in stress fibers [40].

It was shown that ADSCs could successfully differentiate into endothelial cells under specific induction conditions, and that ADSCs exhibited a faster rate and greater proliferation capacity when differentiating into endothelial cells compared to BMSCs [41]. This ability to differentiate into endothelial cells is regulated through VEGF and Notch signaling. VEGFA is a crucial protein within VEGF signaling pathway, significantly influencing proliferation, migration, survival of endothelial cells, in addition to regulating vascular permeability [42]. Notch signaling pathway directly induce arterial endothelial differentiation along with negatively regulate VEGF-induced angiogenesis and inhibit the occurrence of abnormal vascular branching [42].

One bright spot deserves attention is that the differentiation of ADSCs into neurons involves Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. In the nervous system, the Wnt signaling cascade is crucial for the self-renewal, maintenance, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway significantly contributes to the proliferation of neural progenitor cells [43]. Furthermore, the Notch pathway is essential for cell fate decisions in the CNS and plays a significant role in various critical events in glial cell development, such as maintaining NG2 cells in an undifferentiated state [44].

The signaling pathways mentioned above are involved in the differentiation of ADSCs into various cell types. Figure2B provides a general summary of the signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of ADSCs into different types of tissues. Table3provides a comprehensive overview of the various signaling pathway along with the principal proteins that play a significant role in each pathway.

The primary roles of ADSCs encompass immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects that interact with immune cells, as well as their regenerative capabilities stemming from their stem cell characteristics. Owing to their distinctive capacity to modulate the immune system and promote regeneration, ADSCs show great potential for addressing gastrointestinal issues.

ADSCs have immunomodulatory properties in the gut, especially in the context of intestinal inflammation. A large body of research indicates that MSCs can express immunomodulatory capabilities through cell contact and paracrine effects. MSCs, especially ADSCs, interact with innate and adaptive immune responses to inhibit T helper cells proliferation and upregulate regulatory T cells [49].

The intestinal mucosa serves as a vital immune barrier of the intestine, made up of epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells. Epithelial cells, including goblet cells and Paneth cells, function as protective barriers by producing mucus and antimicrobial peptides [50]. They also interact with both intestinal microbiota and the immune system, contributing to their role in establishment of immune barrier function. Stromal cells located in the lamina propria beneath the epithelium are crucial for processes like intestinal fibrosis and wound healing [50]. When it comes to gut immunity, it’s primarily the immune cells present in the lamina propria that carry out essential functions.

The immune system can be categorized into innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity consists of innate immune cells (IICs), including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages Mφs), and dendritic cells (DCs) [51]. These IICs possess pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), enabling them to discriminate between pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [52]. The innate immune response is non-specific, wherein IICs contribute to host defense and inflammation by generating cytokines and chemokines, initiating complement cascades, as well as engaging in phagocytosis. Adaptive immunity, in contrast to innate immunity, is highly specific and adaptive due to its reliance on complex maturation processes of immune cells [53]. The most notably component of adaptive immunity is T cells. In the intestinal tract, these two systems work together effectively to prevent pathogen invasion and support normal physiological functions.

Among T cell subsets, T helper (Th) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) play crucial roles in the adaptive immune response.

Th cells mainly include Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, which are activated and differentiated from Th0 cells [53]. Th1 cells produce IFN-γ, which is essential for eliminating intracellular pathogens [54]. Meanwhile, IL-4/5, and IL-13 secreted by Th2 cells confer antiparasitic effect and mediate allergic responses [54]. Additionally, IL-17, IL-17 F, and IL-22 produced by Th17 cells may contribute to the elimination of extracellular bacteria and fungi while also playing a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [54]. These Th cells guide innate immune responses by directing neutrophils to sites of inflammation where they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that initiate immune reactions [55].

Tregs express Foxp3 and can suppress Th0 cell proliferation [56]. They play a vital role in inhibiting inappropriate immune responses to antigens while maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis. Specifically, they exert their functions through secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β while also preventing activation in other potentially harmful T cell populations [57]. TGF-β inhibits Th2 cell proliferation by reducing GATA-3 production [58]. Both TGF-β and IL-10 can suppress Th cells function by inhibiting the migration of DCs to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) as well as decreasing their activation [59]. Figure3A illustrates the interactions between the T cells mentioned and their secreted cytokines.

ADSCs have been shown to regulate adaptive immune responses through multiple mechanisms. Research indicates that patients with inflammatory bowel disease often have reduced numbers of Tregs in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa, and the reduction of Tregs hinders their effective suppression of immune function, leading to prolonged immune responses [60]. MSCs mature DC1, thereby lowering tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level, while maturing DC2 to enhance interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion, resulting in an increase in Tregs numbers [61]. Furthermore, MSCs can also secrete IL-10 which further accelerate the proliferation of Tregs [61]. These suggest that ADSCs can play an immunomodulatory role by activating Tregs to suppress immune responses. In addition, the TNFR and TLR expressed by MSCs are crucial for migration and immune regulation. When TLR ligands bind to TLRs, on the one hand, they activate the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, thereby inducing T cell suppression; on the other hand, they can activate MSCs to secrete IL-6, promoting the maturation of DCs, which in turn leads to T cells suppression in trans [61].

Another research indicated that the soluble HLA -G5 secreted by MSCs can inhibit T cell proliferation while simultaneously increasing the number of Tregs. Additionally, IL-10 secreted by MSCs promotes the production of HLA-G5, establishing a positive feedback loop for immunoregulation [62]. In summary, ADSCs regulate the immune regulation by secreting or activating various cytokines and substances that either promote or hinder cell proliferation. Figure3B illustrates the role of ADSCs in regulating the gut adaptive immune response.

The innate immune response serves as the body’s first line of defense against pathogens. Activation of the innate immune system is dependent on the interaction of DAMPs and PAMPs with PRRs expressed by IICs. When pathogens invade the intestine, these innate immune cells can migrate to the affected area, leading to intestinal inflammation.

There are several types of PRRs, typically including NLRs and TLRs. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) family includes NOD1 and NOD2, which can be stimulated by various components of bacterial peptidoglycan. The NOD1 and NOD2 signals mediate the activation of the NF-κB pathway through TRAF2, TRAF5 and RIPK2 respectively [63], thereby generating pro-inflammatory effects. And TLR usually shares a common signaling pathway with IL-1R. When ligand binds to TLR, the TIR domain-containing junctions, MyD88 and TIRAP, are recruited to the receptor, which subsequently induces different cascade reactions to activate NF-κB transcription, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN respectively [64].

Innate immune cells contribute to intestinal inflammation through diverse mechanisms. Neutrophils directly promote tissue inflammation and injury by releasing proteases like matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and neutrophil elastase (NE) while altering membrane properties through reactive oxygen species release [65]. At the same time, neutrophils can aggravate the damage of the intestinal mucosal barrier by releasing NETs [66]. In particular, the dual role of NETs in IBD will be discussed below. Mφs play an equally important role in immune regulation. In the intestinal inflammatory response, Mφs are activated to resist pathogen invasion through phagocytosis. Mφs also produce TGF-β1, which together with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) promotes myofibroblast proliferation. Thus, excessive Mφs activation leads to intestinal fibrosis [67]. In addition, it has been shown that intestinal Mφs lacking IL-10 receptors produce more IL-23, which further stimulates IL-22 secretion by Th17 and ILC3 cells, thereby inducing neutrophil recruitment [68]. DCs, as common antigen-presenting cells, play irreplaceable roles in both adaptive and innate immunity. Studies have shown that DCs derived from Crohn’s disease patients express higher levels of CD40 and release more pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18, than in healthy individuals, thereby mediating the activation of Th1 cells [52]. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) include natural killer cells (NK cells), ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3.In the setting of intestinal inflammation, it is primarily NK cells and ILC1s that can contribute to the development of inflammation. These cells are dependent on the transcription factor T-bet for the secretion of TNF and IFN-γ when stimulated by IL-12 and IL-5, which act against viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasites, but also exacerbate inflammation [69,70].

MSCs can regulate innate immune cells at the site of inflammation. It was shown that neutrophil arginase activity was increased by MSCs treatment and exhibited an immunosuppressive phenotype, which inhibited the proliferation of CD4+T cells [71]. As for Mφs, MSCs can exert an immunomodulatory function through the production of immunosuppressive molecules such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE), which promotes the polarization of Mφs from a M1Mφ to an M2Mφ, which enhances anti-inflammatory capacity while reducing the overall inflammatory effect [72]. Additionally, studies reveal that TSG-6 produced by MSCs has an inhibitory impact not only on the signaling ability of NF-κB in Mφs, but also on the maturation of DCs [73]. MSCs mitigate innate immune responses preventing antigen presentation from DCs to T cells. Moreover, the expression of NK cell-activated receptors (including NKp30, NKp44, 2B4, and NKG2D) was reduced after administration of MSCs-derived exosomes, and MSCs were shown to modulate the innate immune response by inhibiting NK cell function via TGF-β [74]. The involvement of ADSCs in regulating the intestinal innate immune response is illustrated in Fig.3B.

Inflammation is a vital and intricate biological process of the body, which serves a protective function. The inflammatory responses relies on intricate interactions among the immune system, vasculature, and tissues [75]. Inflammation arises when the body is exposed to infection, stimulation, or injured. During the acute phase of inflammation, if the injury remains unresolved, it can transition into chronic inflammation, activating the adaptive immune response and potentially leading to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) within digestive diseases.

IBD has emerged as a particularly noteworthy intestinal inflammatory disorder, characterized by its distinctive immunological profile featuring dysregulated mucosal immunity and chronic intestinal inflammation. MSCs have shown promise in modulating these inflammatory responses, thereby not only help ameliorating inflammatory diseases but also promoting tissue regeneration through cell differentiation. Previous studies indicate that MSCs can selectively migrate to the areas of local inflammation in IBD mice, including regions like lamina propria, muscle layer, submucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes [76]. MSCs, particularly ADSCs, promote the differentiation of regulatory Tregs and M2Mφs, thereby facilitating anti-inflammatory activities through the diverse array of cytokines they release. This mechanism is fundamental to the anti-inflammatory properties exhibited by ADSCs [77]. As these cytokines accumulate at the site of inflammation, they hold potential for treating chronic conditions like IBD effectively. Therefore, leveraging the anti-inflammatory properties of ADSCs is essential for addressing intestinal diseases as well as other body injuries.

To elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of ADSCs, it is imperative to first outline the underlying processes of inflammation before investigating how ADSCs exert their inhibitory influence on the inflammatory cascade. The inflammatory response is contingent upon the characteristics of the initial triggering stimulus as well as its specific anatomical location; however, this response fundamentally adheres to a shared mechanism [78]. Initially, PRRs located on the cell surface detect harmful stimuli. Subsequently, this recognition activates various inflammatory pathways, which initiate intracellular signaling cascades via pathways such as MAPK, NF-κB, and JAK-STAT. Following this, the activation of immune cells occurs, which stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, culminating in the release of inflammatory markers. Ultimately, the synthesis of these inflammatory mediators facilitates the recruitment of additional immune cells to the sites of localized inflammation.

Neutrophils represent the most pivotal component among innate immune cells in the progression of inflammatory responses. In this review, we have mentioned in Sect.ADSCs involved in the establishment of innate immune homeostasisthat ADSCs play an anti-inflammatory role in the intestinal inflammatory environment by regulating intrinsic immune cells, such as Mφs, DCs, and NK cells, so here we focus on the mechanism of neutrophils in inflammation and how ADSCs play an anti-inflammatory role by regulating neutrophils.

Neutrophils are the predominant type of immune cells in the human body, constituting approximately 70% of the total white blood cell population [65]. Neutrophils can swiftly migrate to the site of tissue injury, attracting additional immune cells by producing an array of chemokines, cytokines and leukotrienes. Furthermore, they may directly release proteolytic enzymes such as MMP and NE, which contribute to tissue damage [65].

Neutrophils are crucial in the context of intestinal inflammation, they arrive at the site of inflammation in a cascade manner and mediate the inflammatory response through the release of reactive oxygen species, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and phagocytosis.

The fundamental process underlying neutrophil recruitment is outlined as follows [79]. Initially, neutrophils flow through the bloodstream while interacting with the endothelial cells through deformational movements characterized by rolling and trapping. Subsequently, the interaction initiates a multistep signaling cascade that leads to conformational changes in integrin, leading to their activation and subsequent cell adhesion. Following adhesion, neutrophils exhibit slower movement along the endothelium, a phenomenon called “crawling,” which can be occur either parallel or against blood flow directionality. Upon migrating into tissues at infection sites, these cells engage pathogens through various mechanisms, including phagocytosis, formation of NETs, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and granule secretion. Thus, neutrophils serve a critical protective function for the host organism.

The role of NETs in neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses represents an emerging field with promising research opportunities that warrants comprehensive investigation. NETs are specialized filamentous formations expelled by neutrophils, comprising DNA, histones, and various cytokines. Upon exposure to infections, inflammatory triggers, or other stimuli, neutrophils discharge intracellular chromatin along with granule proteins, resulting in the formation of a fragile network structure referred to as NETs. These antimicrobial granules within neutrophils combine with phagosomes to facilitate the ingestion and destruction of bacterial pathogens [80].

Research has indicated that patients with IBD exhibit a marked elevation in the secretion of NETs, resulting in their accumulation within intestinal tissue, which contribute to the development and inflammatory processes associated with IBD [65,81]. The primary pathways involved in the production of NETs include the activation of the REDD1/NETosis/IL-1β signaling axis as well as the interaction between anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and neutrophils. Under conditions of hypoxia, pathogen invasion, and hormonal fluctuations, the levels of the transcriptional regulator EDD1 are augmented, which in turn promotes autophagy and the subsequent release of NETs from neutrophils [82]. Furthermore, ANCA may be implicated in NETs-mediated pathology associated with IBD. Specifically, plasma cells produce ANCA, which can bind to the surface of neutrophils, thereby activating neutrophils and facilitating the release of NETs. Additionally, ANCA binds to protease 3 (PR3) or MPO97 granules, which further amplifies the activation of neutrophil by binding to the Fcγ receptor [65] as depicted in Fig.4A.

Although NETs can facilitate inflammation under certain conditions, they have also shown beneficial effects in attenuating excessive immune responses under different circumstances. For example, research has indicated that NETs can suppress IL-6 while enhancing IL-10 secretion in LPS-activated Mφs associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [83]. Similarly, NETs play a crucial role in resolving inflammation by degrading significant mediators, including cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and MIP-1, as well as TNF, predominantly through the action of serine proteases [84] as shown in Fig.4B.

Given the strong correlation between NETs and the mediation of intestinal inflammation, therapeutic strategies targeting NETs show some promise in IBD. Regarding the anti-inflammatory mechanism of ADSCs, it has been shown that ADSCs can reduce inflammation and treat inflammatory diseases by inhibiting the formation of NETs. Study has shown that ADSCs can effectively inhibit neovascularization associated with corneal wound healing (CWH) by impeding the formation of local NETs, thereby suppressing the inflammatory response [85]. Additionally, a separate investigation demonstrated that ADSCs can alleviate inflammation caused byPropionibacterium acnescolonizing hair follicles, known as acne vulgaris, by inhibiting the formation of NETs [86]. These findings open up novel therapeutic pathways for ADSCs to treat inflammatory diseases. While there is currently a lack of research examining the specific mechanisms by which ADSCs inhibit NET production in the context of intestinal disorders, this indicates a potential direction for future studies to explore the role of NET inhibition in the treatment of IBD.

The action of ADSCs on adaptive immune cells is intricately linked to their modulation of innate immune responses. Specifically, ADSCs play a crucial role in sustaining antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs, Mφs, in a state characterized by immaturity or anti-inflammatory properties through the secretion of various cytokines. This mechanism effectively hinders the activation of effector T cells while simultaneously facilitating the generation of Tregs [87]. Furthermore, the direct suppressive impact of ADSCs on adaptive immune cells is evidenced by their capacity to inhibit the activation of CD8+T cells and the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. This is achieved via the release of several immunosuppressive factors, including NO, IDO, PGE, TGF-β, HO1, LIF, PDL1, and HGF [88].

The ability of ADSCs to preferentially migrate to inflammatory tissues is important for alleviating the inflammatory response. Current research indicates that the in vivo experiments show that exogenous MSCs can exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and reduce the severity of inflammation [89]. One study utilized the green fluorescent dye PKH67 to track exogenously administered MSCs in inflamed colonic mucosa. These MSCs were found primarily in the lamina propria of the inflamed rectum, particularly near the base of crypts. In contrast, they were not detected in non-inflamed areas like the proximal colon [90].

Migration of MSCs into inflamed tissues is influenced by a variety of factors. MSCs possess cell surface receptors that include growth factors, cytokines/chemokines, adhesion molecules, and TLRs [91]. These receptors interact with their corresponding signals that regulate MSCs migration, a process often referred to as homing, which involves several steps. Firstly, in response to cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1, MSCs express integrin β1 and/or integrin α4/β1 complex and migrate to endothelial cells marked by VCAM-1 expression at the site of local inflammation. Next, upon tissue injury, MSCs may express CXCR4 which facilitates their interactions with endothelial cells along with increasing SDF-1 levels. Finally, MSCs complete their migration into the ECM through interactions with integrins and fibronectin, which are regulated by bFGF, TLRs, or MMP-2 produced by the MSCs [61]as shown in Fig.5.

ADSCs are integral to the processes of tissue repair and regeneration, particularly concerning the restoration of the intestinal epithelium. These cells possess the ability to proliferate and undergo differentiation into a variety of cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, thereby playing a significant role in the regenerative and reparative mechanisms of gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, ADSCs can also secrete a range of growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), alongside anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10 and TGF-β. Collectively, these factors promote angiogenesis and support the healing of the intestinal mucosa while also reducing the inflammatory response, thus facilitating overall wound healing.

ADSCs have demonstrated great promise in promoting tissue regeneration and alleviating intestinal inflammation through various mechanisms. ADSCs are mesoderm-derived stem cells that can differentiate into various tissue types, including bone, cardiac, uroepithelial, and skin tissues [7]. The cytokines secreted by ADSCs primarily influence tissue regeneration through the following three ways [7]. First, they secrete cytokines such as Il-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, which activate the NF-κB signaling cascade, JAK/STAT, and JAK1/Tyk2 pathways by binding to their respective receptors [92]. Among them, the JAK1/Tyk2 signaling pathway, activated by IL-10, exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Second, ADSCs promote endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis by secreting TGF-β, VEGF, PGF, and Angl, which initiate critical signaling pathways including TGF-β/SMAD, Ras/MAPK pathway, PI3K/AKT, as well as RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway to regulate cellular proliferation along with capillary formation [93]. Lastly, ADSCs influence tissue injury and repair through paracrine effects via extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are often called ADSC-exosomes. These lipid bilayer structures encapsulate numerous biologically active molecules, such as angiogenic miRNAs and growth factors like VEGFA, FGF, IGF, and PDGF, which subsequently activate intracellular signaling cascades, including PI3K/AKT, Mek/Erk, RAF/MAPK, JAK/STAT, and NF-κB pathways, to promote both cell proliferation and angiogenesis [94].

Current studies have indicated that ADSCs can promote tissue regeneration following gastrectomy closure in animal models [95]. In a study, male Wistar rats underwent gastrectomy closure surgery, with the experimental group receiving locally autografted ADSCs in the submucosa around the suture area. Seven days post-injection, histological analyses revealed that the ADSCs facilitated angiogenesis and collagen deposition, leading to improved healing outcomes. By day 28 of the experiment, the regenerated tissue closely resembled the native structure. The cytokines secreted by ADSCs were quantified by ELISA, revealing the presence of HGF, VEGF and TGF-β in the supernatant and HGF content was significantly higher than VEGF. This finding aligns with the previous conclusion indicating that ADSCs can improve secrete growth factors which accelerate the formation of neovascularization and promote the regeneration of damaged tissues. In conclusion, there is strong evidence suggesting that ADSCs may facilitate tissue regeneration at the closed area of gastrectomy by accelerating angiogenesis and reducing fibrosis in the early stages. Subsequently, ADSCs mitigate excessive fibrosis while aiding in regenerating tissue that closely mimics the natural structure through paracrine mechanisms. These results also highlight the potential application of ADSCs in treating human gastrectomy closures or other types of wound healing.

In the realm of regenerative medicine, research has illuminated the remarkable potential of ADSCs in fostering the healing process of ulceration and tissue devastation stemming from intestinal inflammation. A key study performed on a rat model of TNBS-induced colitis highlighted the diverse advantages associated with the submucosal injection of ADSCs [96].

In the research, rats with TNBS-induced colitis that received ADSC injections exhibited a marked reduction in colon weight and colonic ulceration, suggesting an improvement in colonic edema associated linked to inflammatory responses. Histological analyses further corroborated these findings, revealing improved regeneration of the colonic epithelium alongside a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in the ADSC-treated group when compared to the control group, which was administered PBS. To further understand the localization of ADSCs within inflammatory tissues, the study employed FISH to track the presence of Y-chromosome positive cells. The results demonstrated that ADSCs preferentially clustered in the submucosal layer, although a limited number were also identified in the mucosal and lamina propria layers, indicating the potential for ADSCs to migrate and engage across various tissue layers.

In addition to facilitating tissue repair by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, ADSCs can also regenerate tissues, especially endothelial cells, by secreting growth factors. Specifically, the secretion of growth factors such as HGF and VEGF by ADSCs are believed to play a pivotal role in fostering tissue regeneration [97]. These bioactive molecules collectively stimulate cell proliferation, encourage angiogenesis, and dampen inflammatory responses, thereby facilitating the healing process. HGF, for instance, is a potent mitogen that promotes the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells [98]. VEGF is a vascular permeability factor that stimulates angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. By augmenting blood flow to damaged regions, VEGF promotes the delivery of oxygen and nutrients necessary for effective tissue repair.

Collectively, these findings highlight the enormous therapeutic prospects of ADSCs in addressing intestinal inflammation and its associated complications. By promoting the regeneration of injured tissues and modulating the inflammatory response, ADSCs offer a promising alternative to conventional therapies.

Other types of stem cells are also important for tissue repair, although their function in the gut has not fully understood. Notable stem cells include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), all of which have good application prospects in regenerative medicine.

ESCs, derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, exhibit remarkable potential for tissue regeneration due to their capacity to differentiate into virtually any cell type present in the organism. However, ethical dilemmas and practical challenges have hindered their applications [99]. PDLSCs, on the other hand, possess the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types vital for periodontal tissue engineering and are primarily employed in the regeneration of periodontal ligament or cementum tissues [100]. Similar to ESCs, iPSCs are generated by reprogramming adult somatic cells into a pluripotent state, enabling differentiation into diverse cell types and offering significant potential for tissue regeneration due to their unique properties.

Currently, the majority of clinical investigations concerning ADSCs predominantly emphasize their application in addressing conditions such as wound healing, multiple sclerosis, tissue injuries, age-related ailments, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, as well as in the regeneration of bone and cartilage, stroke management, and spinal cord injuries [10]. Therefore, it is promising to address the role of ADSCs in the treatment of digestive diseases.

Initially, clinical investigations centered on ADSCs primarily targeted regenerative medicine, particularly in the restoration of cartilage and the remediation of bone defects. However, as research into the mechanisms by which ADSCs facilitate tissue repair has progressed, it has become increasingly clear that clinical benefits do not solely arise from the differentiation capacity of ADSCs into chondrocytes or osteoblasts but rather from their immunomodulatory properties. This understanding has prompted a significant pivot in research focus towards evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs in treating inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and CD [28]. Current evidence suggests that ADSCs show considerable promise for treatment of inflammatory disorders. A considerable body of research, including numerous clinical trials, has been dedicated to investigating the role of ADSCs in the treatment of IBD. The pathophysiology and clinical aspects of IBD will be elaborated upon in the following sections.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a persistent and recurrent inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily encompassing in two principal forms: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). UC mainly impacts the mucosal layer of the colon, causing inflammation and ulceration of the mucosal surface, and is characterized by continuous inflammation process within the colon. In contrast, CD usually involves any segment of the gastrointestinal tract but most frequently presents in regions such as the terminal ileum and colon. This condition is marked by transmural inflammatory damage to the intestinal wall, which can subsequently result in ulceration and the formation of fistulas.

The pathogenesis of IBD is multifaceted and results from an intricate interplay of genetic factors, environmental influences, the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and mechanisms of immune response [101]. Genetic factors have an impact on the occurrence of IBD upon its classification as a polygenic disease with a familial aggregation pattern. Environmental influences, notably microbial composition, play a pivotal role since gut microbiota serves as crucial intermediaries linking external environments with internal physiological states. The intestinal barrier comprises IECs and innate immune cells that maintain the balance between the luminal contents and the mucosal surfaces, which effectively defend against pathogen invasion. When innate immune cells are deficient or foreign antigens break through the intestinal mucosal barrier, DCs, together with other antigen presenting cells, trigger a series of immune responses and initiate inflammatory responses. This disruption of the immune balance leads to leukocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa accompanied by sustained T cell-mediated cellular immunity, which ultimately leads to the development of CD or UC. UC represents a chronic inflammatory condition primarily affecting the distal colon and rectum manifesting symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and muco-purulent stools [102]. A significant aspect contributing to the pathogenesis of UC is the imbalance within the immune system. Patients exhibit imbalance between Th1/Th2 cells activities within the colonic tissues where inflammatory cells are persistently activated leading to their accumulation along with upregulation of IL-1, IL-1 receptor, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-γ [103]. The pathways of activation that are implicated in this chronic condition include the NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT signaling cascades. Abnormalities in these regulatory mechanisms induce aberrant signal transduction, further contributing to the immunological imbalance that triggers UC [104].

Central to the dynamics of the NF-κB signaling pathway are key mediators such as NF-κB itself, TNF-α, and other associated factors that are instrumental concerning pathogenesis of UC. The activation of NF-κB causes the release of NF-κB-associated factor complexes into the nucleus and promotes nuclear translocation, which not only regulates the expression of genes, involved in cell proliferation but also influences apoptosis, thereby playing an active role in the host’s inflammatory response. Furthermore, TNF-α is critical in stimulating the release of C-reactive protein. Following the onset of inflammation, a significant influx of TNF-α at the inflammatory site generates localized hypoxic conditions, which subsequently activate HIF-1α, subsequently increases the rate of IL − 10 and COX − 2 synthesis, thereby aggravating the local inflammatory response [105].

CD, a subtype of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, is characterized by skip lesions and transmural inflammation that affect the entire gastrointestinal tract. The terminal ileum and proximal sections of the large intestine are commonly affected sites in CD [106]. Typically, the initial clinical manifestations of CD are marked by prominent inflammatory phenotypes; however, as the condition progresses, complications such as stenosis, fistulas, or abscesses may develop, leading to the need for surgical procedures in nearly 50% of those diagnosed [107].

The pathological mechanism underlying CD encompass the destruction of intestinal barrier integrity and the activation of mediators linked to inflammation. Deficiencies in gut barrier composition or inflammation can contribute to CD pathogenesis. For example, mutations in genes encoding connexin and inflammatory factor receptors may adversely affect the functionality of IECs. Studies have demonstrated that alterations in the expression and positioning of Claudin 2/5/8 contribute to discontinuous tight junctions and compromise barrier dysfunction in CD [108]. Simultaneously, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) occurs within IEC may initiate pathological unfolded protein response (UPR) alongside inflammatory response, which is recognized as a crucial factor in the etiology CD [109]. ERS leads to the upregulation of NKG2D ligands, which subsequently activates NK cells and ILC1s, thereby mediating inflammation processes [110].The signaling pathways of STAT3 and NF-κB within IECs are of paramount importance; deficiencies in proteins associated with these pathways can similarly trigger the pathology of CD [111].

Additionally, impairments in antimicrobial peptide production by innate immune cells or intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) as well as dysfunctions involving proteins linked to immune response pathways, also contribute significantly to CD progression [106]. Mutations across various genes, such as NOD2, ATG16L1, LRRK2, XBP1, and IRGM, lead to activation of innate immune proteins, which in turn activate the NF-κB signaling cascades responsible for mediating inflammatory responses, while concurrently altering Paneth cell functions and resulting in dysregulated secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, study has shown that activated DCs under inflammatory conditions express TLR2, TLR4, and costimulatory receptors, which promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus facilitate the onset of CD [112]. Notably, IELs secreted elevated levels of IL-17 A, IFN-γ, and TNF-ɑ in individuals diagnosed with CD [113]. Consequently, dysfunctionality of IELs such as hyperactivity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes or aberrant reductions in their anti-inflammatory capabilities can further exacerbate inflammatory manifestations and lead to the development of CD.

Adaptive immune system activation is a hallmark feature shared by both UC and CD. In particular, the intestinal infiltrates observed in CD often include Th1/17 cell subsets. The involvement of T cell-mediated adaptive immunity in the induction of gastrointestinal inflammation has been discussed in Sect.ADSCs involving in adaptive immunity, so it will not be further elaborated upon in this section.

Studies have demonstrated that ADSCs can be utilized in the treatment of colitis. A pivotal investigation utilizing a DSS-induced murine colitis model demonstrated that the combined Rg1 and ADSCs therapy significantly attenuated colonic inflammation [114]. In the study, ADSCs were extracted from AT harvested from human abdominal and gluteal regions, with intravenous administration of ADSCs to mice alongside oral delivery of Rg1 via tube feeding. The results from histopathological examinations and immunofluorescence assays demonstrated a notable reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration EV within colonic tissues in the group treated with ADSCs. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that Th17 cells populations were markedly elevated in the DSS group compared to those receiving Rg1, ADSC or ADSC + Rg1 groups, suggesting that both ADSC and Rg1 contribute to maintaining intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg/Th17 balance as illustrated in Fig.6A.

While it is well-established that ADSCs can modulate the immune response and are employed therapeutically for UC, evidence suggests that ADSCs derived from patients suffering from inflammatory or autoimmune conditions may exhibit immunosuppressive deficiencies [115]. Comparative experiments were conducted to evaluate differentiation capacity, proliferation rates, secretion profiles, and immunosuppressive functions between healthy donor-derived (H-ADSC) versus UC patient-derived (P-ADSC) cells. The efficacy of P-ADSCs was ultimately assessed in mouse models of acute or chronic colitis, revealing a reduced proliferative capacity and diminished osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential compared to H-ADSCs. Additionally, P-ADSCs secreted lower levels of PGE, IDO, and TNFAIP6 when stimulated by inflammatory factors, contributing to their compromised immunological effectiveness. Collectively, the therapeutic impact exhibited by P-ADSCs was inferior compared to H-ADSCs as shown in Fig.6A. This study suggests for the first time that autologous transplantation of ADSCs may not be the best approach for UC patients, raising questions about the clinical feasibility of ADSC treatment for this condition.

A hallmark of CD is the presence of fistulae, with 40–50% of CD patients suffering from complication, and among them, 50% exhibit fistulae. The therapeutic application of ADSCs for perianal fistulae was first documented in 2003 by García-Olmo et al.. who achieved successful closure of a rectovaginal fistula in a CD patient using autologous ADSCs administration, establishing a milestone in cellular therapy for fistulizing CD. This patient, aged 33 at the time of the study, had developed perianal pus four years prior, having been diagnosed with perianal CD. Multiple surgical interventions had failed to yield improvement. Prior to treatment with ADSCs, she received local anesthesia and systemic sedation while an initial adipose aspirate was harvested from subcutaneous tissue around the umbilicus. A week post-surgery, despite signs of inflammation in her wound, complete closure of the fistula was achieved without any observed fecal incontinence or vaginal flatulence. However, One month later, she experienced another flare-up of CD accompanied by suppurative symptoms, although minor signs of a perianal fistula re-emerged, no recurrence of the rectovaginal fistula was noted [116]. This trial highlighted the potential efficacy of ADSCs in managing CD, however, it primarily facilitated closure of the fistula but may lead to recurrence of CD.

In subsequent investigations, ADSCs have been extensively utilized for treating CD associated with perianal fistula. Etienne et al.. conducted a comprehensive review summarizing previous studies and ongoing clinical trials involving ADSCs in this context. Among published literature on this subject matter, most clinical trials remain in early stages (phase I and II), with only one Phase III trial having reached completion thus far. In a singular controlled Phase III study, the rate of complete fistula healing was significantly higher compared to the placebo group [117]. One investigation involved injecting freshly harvested autologous AT into perianal fistulas among patients suffering from CD to evaluate ADSC efficacy for CD treatment. Remarkably, complete healing was reported in 57% of cases following the injection of this freshly collected tissue, while cessation or reduction in secretion from the lesions occurred at rates of 14% and 5%, respectively [118]. These findings suggest that the use of freshly harvested autologous AT shows considerable promise as a future therapeutic option for managing perianal fistulas in CD, representing a hopeful combined approach to effectively treating challenging cases involving these fistulas.

Recent investigations published in 2024 indicate that MSCs can mitigate inflammatory responses by engaging in the ubiquitin modification. This involvement allows them to influence various signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, NOD, TGF-β, and TNF-α, which are pertinent in the management of IBD [119]. Currently, the underlying mechanisms through which ubiquitination mediates the relay of inflammatory signals and subsequently instigates IBD remain inadequately explored, necessitating further investigation. Nevertheless, these findings imply that subsequent research could focus on the role of ADSCs in regulating ubiquitination as a potential therapeutic approach for IBD, thereby laying a foundational experimental basis for clinical applications. Furthermore, MSCs have been shown to significantly influence antimicrobial activity and may engage in direct or indirect interactions with gut microbiota [120]. MSCs exert an anti-inflammatory role by directly affecting abundance of certain bacterial strains, thereby diminishing the levels of pathogenic bacteria while enhancing the proliferation of beneficial microbial populations. Meanwhile, MSCs also modulate the gut microbiota indirectly through the regulation of the host’s immune response. This indicates that the modulation of intestinal microbiota by MSCs constitutes a significant mechanism through which these cells may contribute to the therapeutic management of IBD. Future investigations could further examine ADSCs, which present notable advantages over traditional MSCs, to assess their potential for treating IBD from a multifaceted approach.

Stem cells have emerged as a promising novel approach in cancer therapy, prompting extensive investigation across multiple disciplines. Among the various stem cell therapies, hematopoietic stem cells have been recognized as a standard therapeutic option for leukemia and other hematologic cancers. Recent literature indicates the current studys on ADSCs primarily target their potential applications in breast and ovarian cancer treatment, with ongoing debate regarding their role in tumor growth modulation. Some studies suggest that ADSCs can exert an anti-cancer role by facilitating apoptosis in cancer cells [121,122]. Other studies believe that ADSCs contribute to the proliferation of cancer cells through the secretion of diverse cytokines or by fusing with these malignant cells, thereby facilitating their growth and metastatic potential [123–126]. Nonetheless, research focusing on the specific roles and underlying mechanisms of ADSCs in gastrointestinal malignancies remains insufficient. The subsequent discussion will address the biphasic effects of ADSCs on colorectal cancer (CRC).

Regarding the therapeutic effect of ADSCs on CRC, various studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This discrepancy can largely be attributed to the interplay between ADSCs and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), where these cells exhibit a dual function of both immunosurveillance and immunoediting [127].

The tumor-suppressive effects of ADSCs are primarily exhibited through the regulation of immune cells activity within the TME, thus fulfilling a crucial role in immunological surveillance. This encompasses: i) promoting γδ T cells to produce IFN-γ, IFN-α/β, which play a pivotal role in triggering apoptosis in cancer cells [128], ii) the enhancement of B cells activity, leading to the production of antibodies that facilitate tumor eradication [129], and iii) the orchestration of NK cells remodeling, thereby augmenting anti-tumor activity [130]. Moreover, MSCs migrate into tumor sites release anti-tumorigenic factors via paracrine signaling, resulting in the resensitization of primary tumors and the induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Simultaneously, infiltrating MSCs contribute to tissue repair mechanisms through their differentiation potential [131]. ADSCs facilitate tumors predominantly by persistently modifying and influencing the host’s anti-tumor immune mechanisms. This interaction consequently shapes the immunogenicity of tumors and affects clonal selection, ultimately shifting the equilibrium to favor tumor development, a phenomenon referred to as immunoediting [128]. The intricate mechanism entails the infiltration of MSCs into the TME via chemotactic signals. Once within the tumor tissue, these cells engage in a secretory communication with the tumor cells, releasing various soluble factors that promote angiogenesis and exert immunosuppressive effects, thereby aiding in tumor proliferation [131].

On the one hand, ADSCs demonstrate specific anti-cancer properties. Evidence supports that MSCs attenuate colon cancer progression by influencing the immune constituents within the colorectal TME. In adenocarcinomas (ADKs) derived from rats treated with MSCs, a decrease in the presence of infiltrating CD68+Mφs was observed, alongside an increase in the infiltration of CD3+lymphocytes. This alteration in immune cell composition is associated with improved prognostic outcomes and a reduction in negative effects related to tumors, including CRC [132]. Furthermore, MSCs were found to reduce the activity of NK and regulatory Th17 (rTh17) cell, limit Tregs recruitment, and decrease the presence of CD8+lymphocytes and endothelial cells. Conversely, MSCs were shown to restore the activity of Th17 cells, contributing to the modulation of tumor immunity [132]. Regarding CRC that arises from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), research has indicated that BMSCs can mitigate CRC by directing MSCs to the inflamed intestinal region via the DF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway [133]. Additionally, investigations have demonstrated the capacity to directly target tumor cells and inhibit their proliferation. Specifically, studies have shown that ADSCs can suppress cancer cell growth through the secretion of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), a known negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway [134]. Furthermore, the secretome obtained from ADSCs, referred to as AMSCs-Se, has the potential to exert an anti-colon cancer effect by promoting apoptosis in cancer cells [135]. These findings indicate that ADSCs, as a kind of MSCs, may similarly contribute to an anti-CRC role through comparable pathways.

On the other hand, evidence supporting the role of ADSCs in promoting CRC development and metastasis is more compelling. It is widely acknowledged that tumor progression occurs through three distinct phases, such as tumorigenesis, promotion and progression. Regarding tumorigenesis and growth specifically, some evidences indicate that ADSCs facilitate the proliferation of CRCs via IL-6 production [136]. Furthermore, ADSCs mediate cancer progression via activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in breast and colon cancer cells by secreting IL-6. In terms of tumor development and metastatic behavior, it has been shown that ADSCs-derived Cyr61 enhances CRC cells migration and invasion via the αVβ5/FAK/NF-κB signaling cascade [137]. Concurrently, it has been shown that exosomes secreted from CRC facilitate the Cyr 61 transcription within ADSCs. Additionally, a separate study revealed that ADSCs trigger peritoneal metastasis of CRC by enhancing glycolysis activity while simultaneously diminishing apoptosis resistance [138]. This process entails the activation of the TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling cascade, in conjunction with the upregulation of the ANGPTL4 expression, which collectively promotes an invasive phenotype in tumor cells.

Collectively, there remains debate concerning the impact of ADSCs on the progression of CRC, with some studies suggesting beneficial effects alongside reports of detrimental outcomes. The dual roles of ADSCs in either promoting or suppressing CRC are depicted in Fig.6B.

While the evidence supporting the role of ADSCs in promoting tumor proliferation and migration is compelling, their homing ability and regenerative differentiation present important markers for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. EVs and exosomes derived from ADSCs can function as targeted drug delivery systems for tumor cells. Moreover, ADSCs possess the ability to secrete angiogenic cytokines and growth factors that not only bolster endogenous repair processes but also alleviate fibrosis.

EVs isolated from ADSCs function as nanocarriers with strong binding affinity for tumor cells, enabling real-time imaging of tumor localization and delineation [139]. In addition, due to their inherent properties as natural nanovesicles, exosomes have garnered considerable attention for their carrier capabilities. Research has been conducted to isolate MSCs from ADSCs to obtain adequate quantities of exosomes suitable for drug delivery applications. In these studies, SN38, as a hydrophobic agent, was encapsulated within exosomes decorated with MUC1 aptamers specifically targeting MUC1-overexpressing cells. Findings indicated that SN38/Exo-Apt could be effectively utilized in treating CRC [140]. Regarding the reduction of tissue fibrosis, recent evidence released in 2024 indicate that ADSCs can ameliorate radiation-induced colorectal fibrosis (RICF) by rectifying dysbiosis and reinstating a healthy colonic microbiota [141]. RICF represents a chronic complication associated with pelvic radiotherapy in the management of CRC, and this discovery offers important perspectives on potential therapeutic approaches to mitigate RICF.

The dual role of ADSCs in fibrotic diseases has garnered widespread attention. Research indicates that MSCs play a multifaceted and often paradoxical role in the progression of fibrotic conditions Specifically, while tissue-resident MSCs possess the capability to differentiate into myofibroblasts, consequently facilitating the advancement of fibrosis, the administration of exogenous MSCs appears to mitigate fibrotic diseases. This alleviation is achieved through mechanisms such as inflammation modulation, damaged tissue regeneration, ECM remodeling, and the regulation of post-transplantation cellular stress responses [142]. Owing to their distinctive regenerative and paracrine characteristics, MSCs are regarded as a promising therapeutic strategy for an array of gastrointestinal disorders, including hepatic fibrosis, ulcerative colitis, acute liver injury, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [143].

ADSCs have shown significant promise in the treatment of hepatic injury, particularly in addressing hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Numerous experimental models have elucidated the role of ADSCs in collagen fibers degradation and the mitigation of liver fibrosis. The study established a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride(CCl4)-induced liver injury, demonstrating that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) facilitates the trans-differentiation of ADSCs into hepatic lineage cells both in vitro and in vivo [144]. Transplantation of bFGF-treated ADSCs significantly contributes to the regression of hepatic fibrosis in CCl4-induced mice. Another study indicated that ADSCs transplantation may aid recovery from chronic liver injury [145]. ADSCs derived from patients were isolated, cultured, and then injected into rats suffering from chronic liver fibrosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA). Histopathological analyses revealed a marked reduction in hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory activity following ADSC transplantation, along with reduced levels of α-smooth muscle actin and increased the expression levels of MMP-9. These findings suggest that ADSCs can effectively mitigate chemically induced hepatic fibrosis while promoting restoration of liver function.

HCC is an aggressive malignancy characterized by high rate of intrahepatic metastasis, often managed through surgical resection. Cell therapy has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional surgical approaches for HCC treatment. Research indicates that ADSCs can effectively inhibit HCC cell proliferation while promoting apoptosis under laboratory conditions [146], which is mediated through down-regulation of Akt signaling pathways to suppress HCC cellular growth. Another study involving co-cultured systems with HCC cell lines and ADSCs, significant inhibition was observed regarding HCC cells proliferation rates along with enhanced apoptotic activity. Furthermore, ADSCs demonstrated the ability to inhibited migration capabilities within HepG2 and PLC-PRF-5 cells potentially via upregulation of tissue inhibitors such as TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 [147] as depicted in Fig.6C.

Moreover, ADSCs may serve as adjuvant therapies for patients suffering from hepatic cancer. Currently employed radiotherapy (RT) is frequently utilized for advanced-stage HCC patients who are not suitable for surgery or transplantation. However, its prognostic outcomes remain suboptimal. A recent study evaluated the anticancer effects of combining ADSCs with RT on various HCC cell lines, revealing interactions between IFITM1 interacted with STAT3 along with MMP which inhibited the downstream expression related to p53 activation as well as reduced cysteine-asparaginase production during combined treatment of RT and ADSCs, ultimately leading to lower tumor cell proliferation rates [148]. These suggest that incorporating ADSCs could potentially improve the effectiveness of RT for individuals diagnosed with HCC.

Fibrosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of ECM components, particularly collagen, and is typically associated with a chronic inflammatory response triggered by various factors [149]. Research utilizing a mouse model for acute colitis has demonstrated that MSCs can inhibit the differentiation of myofibroblasts from fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-β, leading to enhanced mucosal repair, diminished inflammation, and reduced intestinal fibrosis [150]. Studies have been extensively investigated in the context of radiation-induced colorectal fibrosis. In an in vitro study involving irradiated co-culture with human MSCs, findings indicated that these stem cells could effectively suppress colorectal fibrosis by down-regulating genes associated with ECM, preventing the activation of pro-fibroblasts, and fostering the Th2/M2 immune response [151] (Fig.6B). Simultaneously, the investigation highlighted the synergistic functions of HGF and TSG-6 in mediating the antifibrotic properties of MSCs, underscoring the importance of multiple factors secreted by therapeutic MSCs [151]. Moreover, evidence indicates that treatment with ADSCs influences the Th17 cell population and attenuates the ECM deposition triggered by irradiation, consequently mitigating damage to the intestinal mucosa and reducing fibrosis [152]. These findings highlight the promising use of ADSCs in the treatment of radiation proctitis.

Beyond their established function in addressing hepatic and colorectal fibrosis, ADSCs have been the subject of extensive investigation regarding their therapeutic applications across various bodily systems. A comprehensive review highlights the antifibrotic properties of MSCs in multiple organ systems. Specifically, MSCs have demonstrated efficacy in treating and mitigating fibrosis in models representing cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, peritoneal, pancreatic, cutaneous, and rectal fibrosis. Furthermore, clinical trials have confirmed the beneficial effects of MSCs on fibrosis resulting from cardiac, hepatic, renal, and pelvic radiotherapy. Findings from both preclinical and clinical investigations underscore that MSCs combat fibrosis through mechanisms such as immunosuppression, inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathways, alleviation of hypoxia and oxidative stress, as well as the restoration of ECM degradation [153]. Thus, there exists great potential for the application of MSCs, particularly ADSCs, in the treatment of systemic fibrotic disorders.

The potential role of ADSCs in gastric cancer treatment is still a topic of debate, as there are only a limited number of studies on this subject.

Some studies indicate that ADSCs can inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, while others have shown that they can promote cancer cells growth and migration. Specifically, ADSCs have been shown to effectively inhibit the proliferation of HGC-27 cell lines by inducing apoptosis in an ex vivo setting [154]. Conversely, evidence suggests that ADSCs might facilitate the growth and migration of gastric cancer cells via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis [155]. This result contradicts what we mentioned in the anti-colon cancer effect that ADSCs alleviate IBD-induced CRC through SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway. This observation prompts further investigation into the mechanistic role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in mediating tumor-stem cell interactions. Furthermore, investigations have explored the application of ADSCs in tissue regeneration for gastrotomy closure. In early stages post-surgery, ADSCs appear to enhance tissue regeneration by accelerating angiogenesis and fibrosis [95]. In the late stage, they may mitigate excessive fibrosis development. These findings indicate that the regenerative properties of ADSCs could be utilized to alleviate postoperative complications associated with digestive surgery as shown in Fig.6D.

Radiotherapy is predominantly employed in the management of pelvic malignant tumors, including prostate cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer [156]. While this therapeutic approach is effective in curtailing tumor proliferation, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential repercussions on adjacent healthy tissues, as well as the possibility of adverse reactions. Among the negative outcomes associated with pelvic radiotherapy are radiation-induced proctitis or proctopathy. This condition can manifest in two distinct forms: acute and chronic. The acute variant occurs in nearly all patients, whereas the chronic variant persists over an extended period and significantly affects the intestinal function. Frequently observed symptoms encompass diarrhea, tenesmus, rectal mucus or blood discharge, urinary urgency, incontinence, and pain, with rectal bleeding being the most prevalent symptom [156].The underlying mechanism by which pelvic radiotherapy causes damage to normal tissues involves the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) as a result of ionizing radiation exposure. This process results in oxidative stress, which subsequently inflicts harm on DNA and mitochondria [157]. The resultant tissue injuries are associated with prolonged inflammation, vascular impairment, and the development of fibrosis resulting from the accumulation of ECM matrix components [158].

Preclinical studies indicate that MSCs can alleviate gastrointestinal injury following pelvic radiotherapy by inhibiting ulcer, inducing intestinal villus regeneration, improving anal sphincter regeneration and contraction, enhancing small intestinal epithelial cell turnover, and inhibiting small intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis [156]. Despite the significant therapeutic potential of MSCs in addressing radiation-induced side effects, they do not contribute to the amelioration of DNA damage resulting from radiation exposure and lack the capacity to perform DNA repair functions [156]. The continued proliferation of MSCs in the presence of a damaged DNA template may result in the onset of tumorigenesis. Consequently, it is imperative to comprehend the mechanisms through which adult stem cells modulate tumor proliferation, as this knowledge is essential for the future utilization of MSCs, and even adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), in the realm of pelvic radiotherapy.

While ADSCs exhibit considerable potential within regenerative medicine, it is crucial to address the limitations pertaining to cell heterogeneity, standardization processes, regulatory considerations, tissue yield variability, and inconsistencies in clinical outcomes to ensure their safe and effective application in therapeutic settings.

The inherent variability of ADSCs presents a significant challenge in clinical applications, primarily, largely influenced by factors related to tissue origin and donor characteristics [159]. Variables specific to the donor, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and underlying health conditions, impact the phenotype, morphology, differentiation potential, and overall functionality of ADSCs [160]. Furthermore, ADSCs obtained from different tissue sources exhibit variations in their proliferative and differentiation abilities, immunomodulation and other functions, which ultimately impact the clinical outcome.

The heterogeneity of MSCs can be broadly categorized into three types: heterogeneity stemming from tissue sources, donor-related heterogeneity, and heterogeneity introduced by culture conditions based on the mechanisms governing their generation [160]. In the context of ADSCs, MSCs sourced from a single AT site exhibit uniformity in tissue origin. The main influencing factors of donor heterogeneity include age, gender and metabolic index (MBI). Older age, high BMI (> 30 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus or prior exposure to RT and endocrine therapy have been shown to diminish both the proliferative capacity and differentiation potential of ADSCs [161]. Emerging evidence indicates that different in collection sites significantly influences the yield rates and differentiation profiles of ADSCs, with higher detection rates are observed when harvesting from thigh regions compared to abdominal areas or medial knee sites [29]. Additionally, culture-induced heterogeneity arises from the use of animal-derived serum used during ADSCs culture processes, while exogenous growth factors may also interfere with the differentiation pathways and proliferation rates of these cells. Therefore, to reduce these associated risks, it is imperative to select appropriate tissue sources and donors, and to reduce the interference of the culture environment with ADSCs.

Immunogenicity is another factor that plays a key role in the application of ADSCs. Immunogenicity refers to the long-term expansion of ADSCs showing different immunomodulatory characteristics. In the ADSCs culture process, 10–20% FBS or calf serum is usually used. However, animal-derived products may contain viruses, prions, mycoplasma, and exogenous growth factors, which may cause an immune response in patients, thus interfering with the differentiation and proliferation of ADSCs [159]. Therefore, in order to avoid these risks, media without animal serum should be developed. Genetic stability after manipulation and amplification is another major concern for ADSCs in therapy. The possible adverse differentiation of ADSCs and their interaction with tumor cells need to be monitored and managed in real time.

Despite the extensive research and clinical application of ADSCs in addressing a range of medical conditions, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential adverse effects associated with their use. For instance, a phase I clinical trial evaluating the effects of spray transplantation of allogeneic ADSCs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy reported the occurrence of pleural effusion as an adverse reaction among those treated with these stem cells [162]. Furthermore, a separate study documented instances of severe bilateral vision impairment following the intravitreal administration of autologous ADSCs aimed at treating age-related macular degeneration [163].

Additionally, the risk of tumorigenicity associated with ADSC therapies warrants careful consideration. As previously mentioned, while certain studies have indicated that ADSCs can inhibit cancer cell proliferation, a considerable number of investigations have also reported their potential to promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Consequently, the safety profile of ADSCs in cancer therapy necessitates further exploration. It is crucial to highlight, however, that the most findings suggesting cancer-promoting effects were derived from in vitro studies or animal models, leaving the clinical relevance of these observations uncertain.

The clinical application of ADSCs is confronted with numerous ethical. Primarily, there exists an ethical imperative to guarantee the sufficiency and legitimacy of informed consent, which must be voluntarily provided by patients or subjects, fully comprehending all potential risks and advantages associated with the treatment. Furthermore, safeguarding patients’ confidential information is critically important. Consequently, any handling of personal health data must adhere rigorously to privacy protection standards. Risk–benefit evaluation also remains a pivotal aspect of ethical scrutiny, ensuring that the prospective advantages of the treatment surpass the associated risks and that appropriate risk management strategies are in place. The regulation of the clinical application of ADSCs necessitates a rigorous approach to qualification and standards control. It is imperative that medical institutions and researchers possess the requisite qualifications and infrastructure, which encompass appropriate licenses, specialized departmental credentials, certified health technicians, and pertinent technical expertise. Concurrently, stringent quality control measures must be enforced throughout the processes of preparation, storage, and transportation of ADSC preparations. This is essential to ensure compliance with established quality standards and requirements. Furthermore, the utilization of ADSCs must adhere to both Good Tissue Practice (GTP) rules and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [164]. GTP’s primary objective is to safeguard “human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products” (HCT/P) from potential contamination by infectious agents while simultaneously ensuring their structural integrity and functionality by upholding rigorous quality and safety standards. GMP is established to monitor the processing and manufacturing stages of each cell product meticulously [165]. It is worth mentioning that automated machinery employed for the isolation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class III medical device, which necessitates stringent regulatory oversight; however, this classification has also posed challenges to its clinical application [159]. Furthermore, FDA regulations require that ADSCs transplants be minimally manipulated without enzymatic treatment and utilized within the same surgical procedure. As a result, there is an immediate necessity for the formulation of enzyme-free techniques that are not only economically viable but also reproducible, facilitating the generation of high-caliber ADSCs that are appropriate for clinical use [159]. Finally, global collaboration significantly influences the ethical and regulatory dimensions associated with the clinical use of ADSCs. Gaining insights from the progressive methodologies and experiences of different nations in stem cell clinical applications can facilitate the robust advancement of worldwide stem cell research and its applications.

Overall, the ethical governance and regulatory framework surrounding the clinical application of ADSCs require concerted efforts from medical institutions, researchers, regulatory bodies, patients, and various societal stakeholders. This collective endeavor is essential to guarantee the safety and ethical integrity of these applications while fostering their responsible advancement in fields such as gastrointestinal health.

Although preliminary data suggest ADSCs may ameliorate digestive disorders, several hurdles must be tackled before clinical implementation. It is essential to consider various factors that may impact the effectiveness and feasibility of this treatment approach.

To mitigate the oncogenic potential of ADSCs during therapeutic interventions, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the underlying mechanisms by which ADSCs contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Additionally, enhancing the regulation and monitoring of ADSCs throughout their clinical application is essential. While the assertion that ADSCs facilitate tumor proliferation in colorectal and gastric cancers is compelling, the mechanistic understanding remains inadequate, with discrepancies evident in the literature regarding the dual roles—promotional versus inhibitory—of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway. Furthermore, comprehensive characterization along with stringent quality control protocols must be established for the utilization of ADSCs to ensure that there are no transformed or genetically unstable cells. In the event that unstable or mutated cell populations are detected during clinical use, it is imperative to eradicate the transplanted ADSCs populations through the incorporation of suicide genes [166]. Regular imaging following ADSCs injection is also essential for overseeing any potential tumorigenic activities linked to these cells. Additionally, enhancing the targeting efficacy of ADSCs towards specific tissues pertinent to disease treatment, while concurrently reducing off-target effects, will significantly promote the progress of precision medicine initiatives.

ADSCs are presently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials targeting various applications, including facial rejuvenation, keloid management, reconstructive procedures, treatment for alopecia, arthritis therapy, periodontal interventions, and healing of diabetic wounds [10]. Nevertheless, a significant number of these studies remain confined to the preclinical stage, indicating that the existing clinical evidence is inadequate to facilitate the broad application of ADSCs in medical practice. Several constraints contribute to this situation, such as limited patient cohorts, primarily brief observation duration, a lack of standardization in AT grafts, shortcomings in clinical protocols and guidelines, as well as subjective methods employed for assessing clinical outcomes [167]. ADSCs hold great promise for gastrointestinal applications, including the treatment of immune-related disorders, facilitation of hepatic fibrosis recovery, and therapy for gastrointestinal cancers.

The homing ability of ADSCs is intricately linked not only to their role in mitigating inflammation but also serves as a crucial mechanism influencing tumor formation either by promoting or inhibiting it. Consequently, it is imperative to investigate the homing mechanisms of ADSCs to elucidate their immunomodulatory roles and the paradoxical effects they exert on tumor dynamics. While existing studies are examining the homing process of ADSCs and the associated signaling pathways, numerous inquiries remain unanswered, necessitating a more comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms prior to their clinical utilization. Specifically, there is a need to elucidate how to increase the number of ADSCs heading for the target sites and the localizations of quiescent ADSCs in the body and the micro-structures of their niches [168].

EVs are nanoscale bilayer lipid membrane structures secreted by donor cells [169]. EVs contain a variety of biomolecules, including lipids, proteins, compounds, multi-molecular complexes, DNA, RNA (such as siRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, etc.), and even intact subcellular organelles [170]. ADSC-derived extracellular vesicles (ADSC-EVs) preserve therapeutically relevant biological activities of their parental cells while mitigating safety concerns associated with live cell transplantation. A large amount of evidence supports the role of ADSC-EVs in accelerating tissue regeneration and inhibiting inflammation. Recent review published in 2024 summarized that ADSC-EVs have been used in the clinical treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, COVID-19, periodontitis and other diseases [170]. The immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of ADSC-EVs also provide cell-free treatment options for IBD patients and new ideas for clinical application. The application of ADSC-EVs can avoid problems such as the need for vascularization and the potential risk of tumorigenesis, thus providing a safer and more simplified method [171]. Before ADSC-EVs can be translated into clinical practice on a large scale, their isolation, purification, storage, and accuracy tables must be standardized, while further elucidating their therapeutic mechanisms.

Existing research demonstrates the ADSCs can ameliorate gastrointestinal disorders mainly by reduction of intestinal inflammation. However, there is a need for further optimization of therapeutic processes encompassing dosage determination, exploring different administration methods, and timing to enhance the overall effectiveness of these treatments. Additionally, the exploration of exosomes components derived from ADSCs is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies as part of this optimization process. Standardizing ADSC-exosome isolation, characterization, and quantification protocols is critical to ensure therapeutic reproducibility and enable GMP-compliant production [172].

ADSCs are one of the highly promising types of MSCs in the field of regenerative medicine because their application raises fewer ethical issues than BMSCs and UC-MSCs. This review summarizes the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and tissue-repairing roles and mechanisms of ADSCs in the gastrointestinal tract, along with the advice of their preclinical studies and clinical trials in the treatment of digestive disorders, which guides the future direction of ADSCs research in the gastrointestinal field.

Despite ADSCs’ ambivalent role in tumor immunity (including pro-metastatic effects), their application in inflammation-associated tumors and EV-based therapeutics remains clinically viable, opening novel therapeutic avenues.
