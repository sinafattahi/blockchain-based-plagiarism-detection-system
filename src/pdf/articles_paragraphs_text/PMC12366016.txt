Increasing the resources available in healthcare settings to improve the detection of sepsis can significantly reduce mortality rates. These resources could include advanced diagnostic tools, sepsis screening protocols and ongoing medical education for healthcare providers, ensuring they are equipped to identify sepsis in its early stages [1]. Policies should advocate integrating sepsis detection systems into existing healthcare frameworks. The regional government of Catalonia has promoted such an action plan since its establishment in 2015. This action plan includes a programme called Sepsis Code, which was developed by seven scientific societies and the prehospital emergency department, and has been approved by healthcare policy stakeholders and implemented since 2017 [2]. Similar programmes have been implemented for other time-dependent diseases. The programme includes an organisational model according to hospital levels of care and locations, suggested training programmes (including an app), screening tools, and an automated registry.

This study aims to compare the quality of healthcare in Catalonia, a Spanish region with a programme for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, with data from centres in the rest of the European Union.

Data from the European Sepsis Care Survey (ESCS) was used to analyse sepsis care in Catalan hospitals and compare it with data from 25 other countries of the European Union [3].

The survey was conducted online using the survey software LamaPoll, platin version (Lamano GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany). Data analysis was done by SPSS-IBM statistics version 26.0 and Excel. The study complies with the EQUATOR network reporting guidelines CHERRIES [4] and CROSS [5] and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:NCT05059808).

Fifty-five percent (21/38) of hospitals in Catalonia with intensive care units (ICUs) were included, representing 100% (17/17) of public tertiary hospitals. These Catalonian hospitals were then compared with 691 centres from the European Union (including hospitals from other Spanish regions). Compared with the EU, hospitals in Catalonia had a higher rate of screening programmes implemented in the emergency department (95% [19/20] vs 53% [293/550] p < 0.001), and general wards (80% [16/20] vs 45% [255/568] p = 0.002). The rate of sepsis screening programmes was not different in Catalonian ICUs (79% [15/19] vs 61% [354/585], p = 0.10) (Fig.1). Standardised sepsis management protocols in the emergency department were more prevalent in comparison with the EU (100% [20/20] vs 57% [309/544] p < 0.001), as well as in general wards (85% [17/20] vs 42% [234/554] p < 0.001) (Fig.1), but not in the ICUs where standardised management was high in both settings (90% [17/19] vs 72% [412/575], p=0.088). Similar comparisons were performed, including only university hospitals, and in comparisons with other hospitals from Spain and are included in the Supplementary (Table S1 and Figs. S1  and S2).

Hospitals in Catalonia had more quality improvement programmes of any kind than hospitals in the EU (63% [12/19] vs 27% [159/598], p<0.001) (Fig.1). The number of staff involved in sepsis training (as teacher or student) from the EDs and ICUs was similar in Catalonia and the EU, but lower in Catalan wards. Meetings scheduled for case discussion and training were more common in Catalonia than in the EU but this did not achieve statistical significance (83% [10/12] vs 66% [105/159], p= 0.218). In Catalonia, more quality indicators are recorded, especially time-to-antibiotics (50% [10/20] vs 16% [99/633], p < 0.001) and bundle compliance (55% [11/20] vs 12% [72/633], p < 0.001).

This retrospective post-hoc analysis revealed that, hospitals in Catalonia had better sepsis management and screening indicators than similar hospitals in the EU. At the same time, there were more sepsis programs implemented in Catalonia. This analysis was prompted by the high participation rate of tertiary hospitals from Catalonia in the survey, and the need to draw local conclusions for improvement in a region where a programme had been in place for five years prior to the survey. Since its implementation, the Sepsis Code has significantly impacted the management of sepsis in Catalonia. Hospitals and healthcare centres that have adopted the Sepsis Code have reported improvements in the early recognition and treatment of sepsis. One of the most significant impacts of the Sepsis Code has been a reduction in sepsis related mortality rates [6,7]. Also, improvements in managing this condition has been reported in emergency department [7].

The main limitation of this study is that the results are based on a survey. While the information provided by department heads and consultants is considered reliable, it has not been audited or verified. Another important limitation is that a higher proportion of tertiary and university hospitals in Catalonia were included. Although we conducted sensitivity analyses showing similar results when comparing only university hospitals, we were unable to compare smaller hospitals. Additionally, we lack complete data on the number of hospitals in each included country and their complexity. A strength of this study is the high participation rate of hospitals in Catalonia, which represents all public tertiary hospitals with intensive care units.

In conclusion, hospitals in Catalonia, a region with a sepsis management programme (Codigo Sepsis) promoted by healthcare policy, have higher rates of sepsis screening and standardised sepsis management.
