Genetic association studies play a pivotal role in identifying disease-associated variants, but researchers face challenges in performing essential calculations like Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium testing, odds ratios, and confidence intervals due to reliance on manual methods or multiple software tools. We aimed to developGeneRiskCalc, an integrated web-based platform that simplifies genetic association analysis by automating Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium assessment, odds ratios with confidence interval calculation, and visual data presentation in case–control studies. Using an HTML/CSS/JavaScript framework, we developed online software with three core functionalities: (1) automated HWE evaluation, (2) odds ratio with 95% confidence interval computation with statistical validation, and (3) dynamic Forest Plot generation for data visualization. The tool was designed with an intuitive interface to minimize prerequisite statistical expertise.

The tool, named theGeneticRiskAssociationCalculator (GeneRiskCalc), demonstrated high computational accuracy in HWE testing (χ2validation) and association metrics (odds ratio and confidence interval). The results were cross-validated against established statistical methods, confirming their reliability. Furthermore, the integrated Forest Plotter enabled immediate visualization of effect sizes across multiple genetic models, facilitating a comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations.

By integrating essential analytical steps into a single platform, theGeneRiskCalc, streamlines genetic epidemiology workflows, addressing key challenges in data analysis. Its user-friendly interface enhances accessibility, promotes reproducibility, and accelerates research in genetic association studies. The tool is freely available atGeneRiskCalc(https://sites.google.com/view/GeneRiskCalc/home?authuser=0).

Disease is fundamentally an abnormal condition that disrupts the structure or function of an organism, often marked by distinct signs, symptoms, or dysfunctions (cancer.gov). Its development is not a matter of chance but rather the outcome of a dynamic interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. While external influences such as diet, exposure to toxins, and physical activity can be modified, genetic predisposition remains an immutable force shaping an individual’s susceptibility, progression, and severity of disease [1–3,4].

Genetic susceptibility often arises from genomic variations, among which Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common. On average, the human genome contains approximately 4–5 million SNPs when compared to the reference genome, with one SNP occurring roughly every 1,000 base pairs (Fact Sheet: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)| CD Genomics Blog), although regional variation in SNP density exists. Variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1% are classified as common SNPs [5–7]. SNPs have different forms, with the biallelic type being the most common, where a single genetic locus has two possible alleles. In contrast, tri-allelic and tetra-allelic SNPs, where three or four alleles occur at a locus are much less frequent in the human genome and represent a minor fraction of total SNP variation [8]. At the population level, one allele, often referred to as the “wild-type or major allele” tends to be more common and is usually associated with normal biological function. The alternative or the minor allele (less frequent), although not inherently deleterious, may under certain circumstances be associated with increased disease susceptibility. This potential arises through mechanisms such as altered gene expression, disruptions in protein structure, or interference with key metabolic pathways [9–11]. By subtly reshaping molecular and cellular processes, they create a predisposition to disease that may remain silent until triggered by environmental or physiological stressors [10,12,13]. This intricate genetic architecture underscores why some individuals remain resilient against diseases, while others, carrying specific SNPs, are at heightened risk.

To investigate the association between risk alleles and disease susceptibility, researchers commonly employ case–control studies, a type of observational study that compares individuals with the disease (cases) to those without the disease (controls) [14]. These Genetic Association Studies (GAS) rely on key statistical measures such as the Odds Ratio (OR), which estimates the strength of association between a risk allele and disease, and Confidence Intervals (CI), which indicate the precision and reliability of the OR [14]. However, calculating these measures traditionally involves manual computation or the use of separate online calculators for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and OR, as well as complex statistical software, which can present challenges for efficient analysis. Therefore, to address this limitation, we developed a web-based tool that simplifies genetic association analysis. It assesses HWE to evaluate population stability and automates the calculation of OR and CI for case–control studies. The tool also includes an integrated Forest Plotter for visualizing association data. By streamlining these processes, this tool enables efficient analysis of genetic risk factors, supporting advancements in genetic research and precision medicine.

TheGeneticRiskAssociationCalculator (GeneRiskCalc), is a web-based tool designed for accessibility, requiring no programming expertise or software installation. Its intuitive interface enables researchers to input genotypic data, perform statistical analyses, and visualize results interactively.GeneRiskCalcwas specifically developed to support essential analyses in candidate gene association studies using single SNP inputs, offering streamlined calculation of HWE, genotype/allele frequencies, risk under genetic models, and multiple testing corrections.

GeneRiskCalcis an online application designed for genetic association analysis, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure accessibility without requiring installations or server dependencies. The tool features a responsive interface for data input and output visualization, powered by a robust statistical engine that performs HWE testing (calculating allele frequencies, expected genotype distributions, and chi-square tests) and association analyses (OR with 95% CI). It includes multiple testing corrections via Bonferroni adjustment and validates inputs to prevent calculation errors. Results are presented in structured tables, with optional forest plot visualization by manual data entry. The application was validated against established software and simulated datasets, confirming its accuracy for both standard and edge-case scenarios. Entirely browser-based,GeneRiskCalcoffers researchers a fast, secure, and platform-independent solution for genetic risk assessment.

The HWE is a key principle in population genetics, stating that allele and genotype frequencies remain stable across generations in the absence of evolutionary forces like mutation, genetic drift, migration, or selection. In genetic association studies, HWE testing helps identify deviations that may indicate genotyping errors, population stratification, or non-random mating. In case–control studies, HWE is typically assessed in the control group to ensure data validity, as significant deviations may suggest biases that could affect association findings [15].

where: p2= frequency of the “AA” genotype, 2pq = frequency of the “Aa” genotype, and q2= frequency of the “aa” genotype.

After applying Eq. (2), we obtain the expected genotype frequencies. These expected values are then compared to the observed genotype frequencies to determine whether there is a significant difference between them. To assess this difference, a chi-square (χ2) test is performed.

where:χ2= chi-square test statistic, Oi = observed genotype counts, and Ei = expected genotype counts (calculated from allele frequencies). It is important to note that a p-value greater than 0.05 indicates no significant deviation from HWE, suggesting that the population is in equilibrium. Conversely, ap-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant deviation from HWE, warranting further investigation to assess potential genotyping errors, population stratification, or other confounding factors.

The OR is a key statistical measure used to assess the strength of association between a genetic variant and a disease in case–control studies. It quantifies how the presence or absence of a particular allele or genotype affects the odds of developing a disease. In genetic association studies, different genetic models such as dominant, recessive, codominant, over-dominant, and allele models are used for the calculation of risk [16]. The OR is typically determined using a 2 × 2 contingency table that organizes allele or genotype counts for cases and controls (Table1).

where:a= Number of cases with the risk alleleb= Number of controls with the risk allele,c= Number of cases without the risk allele, andd= Number of controls without the risk allele.

After obtaining the OR, calculating the 95% confidence interval (CI) is crucial for assessing the statistical significance and precision of the estimated association. The CI is computed using the logarithmic method based on the standard error (SE) of the natural logarithm (ln) of the OR.

After calculating the values, interpreting the OR and CI is crucial in genetic association studies. An OR of 1 indicates no association between the genetic variant and disease risk, while an OR greater than 1 suggests increased odds of disease, implying the variant may be a risk factor. Conversely, an OR less than 1 indicate decreased odds of disease, suggesting a potential protective effect. The 95% CI provides additional insight into statistical significance; if the interval includes 1, the association is generally considered not statistically significant, meaning the observed effect could be due to chance rather than a true genetic relationship [14].

In this study, a p-value threshold of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This standard criterion was used to assess whether the observed differences in genotype frequencies or associations were unlikely to have occurred by chance. A p-value below this threshold was interpreted as evidence of a true genetic effect.

GeneRiskCalcrequires genotypic counts for Homozygous Dominant (HW), Heterozygous (HT), and Homozygous Recessive (HR) in both case and control groups. These values are used for HWE analysis and OR calculation with a 95% CI andp-value.

Concerning the Output, the results will include genotypic frequency, allele frequency, HWE status based on χ2value,p-value (assessing genetic equilibrium), and OR/CI withp-value (indicating genetic association strength). For visualization, users can manually input OR and CI values or copy data from Excel into the integrated Forest Plotter to illustrate effect size and direction.

The results are displayed in a structured table, presenting clear and organized information on key statistical measures, including allele and genotype counts, HWE with χ2andp-values, and OR with 95% CI, andp-values. Additionally, Bonferroni correction is applied for multiple genetic models to ensure accuracy.

The accuracy and reliability ofGeneRiskCalcwere rigorously validated through multiple approaches. Benchmark testing compared results with established tools to ensure precision. For HWE analysis, various online software were used such as bio. blog.labs (Seb Carvello—Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium Calculator), Wpcalc (Online Calculator of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium), San Mateo (Excel file: Supplementary file-1).

Furthermore, to validate and compare the calculated ORs, several freely available online tools were utilized. These included MedCalc’s Odds Ratio Calculator (https://www.medcalc.org/calc/odds_ratio.php), GIGA Calculator’s Odds Ratio tool (https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/odds-ratio-calculator.php), the OpenEpi 2 × 2 Table Statistics tool (OpenEpi–2 × 2 Table Statistics), and the Odds Ratio calculator provided by Epitools (https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/twobytwotable). These platforms facilitated cross-verification of OR values and supported a robust interpretation of the statistical results.

To ensure result consistency, simulated datasets with predefined HWE status (Table2) and OR values were analyzed (Table3). Additionally, real-world genetic association datasets were tested to validate performance in practical scenarios (Table4). The tool’s robustness was further assessed by evaluating edge cases, including scenarios with zero genotype counts and extreme OR values (Table2). Finally, user interface testing was conducted to ensure seamless data input, intuitive result interpretation, and overall ease of use. Together, these validation steps confirm thatGeneRiskCalcdelivers accurate, reliable, and robust results for genetic association analysis. The workflow ofGeneRiskCalc, from data input to result visualization, is depicted in Fig.1.

TheGeneRiskCalcis a specialized tool designed for HWE analysis and genetic association evaluation in case–control association studies. It plays a crucial role in assessing genotype distributions within a population, including HW, HT, and HR counts for both case and control groups. This allows researchers to determine potential associations between genetic variants and disease susceptibility. By inputting genotype counts (Fig.2) for both cases and controls, users can evaluate whether observed genotype frequencies deviate from expected values under equilibrium conditions (Fig.3).

Beyond HWE testing,GeneRiskCalcalso facilitates the analysis of genetic variant associations across multiple genetic models (Fig.4), helping researchers assess the risk of disease development linked to specific genetic variants. To ensure robust statistical interpretation,GeneRiskCalcoffers an optional Bonferroni correction (Figs.2,3,4) for multiple testing, minimizing the risk of false-positive findings. The platform is designed to provide highly reliable and accurate genetic risk assessments (Table2), incorporating various inheritance models to offer deeper insights into the genetic basis of complex traits (Table3).

Beyond statistical calculations,GeneRiskCalcalso features a forest plot visualization tool. Users can copy their association values and paste them into Excel for data cleaning (Fig.5) before transferring them into the Forest Plotter (Fig.6). This feature simplifies plot generation, editing, and downloading. It enhances data presentation, allowing users to visually interpret and communicate their findings clearly and effectively. By integrating advanced statistical methods with intuitive visualization tools,GeneRiskCalcprovides a powerful and user-friendly platform for conducting comprehensive genetic association studies.

To evaluate the accuracy and reliability ofGeneRiskCalcin assessing HWE, we conducted a rigorous comparison with multiple online HWE calculators, including Bio. Blog. Labs, Wpcalc, and San Mateo. Using simulated datasets (SD1–SD10), we analyzed genotype distributions for HW, HT, and HR individuals, calculating χ2values and corresponding p-values across these tools (Table2). Our results demonstrated a high degree of consistency betweenGeneRiskCalcand other established HWE calculators. This agreement underscores the statistical robustness ofGeneRiskCalc, confirming that minor variations in rounding methods or computational algorithms do not affect the outcomes. These findings reinforceGeneRiskCalcas a reliable tool for assessing genetic equilibrium in association studies.

In addition to HWE testing, we validated the accuracy of our tool by analyzing ORs. To ensure reproducibility and precision,GeneRiskCalc’sORs outputs were cross-verified against those generated by multiple established online (see section: Validation of GeneRiskCalc) OR calculators using randomly selected simulated datasets (Table2). The results demonstrated a high level of consistency across platforms, affirming the reliability ofGeneRiskCalcin genetic association studies (Table3). Minor discrepancies observed were attributable to rounding differences or display precision rather than methodological variations. This validation step is essential, as discrepancies in OR values can lead to misinterpretation of genetic associations. By confirming the accuracy ofGeneRiskCalc’sOR computations, we establish it as a robust and dependable tool for genetic risk assessment.

To further strengthen our validation, we extended our analysis beyond simulated datasets to include few published genetic association studies where some conducted within our laboratory [18–22,23] and some from external sources [24–28,29]; [30,31] (Table4). These studies represented diverse populations and varying sample sizes, providing a comprehensive dataset for comparison. Upon conducting calculations across these real-world datasets, we found a strong alignment between results obtained usingGeneRiskCalcand those originally reported in the publications. The consistency of findings across multiple datasets validates the reliability and applicability ofGeneRiskCalcin genetic research.

Enclosing the section, concerning the strength of theGeneRiskCalc, it is important to note that unlike other HWE or OR calculators, this tool is an all-in-one platform that integrates statistical computation with real-time visualization. Traditional approaches often require researchers to switch between multiple tools for HWE assessment, OR calculations, and data visualization, leading to inefficiencies and increased chances of error.GeneRiskCalcovercomes these limitations by offering a streamlined workflow where all essential genetic association analyses can be performed in a single interface. Its intuitive, web-based design eliminates the need for complex statistical software, making genetic risk assessment accessible to a broader audience, including clinicians, geneticists, and early-career researchers who may lack advanced bioinformatics expertise.

The primary strength ofGeneRiskCalclies in its integrated, web-based platform tailored for candidate gene association studies. It streamlines the analytical workflow by allowing users to perform essential genetic analyses such as HWE testing, genotype and allele frequency estimation, observed vs. expected genotype comparisons, odds ratio calculations across multiple genetic models, and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing within a single, user-friendly interface. Its intuitive design and one-click execution make it particularly accessible to researchers with limited programming or statistical expertise. Additionally, the tool includes a built-in forest plot generator, enabling users to visually summarize odds ratios and confidence intervals from association results.

Considering its intended scope, the current version ofGeneRiskCalcis purposefully optimized for single SNP analysis and does not support multiple SNP inputs or covariate adjustments (e.g., age, sex, population stratification). These design choices align with its focus on small- to medium-scale candidate gene studies, rather than complex genome-wide or multivariable models. Although forest plots can be generated using exported data, real-time, built-in visualization is not yet available. These limitations reflect the tool’s foundational aim which is to provide fast, user-friendly analysis of genotypic data using simple input formats.

Future versions ofGeneRiskCalcmay incorporate expanded functionalities, including batch processing of multiple SNPs, covariate adjustment through logistic regression, and fully integrated forest plot generation. These enhancements are intended to broaden the tool’s analytical scope while preserving its user-friendly interface. By supporting more comprehensive and visually integrated analyses, the tool will better align with the advancing demands of genetic epidemiology research.
