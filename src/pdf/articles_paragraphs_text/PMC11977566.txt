Visualizing the major salivary glands (MSGs) in domestic mammals using plain radiology and identifying damaged their structures is impossible. To accurately display MSGs, the knowledge of normal sectional imaging anatomy is essential for veterinarians, aiding them significantly in identifying the exact relations and position of MSGs; however, no reports on the MSGs sectional imaging anatomy in this species have been made.

This study aimed to evaluate computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gross sections of MSGs.

Seven healthy adult donkeys were used in this study. The sectioned heads were evaluated by CT and 1.5 Tesla MRI. After imaging, the frozen slab sections were photographed, and identified anatomic structures were matched with structures on corresponding CT and/or MRI images.

The main topographical anatomy references were the external auditory canal and the digastricus muscle for the parotid salivary gland (PSG), digastricus muscle, body of thyroid cartilage and thyrohyoid muscle for the rostral and caudal lobes of the mandibular salivary gland (MSG) as well as the mylohyoid muscle and tongue for the polystomatic sublingual salivary gland (PSSG). The main CT landmarks for PSG were the external auditory canal, atlas wing and digastricus muscle for the caudal lobe, the body of thyroid cartilage and thyrohyoid muscle for the rostral lobe of MSG and the body of mandible and tongue for PSSG. The consistent MRI landmarks were the external auditory canal, the guttural pouch and maxillary vein for PSG, the body of thyroid cartilage and the thyrohyoid muscle for MSG's rostral lobe. The PSSG was not discerned in MRI. The sectional anatomy and imaging of donkey MSGs were similar to those that have been reported in the horse; the principal difference involved the perforation of the PSG substance in horse by the maxillary vein.

Labelled transverse cross‐sectional imaging anatomy of the donkey MSGs was produced sequentially as an initial reference to aid in evaluating and interpretating of the sectional imaging studies of these structures in this species.

This study aimed to evaluate computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance image (MRI) and gross sections of the major salivary glands.

The three paired major salivary glands (MSGs) (parotid, submandibular and sublingual) in herbivores play a significant role in preserving the overall health of oral structures and gastric environment (Bell et al.2007). Accordingly, conditions that affect the salivary glands and their function directly affect the mouth and stomach (Smith2019). The domestic animals’ salivary glands and associated ducts are not visible on plain radiographs (Kealy et al.2011; Thrall2018). However, both sectional imaging diagnostic techniques, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), permit remarkable accuracy in both anatomical and pathological diagnosis of the complex anatomy of head structures and have largely replaced the plain radiography, largely due to their tomographic capabilities and superior contrast resolution (Kealy et al.2011; Thrall2018) and can be used to depict the position and relationships of the structures without the problem of superimposition (Epperly and Whitty2020; Greco et al.2022; Tucker and Frrell2001).

The domestic horse (Equus caballus) and the donkey (Equus asinus) share a common ancestry but have evolved into morphologically distinct species. All structures cannot be assumed to have similar anatomy (Burden and Thiemann2015; Merkies et al.2020). Donkeys are primarily used as pack animals, companions and for the production of meat or milk (Bennett and Pfuderer2020; Li et al.2020; Liu et al.2020). Worldwide, there are an estimated 44 million donkeys, with 96% of them located in developing countries, where they constitute a major economic asset (Fielding1991). However, the European donkey population is currently on the rise, driven by the production of donkey milk (McLean and Gonzalez2018). Salivary gland diseases and disorders in donkeys are relatively rare or underdiagnosed. Interestingly, the prevalence of sialoliths in donkeys is notably elevated, with a 70% occurrence, compared to other equids, where horses have a 20% occurrence, and mules have a 10% occurrence (Kay2006).

To accurately evaluate and interpret CT or MR images of the MSGs, it is essential to know the sectional anatomy of clinically normal MSGs (Feeney et al.1991).

A review of the available literature revealed that the correlative CT or MRI image anatomy of the head structures in donkeys, including cavities (El‐Gendy et al.2013) and the guttural pouch (Alsafy et al.2008; Oto and Haziroglu2011), has been published. However, no report has been made on the normal sectional anatomy of the donkey MSGs with correlative CT and MR images. Therefore, in‐line with our research on the anatomy and sialography of MSGs in water buffalos (Nourinezhad et al.2021), the main objectives of this study were to provide a description of the bi‐dimensional anatomy of the MSGs in donkeys and to compare transverse gross sections of the MSGs with corresponding CT and MRI scans to provide useful information that enables the veterinarian to establish a diagnosis and select appropriate therapy.

A total of seven adult donkeys (four males and three females) were used in this study. The donkeys belong to the Khuzestan province in the southwest of Iran. The donkeys were fed ad libitum with a fresh forage (grass), hay and clean water. The specimens were intact, without any external abnormalities or pathologies. The local ethical committee approved all procedures for the use of animals in experiments. The donkeys were sedated with 2 mg/kg xylazine HCl 2% and administered intramuscularly (I/M). The donkeys were euthanized using 50 mg of sodium pentobarbital per kg of body weight administered intravenously (I/V) (Leary et al.2013). The euthanized specimens were used for teaching purposes in dissection hall of the anatomy department of faculty veterinary. All donkey heads were sectioned at the level of the C2–C3 intervertebral space for the current study.

Scout films in the lateral oblique projections of the sectioned heads were acquired using a Toshiba KCD‐10M‐6AIT x‐ray unit (Japan) and system: Prima CR radiology device, CR ‐ 1392 model, Fujifilm, Japan to grossly identify any abnormalities.

The sectioned head was cooled and imaged within 24 h of euthanasia to minimize post‐mortem changes. The head region was scanned in ventral recumbency using a 64‐slice CT scanner (Siemens, Somatom Emotion, Germany). The heads were positioned in the right lateral recumbency with the image plane perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the head and the occlusal surfaces of the cheek teeth. Transverse 5 mm contagious slices of the head were obtained using protocols for the soft tissue and bone. Scan settings were 110 kV, 130 mA and 50 cm field diameter (view). A window level of 35 using a window width of 300 was used to assess the MSGs and soft tissues (Solano and Brawer2004).

Immediately after CT acquisition, MRI data were acquired using a 1.5 Tesla MRI (Phillips, Ingenia, USA). The head was positioned in ventral recumbency on the scanning table inside a 20‐channel head/neck coil (Siemens, Germany). The T2‐weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: echo time (TE) of 110.0 ms, repetition time (TR) of 4882.4 ms, slice thickness of 5.0 mm, field of view (FOV) of 230 × 230 mm2and matrix size of 288 × 60. The voxel size was approximately 0.5 mm with a slice spacing of 0.5 mm. A flip angle (FA) of 90° was used. A medical imaging viewer (RadiAnt DICOM Viewer 2023.1, Medixant Co., Poznan, Poland) was used to assess the images of the study.

After imaging, the heads of the examined donkeys were frozen at −70° centigrade at ventral recumbency. Afterwards, the heads were transversally sectioned using the electronic band saw at the rostral level of the facial crest, at the level of the orbital cavity and at the region of the external auditory canal (parotid region) (Popesko1986). The slices were gently cleaned from debris with cold running water and light brushing. Subsequently, they were blotted dry and immediately photographed (Nourinezhad et al.2025) using an iPhone 13 Pro Max on both sides of the sections. A set of cadaveric sections in which all of the regional anatomic structures could be observed with a minimum repetition of specific structures was chosen. Identifiable anatomical structures were first labelled on photographic slides of the cadaver sections to access multiple veterinary anatomical textbooks (Popesko1986; Ashdown and Done2012) and were labelled according to the official anatomical terminology of the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (2017). CT and MRI scans were selected to identify the best anatomical correlation. Afterwards, all recognizable anatomic structures on the frozen sections were correlated to analogous structures corresponding to the CT and MRI slices and then labelled on the images. Some structures that were present in the anatomical sections could not be observed on the corresponding MR and CT images. Before the photographs were captured, a part of a steel ruler was placed in anatomical sections, and gross dissections were used as a scale bar, with the distance between the two lines set to 1 mm.

No clinical complications were observed in any of the examined heads. The sectional anatomy and imaging of the MSGs were not exhibited sex differences. The results of our study are presented as matched photographs in the figures, in which three cross‐sections and their corresponding CT and MR images were selected. The lateral projection of the donkey head, with lines indicating the approximate levels of each CT, MRI and an anatomical slice of the frozen cadaver, is presented in Figure1. The transverse planes of the CT (A), cadaver slab (B) and MR (C) images of the head are shown in Figures2,3,4.

Parotid salivary gland (PSG) had topographical anatomical references to the external auditory canal dorsally, occipito‐mandibular belly of the digastricus muscle, combined insertion tendons of the brachiocephalicus and sternocephalicus, stylohyoid bone and guttural pouch medially, mandibular salivary gland (MSG) ventrally and parotidoauricularis laterally. The maxillary vein was passed dorsomedial to the PSG (Figure4). The MSG was consisted of two lobes (cranial and caudal). The caudal lobe had topographic anatomical references to the digastricus muscle, medial retropharyngeal lymph node, atlas wing and guttural pouch medially; ventral border of the PSG dorsally and the brachiocephalic muscle ventrally (Figure4). The cranial lobe of the MSG was exhibited topographic anatomical references to the body of the thyroid cartilage and the thyrohyoid muscle medially, the fused omohyoid and sternohyoid muscles ventrally and the medial pterygoid muscle laterally (Figure3). The polystomatic sublingual salivary glands (PSSG) was exhibited topographic anatomical references to the omohyoid muscle laterally, genioglossus muscle and mandibular duct dorsomedially, geniohyoid muscle ventrally and fat tissue medially (Figure2). The main topographical references for the PSG, MSG and PSSG were the external auditory canal, digastricus muscle, mylohyoid muscle and tongue body, respectively.

The best topographical landmark for the PSG was the external auditory canal which had a radiolucent appearance. The PSG was located immediately ventral to the external auditory canal (Figure4). The best topographical landmark for the caudal lobe of the MSG was the atlas wing which had a radiodense appearance. The MSG was positioned ventrolateral to the wing of the atlas (Figure4). The best topographical landmark for the rostral lobe of the MSG was the body of the thyroid cartilage which had a radiodense appearance. This lobe of the MSG was situated ventrolateral to the body of the thyroid cartilage (Figure3). The best topographical landmark for the PSSG was fat tissue under the body of the tongue which had a radiolucent appearance. The PSSG was situated on both sides of the fat tissue under the tongue body, medial to the middle of the mandibular body (Figure2).

On the MR images (Figures2,3,4), anatomical details of the MSGs and related structures were evaluated based on the signal intensity. On the T2‐weighted image, the PSG and MSG had a high signal intensity relative to the muscular tissue. On the T2‐weighted image, the signal intensity of the salivary glands was variable in relation to the muscle tissue. In general, the highest and lowest signal differences in this enhancement between the MSGs and muscle were related to the PSG and MSG, respectively. The MSG had the lowest signal difference on the transverse section and was identified by means of the low signal intensity compared to the other salivary glands. The main salivary duct and PSSG were not identified. The signal intensity of the MSGs appeared homogeneous in the MSG and heterogeneous in the PSG.

Due to the lack of reports on sectional anatomy and imaging of the salivary glands in donkeys, the findings of this part of the study were compared with such sections in the horse's head.

A thorough understanding of the sectional anatomy of the head region is the first step towards correctly interpreting images obtained from CT and MRI. Transverse cross‐sections of the head are the most useful and common anatomical sections, allowing for the removal of superimposing structures and improving the visualization and differentiation of soft tissues and bony structures. However, dorsal, sagittal and oblique planes of the head are uncommon (Stieger‐Vanegas and Hanna2022).

The oblique transverse sections obtained in this study, particularly the last sections (T2 and T3), were more informative on topographic anatomy of the MSGs compared to anatomical and sectional imaging of the horse provided in existing references. These sections revealed the PSG and MSG with adjacent structures (Getty1975; Nickel et al.1979; Popesko1986; Dyce et al.2010; Kimberlin et al.2017). According to Kimberlin et al. (2017), the MSG was not visible in the three sections presented at different levels of the atlas bone. Another difference between the present study's sections and the images by Kimberlin et al. (2017) relates to the absence of contact between the lateral or medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the PSG or MSG in any horse head sections.

Budras et al. (2009), in their book ‘The Anatomy of the Horse’, mentioned that the lateral retropharyngeal lymph node is located deep to the PSG between the dorsal end MSG and the occipito‐mandibular belly of the digastric muscle against the lateral surface of the guttural pouch. Therefore, it can be concluded that similar to the veterinary anatomy textbooks (Barone2009, Dyce et al.2010), this lymph node is not in contact with the PSG, which agrees with the present study's findings. However, according to other anatomical textbooks (Getty1975; Nickel et al.1979), the parotid gland is in contact with the retropharyngeal lymph node, though no specific mention of whether the lymph node is lateral or medial retropharyngeal lymph node was made (Getty1975; Nickel et al.1979).

In horses, the maxillary vein passes through the parenchyma of the PSG (Popesko1986; Dyce et al.2010), but observations from this study in donkeys did not show such anatomical features.

In the current investigation, the PSG and MSG, except at the level of the atlas, were separated by the digastric muscle throughout most of their courses, consistent with the images from Popesko (1986) and Dyce et al. (2010) and the online guide to equine dissection (Knight and Powell2001).

Regarding the MSG, the anatomical relationships observed in the studied donkeys were similar to those documented in horses (Getty1975; Popesko1986; Dyce et al.2010).

The topography of the PSSG in horses (Getty1975; Nickel et al.1979; Popesko1986) was similar to that in the examined donkeys. However, in the gross cross‐section presented by Popesko (1986) at the level of the last molar tooth in horses, this gland is shown to be in contact with the styloglossus muscle. In contrast, in the present study, the gross cross‐section at the level of the third premolar teeth showed no such a contact. This discrepancy is attributed to the difference in the location of the gross transverse sectioning between horses and donkeys.

To date, no studies have been published on the CT sections of normal salivary glands in donkeys, nor their correspondence with anatomical sections. However, in the ‘Atlas of Clinical Imaging and Anatomy of the Equine Head’, the salivary glands are identified by CT (Kimberlin et al.2017).

CT is useful for evaluating structures within or adjacent to the salivary glands in horses, as it displays soft tissue, hard tissue and subtle differences in soft tissue density (Stieger‐Vanegas and Hanna2022). In veterinary medicine, CT is considered one of the most reliable advanced diagnostic methods for identifying the salivary system (Tan et al.2022). Typically, cross‐sectional CT images are taken using a soft tissue window after intravenous contrast administration, and salivary glands are easily distinguishable from the surrounding fats and muscles (Stieger‐Vanegas and Hanna2022). In this regard, (Solano and Brawer2004) demonstrated the PSG and MSG in horses using contrast‐enhanced CT images obtained with a soft tissue window. However, no descriptions were made on the horse salivary gland imaging in the book ‘Veterinary CT’ (Schwarz and Saunders2011). On the other hand, they reported that MSGs in dogs and cats, except their ducts and papillae, can be visualized on contrast‐enhanced CT.

In equine medicine, contrast‐enhanced CT is used to diagnose sialocele or sialadenitis in the PSG and MSG, as well as parotid melanoma (Dixon et al.2016). Melanoma, one of the most common tumours in horses, often involves the PSG and appears hyperattenuating compared to adjacent muscles. This contrasts with human melanomas, which exhibit a wider range of appearances (Stieger‐Vanegas and Hanna2022). Additionally, CT sialography is useful in identifying salivary duct dilation and obstructions and can detect sialoliths (mineralized structures) in horses (Stieger‐Vanegas and Hanna2022).

Because the salivary system is close to vascular, neural and lymphatic structures, surgical management can be challenging. Therefore, accurately identifying affected salivary glands and ducts before surgery is crucial. Multi‐dimensional imaging of the salivary glands and ducts through CT can be used for preoperative planning in cases of salivary stones, duct rupture or salivary gland injuries (Kneissl et al.2011).

Because MRI can provide excellent soft tissue images, it is considered the best technique for studying salivary glands. Currently, MRI is the preferred imaging method for evaluating salivary gland diseases in dogs (Durand et al.2016). It is particularly useful for showing salivary gland masses, internal gland structures and regional extension of the lesion into adjacent spaces and tissues (Weidner et al.2012; Durand et al.2016; Gil et al.2018). The use of intravenous contrast agents, usually gadolinium, can help improve the resolution of tumour images. Suppression of high‐fat signals surrounding the glands is also commonly done to enhance the appearance of tumours. Additionally, MRI with stimulated saliva secretion, acting as a natural contrast, effectively displays duct morphology and sialoliths. Examinations of the salivary glands typically use T1‐ and T2‐weighted sequences, where T1‐weighted images are mainly used to show anatomical regions, best illustrating bone structures. T2‐weighted images, on the other hand, are commonly used to show pathological or inflammatory changes, with T2‐weighted sequences distinguishing salivary glands and surrounding structures better than T1–T1‐weighted sequences (Kneissl et al.2011; Weidner et al.2012; Durand et al.2016; Gil et al.2018). Inflamed salivary glands typically appear enlarged, showing lower tissue signals in T1‐weighted images and higher signals in T2‐weighted images compared to the surrounding muscles (Mallya and Lam2014).

Regarding MRI imaging of normal salivary glands in donkeys, no data have been published so far. Nevertheless, salivary glands are depicted in the ‘Atlas of Clinical Imaging and Anatomy of the Equine Head’ (Kimberlin et al.2017). The authors demonstrated the MSGs in transverses MRI sections of the horse's head in T1‐weighted sequences. Comparing these images to those in this study indicates that the topographical landmarks of equine MSGs are similar to those of donkeys, with the notable difference being that the maxillary vein perforates the PSG in horses. On the other hand, several reports on the gross anatomical sections and MRI sections of salivary glands in dogs are available (Weidner et al.2012; Durand et al.2016; Gil et al.2018), providing a basis for comparison with the findings of this study. Similar to the current study, the signal intensity of the salivary glands in dogs is higher in T2‐weighted images compared to muscle tissue (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018).

Contrary to the results of this study, the signal intensity of the MSGs in T2‐weighted images differs from muscle tissue in dogs. Generally, the greatest signal difference between muscle and salivary glands is seen in the MSG and sublingual glands, whereas the PSG exhibits the least difference (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018). In traverse cross‐sectional images, the PSG in dogs shows the lowest signal contrast, appearing darker compared to other salivary glands (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018). This contrasts with the current study's findings, likely due to differences in salivary secretions. In equines, the PSG is purely serous (Barone2009), whereas in carnivores, it is seromucous (mixed). The MSG in equines and humans is seromucous with more serous cells, but in carnivores, it is also seromucous with more mucous cells. The sublingual salivary gland in domestic animals is seromucous, with a greater proportion of mucous cells (Barone2009). Mixed secretions containing more proteins, such as in seromucous glands, may produce higher signal intensity compared to purely serous secretions. Differences in free versus bound water distribution could also explain the observed signal intensity patterns (Weidner et al.2012). These differences in secretion types may explain the varying MRI signal intensities observed between donkeys and dogs. The authors of this study suggest that increased serous fluid leads to higher signal intensity in salivary glands, whereas increased mucous fluid results in lower (darker) signal intensity.

The main salivary ducts and the PSSG in dogs were not identifiable in MRI images (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018), similar to the findings of this study.

Like dogs (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018), the structures of the donkey MSG are homogeneous, whereas the donkey PSG is more heterogeneous.

In transverse MR images, the PSG in dogs appears triangular and is located ventrally to the external auditory canal. The MSG is located ventral to the PSG, and the digastric muscle lies medial to the MSG (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018). The topographical descriptions of the PSG in dogs and donkeys are similar in MRI cross‐sections regardless of the PSG position relative to the MSG.

In transverses MR images, the MSG in dogs is oval and is surrounded by the medial retropharyngeal lymph node medially, the linguofacial vein ventrolaterally and the maxillary vein dorsolaterally (Weidner et al.2012; Gil et al.2018). These topographical relationships differ from those observed in the examined donkeys.

To obtain images with better resolution and macroscopic anatomic identification for evaluating salivary glands and related vascular structures in donkeys, vascular tomographic imaging, including CT and MR angiography, are very useful techniques, similar to MR angiography reported in dogs (Gil et al.2018). Moreover, CT and MR sialography demonstrate the normal appearance of the parotid and mandibular ductal system and the outline of the gland body due to filling of the acini with contrast material in dogs (Kneissl et al.2011); such techniques were not used in this study because the objective was to present plain CT and MRI images made by standard procedures.

The matched anatomical‐CT‐MRI images and data reported in the present study may provide veterinary clinicians with useful references of clinically relevant anatomic structure appearance, position and relations for CT, MRI and even ultrasonographic evaluation of the MSGs in donkeys.
