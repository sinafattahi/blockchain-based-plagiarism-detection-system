Synthetic surfactants have been associated with environmental concerns, requiring their replacement with natural alternatives such as saponins. In this study, saponin extraction from soapnut was optimized using the reflux method through the Box–Behnken design and response surface methodology (RSM). Foams generated from the saponin solution were evaluated for effectiveness in ammonia and particulate matter (PM) removal, along with foam characteristic analysis. The optimized saponin extraction yielded 30.18% saponin, exceeding the yields achieved through conventional methods. The extracted saponin exhibited enhanced foamability with increasing concentrations, leading to an expanded surface area that facilitated the removal ammonia and PM removal through foam-based adsorption. Ammonia removal was further improved as the foamability and stability of surfactant foams increased at saponin concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) under neutral pH conditions. The comparable PM removal efficiency of saponin-based foams to that of synthetic surfactants underscores their potential as an effective and environmentally sustainable solution for air pollution control.

Foams generated from soapnut-derived saponins can be utilized for the removal of air pollutants such as ammonia and particulate matter.

Given the environmental benefits of natural surfactants, researchers have worked to improve their extraction techniques, with two primary optimization methods currently in use. The first approach, the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method, systematically adjusted a single variable at a time to refine surfactant extraction processes.10,11The second, the response surface method (RSM), employed regression analysis to develop equations that explained the relationships between variables and yields, facilitating the identification of optimal conditions.12,13However, many studies that focused on enhancing the extraction efficiency of natural surfactants neglected to assess other critical properties, such as foam characteristics and their potential applications in contaminant removal.

Air pollutants such as ammonia, have been recognized as precursors to particulate matter (PM), contributing to air quality deterioration and posing significant health risks.14,15Especially, the majority of ammonia emissions in the United States, approximately 60%, were attributed to livestock manure, while 20% originated from synthetic fertilizers.16Once released into the atmosphere, ammonia reacted with pollutants such as SOxand NOx, forming secondary PM and further exacerbating air pollution. Given its role as a PM precursor, ammonia contributed to indirect health risks by increasing ambient PM concentrations, which had been associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. The combined health risks presented by PM and ammonia underscore the necessity for effective removal strategies to mitigate both direct exposure hazards and further air pollution.

Ammonia and PM have conventionally been removed using packed towers, spraying, biological treatment, or zeolite adsorption.17,18These methods were characterized by complex equipment requirements, reliance on chemicals, and high operational costs, thereby necessitating more efficient and cost-effective removal approaches.19,20Considering the increased adsorption surface area is essential for enhancing removal efficiency, the utilization of surfactant solutions to generate foams represents an effective approach, as the foams continuously offer an expanded interface for pollutant capture.21–23Previously, synthetic surfactant foams were applied to capture coal dust during mining, achieving a removal efficiency of over 70%.24,25Also, dust suppression using synthetic surfactant foams achieved a reduction in dust generation exceeding 30% and a decrease in water usage of more than 70% relative to conventional spraying methods.26However, research on the potential of natural surfactants for air pollutant removal remains limited.

In this study, the extraction process of saponin from soapnut was optimized using a Box–Behnken design and RSM to enhance saponin yield. Furthermore, the saponin foam-based removal of ammonia and PM, along with its foam characteristics, was examined to determine its potential as an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic surfactants in air pollution control.

Commercially available dry soapnut husks were grounded to a particle size below 75 μm and subsequently mixed with 200 mL of ethanol and/or deionized water mixture in a three-neck flask for extraction. Saponin was extracted using the reflux extraction method,12under varying extraction temperature (30 to 80 °C), ethanol concentration (0 to 50%), soapnut-to-solvent ratio (0.04 to 0.1 g mL−1), and extraction time (1 to 9 hours).

The saponin extract was subjected to vacuum filtration and subsequently concentrated in the water bath at 100 °C to enable saponin quantification. The dried extract was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 20 mL of 99%n-butanol to precipitate the saponins. The resulting mixture was dried again at 100 °C to evaporate then-butanol, thereby concentrating the extract and isolating the saponins.27,28The isolated saponins were dissolved in deionized water and analyzed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (METTLER TOLEDO, UV5) at a wavelength of 425 nm. Calibration curves were determined using a saponin standard (CAS no. 8047-15-2) in the concentration range of 0.5 to 4 mg mL−1. The extraction yield was then calculated using the following equation.

The effects of four variables (extraction temperature, ethanol concentration, soapnut-to-solvent ratio, and extraction time) on extraction yield were evaluated through single-factor experiments. Subsequently, the Box–Behnken design and RSM were applied to optimize the extraction process.29–31A total of 27 experimental runs were performed, incorporating four independent variables selected based on their significant influence on saponin yield. The statistical significance was evaluated through analysis of variance (ANOVA). Saponin yield was defined as the dependent variable, and a second-order polynomial equation was developed to describe its relationship with the independent variables.

Additionally, the viscosity of the saponin solution was measured using an Ostwald viscometer at room temperature, and relative viscosity was calculated based on the viscosity of deionized water (1 cP). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the saponin solution was determined based on foamability where the linear slope of foam generationversusconcentration exhibited a distinct change.

Ammonia removal experiments were conducted by introducing the ammonia gas from a Tedlar bag into a rectangular test chamber (length: 47.5 cm × width: 37.5 cm × height: 20 cm) at a flow rate of 0.5 L min−1using a gas pump (QC-10N, SIBATA). Ammonia concentration was monitored using an ammonia gas detector (Ventis Pro, Gastron). To ensure uniform dispersion of ammonia gas within the chamber, a fan was installed at the top. A circular tank (diameter: 18 cm) containing 1 L of saponin solution or deionized water and foam generators (S5, SRF) was placed inside the chamber (Fig. S1). Once the ammonia concentration in the chamber reached 100 ppm, the gas injection to the chamber was stopped and the foam generators were activated to generate foams. A series of experiments were conducted under varying solution pH levels (3–11), foam generator flow rates (0.5–2.0 L min−1), solution volumes (100–1500 mL), and saponin concentrations (0–0.16 wt%) to identify the optimal conditions for ammonia removal.

Foamability and stability experiments, conducted under the same conditions as the ammonia removal experiments, used a foam generator with a flow rate ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 L min−1. A 300 mL of saponin solution was placed in an acrylic cylinder with a diameter of 18 cm and a height of 50 cm. Foamability was assessed by measuring the foam height after 140 seconds of bubble generation, while stability was evaluated by recording the foam height remaining 5 minutes after foam generation was ceased.

The PM removal experiment was conducted by placing 3 L of saponin solution in a test chamber (L: 50 cm ×W: 50 cm ×H: 50 cm), and PM concentrations were measured using an aerosol spectrometer (DustDecoder 11-D, Grimm), following the methodology in a previous study (Fig. S1).23A 1 cm segment of an incense stick was burned to generate PM in a separate reservoir and injected into the test chamber using a gas pump (N96, KNF). Once the PM concentration reached 250 μg m−3, the PM injection to the chamber was stopped and foams were generated using a foam generator (KK-180C, Paladin) to initiate the PM removal process. Given that the PM generated from incense combustion was predominantly below 1 μm, this study specifically focused on the removal of PM1.0.

Foamability and stability tests were also conducted as described in Section 2.4. These tests were performed under the same conditions as the PM removal experiments, with the flow rate of the foam generator set at 5 L min−1.

The removal efficiency of particulate matter (PM) was evaluated using a mass balance approach within a continuous flow system, in which incense sticks were used as the PM emission source.

Three experimental configurations were implemented to accurately determine the amount of PM captured by the saponin-generated foam. First, in the air blank test, PM was introduced into an empty chamber without any saponin solution, while the foam generator operated for 60 minutes. This setup quantified background losses attributable to natural deposition onto the chamber walls and the foam generator. Second, in the bubble blank condition, foam was produced using the saponin solution without PM injection. This test measured mist particles generated from foam collapse, which could otherwise be misidentified as PM by the aerosol spectrometer (DustDecoder 11-D, Grimm). Third, in the bubble test, PM was introduced into the chamber containing the saponin solution, and foam was continuously generated for 60 minutes to assess the removal performance of the foam.

Single-factor experiments were conducted to examine the effects of extraction temperature, ethanol concentration, soapnut-to-solvent ratio, and extraction time on saponin yield and to establish the experimental range for each variable in the Box–Behnken design (Fig. 1).

The effect of ethanol concentration on saponin extraction indicated that yields were highest at concentrations below 25%, with a notable decline observed beyond this threshold (Fig. 1B). This trend was strongly associated with solvent polarity, as bioactive compounds like saponin dissolve effectively in polar solvents such as water or diluted ethanol, whereas their solubility decreases in less polar solvents like pure ethanol.36,37Additionally, elevated ethanol concentrations induced protein coagulation in plant extracts, further hindering saponin recovery.38Since ethanol concentrations exceeding 50% reduced the yield, solvents with ethanol concentrations below 25% were considered to have polarity more compatible with that of saponin.

The relationship between the soapnut-to-solvent ratio and saponin yield demonstrated an optimal point at 0.075 g mL−1, beyond which the yield was declined. This finding was consistent with previous studies,10,39,40which indicated that excessive powder concentration could reduce solubility and facilitate the extraction of unwanted compounds, such as polysaccharides and proteins, ultimately lowering saponin recovery.

A regression model was established based on the actual measurements obtained from the experimental series detailed in Table S1, with the resulting regression equation as below.

Evaluating the foam properties using the Ross-Miles method across various saponin concentrations revealed that foamability increased steadily with increasing saponin concentrations and saturated beyond 0.04 wt% (Fig. 2A). Notably, the slope of the linear increase in foamability changed significantly at 0.01 wt%, which was correlated with a decrease in stability and a reduced increase in viscosity. Especially, the viscosity of the solution was increased rapidly up to 0.01 wt% (Fig. 2B). Foam stability based onR5values, exceeded 50% at saponin concentrations above 0.000125 wt%, peaked at 0.01 wt%, and then slightly declined with further increases in concentration (Fig. 2C). This behavior was attributed to reduced foam drainage due to the sharp increase in viscosity up to 0.01 wt%, which enhanced stability.52However, at concentrations exceeding 0.01 wt%, the increased presence of surfactant molecules in the lamellae might lead to heavier foam, thereby accelerating foam drainage and reducing stability (Fig. 2D). The change in the linear trends of foamability and viscosity, along with the foam stability, indicates that this region corresponds to the CMC of the solution,53–55suggesting that the CMC of the extracted saponin was 0.01 wt%.

As shown in Fig. S3, foamability tests conducted under the same conditions as the ammonia removal experiments revealed that foamability increased with the flow rate, a trend attributed to the larger volume of air introduced into the saponin solution, which promoted greater foam generation. The effect of pH variations on foamability showed that foam generation was fairly vigorous under neutral conditions.56,57Furthermore, foamability was steadily increased with saponin concentration up to 0.04 wt%, beyond which it was plateaued. A strong correlation was observed between the foamability and stability of the saponin solution. As foam stability improved, the foam retention time was prolonged, enabling greater foam accumulation and consequently enhancing foamability. However, at higher flow rates, the correlation between foamability and stability weakened. Although increased flow rates facilitated greater air injection and foam formation, the associated rise in shear forces likely generated less stable foams with thinner films, resulting in reduced foam stability.

Ammonia removal experiments using saponin solution revealed that the removal efficiency increased with higher foam generation flow rates, saponin concentrations, and solution volumes at pH 7 (7.08 ± 0.08) (Fig. 3). The highest removal efficiency was observed at pH 7, with a decline noted as pH deviated from neutrality, reaching a minimum at pH 11 (Fig. 3B). This trend can be explained by the acid–base equilibrium of ammonia (pKa≈ 9.25),61where at neutral pH, ammonia predominantly exists as the water-soluble ionized form (NH4+), which can be effectively retained in the foam's aqueous phase. However, under alkaline conditions (pH > 9.25), the equilibrium shifts toward the uncharged form (NH3), which, although partially remaining dissolved, exhibits higher volatility and lower solubility compared to NH4+.62This makes it less likely to be retained in the foam matrix, thereby reducing the overall removal efficiency. In addition, the removal efficiency of saponin was lower under acidic conditions, likely because foam generation was more effective under neutral conditions.63Under identical conditions using deionized water, higher ammonia removal efficiency was observed under acidic conditions. This can be attributed to the fact that ammonia exists predominantly in the form of ammonium ions in acidic environments.64Furthermore, ammonia removal efficiency did not exhibit a linear relationship with increasing saponin concentration. Instead, the efficiency initially decreased up to 0.01 wt%, followed by a gradual increase, reaching a maximum at 0.16 wt%. This trend suggests that as the saponin concentration approached its CMC of 0.01 wt%, the associated reduction in surface tension may have led to the release of absorbed ammonia into the chamber.65Since surface tension typically reaches a minimum at the CMC, it is reasonable that the surface tension remains unchanged with further increases in saponin concentration beyond this point. As shown in Fig. S3E, the foamability increased continuously up to 0.04 wt%, contributing to improved ammonia removal. These findings imply that maintaining saponin concentrations above the CMC is essential for effective gaseous ammonia removal, ensuring sufficient foam generation. Although foamability plateaued beyond 0.04 wt%, higher saponin concentrations likely promoted micelle formation,66,67thereby effectively trapping dissolved ammonia within the solution and further enhancing removal efficiency. This improvement can be attributed to the combined effects of neutral pH, enhanced foam generation, increased saponin concentration, increased flow rate, and greater solution volume, all of which contributed to expanding the available surface area for ammonia absorption within the chamber.23Additionally, the retention time of ammonia gas was prolonged as the generated foam was sustained, allowing for effective absorption into the saponin solution coating the foam surface.68The difference in removal efficiency between water and saponin solution across varying solution volumes further supported this finding, with saponin solution exhibiting an average removal efficiency improvement of 17.13 ± 3.36%.

The removal efficiency of PM increased with higher saponin concentrations (Fig. 4), likely due to the reduction in surface tension that enhanced foam formation and, in turn, expanded the available adsorption surface area. A rapid increase in PM removal efficiency was observed when a small amount of saponin (0.000125 wt%) was dissolved in deionized water due to the increased viscosity of the solution (Fig. 2B), thereby enhancing the adsorption of PM from the headspace. Moreover, the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased, suggesting that the changes in foam formation near the CMC were reflected in the corresponding increase in removal efficiency (Fig. 2A and B). This phenomenon was attributed to the increase in the number of surfactant molecules at the water surface with rising saponin concentrations, eventually reaching saturation at the CMC of 0.01 wt%. These findings highlight a strong interrelationship between foamability, viscosity, and PM removal efficiency.

As shown inFig. 5, the experiments conducted using 0.05 wt% of extracted saponin yielded a removal efficiency of 28.16 ± 2.27%, comparable to that achieved with synthetic surfactants, lauryl amine oxide (LAO).23The foamability of 0.05 wt% saponin was 11.67 ± 0.19 cm, closely aligning with the 11.43 ± 4.52 cm observed for LAO. These results reinforced the correlation between foamability and PM removal efficiency and demonstrated the potential of natural surfactants like saponin as environmentally friendly alternatives for air pollutant removal.

The extraction of saponin from soapnut was successfully optimized in this study, achieving a high yield of 30.18% under optimal conditions, including an extraction temperature of 30 °C, 0% ethanol concentration, a soapnut-to-solvent ratio of 0.04 g mL−1, and a 1-hour extraction time. Using the saponin-based foams, the maximum ammonia removal efficiency was recorded at 98.5 ± 2.12%, alongside a particulate matter (PM) removal efficiency of 49.77 ± 4.63%.

Increased saponin concentrations enhanced foamability, stability, and viscosity. The CMC of the extracted saponin was approximately 0.01 wt%, at which significant changes in foamability, stability, and viscosity were observed. Furthermore, increased air flow rates and saponin concentrations enhanced foam generation, particularly under neutral pH conditions. The trends observed in foam characteristics strongly correlated with ammonia and PM removal efficiency, underscoring the critical role of foam properties in effective air pollutant removal.

The PM removal efficiency of saponin-based foams was comparable to that of synthetic surfactants, demonstrating the potential of saponin as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic surfactants for air pollution control.
