To evaluate the clinical efficacy of one-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting, fusion, and internal fixation in the treatment of Brucellosis Spondylitis.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 45 patients (30 males and 15 females) with lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis who met the inclusion criteria and were treated at the Department of Spinal Orthopedics, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University between January 2010 and February 2025.Patients ranged in age from 30 to 74 years (mean 52.7 ± 10.4 years) and had spinal lesions involving no more than two segments between T12 and S1. All patients received strict oral anti-brucellosis medication before and after surgery, and underwent one-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting, fusion, and internal fixation. Clinical parameters including hospital stay duration, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative drainage volume were recorded. Follow-up assessments included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores for low back pain, ASIA impairment scale for neurological function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), standard agglutination test (SAT), kyphotic Cobb angle of the affected segments, and postoperative complications such as implant loosening or rod fracture at various time points before and after surgery.

All 45 patients achieved surgical site healed primarily without cerebrospinal fluid leakage or neurological complications. Within one week after the surgery, mild activities (such as standing beside the bed and short-distance walking) can be performed with the aid of a brace to promote blood circulation and prevent complications, with significant improvement in low back pain and neurological symptoms. All patients with preoperative neurological deficits recovered to ASIA grade E by 24 months postoperatively. Significant improvements (P< 0.05) were observed in mean VAS scores, JOA scores, ESR, CRP levels, and Cobb angles at all postoperative time points compared to preoperative values. At final follow-up, all patients demonstrated SAT titers below 1:160. The bone fusion rate reached 91.11% (41/45) according to Bridwell’s classification criteria. Based on the modified MacNab criteria, the excellent and good rate was 95.56% (43/45). No cases of disease recurrence, implant loosening, or rod/screw breakage were observed during the follow-up period.

For lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis, one-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting, fusion, and internal fixation, when combined with standardized pharmacological treatment, represents an effective therapeutic approach. This comprehensive treatment strategy facilitates thorough lesion eradication, improves spinal function, and achieves satisfactory clinical outcomes.

Infection of the spine by Brucella, involving intervertebral discs, vertebrae, and paravertebral muscles, is referred to as Brucellosis Spondylitis (BS). The most common early manifestation of BS is persistent localized spinal pain, which typically exacerbates during febrile episodes. Current literature reports an approximate 12% incidence of neurological impairment [1–4]. BS is considered a severe complication of brucellosis due to its association with epidural, paravertebral, and psoas abscesses, as well as potential neural compression. For patients presenting with severe symptoms or showing poor response to conservative pharmacological treatment, including cases developing drug resistance or hepatic/renal impairment, surgical intervention becomes necessary when symptoms persist despite appropriate early medical management. The current therapeutic strategy emphasizes precise surgical indication based on lesion location and direction of spinal cord/nerve root compression. The one-stage posterior approach has emerged as a preferred surgical method, allowing complete debridement, bone grafting, and internal fixation through a single incision. This approach enables thorough removal of Brucella-induced granulation tissue within the spinal canal, effectively decompressing the spinal cord and nerve roots.The application of internal fixation during surgery facilitates the restoration of lumbar physiological curvature and enhances spinal stability.When combined with perioperative antimicrobial therapy, this approach contributes to disease eradication [5–7]. This retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 45 patients with lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis who underwent one-stage debridement with bone grafting and internal fixation between January 2010 and February 2025. With a minimum follow-up period of two years, the study evaluated the clinical efficacy and practical value of this surgical protocol.

This study included patients diagnosed with lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis who underwent one-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting and internal fixation at the Department of Spinal Orthopedics, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University between January 2010 and February 2025.

The diagnosis of lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis currently lacks standardized criteria and is primarily based on the following comprehensive assessment [8–11]:(1) Epidemiological history, including residence in endemic areas, contact with infected animals, consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, or ingestion of raw meat; (2) Clinical manifestations such as prolonged fever, fatigue, hyperhidrosis, and possible arthralgia; (3) Persistent low back pain or radicular symptoms; (4) Laboratory findings (with blood culture positivity as the gold standard) or imaging evidence (X-ray/CT/MRI) of spinal involvement. A definitive diagnosis can be established when all these criteria are met.

The inclusion criteria for lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis were: (1) confirmed diagnosis limited to T1-S1 segments with no more than two vertebral levels involved; (2) inadequate response to at least 6 weeks of standardized anti-brucellosis therapy; and (3) presence of one or more of the following conditions: (a) persistent low back pain unresponsive to appropriate pharmacological treatment; (b) spinal instability accompanied by neurological dysfunction; (c) significant intraspinal abscess or inflammatory granulation tissue causing spinal cord, nerve root, or cauda equina compression; (d) large paravertebral abscess showing poor resolution; or (e) substantial vertebral bone destruction.

The exclusion criteria included: (1) patients with stable spinal conditions and intact neurological function; (2) cases complicated by excluding concurrent other spinal infections or spinal tumors; (3) skeletally immature patients or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy within the preceding 6 months; (4) inability to maintain long-term follow-up or cases with incomplete clinical data; and (5) patients with less than 2 years of postoperative follow-up.

From January 2010 to February 2025, a total of 45 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent one-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting and internal fixation, with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. The cohort comprised 30 males and 15 females, aged 30–74 years (mean ± SD: 52.7 ± 10.4 years). The disease duration ranged from 6 to 36 months (10.7 ± 5.8 months). All patients presented with varying degrees of low back pain during the disease course. Preoperative assessment revealed Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores ranging from 4 to 9 (6.42 ± 1.14) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores between 9 and 21 (13.53 ± 2.86). Neurological evaluation using the ASIA impairment scale showed grade C in 5 patients (11.1%). The L3-L5 vertebral segments were involved in 28 cases (62.22%).

Preoperative laboratory findings revealed that all 45 patients tested positive for the standard agglutination test (SAT) with titers exceeding 1:160. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ranged from 2.00 to 99.00 mm/h (mean ± SD: 43.60 ± 26.87 mm/h), while C-reactive protein (CRP) levels varied between 0.88 and 153.00 mg/L (37.48 ± 32.59 mg/L).

Preoperative radiographic evaluation, including X-ray, CT, and MRI, was performed in all 45 patients to assess the distribution and extent of infectious lesions and the degree of vertebral destruction. The lesions were distributed as follows: thoracolumbar region (T12-L1) in 2 cases (4.44%), lumbar spine in 35 cases (77.78%), and lumbosacral region (L5-S1) in 8 cases (17.78%). Two-level involvement was observed in 3 cases (6.67%): L2-4 in 1 case (2.22%) and L3-5 in 2 cases (4.44%). Single-level involvement was present in 42 cases (93.33%). Intervertebral space narrowing was observed in 35 cases (77.78%). Detailed distribution of affected vertebrae is presented in Table1, while preoperative kyphotic Cobb angles are shown in Table6. No preoperative kyphotic deformity was observed, although 1 case exhibited scoliosis (Cobb angle < 25°) due to degenerative changes at the affected level. Step-like deformities were noted in 6 cases (13.33%) due to severe facet joint destruction: L4 anterior slippage in 4 cases (Meyerding grade I) and L5 anterior slippage in 2 cases (Meyerding grade I). Paravertebral abscesses were identified in 32 cases (71.11%), ranging in size from 13 × 10 × 6 mm to 65 × 52 × 34 mm. Herniated disc material compressing the dural sac was observed in 19 cases (42.22%). Significant intraspinal abscess formation causing dural compression was present in 3 cases (6.67%), while herniated discs compressing both the dural sac and unilateral nerve roots were found in 6 cases (13.33%). Bilateral nerve root compression due to disc herniation was noted in 2 cases (4.44%).

All patients continued standardized antimicrobial therapy for 1–3 weeks prior to surgery (Rifampicin 600 mg once daily, Doxycycline 200 mg twice daily, and Gentamicin 5 mg/kg once daily). Surgical intervention was scheduled when patients achieved normal body temperature, showed improvement in systemic toxic symptoms, completed necessary preoperative evaluations, and had no contraindications for surgery. Preoperative imaging studies were thoroughly analyzed to determine the extent of lesion involvement, degree of vertebral destruction, feasibility of pedicle screw placement in affected vertebrae, and appropriate levels for posterior fixation and fusion.Regarding the setting of the threshold values for CRP/ESR, we determine the timing of the surgery as follows: to reduce CRP (C-reactive protein) from its peak by at least 50% and no more than 30 mg/L, and to reduce ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) from its peak by at least 40% and no more than 50 mm/h. This is because when CRP and ESR fall within this range, it indicates that the infection in the patient’s body has been effectively controlled and the inflammatory response is in a relatively stable state. Performing surgery at this time can reduce the risk of postoperative infection spread. Regarding the neurological condition, the surgery must meet the following conditions: the patient does not have progressive deterioration of neurological function, and there are no new symptoms of sensory disturbance, urinary or defecation dysfunction. If the patient has progressive nerve damage, even if the inflammatory indicators do not fully meet the standards, early surgery will be considered to relieve nerve compression. Regarding the duration of antibiotic use, for patients with relatively stable conditions, sensitive antibiotics should be standardized for preoperative use for at least 2 weeks; for patients with severe infections (such as paravertebral abscess), the antibiotic use time should be extended to 3 weeks, and the type of antibiotics should be adjusted based on the drug sensitivity results confirmed by puncture biopsy.Antibiotic prophylactic treatment against infections is administered by intravenous injection of cephalosporin antibiotics (such as cefuroxime) 30 min to 1 h before the surgery.

The type of bone grafting is selected based on the degree of bone defect during the operation: Mainly based on (1) the degree of bone defect shown in preoperative imaging; (2) the stability assessment after decompression during the operation; (3) the degree of bone defect after lesion clearance during the operation. Autologous bone or allogeneic bone is selected for posterior lateral bone grafting.Principles for Selecting Surgical Fixed Segments.The selection of fixed segments is centered on “crossing the infected segment and ensuring biomechanical stability”,All fixed segment selections are combined with preoperative CT three-dimensional reconstruction (to assess the bone condition of the vertebral body) and intraoperative fluoroscopy (to confirm the position of the screws), ensuring that the screws are located in a safe area of the vertebral body and penetrate the vertebral cortex ≥ 80%, to meet the biomechanical requirements.Establishment of verification standards: (1) Sampling requirements: At least 3 suspected infection sites should be sampled for pathogen culture during the operation to ensure the representativeness and accuracy of the samples, thereby enhancing the reliability of the test results. (2) The “3-2-1” principle is recommended: At least 3 suspected infection sites should be sampled for pathogen culture during the operation. If the same pathogen is detected in 2 points, the diagnosis can be established; for highly virulent pathogens, as long as 1 point is detected, the diagnosis of bone infection or deep infection can be established.

Vital signs and lower extremity motor function were closely monitored on the first postoperative day. During the initial bed rest period, patients received guidance on lower extremity exercises and regular turning to prevent complications. The drainage tube was removed when output was less than 50 ml/day. Nutritional support was enhanced, and sensitive antibiotics were administered for 3 days. Anti-brucellosis therapy was maintained for a minimum of 6 months, with regular monitoring of liver and kidney function along with inflammatory markers until therapeutic targets were achieved. The patient needs to stay in bed for two weeks (The two-week rest after the surgery is not an absolute “standstill”, but rather a “protective recovery period” based on biological mechanisms such as tissue healing, immune recovery, and metabolic balance. Its purpose is to provide a stable internal environment for the body, reduce the risk of complications, and lay the foundation for subsequent rehabilitation exercises. This basis has been confirmed by numerous clinical studies and biological theories of tissue repair)after the operation. Two weeks later, they can get up and move around with a thoracolumbar brace, gradually increasing the amount of activity. They still need to wear the brace continuously for at least three months. During this period, they should avoid sitting for long periods and bending over. Regular follow-up included periodic assessment of inflammatory markers and radiographic evaluation of fusion status every 3 months.

CSF Leakage Management: (1) Conservative treatment:①Local treatment of the incision: Remove the surface sutures, gently press the leakage site with sterile gauze, cover the wound with biological protein glue to seal the wound, then re-suture the incision (superficial tension-reducing suture), and apply elastic bandages for compression bandaging externally;② Position management: Maintain a head-down foot-up position (bed tail raised 15°), for 72 h, to reduce the pressure of cerebrospinal fluid on the leakage site;③ Drug intervention: Intravenously infuse mannitol (125 ml, twice daily) to lower intracranial pressure, and use broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone) to prevent intracranial infection until the leakage stops for 48 h;④Drainage management: Keep the incision drainage tube in place until the leakage stops (1 case for 3 days, 1 case for 5 days), to avoid compression of the dura mater by accumulated fluid. (2) Efficacy and outcome: Through the above conservative treatment, the leakage can be successfully controlled. For cases where the leakage cannot stop, surgical repair is performed instead. Pay attention to observing incision healing and the occurrence of complications such as intracranial infection or subdural hematoma.

All surgical patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Clinical data including hospital stay duration, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, and complications were recorded. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score for low back pain, and modified MacNab criteria. Regular postoperative laboratory tests monitored erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), standard agglutination test (SAT), and liver function. Routine radiographic examinations were performed to evaluate disease recurrence, bone fusion status, and potential complications such as implant loosening, breakage, or displacement. Kyphotic Cobb angles at the affected segments were measured preoperatively and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Measurement Tools: Immediate postoperative and follow-up standing full spine anteroposterior and lateral X-ray films (for some complex cases, additional three-dimensional CT reconstruction images will also be provided), which are digitally measured through the imaging system (such as PACS) to avoid manual measurement errors. Measurement Time Points: Including immediately after surgery (the corrected baseline), 1 months after surgery, 6 months after surgery, 12 months after surgery, and 24 months after surgery (as set by the research protocol), ensuring coverage of both short-term and mid-term follow-up windows.Reliability Control: Measurements are independently conducted by two radiologists with over 5 years of experience in spinal deformity measurement.Bone fusion status was assessed according to Bridwell’s classification criteria [12] based on radiographic findings.

Significant improvement in clinical symptoms (VAS score ≤ 2), absence of fever, and normal neurological function (ASIA grade E); (2) The C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were both within the normal reference range (CRP < 10 mg/L, ESR < 20 mm/h) in two consecutive tests (with an interval of at least 2 months); (3) CT findings demonstrating no evidence of bone destruction with signs of bone repair, and MRI showing resolution of abscesses, organization or calcification of inflammatory soft tissue and granulomas, and absence of significant compression on the spinal cord, cauda equina, or nerve roots during the 3–6 month postoperative rehabilitation period.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables, including VAS scores, JOA scores, ESR, CRP levels, and Cobb angles, were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x̄ ± s). Comparisons across different time points were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Categorical data were compared using the chi-square (χ2) test, while ordinal data were analyzed with the rank-sum test. The significance level (α) was set at 0.05, with P-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.

All patients successfully underwent surgical treatment without neurovascular complications. The hospital stay ranged from 6 to 32 days (mean ± SD: 17.6 ± 5.9 days). Intraoperative blood loss varied between 100 and 1300 ml (360.0 ± 237.8 ml), while operative duration ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 h (2.70 ± 0.70 h). Postoperative drainage volume was recorded between 110 and 805 ml (373.4 ± 174.6 ml). None of the 45 patients experienced worsening of neurological deficits, surgical site infections, or other major complications.

All 45 patients enrolled in this study completed the follow-up period, which ranged from 24 to 78 months (mean ± SD: 37.1 ± 10.3 months). All patients continued standardized oral anti-brucellosis therapy postoperatively until meeting the clinical cure criteria. No cases of brucellosis recurrence were observed after treatment cessation. During the course of medication, no adverse drug reactions or abnormal liver function indicators were reported.

The follow-up results of VAS and JOA scores are detailed in Table2; Fig.1. A significant decreasing trend in VAS scores and a marked increasing trend in JOA scores were observed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (P< 0.05) between preoperative values and all postoperative time points. However, no significant difference (P> 0.05) was found between the 12-month and 24-month postoperative assessments.

The follow-up results of ASIA impairment scale grading are presented in Table3. Significant improvements in ASIA grades were observed at 3 and 6 months postoperatively compared to preoperative status (P< 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were noted between various postoperative time points (P> 0.05).

The follow-up results of modified MacNab criteria evaluation are presented in Table4. The excellent and good rates showed progressive improvement at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the 6-month and both 12-month and 24-month assessments (P< 0.05), while no significant difference was observed between the 12-month and 24-month evaluations (P> 0.05).

The follow-up results of inflammatory markers for all patients are presented in Table5; Fig.2. Both ESR and CRP levels demonstrated a significant decreasing trend at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (P< 0.05) between preoperative values and all postoperative time points, while no significant difference (P> 0.05) was observed between the 12-month and 24-month assessments. The mean ESR returned to normal range by the 3-month follow-up, and the mean CRP normalized by the 6-month follow-up. At the 24-month follow-up, all 45 patients exhibited normal ESR and CRP levels, with SAT titers below 1:160.

The changes in Cobb angles at various time points are presented in Table6; Fig.3. A significant reduction in mean Cobb angle was observed postoperatively compared to preoperative measurements at all follow-up time points (P< 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were found between different postoperative time points (P> 0.05).

The bone fusion outcomes are presented in Table7. The fusion rates demonstrated significant improvement at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the 6-month and 24-month follow-ups (P< 0.05), while no significant differences were observed between the 12-month and either 6-month or 24-month assessments (P> 0.05). At the 24-month follow-up, two elderly patients (4.44%) aged over 70 years with osteoporosis showed incomplete bony fusion between facet joints and transverse processes. However, radiographic evidence indicated healing signs of bone destruction, abscess resolution, and organization of inflammatory soft tissue without apparent infectious signals. No severe adjacent segment degeneration or related symptoms were observed in any patients. Furthermore, no cases of implant failure, loosening, or displacement occurred during the follow-up period.

Brucellosis Spondylitis exhibits distinct pathological stages: the acute phase is primarily characterized by inflammatory exudation and cellular necrosis, while the subacute and chronic phases demonstrate granuloma formation. As illustrated in Fig.4, histopathological examination reveals fibrous hyperplasia, vascular dilation and congestion accompanied by necrotic foci, with extensive infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. These pathological features are consistent with the characteristic presentation of infectious granulomas.

Case presentation of a 54-year-old male patient (Liu) admitted with a 3-month history of low back pain accompanied by limited mobility, which had worsened over the past 2 months. Physical examination and preoperative diagnosis confirmed Brucellosis Spondylitis at L3-4.The patient underwent single-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting and internal fixation.

The patient surnamed Wang, male, 41 years old, was admitted to hospital mainly due to “low back pain for more than 4 months, aggravated with radiative pain of the right lower extremity for 6 days”. The preoperative diagnosis was brucellosis spondylitis (L4-5), and one stage posterior debridement with bone graft fusion was performed.

The selection of surgical approaches for lumbar spine procedures requires individualized consideration. While the anterior approach allows thorough debridement of lesions (including abscesses and necrotic intervertebral discs) and spinal cord decompression, it may compromise vertebral structural integrity, potentially leading to spinal instability, particularly in cases of Brucella spondylitis [13]. Contemporary treatment strategies emphasize the importance of stability reconstruction, where appropriate internal fixation can restore biomechanical support, promote inflammatory resolution and tissue repair, and reduce recurrence rates. Clinical decision-making necessitates a balance between radical debridement and spinal stability, taking into account infection characteristics (such as abscess extent and degree of neural compression) and anatomical considerations when choosing between anterior, posterior, or combined approaches [14]. SANAEI-DASHTI et al. [15] have reported that isolated debridement and bone grafting no longer suffice as surgical treatment objectives for Brucellosis Spondylitis. Guerado et al. [16] through literature review, emphasized the necessity of robust internal fixation systems for spinal stability reconstruction, regardless of whether anterior or posterior approaches are employed. Li Xiaopeng et al. [17] reported successful outcomes in 16 cases of lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis treated with single-stage anterior debridement, interbody fusion, and internal fixation. The anterior approach proves particularly effective for patients with paravertebral or psoas abscesses and anterior column involvement, offering clear surgical exposure for complete lesion removal while preserving posterior column structures, restoring vertebral height, and correcting deformities. However, the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments present technical challenges due to complex anterior anatomical structures (including major vessels and nerve plexuses), increasing the risk of neurovascular injury during internal fixation placement. While this approach directly addresses anterior column pathology, its application in the lower lumbar spine requires careful consideration of local anatomical risks versus stability reconstruction needs [16–20]. Comparative studies [21] have demonstrated that standalone anterior debridement and fusion often necessitate prolonged bed rest, are associated with multiple complications and low fusion rates, and may lead to secondary spinal instability or recurrence. In contrast, combined posterior pedicle screw fixation provides early spinal stabilization, significant pain relief, improved fusion rates, and reduced complications, establishing itself as the predominant surgical approach for lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis.However, the anterior approach may risk inadequate contralateral decompression in cases of severe spinal canal stenosis, bilateral nerve root compression, or epidural abscesses. Additionally, anterior procedures are associated with larger incisions, significant tissue trauma, substantial intraoperative blood loss, and prolonged surgical duration due to position changes, all of which may exacerbate systemic trauma. The postoperative immunocompromised state may further increase infection recurrence risks, necessitating careful consideration of surgical benefits versus potential complications [22]. Due to the higher incidence of postoperative complications, suboptimal correction of kyphotic deformities through infected vertebral fixation, and potential for intrathoracic or intra-abdominal Brucella dissemination, this approach is more commonly employed in cervical Brucella infections [23]. While autologous iliac bone grafts offer excellent biocompatibility, the harvesting process is time-consuming and may lead to complications such as pain and fractures. Allografts, with reduced immunogenicity through processing, can be customized into smaller particles to minimize spinal cord compression [24], offering shorter fusion periods.

In recent years, the posterior approach has gained prominence for lumbar Brucella spondylitis treatment, particularly suitable for cases with small anterior abscesses, posterior epidural abscesses, and lower lumbar abscesses inaccessible via the anterior approach [25]. This method avoids major vessels, offers technical simplicity, and minimizes trauma and risks. Yang Shengsen’s research [26] indicates that patients with stable vertebrae and localized abscesses can be effectively treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation combined with posterolateral fusion, while those with significant spinal instability, paravertebral or intraspinal abscesses causing severe neural impairment require thorough debridement, decompression, and stability reconstruction. He Xin et al. [27] reported successful treatment of 16 lumbar Brucella spondylitis cases using single-stage posterior debridement with interbody fusion and internal fixation, demonstrating effective debridement, spinal stability reconstruction, rapid pain relief, and shortened treatment courses, providing a valuable surgical option. Current consensus among clinicians suggests that lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis surgery should simultaneously address abscesses, sequestra, neural compression, and spinal stability reconstruction. Single-stage debridement with fusion and internal fixation effectively alleviates pain, promotes recovery, and represents an optimal clinical solution.

Our study followed lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis patients undergoing single-stage debridement, fusion, and internal fixation for over two years, demonstrating significant pain relief within one month postoperatively, with VAS scores decreasing from 6.42 ± 1.14 to 3.13 ± 0.87 (P< 0.05). Substantial lumbar function improvement (over 50%) was observed within three months, with JOA scores improving from 13.53 ± 2.86 to 20.51 ± 3.63 (P< 0.05). At 24 months postoperatively, all patients reported near-complete pain relief, with over 90% lumbar function improvement and 95.56% excellent or good outcomes according to the modified MacNab criteria, with no cases of symptom exacerbation. Studies [28] have noted that vertebral remodeling in Brucellosis Spondylitis resembles long bone fracture healing, with new bone formation and mechanical axis reconstruction following spinal stabilization. Some patients with severe bone destruction demonstrated active osteogenesis, with follow-up showing vertebral morphology restoration, lesion fusion, normal bone density, and spinal stability, confirming the pathological repair characteristics. In our study of 45 cases, preoperative imaging confirmed appropriate pedicle dimensions for screw placement in both coronal and sagittal planes, with intraoperative findings of good pedicle bone quality allowing for infected vertebral screw placement. Cobb’s angle decreased from 22.0 ± 5.94° preoperatively to 11.58 ± 3.52° at one month postoperatively (P< 0.05), and to 10.37 ± 2.02° at 24 months, with no significant difference between one-month and 24-month measurements (P> 0.05). Posterior intervertebral fixation effectively restored and maintained vertebral height, expanded joint spaces to prevent wear, eliminated pain, provided immediate stability promoting bone fusion, and achieved permanent spinal stability. Only two elderly patients (4.44%) with osteoporosis showed incomplete posterolateral fusion, while all other patients achieved fusion within one year, with a 91.11% fusion rate according to Bridwell criteria (41/45), and no adjacent segment degeneration. Our findings suggest that unstable vertebral screw-rod fixation facilitates bone fusion, and reducing fixed segments preserves lumbar motion, prevents stress concentration, and avoids adjacent segment disease risks. Single-stage surgery effectively alleviates pain, reconstructs stability, and enhances long-term outcomes.

Among our 45 cases, 26 patients presented with spinal cord or nerve root compression and corresponding neurological deficits preoperatively. Twenty-one patients exhibited significant lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms (ASIA grade D), while five showed radicular symptoms (ASIA grade C), with imaging suggesting dural compression by anterior epidural abscesses. These patients underwent single-stage posterior debridement, fusion, and internal fixation, followed by standardized anti-Brucella medication adhering to the principles of adequate duration and combination therapy. At three-month follow-up, radicular symptoms had resolved, with statistically significant improvement in ASIA grades (P< 0.05). By six months, MRI showed complete resolution of intraspinal abscesses and inflammatory lesions, with no spinal cord compression. Three patients (6.7%) with preoperative neurological symptoms improved to ASIA grade D, while the remainder reached grade E, demonstrating that effective posterior debridement combined with medical therapy can relieve neural compression. VAS scores improved from 6.42 ± 1.14 preoperatively to 1.13 ± 0.76 at six months(P< 0.05), while JOA scores improved from 13.53 ± 2.86 to 23.84 ± 3.15 (P< 0.05), indicating excellent lumbar function recovery. ESR and CRP levels showed significant downward trends at all time points within six months (P< 0.05), indicating progressive infection control, tissue repair, and pain relief, with resolution of some systemic symptoms. By 12 and 24 months, all patients had normal ESR and CRP levels (P> 0.05), with no detectable inflammatory reactions, negative imaging findings for infection, and SAT titers below 1:160. Our study confirms that standardized medical therapy combined with single-stage posterior debridement, fusion, and internal fixation can effectively eradicate Brucella infection, relieve neural compression, reconstruct spinal stability, provide significant pain relief without recurrence, and achieve clinical cure.

Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. The retrospective, single-center design limited the generalizability of the findings. Future studies incorporating larger, multicenter cohorts with a comparator group will aid invalidating these findings.Future research plans to compensate for this limitation, we will design prospectie study plan: A total of 150 patients who met the diagnosis of “multi-segment BS” were planned to be included. After balancing the baseline through propensity score matching, they were divided into the one-stage posterior lesion clearance, bone graft fusion and internal fixation group, the anterior surgery group and the conservative treatment group. The short-term (3 months) and long-term (2 years) efficacy of the three groups were compared to verify the reliability and application scope of the conclusion of this study.

For lumbar Brucellosis Spondylitis, single-stage posterior debridement with bone grafting, fusion, and internal fixation, when combined with strictly standardized medical treatment, effectively eliminates lesions and improves spinal function, achieving satisfactory clinical outcomes.
