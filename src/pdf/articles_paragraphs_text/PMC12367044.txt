Women are disproportionately affected by hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and depression in the United States.

Patients with HS have a higher risk of depression.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) may be a quick, feasible, and useful method to screen for depression as part of routine dermatology clinic visits.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that disproportionately affects women in the United States.1Patients with HS have demonstrated higher odds of having depression (1.3–4.8 times) compared with patients without HS.2The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) is a two-question validated depression screening tool that is recommended in the North American HS comorbidity screening guidelines.2The PHQ-2 has also been studied in other dermatologic conditions, such as psoriasis3and atopic dermatitis.4However, there is a paucity of studies evaluating its use in dermatology clinics for screening patients with HS.

A retrospective chart review was conducted of HS patients seen at the University of Southern California dermatology clinic from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024 (IRB # UP-24-00320). Patients with an established HS diagnosis who completed a PHQ-2 within the study window were included. Demographic data and HS disease characteristics were extracted. Differences in characteristics between the positive PHQ-2 cohort (score ≥ 3) versus the negative PHQ-2 cohort (score < 3) were determined using Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the unpairedttest for continuous variables.

A total of 156 patients met the inclusion criteria (Table1). Of these, the majority (78.8%, 123/156) were female. Over a quarter (26.3%, 41/156) of patients had a positive PHQ-2 score, and of those, the majority (53.7%, 22/41) did not have a pre-existing depression diagnosis. Patients with a positive PHQ-2 score had statistically significant increased quality of life impact (Dermatology Life Quality Index; 17.8 vs 8.3,P< .0001), HS disease activity (Hidradenitis Suppurativa Physician Global Assessment,P= .037), and symptom burden (including pain [P< .0001], itch [P= .004], and drainage [P< .0001] scores) compared with patients with negative PHQ-2 scores (Table2). There was no significant sex difference between the PHQ-2 positive and negative groups.

The PHQ-2 consists of two questions to assess for the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks: (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things and (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. Each question is scored on a scale from 0 to 3, and a total score of 3 or higher is considered positive (range, 0–6).

Fisher exact test was used for comparisons of categorical variables, and unpairedttests were used for continuous variables, unless otherwise specified.

Our study found that over a quarter of patients with HS seen in our dermatology clinics had a positive PHQ-2 score, aligning with the estimated prevalence of depression in patients with HS of up to 26%.2Our findings support the HS comorbidity screening guidelines2recommending depression screening in all patients with HS, regardless of Hurley stage. A prior study that administered the PHQ-9 survey to HS patients found that 33% met criteria for major depression, and no significant relationship was found between PHQ-9 score and patient-reported disease severity.5HS symptom burden, quality of life impact, and disease activity appeared significantly higher for patients with a positive PHQ-2 score. Future studies are needed to further explore the relationship between depression and HS disease activity, including whether greater disease control can improve mental health outcomes. In clinical practice, if a patient screens positive on the PHQ-2, dermatologists can evaluate for suicidal ideation, provide mental health resources, and facilitate referral to a primary care provider or mental health professional for comprehensive assessment, diagnosis, and management. Limitations of our study include its retrospective, single-center design, small sample size, and predominance of patients with moderate to severe disease, which may impact generalizability.

Our study supports administering the PHQ-2 to all HS patients and suggests that patients with more severe HS disease activity may be at higher risk of a positive PHQ-2 score. This brief two-item questionnaire can be used to identify at-risk patients who may not have been diagnosed with depression or patients with existing depression who may need additional intervention.
