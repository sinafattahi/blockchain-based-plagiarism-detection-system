Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a prevalent cancer characterized by intricate molecular mechanisms that contribute to its advancement. Epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation, play a critical role in cancer development. This research examinesTET1gene methylation’s involvement in RCC development and its viability as a diagnostic marker.

We evaluatedTET1expression in 532 RCC tumor samples and 72 adjacent normal tissues using data from the TCGA database. A clinical case–control study involving 40 RCC patients and matched controls was conducted to evaluateTET1methylation at nine CpG sites in the promoter region using pyrosequencing. The relationship betweenTET1methylation, clinical indicators, and tumor markers was evaluated by combining clinical samples and cell experiments. The diagnostic efficacy ofTET1methylation and mRNA expression levels were assessed using ROC curve analysis.

TET1expression was notably reduced in RCC tumor tissues relative to adjacent normal tissues (P< 0.05) and was elevated in early stage (T1 and stage 1) tumors compared to advanced stages. RCC patients exhibited significantly higher methylation levels at all nine CpG sites and in the mean methylation level compared to controls (P< 0.001). Gender-specific analysis revealed lowerTET1methylation levels in males compared to females, with significant differences at CpG1–CpG8 sites (P< 0.05).TET1methylation levels were positively correlated with tumor stage, tumor size, and serum markers, such as CA125, NSE and Ki67 (P< 0.05), and significantly negatively correlated withTET1expression (r = − 0.665,P< 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the combination ofTET1average methylation and mRNA expression level (AUC = 0.876) had a high diagnostic efficacy. The levels of TET1 and p21 in RCC patients and 786-O cells were significantly reduced, and the level of Ki67 was significantly increased, suggesting thatTET1methylation may participate in the mechanism of malignant proliferation of RCC tumor cells by regulating p21 and Ki67.

This study underscores the importance ofTET1methylation in RCC progression and its promise as an early stage diagnostic biomarker, and may be involved in the mechanism of malignant proliferation of RCC cells. These findings offer fresh perspectives on RCC’s epigenetic regulation and highlight TET1’s potential in therapy and diagnosis.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a prevalent malignant tumor of the urinary system, originates from renal tubular epithelial cells [1]. Globally, RCC incidence has increased in recent years, reaching approximately 4–5 cases per 100,000 individuals annually [2]. In some developed countries, the incidence is even higher [3]. In China, RCC is the second most common tumor of the urinary system, and the incidence is also increasing year by year [4].The mortality rate of RCC is relatively high, which is mainly related to its characteristics, such as no obvious early symptoms and easy metastasis [5].The clinical manifestations and extrarenal manifestations of RCC are not specific, and the clinical pathology is highly diverse, making it difficult to diagnose and treat it early [6].At present, the main treatment for kidney cancer is radical surgery, but after surgery for early kidney cancer patients, 30–40% of patients still have lesions metastasis [7]. Radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for localized and locally advanced kidney cancer. In contrast, metastatic kidney cancer is primarily managed with comprehensive medical treatment, as it shows limited sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [7]. The most important factor affecting the prognosis of RCC is the pathological stage [8]. In addition, factors such as histological grade, patient's behavioral status score, symptoms, whether there is tissue necrosis in the tumor, abnormalities and changes in some biochemical indicators are also related to the prognosis of RCC [9].

Ten Eleven Translocation 1 (TET1) protein is an efficient catalytic DNA cytosine oxygenase in the body. It contains several multi-domain proteins with controversial nucleic acid binding sequences, including a double Zn2 + chelated CXXC region and a cysteine-rich catalytic region [10]. Studies have shown thatTET1is not only related to tumor invasion and metastasis, but is also more likely to be one of the important factors in activating oncogenes, inducing cell proliferation, and causing tumorigenesis [11,12]. Previous research indicates thatTET1plays a role in regulating the cell cycle and influencing the proliferation of RCC cells [13]. In addition, researchers found that the expression levels ofTET1mRNA and protein in RCC tissues were significantly lower than those in adjacent tissues [14]. Research indicates thatTET1might play a role in the onset and progression of RCC, although the precise mechanism remains unclear [13].TET1catalyzes the oxidation of methylated cytosine, playing a crucial role in DNA demethylation [15].TET1activity directly influences DNA methylation, regulating gene expression and contributing to the onset and progression of various diseases [16]. The promoter region of theTET1gene contains multiple CpG methylation islands, and its methylation may significantly influence its biological function [17].

Drawing from prior research, we hypothesized that DNA methylation in theTET1gene promoter region might contribute to RCC pathology by silencing gene expression. This study employed a case–control design involving 80 age- and sex-matched participants to investigate the association betweenTET1gene methylation and RCC. We investigatedTET1methylation's impact on tumor grading and early diagnosis in RCC patients.

Transcriptome files and clinical data for RCC samples were obtained from the TCGA database. TPM data were extracted to compareTET1expression levels between RCC tumors and adjacent tissues. A total of 532 RCC patients with complete clinical information were analyzed for the correlation betweenTET1and tumor grade after excluding duplicate and incomplete samples.

The Ethics Committee of Ningbo Urology and Nephrology Hospital approved this study (2025YP102). The study included 40 RCC patients (20 males, 20 females) and 40 renal cyst controls (20 males, 20 females). Eligible patients were those who had not undergone radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other anticancer treatments prior to surgery and were diagnosed with RCC through intraoperative pathology. The pathological classification and stage of RCC, tumor size, family history, and other diseases of the patients were recorded. At the same time, some key phenotypes such as related tumor markers were tested and recorded. Fasting blood samples were collected from all subjects for tumor marker testing, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), Ferritin (FERR), total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carbohydrate antigen 242 (CA242), carbohydrate antigen 50 (CA50), carbohydrate antigen 724 (CA724), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), cytokeratin 19 fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1). The remaining blood samples were stored in EDTA tubes for subsequent mRNA and genomic DNA extraction.

Genomic DNA from human blood was isolated using magnetic bead separation technology (Lab-Aid 820, Xiamen, China). The DNA sequence within the CpG island (Chr10: 65, 560, 374–68, 561, 065) of the promoter region of theTET1gene was selected, and the primers for the DNA methylation sequence in this region were designed using PyroMark Assay Design software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The optimal primers and amplification region were selected based on the primer scores of the software. The sequence we finally selected contained 9 CpG dinucleotides for pyrosequencing methylation analysis. The primers forTET1gene methylation sequencing are as follows: forward primer 5′-Biotin-GTAGGGTTTAGAGAAGGTAGAGTTTTAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CCCAAAAATCCACAATAAAAAAACAAATA-3′, and sequencing primer 5′-TGTTTAGGGGGGTTGA-3′. After the sample DNA concentration was determined, bisulfite conversion was performed using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen), followed by PCR amplification of the target region and single-stranded DNA preparation, and finally methylation analysis was performed on the PyroMark Q48 system (Qiagen).

We selected 15 RCC patients and 14 sex- and age-matched controls to examine the expression ofTET1mRNA. RNA was isolated from blood utilizing the QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was converted to cDNA using high-capacity reverse transcription kit (TransGene Biotech, Beijing, China). RT-qPCR was conducted using a LightCycler 480 system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) with SYBR Green SuperMix (TransGene). The qPCR primer sequences were as follows:TET1forward primer, 5′-CCTCCTTCCTCACCTCTCCTCAA-3′;TET1reverse primer, 5′-TGTGCTCACTGTCTGACCAATACTC-3′.p21forward primer, 5′-GCAGACCAGCATGACAGATTTC-3′;p21reverse primer, 5′-ATGTAGAGCGGGCCTTTGAG-3′.Ki67forward primer, 5′-CGTCCCAGTGGAAGAGTTGT-3′;Ki67reverse primer, 5′-CGACCCCGCTCCTTTTGATA-3′. The reference gene ACTB sequence and the mRNA expression calculation method are detailed in a prior study [18].

Human renal carcinoma cells (786-O, Cat. CL-0010, Pricella. Wuhan, China) were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, NY, USA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (10099141C, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). The normal renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2, Cat. CL-0109, Pricella) were maintained in MEM (Pricella) containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S. Proteins were extracted from cells using RIPA buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China), separated by 10% SDS–PAGE (30 μg/lane), and transferred to PVDF membranes. Antibodies included: anti-TET1 antibody (1:5000, Cat. A1506, ABclonal, Wuhan, China), anti-p21 (1:1000, Cat.A19094, Abclonal), anti-Ki67 (1:1000, AF0198, Affinity, Wuhan, China), and anti-β-actin antibody (1:20,000, Cat.T0022, Affinity). Signals were detected by ECL and quantified using ImageJ (normalized to β-actin).

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded RCC tissues were cut into 4 μm thick sections. Dewaxed with xylene and hydrated through a graded ethanol series. Antigen retrieval was conducted using heat and citrate buffer at pH 6.0. The sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for blocking. The anti-Ki67 primary antibody (1:1000, ZM-0166, Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Biological Company, China) was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After a 50-min incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature, the number of cells was examined under a microscope. Quantitative data were based on the statistics of 5 high-power fields (HPF) for each sample, and the average value was calculated to represent the number of positive cells in the entire tissue section.

Clinical data for case and control groups were expressed as mean ± standard error (SEM) or numerical values, with differences assessed usingttests or nonparametric tests. The association betweenTET1and clinical data was analyzed using the Pearson test. We employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess the sensitivity and specificity ofTET1for early RCC diagnosis. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 23.0 and GraphPad Prism version 9.0. Apvalue less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. The post hoc efficacy was analyzed using G*Power 3.1 software, and the 80% efficacy threshold was considered to be reliable. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple-testing adjustments.

After removing duplicate information, we collected a total of 431 bladder tumor tissues and 19 adjacent tissues, 553 prostate tumor tissues and 52 adjacent tissues, 532 RCC tumor tissues and 72 adjacent tissues in the TCGA database. As shown in Fig.1A–C, we found that there was no difference in the expression ofTET1in bladder cancer and prostate cancer compared with adjacent tissues, while the expression ofTET1was significantly reduced in RCC tumor tissues. Our analysis of clinical data from 532 patients revealed thatTET1expression was significantly elevated in RCC tumor stages T1 (Fig.1D) and stage 1 (Fig.1E) compared to other groups. Notably,TET1distribution varied significantly across T1, T2, T3, and T4 grades, whereas no significant differences were observed in pathologic stage distribution (Fig.1F).

To clarify the relationship betweenTET1methylation and RCC, we conducted a clinical case–control study, including 40 pairs of RCC patients and controls matched by gender and age. Table1presents their clinical data, revealing no significant differences in tumor markers between the two groups. This study assessed DNA methylation levels at 9 CpG dinucleotide sites within theTET1gene promoter region (Chr10 65, 560, 374–68, 561, 065), with pyrophosphate sequencing peak changes illustrated in Fig.2. Pyrophosphate sequencing revealed significantly elevated methylation levels atTET1CpG sites (CpG1–CpG9) and the average methylation in the blood of RCC patients compared to the control group (P< 0.001, Fig.3A). Considering that gender is an important factor in the development of RCC, we conducted a subgroup analysis of gender. The study found that males exhibited significantly lower methylation levels at theTET1gene CpG1-8 sites compared to females (P< 0.05, Fig.3B). Male RCC patients exhibited significantly elevatedTET1methylation levels compared to controls (P< 0.05, Fig.3C). In female RCC patients, methylation levels atTET1sites CpG1, CpG2, CpG4, CpG6, CpG8, CpG9, and the overall average were significantly elevated compared to controls, whereas CpG3, CpG5, and CpG7 showed no significant differences (p > 0.05, Fig.3D). In RCC patients, only CpG1 and CpG6 sites exhibited lower methylation compared to females (Fig.3E). Conversely, in the control group, males showed significantly lower methylation levels atTET1gene sites CpG1, CpG2, CpG4, CpG5, CpG6, CpG7, CpG8, CpG9, as well as in average methylation, compared to females (Fig.3F). Gender-stratified analyses confirmed significantTET1hypermethylation in RCC patients vs. matched controls in both females (11.14% vs. 9.45%,P< 0.001) and males (10.29% vs. 7.96%,P< 0.001), with post-hoc power > 95% for each comparison. However, male RCC vs. female RCC was underpowered (power = 38.4%, d = 0.56).

Correlation analysis showed that RCC T tumor stage was positively correlated withTET1gene CpG1 (P< 0.05, Fig.4A), CpG2 (P< 0.01), CpG3 (P< 0.05), CpG4 (P< 0.01), CpG5 (P< 0.01), CpG7 (P< 0.01), CpG9 (P< 0.01) and average methylation level (P< 0.01, Fig.4A,B). RCC T tumor size was positively correlated withTET1gene CpG1-3 (P< 0.05, Fig.4A), CpG4-7 (P< 0.01), CpG9 (P< 0.05) and average methylation level (P< 0.01, Fig.4C). In female patients, blood CA125 levels showed a positive correlation with theTET1gene's CpG1 (P< 0.05, Fig.4A), CpG7 (P< 0.01), CpG9 (P< 0.01), and average methylation levels (P< 0.05, Fig.4D). A positive correlation was observed between blood NSE concentration andTET1gene CpG4 methylation levels in patients (P< 0.05, Fig.4A). In addition, Fig.4E showed a strong negative correlation betweenTET1mRNA levels and DNA methylation enhancement (r = −0.665,P< 0.001). In addition, our results also showed thatTET1mRNA levels were negatively correlated with T tumor stage (r = − 0.835,P< 0.001, Fig.4F) and tumor size (r = − 0.552,P= 0.033, Fig.4G). After Bonferroni correction (corrected α = 0.0056), the correlation between the average methylation level of TET1 and RCC tumor size, tumor stage, CA125 and mRNA remained significant (p adj < 0.05), while the correlation between mRNA and tumor size disappeared (p adj > 0.05).

To clarify the value ofTET1gene in the early diagnosis of RCC, we performed ROC curve analysis. The study demonstrated thatTET1methylation sites, including CpG1 (AUC = 0.834), CpG2 (AUC = 0.838), CpG3 (AUC = 0.694), CpG4 (AUC = 0.798), CpG5 (AUC = 0.760), CpG6 (AUC = 0.788), CpG7 (AUC = 0.763), CpG8 (AUC = 0.856), CpG9 (AUC = 0.771), along with the mean methylation level (AUC = 0.852, Fig.5A,B) andTET1mRNA expression level (AUC = 0.767, Fig.5B), exhibited strong diagnostic efficacy. Moreover, the ROC diagnostic value was improved after combined analysis ofTET1methylation and mRNA (AUC = 0.876, Fig.5B).

We then performed validation analysis using clinical samples and cell experiments. The results showed that theTET1andp21transcriptomes in the blood of RCC patients were significantly lower in RCC than in the control group, while the expression ofKi67was significantly increased (Fig.6A). The results of the cell experiment were similar. Compared with the HK-2 cell line, the protein levels of TET1 and p21 in the renal cancer cell line 786-O were significantly reduced, and Ki67 was significantly increased (Fig.6B). In addition, the results of immunohistochemistry showed that the content of TET1 and p21 in renal cancer tissues at the T3 stage was significantly lower than that in the T1 stage, while Ki67 was the most abundant in the T3 stage (Fig.6C,D). Compared with T1 patients, bloodTET1methylation in T3 RCC patients was significantly increased (Fig.6E). The results showed that TET1, p21 and Ki67 showed a certain linear relationship in renal cancer (Fig.6F). Therefore, these findings suggest that external carcinogenic factors that promote increasedTET1DNA methylation may regulate the p21 and Ki67 signaling pathways by reducing TET1 expression, leading to abnormal RCC cell cycle, rapid proliferation of cancer cells, and ultimately the formation of RCC (Fig.7).

This study aimed to investigate the link betweenTET1methylation and the risk of RCC. Our findings indicate thatTET1methylation levels are notably elevated in RCC patients compared to the control group. In the control group, males exhibited significantly lowerTET1methylation levels compared to females, whereas no significant gender difference was observed among RCC patients. Second,TET1methylation levels were positively correlated with tumor stage and tumor size in RCC patients, as well as CA125 concentration in the blood of females. Third, RCC patients exhibited significantly lower plasmaTET1expression compared to the control group.TET1expression was negatively correlated with DNA methylation degree, tumor grade, and tumor size.TET1DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels serve as diagnostic markers for RCC patients.

Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation significantly influences tumor development [19]. Tumor cells release highly methylated fragments of related genes into the circulation as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) through apoptosis/necrosis, which is related to tumor burden [20]. Zhuang et al. [21] demonstrated that RASSF1A promoter methylation is associated with the development, progression, and reduced cancer-specific survival in. Faraj et al. [22] demonstrated a strong association between alterations in cadherin 3 expression, DNA methylation, and the dedifferentiation and advanced clinical stage of RCC cells. Ding et al. [23] identified that ZNF582 exhibited high methylation in RCC, influencing tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through its expression regulation. Ahmad's study [24] demonstrated that DAPK-1 methylation is significantly associated with various pathological stages and histological grades of RCC, serving as an independent prognostic indicator. The study indicates that RCC patients exhibit significantly elevatedTET1methylation levels compared to the control group, suggesting thatTET1epigenetic modification may be crucial in RCC pathogenesis. DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification that frequently results in the silencing of gene expression. TET1, a dioxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), facilitating DNA demethylation. The increase inTET1methylation level may lead to a decrease in its activity, thereby affecting the DNA demethylation process, and ultimately leading to abnormal expression of related genes and promoting tumor occurrence.TET1methylation levels showed a positive correlation with tumor stage and size, suggesting their potential as a biomarker for assessing RCC prognosis due to their reflection of tumor aggressiveness and progression.

Gender differences significantly influence DNA methylation levels and RCC risk [25,26]. Gene expression profiles in healthy kidney tissue exhibit significant differences between males and females [27]. In RCC, molecular subtypes and gene expression exhibit distinct trends based on sex [28]. The study found thatTET1methylation levels were significantly higher in males than females within the control group, potentially due to sex hormone influences. In RCC patients, there was no significant difference inTET1methylation levels between males and females, suggesting that the occurrence of tumors may break this gender difference, but due to the small sample size, this result needs to be further verified in a larger sample. CA125 is a commonly used tumor marker, especially in ovarian cancer [29]. Although its diagnostic value in RCC is limited, some studies have shown that CA125 may also be elevated in some RCC patients [30]. The study identified a positive correlation betweenTET1methylation levels and CA125 concentrations in female RCC patients, indicating a potential link betweenTET1methylation and CA125 expression regulation, though the exact mechanism requires further investigation. This may suggest thatTET1methylation and CA125 can be detected together in female RCC patients to improve the accuracy of diagnosis or prognostic assessment.

Research has identifiedTET1as a tumor suppressor gene.TET1expression is significantly reduced in RCC tissues compared to adjacent tissues and is closely associated with poor patient prognosis [13,14]. p21 plays a key role in the growth of tumor cells [31]. Normal cells highly express p21 to maintain cell homeostasis, but p21 expression is significantly reduced when tumor cells proliferate abnormally. Ki67 is considered to be a core marker for RCC cell proliferation, and its expression level directly reflects the aggressiveness and prognosis of the tumor [32]. Previous studies have shown that the loss of TET1 may affect the stability of the cell cycle through P21 or Ki67 [33,34]. This study confirms this pattern in clinical samples and cell experiments, where TET1 expression was markedly lower in RCC patients than controls. Importantly, we observed that decreasedTET1expression strongly associates with increased DNA methylation, higher tumor grade, larger tumor size, and elevated Ki67 proliferation index. This epigenetic silencing appears to drive carcinogenesis by impairingTET1'sDNA demethylation function, particularly through suppression of the cell cycle regulator p21. Mechanistically, hypermethylation of theTET1promoter leads to reduced TET1 protein, which in turn reduces p21 expression, ultimately disabling cell cycle control and unleashing Ki67-mediated proliferation. This interconnected TET1–p21–Ki67 axis explains whyTET1expression negatively correlates with tumor malignancy.

Clinically, our findings positionTET1DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels as promising diagnostic biomarkers capable of distinguishing RCC patients from healthy individuals. Simultaneous assessment of both parameters could enhance diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Compared to traditional imaging, blood-based TET1 profiling offers non-invasive advantages with greater patient acceptability. We propose that future liquid biopsy panels incorporatingTET1methylation/mRNA analysis—potentially combined with conventional markers (CA125, NSE) and proliferation indices (Ki67) could enable early RCC detection while monitoring disease progression. Such integrated approaches may ultimately guide risk-adapted therapies for high-risk patients.

Limitations and prospects of the study: this study has certain limitations. First, the samples size is limited. While adequately powered for within-gender case–control comparisons, direct statistical contrasts between genders were not feasible due to sample size constraints. Gender-specific findings should be interpreted as descriptive observations requiring validation in larger cohorts. Second, this study mainly explored the correlation betweenTET1methylation and expression levels and the clinical pathological characteristics of RCC, and has not yet studied its specific molecular mechanism in depth. Future research should investigate the precise role ofTET1in RCC progression, including the impact ofTET1methylation on downstream gene expression and its interactions with other critical signaling pathways. In addition, prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical application value ofTET1in the early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of RCC.

This study highlights the importance ofTET1methylation in the progression of RCC, its potential as an early diagnostic biomarker, and may be involved in the mechanism of malignant proliferation of RCC cells. These findings provide new perspectives on epigenetic regulation of RCC and highlight the potential of TET1 in treatment and diagnosis.
