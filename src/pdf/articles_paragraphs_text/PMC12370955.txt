The complex pore structure of carbonate rocks often results in scattered data in the relationship between formation resistivity factor (FRF) and porosity, posing significant challenges for accurate reservoir characterization. Although traditional methods have been useful, they exhibit limitations in reducing data variability particularly in capturing the critical interaction between the cementation factor and porosity. The Electrical Zone Indicator (EZI) represents a methodological advancement; however, greater precision is needed to achieve comprehensive rock typing resolution. In this study, Multi Resolution Graph-Based Clustering (MRGC) was integrated with the EZI rock typing method to improve FRF prediction accuracy in carbonate reservoirs. Well log data from three wells (A, B, and C) in a geologically complex carbonate reservoir in southwestern Iran were analyzed. To optimize data quality and consistency, rigorous preprocessing steps were applied, including depth shifting, data purification, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Using the MRGC method, five distinct electrofacies were identified and systematically incorporated into the refined EZI framework. Key petrophysical parameters tortuosity factor (a) and cementation exponent (m) were recalculated, yielding values in close agreement with established ranges for carbonate formations. The integration of MRGC with EZI led to substantial improvements in model performance, increasing the coefficient of determination (R²) for FRF estimation from 0.924 to 0.974. This enhanced workflow offers more accurate representation of petrophysical variability, improved precision in rock classification, and a robust framework for characterizing subsurface heterogeneities. The integration of advanced clustering techniques with electrical rock typing establishes a new benchmark for the classification of complex carbonate reservoirs, contributing to optimized hydrocarbon recovery strategies and more reliable reservoir management and fluid flow prediction.

Accurate rock typing plays a critical role in reservoir characterization and hydrocarbon development planning. This is especially true for carbonate reservoirs, which account for more than 60% of global hydrocarbon reserves and over 80% of Iranian oil fields1,2. However, these reservoirs are geologically complex due to their inherent multi-scale heterogeneity, intricate pore systems, and extensive diagenetic alterations. These complexities significantly influence rock–fluid interactions and fluid flow behavior, demanding precise and reliable rock typing techniques to optimize recovery and support reservoir management3. Traditionally, rock typing has been performed using core plug analysis and petrophysical well logs. Core data provide detailed measurements of porosity, permeability, and lithofacies, but their use is limited by high costs and spatial sparsity. In contrast, well logs offer continuous vertical coverage but often lack the resolution to capture subtle variations in pore structure and facies particularly in heterogeneous carbonate systems4,5. Bridging the gap between core precision and log continuity has remained a long-standing challenge in reservoir modeling5.

Electrical rock typing offers a practical framework for characterizing electrofacies—distinct rock units classified based on their electrical properties6. This method is grounded in Archie’s equation, which relates the formation resistivity factor (FRF) to porosity (ϕ) and the cementation exponent (m)7,8. Extensions of Archie’s model, such as the Current Zone Indicator (CZI) and Electrical Quality Index (EQI), have expanded the method’s utility in complex lithological contexts8,9. However, conventional electrical models often struggle in intervals with heterogeneous cementation textures, mixed pore systems, and diagenetic overprinting common features in carbonate formations10. As a result, estimating the FRF and classifying electrofacies can be error-prone and inconsistent, particularly when strongly influenced by porosity9. To address these limitations, recent research has focused on integrating clustering techniques with electrical rock typing workflows. Among these, Multi-Resolution Graph-Based Clustering (MRGC) and Electrical Flow Unit (EFU) analysis are two of the most promising approaches11,12. MRGC employs graph theory to cluster petrophysical data across multiple scales, improving electrofacies delineation even in highly heterogeneous settings13. EFU, on the other hand, defines flow units based on electrical properties, helping to quantify reservoir behavior more accurately14. Yet, both MRGC and EFU remain susceptible to classification errors linked to porosity-dependent variations in electrical response. The Electrical Zone Indicator (EZI) method was introduced to minimize this issue by reducing porosity’s influence on electrofacies classification9. While EZI improves consistency, its accuracy is further enhanced when combined with MRGC-derived electrofacies.

Recent studies underscore the importance of combining electrofacies analysis with clustering techniques. For instance, Agar and Geiger demonstrated the critical roles of pore connectivity, tortuosity, and diagenesis in determining electrical responses15. Li et al. showed how pore-throat architecture affects cementation factors, influencing FRF–porosity relationships16. These findings emphasize the limitations of single-model interpretations and the need for integrated models that incorporate complex pore structures. Other researchers have explored electrofacies classification in conjunction with machine learning17. Mohammadian et al. applied supervised learning to Iranian carbonate reservoirs, significantly improving permeability predictions18. Mirzaei-Paiaman et al. and Karimian Torghabeh et al. demonstrated that coupling hydraulic flow unit analysis with electrofacies and clustering enhances heterogeneity resolution and reservoir zonation, particularly in the Asmari and Kangan formations19,20.

Despite the proliferation of clustering and electrical rock typing techniques, the integration of EZI with MRGC remains underutilized in carbonate systems. To address the noted gap, this study introduces a novel and integrative methodology that explicitly targets a key limitation in existing electrofacies-based rock typing approaches namely, the strong dependency of electrofacies classification on porosity, which often leads to inconsistent or non-generalizable results, particularly in carbonate reservoirs. The proposed approach combines MRGC with the EZI method, forming a framework that enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of FRF estimation and rock type classification. Unlike traditional methodologies that rely solely on either core data or well logs, this integrated workflow leverages the high-resolution clustering capabilities of MRGC to delineate electrofacies from petrophysical logs, and then applies the EZI method to refine electrical rock typing across those facies21,22. This synergy bridges the spatial limitations of core analysis with the continuous vertical coverage of well logs, enabling a more robust and transferable model for complex carbonate reservoirs. To the best of this knowledge, this is the first application and validation of the MRGC–EZI framework in a real-world carbonate reservoir. The approach not only reduces porosity-dependence in electrofacies definitions but also improves the classification consistency across different reservoir intervals. Furthermore, it leads to more accurate FRF and permeability predictions, offering a scalable solution for broader reservoir characterization challenges. This methodological innovation fills a critical gap in the current literature and represents a significant advancement in data-driven, electrofacies-based reservoir modeling.

This study proposes and applies an integrated methodology combining MRGC with the EZI for advanced rock typing in a heterogeneous carbonate reservoir located in southwestern of Iran (Appendix 1)9. Utilizing 81 core plug samples alongside a comprehensive suite of petrophysical well logs including resistivity, neutron porosity, bulk density, acoustic travel time, gamma ray, and photoelectric factor the primary objective is to refine the estimation of the FRF and enhance the accuracy of electrofacies classification9. By incorporating MRGC-derived electrofacies into the EZI framework, the proposed workflow effectively bridges the gap between high-resolution but spatially limited core data and the continuous vertical coverage provided by well logs. The outcome is a transferable and robust methodology for rock typing in geologically complex carbonate reservoirs, offering improved prediction of flow-related properties and contributing to more effective reservoir characterization and management in analogous settings worldwide.

This study utilizes a dataset comprising 81 core plugs with well log data including resistivity, neutron, density, sonic, gamma ray, and photoelectric logs acquired from an Iranian carbonate reservoir to illustrate the enhanced accuracy of permeability, porosity, and FRF estimations achieved through the proposed EZI approach (Appendix 1)9. The dataset includes comprehensive measurements of key petrophysical properties such as permeability, porosity, and FRF, which are systematically presented in Table1. Furthermore, stratigraphic details for the analyzed samples are provided to ensure a robust understanding of their geological context. This dataset serves as a representative case for evaluating the effectiveness of the EZI method, particularly in heterogeneous carbonate formations, which are prevalent in Iranian reservoirs9.

Variation range of porosity, permeability and resistivity for dataset9.

The dataset originates from the Asmari formation, a major carbonate reservoir in the southwestern region of Iran. Renowned for its extensive hydrocarbon potential, the Asmari formation comprises a diverse lithological composition, including fossil-bearing limestone, dolomitic limestone, argillaceous limestone, sandstone, and shale23,24. This formation serves as the primary reservoir rock for numerous oil fields within the Zagros region. It represents a complex stratigraphic unit that is further divided into two main sections: the Lower Asmari and the Upper Asmari25,26. The Lower Asmari is characterized by thick sequences of limestone and dolomite, interbedded with marl and shale layers. This unit exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, with significant variations in lithology and depositional environments across different regions27,28. In contrast, the Upper Asmari primarily consists of limestone and marl, with fewer dolomite beds, and is generally more homogeneous due to its consistent lithology and depositional setting29,30. Both the Lower and Upper Asmari contain distinct sub-members, which are classified based on variations in lithology, thickness, and depositional environments. These include notable sub-members such as the Khami, Gachsaran, Sarvak, and Pabdeh, each contributing to the overall stratigraphic complexity and heterogeneity of the Asmari formation31. This inherent variability underscores the challenges in reservoir characterization, particularly for predicting key petrophysical properties such as permeability, porosity, and FRF.

whererepresented normalized porosity (dimensionless), andwas referred to as the Electrical Radius Indicator (ERI) (dimensionless). Their findings provided strong evidence that grouping rock samples based on the CZI offered a more reliable and effective method for predicting the “m” and “a” values within each category. The study revealed that “m” values ranged between 1.1 and 1.3, while “a” values varied from 5 to 19. This innovative approach significantly advanced the characterization and classification of carbonate rock samples, enhancing the precision of petrophysical analysis and improving exploration and reservoir evaluation methodologies.

Their findings revealed that rock samples with similar EQI values exhibited identical electrical behavior. The researchers applied this innovative parameter to a dataset of 112 carbonate samples, systematically classifying them into nine distinct groups. Each class was associated with a unique equation that related the FRF to porosity. Notably, the study observed that plots of cementation factor versus porosity displayed linear trends with high determination coefficients, highlighting the robustness and reliability of the EQI-based classification approach.

By employing this formulation, EZI demonstrates a reduced dependence on porosity compared to the EQI, making it a more reliable parameter for electrical rock typing. Consequently, this innovative concept was applied to improve the classification of rock samples, particularly in heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs, enhancing the accuracy of reservoir characterization and petrophysical analysis.

Figure1provides an overview of the workflow combining the EZI and MRGC methods. The process begins with core preparation, where cores are meticulously cleaned to eliminate any contamination and numbered for identification. Routine and special laboratory tests are then conducted to measure porosity, permeability, and the FRF of the samples. In the subsequent step, EQI and EZI values are calculated using Eqs.4and5, respectively9. The EZI concept for rock typing is derived by dividing EQI by normalized porosity and is plotted on a log-log scale (EQI vs. normalized porosity). Linear regression is applied to the resulting trends, allowing the determination of the parameters “a”, “m”, and their respective determination coefficient (R²) for each rock type. It is advisable to organize the extracted results into tables specific to each rock type group. Following this, well log data are prepared for the MRGC process. This preparation involves three critical steps: depth shifting, purification to remove noise or erroneous readings, and principal components analysis (PCA) to simplify and optimize key variables. The refined log data are then processed using the MRGC method to determine the optimal number of electrofacies. The EZI rock typing procedure is subsequently re-applied to these electrofacies groups. Finally, the new “a”, “m”, and R² values for the updated rock type groups are tabulated, and the FRF values of the samples are estimated and compared against laboratory-measured values to validate the accuracy of the workflow.

The workflow of the combination of EZI and MRGC procedure.

In this study, a new parameter the EZI is introduced to enhance the accuracy and robustness of rock typing. The EZI for each rock sample is calculated as the ratio of the EQI to normalized porosity, as presented in Eq.5. This formulation is designed to reduce the mathematical dependence on porosity, a limitation present in the EQI alone, while maintaining its physical relevance and interpretability. Although porosity remains a fundamental factor influencing all rock typing parameters due to its intrinsic relationship with rock and fluid properties, the EZI minimizes its mathematical influence. This is achieved by dividing out porosity from expressions where it appears, reducing the overall dependency and enabling the identification of rock types based more directly on their electrical behavior9.

By doing so, the EZI provides a more stable and physically meaningful measure for electrofacies classification, especially in carbonate reservoirs where heterogeneity and diagenetic alterations significantly affect porosity distribution. The reduction of porosity bias results in improved delineation of rock types, more consistent classification across well intervals, and enhanced estimation of key reservoir properties such as permeability and formation resistivity. Ultimately, the EZI offers a more refined perspective on reservoir heterogeneity and petrophysical variability, enabling better informed decisions in reservoir management9.

To complement the EZI framework and further enhance rock typing accuracy, the MRGC method is employed. MRGC is an advanced hierarchical clustering technique that groups data points typically derived from well logs based on similarity across multiple levels of resolution. This method is particularly effective in heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs, where property variations occur at both fine and broad geological scales. MRGC operates by representing each data point (e.g., log measurements at a given depth) as a node within a graph. Similarities between data points are defined as edges connecting the nodes. The algorithm then partitions the graph into clusters (electrofacies) by identifying data points that share similar characteristics across different scales of observation. This multi resolution capability allows MRGC to detect both fine scale variations (e.g., subtle pore structure changes) and coarse scale features (e.g., facies or lithological shifts), producing a comprehensive classification of reservoir rocks35,36.

Depth Shift: Ensures alignment of well logs to a consistent depth reference, critical for correlating reservoir layers and geological features accurately.

Purification: Removes noise, outliers, and artifacts introduced by factors such as borehole irregularities, tool misalignment, or drilling mud contamination. This step improves the reliability of log based interpretations.

PC1: Density, Neutron, and DT (sonic transit time).

PC2: Density, Photoelectric Factor (PEF), and Gamma Ray.

PC3: Deep Resistivity (LLD), Caliper, and Shallow Resistivity (LLS).

These components capture essential variability in the petrophysical dataset and provide a condensed input for clustering analysis37,38.

Following PCA, the transformed data are integrated with corresponding depth information and processed using the Facimage module in Geolog software. This module analyzes the petrophysical behavior of the log data and determines the optimal number of electrofacies, effectively segmenting the reservoir based on both electrical and petrophysical characteristics39.

This workflow is applied to well log data from a carbonate oil field in southwestern of Iran, where core samples had previously been used to validate the EZI methodology. The objective is to utilize MRGC to derive electrofacies from the log data and integrate these with the EZI based rock types to refine classification outcomes. The integration of MRGC with EZI not only improves the resolution of rock typing but also enhances the accuracy of FRF estimations. MRGC effectively identifies electrofacies boundaries, while EZI provides a porosity independent electrical characterization of rock types. Together, they create a more precise, scalable, and geologically informed classification framework. This study presents a novel integration of EZI and MRGC techniques for electrofacies classification in carbonate reservoirs. The method addresses longstanding challenges in carbonate rock typing by reducing porosity bias and capturing multi scale heterogeneity, leading to significant improvements in the resolution and reliability of reservoir characterization40.

The robust performance of the EZI technique is further demonstrated through its ability to provide accurate and consistent results within the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of carbonate reservoirs. This underscores its effectiveness in overcoming the challenges posed by the complex lithological variations typically encountered in such formations. The integration of EZI with complementary rock typing methods facilitates enhanced understanding of reservoir quality, offering valuable insights for improved reservoir characterization and optimized hydrocarbon recovery strategies9.

The EZI method was systematically applied to classify the various reservoir rock types in the sample dataset, providing a detailed investigation of the correlation between electrical properties and petrophysical parameters. The results of this analysis are depicted in Fig.2, which presents a plot of the EQI values against normalized porosity for all samples. This plot serves as a foundation for identifying distinct electrofacies and determining their corresponding electrical parameters. The analysis revealed that the coefficient “a” representing the tortuosity factor, ranged from 0.056 to 1.014. These values align well with previously reported ranges for carbonate reservoirs, reinforcing the applicability of the EZI method for such complex formations. Additionally, the cementation factor a critical parameter influencing electrical behavior varied between 2.108 and 3.268. Notably, the R² for the regression models exceeded 0.9 across all cases, indicating a strong statistical relationship and high reliability of the method in characterizing the electrical properties of the rock samples (Table2)9.

The performance of this innovative electrical rock typing methodology was systematically evaluated across multiple geological formations to assess its robustness and applicability. To validate the accuracy and reliability of the approach, the calculated FRF values were compared with their corresponding measured values for all samples. This comparison is illustrated in Fig.3, which depicts a strong correlation between the predicted and observed FRF values9.

The high R² observed in the analysis confirms the method’s remarkable precision in estimating FRF. These results underscore the method’s ability to accurately capture the intricate relationships between electrical properties and reservoir characteristics, even within the complex and heterogeneous environments of carbonate formations. This validation further emphasizes the efficiency of the proposed method in characterizing subsurface formations, offering a reliable framework for identifying reservoir quality and supporting the development of more effective hydrocarbon recovery strategies. The observed performance across varied lithological settings highlights the adaptability and robustness of this technique in reservoir studies9.

Following the determination of EZI parameters, well log data from an oil field in southwestern Iran, where core samples had previously been used to develop and validate the EZI electrical rock typing method were employed for further analysis. The MRGC method was applied to the well logs from wells A, B, and C to identify the optimal number of electrofacies, which was determined to be five. These electrofacies were then refined and corrected using the MRGC approach, enhancing the classification of rock types initially generated by the EZI method. This refinement provided more precise insights into the characteristics of the reservoir rocks.

Depth shifting is the initial step involved in aligning the depths of the logs from wells A, B, and C to ensure consistency and accuracy in data interpretation across all measurements. Proper depth alignment is crucial for minimizing errors and achieving reliable clustering results (Fig.4).

Following the depth-shifting procedure, the purification process was applied to further enhance the quality of the well log data. This step involved identifying and flagging defective data points, which were then removed from the dataset. These defective points, often caused by issues such as borehole wall collapse, inadequate drilling fluid conditions, or tool-pad misalignment, could lead to inaccuracies in subsequent analysis. By filtering out these erroneous readings, the dataset was refined, yielding a cleaner and more reliable dataset for further processing and analysis (Fig.5).

The final pre-processing step involved PCA, a statistical technique employed to reduce the dimensionality of the well log data while retaining its most significant features. By transforming the data into a new coordinate system, PCA condenses the original variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated components (principal components), which capture the majority of the variance in the dataset. This approach simplifies the data structure, making it more manageable and interpretable for further analysis, while preserving the critical information required for effective rock typing. The results of the PCA process are illustrated in Fig.6, showcasing the optimized alignment of the data for subsequent clustering.

After completing the pre-processing steps on the well logs, the MRGC method was applied to identify and classify the electrofacies. The graphical representations of the outcomes for each pre-processing step including depth shifting, purification, and PCA are presented, illustrating the adjustments made during the data preparation process and supporting the validation of the method’s reliability.

The integration of these pre-processing techniques with the MRGC method successfully identified five distinct electrofacies for wells A, B, and C (Fig.7). This refined classification significantly improves the evaluation of carbonate reservoirs by providing more accurate and reliable insights into the reservoir’s heterogeneity, as well as its fluid flow behavior. Additionally, the enhanced electrofacies classifications strengthen the foundation for FRF prediction, offering more precise estimations that are essential for optimizing reservoir management and hydrocarbon production.

The results from the MRGC analysis revealed that the EZI method could be further refined to achieve higher accuracy in rock typing. After applying the MRGC processes and determining the electrofacies, it was found that five distinct rock types could be identified, offering a more precise classification. Considering the use of log data in the Asmari formation and existence of various lime stone and shale lithologies, it is possible to divide the resulting facies into the following categories by examining the petrophysical and geological information of the study area. Table3provides a proper nomenclature of the identified facies along with their lithology. Since the MRGC method utilizes well log data, which are continuous and typically more accurate than core data, the five rock types identified using this approach are considered to be more reliable and representative of the reservoir’s true characteristics. Following the identification of the five rock types, it became necessary to revisit the EZI method and update the associated tables and figures accordingly. In Table4, similar to Table2, the ranges for determining “a”, “m”, and R² were recalculated and divided into five sections, corresponding to the refined rock types identified by the MRGC method. This new classification allows for a more accurate representation of the reservoir’s properties. Based on these updated ranges, Fig.8was created to visualize the five rock types and their relationships.

Reservoir rock typing by combining EZI and MRGC methods for dataset.

The reanalysis revealed that the coefficient “a,” ranged from 0.122 to 0.941. These values are consistent with previously reported ranges for carbonate reservoirs, underscoring the robustness and relevance of the EZI method for analyzing such complex formations. Furthermore, the cementation factor varied between 1.794 and 3.288. Importantly, the R² for the regression models exceeded 0.9, signifying a strong statistical relationship and high reliability of the method in characterizing the electrical properties of the rock samples. These findings, summarized in Table4, demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated MRGC and EZI approach in improving the classification and understanding of reservoir heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the accuracy of petrophysical property predictions.

When applying the MRGC method, notable changes are observed in the determination coefficient, reflecting the enhanced predictive accuracy of the rock typing model. Initially, the R² was 0.924, suggesting that the existing rock typing model, such as the preliminary EZI method, did not fully account for the variations within the dataset. This limitation indicates the model’s inability to capture certain nuances and complexities inherent to the rock types, potentially leading to less precise predictions. Following the application of the MRGC method, the determination coefficient increased significantly to R² = 0.974 (Fig.9). This improvement highlights a better alignment between the model predictions and the actual data, showcasing a refined understanding of rock type classifications.

FRF prediction curve by combination EZI rock typing and MRGC method for dataset.

Low FRF values (close to 1) typically indicate well-connected pore systems with low tortuosity, often corresponding to high quality reservoir rocks with effective fluid flow pathways.

High FRF values suggest either poor pore connectivity or the presence of isolated pores, vugs, or tight cemented zones, which reduce the electrical conductance and signal poorer reservoir quality.

The range of the coefficients “a” and “m” derived from the regression models offers additional insight into the complexity of the pore system. For example, a wide variation in “a” and “m” across rock types reflects the diversity in pore throat geometry, cementation, and diagenetic overprints within the carbonate matrix. These petrophysical signatures are not only consistent with values reported in the literature but also serve as diagnostic indicators of rock type and fluid flow potential.

Furthermore, the high coefficient of determination (R² > 0.9) between predicted and measured FRF values validates the robustness of the proposed method in capturing the complex interactions between electrical properties and petrophysical characteristics. The improved FRF estimation following MRGC integration demonstrates that the classification model effectively resolves the heterogeneity in the dataset, providing a more physically representative characterization of the reservoir.

Overall, the calculated FRF values serve as a quantitative bridge between electrical measurements and the physical fabric of the reservoir, enabling more reliable interpretations of porosity, saturation, and rock quality critical inputs for hydrocarbon recovery strategies and reservoir management.

The integration of MRGC with the EZI method has effectively identified a more precise and accurate categorization of rock types, successfully addressing variations that were previously overlooked. The increase in the determination coefficient demonstrates the MRGC method’s efficacy in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of rock typing models. This advancement underscores the importance of incorporating sophisticated clustering techniques, such as MRGC, to refine traditional methods like EZI, ultimately leading to better reservoir characterization and prediction of reservoir properties.

By combining clustering methods such as MRGC with rock typing approaches like EZI, this study demonstrates notable progress in the classification and characterization of complex carbonate reservoirs. This integrated approach not only improves the accuracy of rock typing but also offers deeper insights into reservoir properties, key factors in optimizing reservoir management, predicting fluid flow, and estimating FRF.

The application of pre-processing techniques, including depth shifting, data purification, and PCA led to cleaner, more accurately aligned, and dimensionally optimized well log data. These improvements in data quality greatly enhanced the performance of the EZI rock typing approach. Additionally, the electrofacies generated through the MRGC method allowed for a more targeted and effective application of EZI to core data, yielding more precise rock classifications and revealing subtle reservoir heterogeneities that were previously overlooked.

MRGC analysis successfully identified five distinct electrofacies, marking a significant advancement over earlier classification schemes and offering a more precise and detailed correspondence with EZI rock types. Moreover, the calculated values of “a”, “m”, and R² for these newly defined rock types were within the expected ranges for carbonate reservoirs, confirming the robustness and practical relevance of this enhanced classification method for characterizing complex carbonate systems.

Integrating MRGC results into the EZI rock typing framework yielded a more robust and dependable approach to reservoir characterization, greatly supporting more informed decision-making in reservoir management and hydrocarbon production optimization. The application of the MRGC technique led to an improvement in the R² value FRF estimation from 0.924 to 0.974, highlighting the enhanced precision this combined methodology offers. This substantial gain demonstrates the effectiveness of merging MRGC and EZI in refining rock classification and delivering a more accurate and detailed understanding of reservoir properties.
