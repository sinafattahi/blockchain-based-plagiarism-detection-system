The Trebouxiophyceae is a diverse and species-rich class within the Chlorophyta, exhibiting a wide array of lineages and remarkable variations in morphology and ecology. This group encompasses various lifestyles, including photobionts in symbiotic relationships, free-living forms, and parasitic heterotrophs lacking photosynthetic capacity. Trebouxiophycean algae have attracted considerable scientific interest due to their fundamental biological significance and their promising applications in biotechnology. This study presents a comprehensive genomic analysis of six newly sequenced strains of Trebouxiophyceae, expanding upon a foundation of 25 previously reported high-quality genomes to conduct comparative genomics and evolutionary assessments.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 18 S rDNA and single-copy orthologues confirmed the accurate identification of species. The analyzed strains exhibited variable genome sizes ranging from 2.37 Mb to 106.45 Mb, with GC content varying between 46.19% and 67.20%, and repeat content ranging from 1.67 to 19.73%. Gene family expansion and contraction analyses revealed that the subaerial speciesApatococcusexhibited the most extensive expansions, whilePicochlorum, along with the ancestors of the parasitic genera (Auxenochlorella,Helicosporidium, andPrototheca) experienced pronounced contractions. Evolutionary analyses using the branch model and branch-site model in PAML indicated that genera with the most marked gene family expansion and contraction also contained orthogroups undergoing positive selection and rapid evolution. Comparative assessments of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), nitrogen transport and assimilation proteins, hexose-proton symporter-like genes (HUP1,HUP2, andHUP3), and C4-related enzymes across 31 Trebouxiophyceae genomes revealed further patterns of adaptation.Coccomyxawas the only genus containing all the ten types of BGCs, while most other genera exhibited relatively fewer BGCs. The nitrate transporter and the urea active transporter were both absent in the three parasitic genera, and urease, the urease accessory proteins and arginase were nearly universally missing in all the species. All the species possessed theHUP1,HUP2, andHUP3genes, except thatHUP2was absent inProtothecaandPicochlorum, and the relative abundances of the three genes varied among genera. The NAD-ME, and PCK subtypes of C4-related genes were widely distributed in all the samples, while the malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) was identified only in the four freshwater strains belonging toChlorellaandCoccomyxa.

Expanded gene families, along with the rapid evolution and positive selection genes, likely played important roles in environmental adaption across terrestrial and marine habitat. Conversely, genome streamlining due to widespread gene families likely contributed to the parasitic heterotrophic lifestyles. Additionally, the distribution of BGCs, nitrogen transport proteins and HUP-like genes, and the types of C4-related enzymes perhaps highlighted the potential of Trebouxiophyceae to adapt to complex and varied environmental conditions.

Trebouxiophyceae encompass a wide variety of lifestyles, consisting of both free-living species and symbiotic forms (e.g. lichenized algae) [15–18]. The majority of Trebouxiophyceae are photosynthetic and play essential roles as photobionts in symbiotic relationships, especially within lichen associations [19]. Notably, genera such asTrebouxia,Myrmecia, andPrasiolaform symbioses with fungi to create lichens [20,21], while others, such asChlorella,Coccomyxa, andElliptochloris, serve as photosynthetic symbionts in ciliates, metazoa, and plants [19]. In contrast, some members of this class have lost their photosynthetic capabilities, evolving to adopt free-living or parasitic heterotrophic lifestyles. Examples includeProtothecaandHelicosporidium, which exemplify the remarkable evolutionary versatility found within the Trebouxiophyceae [22–24].

Trebouxiophyceae represents a highly diverse and evolutionarily adaptable group within the Chlorophyta, playing crucial roles in various ecosystems and demonstrating significant ecological and evolutionary importance. Moreover, members of this class exhibit substantial biotechnological potential, particularly in the fields of biofuel production, bioremediation, and pharmaceuticals. To date, the 163 genomes representing 25 genera of Trebouxiophyceae, including the metagenomes have been reported. Genomic research on Trebouxiophyceae has significantly advanced our understanding of their evolutionary history, metabolic capabilities, and ecological adaptations. For example, it has been reported that ancient horizontal gene transfer events from fungi to theTrebouxiamay have contributed to the origin of lichen symbiosis [25]. Comparative genomics onChlorellastrains has revealed that symbiotic algae exhibit distinct nutritional traits and physiological phenotypes, likely driven by co-evolutionary adaptations to their host environments [26]. Genome and transcriptomic analyses of the halotolerant and thermotolerant green algaPicochlorumprovided insights into the evolution of thermotolerance and identified genomic adaptations, including genome streamlining through a reduction in the number of gene families and intergenic regions [27]. Similarly, the genome sequencing of the polar unicellular green algaCoccomyxa subellipsoideaC-169 uncovered gene losses (including components of the glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchoring system, pyruvate phosphate dikinase and the photosystem 1 reaction center subunit N (PsaN)) and gene gains could have contributed to adaptation to low temperatures [28]. The draft genome of the microalgaChlorella protothecoidessp. 0710 revealed a smaller genome size and unique genetic features supporting heterotrophic growth and lipid accumulation, underscoring its potential as a model for microalgae-derived biodiesel production [29]. TheHelicosporidiumgenome demonstrated an unexpected preservation of host-independence and revealed a unique evolutionary pathway compared to apicomplexans [30]. Furthermore, comparative genomics within the lichen photobiont genusTrebouxiaindicated that several gene families exhibiting significant evolutionary changes (i.e. gene expansion and contraction) are associated with metabolic processes linked to protein phosphorylation, a regulatory mechanism important in photosynthesis, particularly under variable light conditions.

In this study, we sequenced the genomes of six Trebouxiophyceae strains, includingCoccomyxa rayssiae,Coccomyxa arvernensis,Coccomyxa simplex, and threeChlorella vulgarisstrains. We conducted comparative genomic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary analyses by integrating these new genomes with 25 previously reported high-quality Trebouxiophyceae genomes. The main objective was to investigate the adaptive strategy of Trebouxiophyceae species to different environment through evolutionary analyses of gene families. Our results suggested that the contraction and expansion of gene families, as well as the rapid evolution and positive selection of key genes possibly played important roles in environmental adaption. Additionally, the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across different genera underscored their potential ability to adapt to complex environmental stresses by producing a wide array of secondary metabolites. Overall, this study expanded the genomic resources available for Trebouxiophyceae and provided new insights into their ecological adaptations, evolutionary relationships, and biotechnological potential.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 18 S rDNA sequences extracted from the six newly sequenced Trebouxiophyceae genomes, together with publicly available data (Fig. S1). The resulting phylogenetic tree, which displayed high support values at the basal nodes, confirmed the species identification. Specifically, the threeChlorellastrains (SAMC4847386- SAMC4847388), along withChlorella vulgaris(FR8655658.1), formed a single clade. The threeCoccomyxastrains (SAMC4847389- SAMC4847391) clustered within a clade comprising otherCoccomyxastrains.

We further conducted phylogenetic analysis using the 67 single copy orthologues from the 31 Trebouxiophyceae species by Astral with the twoChlamydomonasspecies as outgroup (Fig.1). The results revealed that Trebouxiophyceae species formed two main clades. In the first clade, allCoccomyxastrains clustered withElliptochloris bilobataandSymbiochloris irregularis, while allTrebouxiastrains grouped withApatococcusandMyrmecia bisecta. In the second clade, the genusPicochlorumwas nested within the Chlorellales lineage. Within this clade,Micractinium conductrixclustered with allChlorellastrains, and the three parasitic generaHelicosporidium,Prototheca, andAuxenochlorella, with formed a distinct subclade.

We sequenced the whole genomes of the six Trebouxiophyceae strains. The assembly and annotation statistics, including those of 25 publicly available Trebouxiophyceae genomes, were summarized in Table1. All newly generated and annotated genomes showed high BUSCO completeness (95.9–97.9%). The assemblies of the six strains displayed an average contig N50 length of approximately 21 Kb, and scaffolds number ranged from 2188 to 3969. Genome sizes varied from 36.86 Mb to 53.28 Mb, with the GC content ranging from 51.87 to 61.82%. The total number of identified genes ranged from 7148 to 7719. Structural annotation revealed that the six newly sequenced Trebouxiophyceae strains had low repeat composition, covering only 1.67–5.04% of the genome.

Among allChlorellastrains, the three newly sequenced strains had the smallest genomes, whereas the newly sequencedCoccomyxa arvernensisexhibited the largest genome amongCoccomyxaspecies. Across all the Trebouxiophyceae, the genusApatococcushad the largest genome size (over 100 Mb), whileHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandPicochlorumpossessed the smallest genome (< 20 Mb). Regarding gene number,Prototheca,HelicosporidiumandAuxenochlorellahad the fewest genes (5529–6033), whereasApatococcus,TrebouxiaandSymbiochlorishad the most (10940–13851). BothChlorella(7148–10866) andCoccomyxa(7310–11898) showed substantial gene number variation between species. GC content was lowest inPicochlorumandTrebouxia(< 50%) and exceeded 60% inChlorella,Auxenochlorella,Helicosporidium,Prototheca, andMicractinium. Repeat content ranged from 1.47 to 17.01%, and showed substantial intra-generic variation.Trebouxia,ApatococcusandMicractiniumgenerally had high repeat content, whileAuxenochlorella,HelicosporidiumandProtothecahad lower values.

Gene family analyses were conducted at different taxonomic levels using all the 31 high-quality Trebouxiophyceae genomes, including the six newly sequenced genomes. Orthologous analysis identified 709 gene families conserved across all the 31 genomes at the species level (Fig. S2). Nearly all genera, except forHelicosporidium,Prototheca,Auxenochlorella, andPicochlorum, exhibited unique gene families, comprising 0.74–5.68% of the total gene count. At the genus level (Fig.2), 1,971 gene families were conserved among all the 12 genera. Most genera, except forHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorella, contained unique gene families: 2,518 f unique toTrebouxia, 2,185 toCoccomyxa, 1,455 toApatococcus, 955 toPicochlorum, 853 toChlorella, 393 toSymbiochloris, 371 toMyrmecia, 172 toElliptochloris, and 118 toMicractinium.

To comprehensively assess differences in orthologous groups, particularly those with functional annotations, we performed gene family expansion and contraction analyses with CAFÉ, using 21,630 gene families. As shown in Fig.3, all species and nearly all ancestral nodes exhibited substantial number of gene family expansions and contractions.Apatococcus fuscideaehad the highest number of expanded gene families (1,996), whileHelicosporidiumsp. ATCC 50,920 exhibited the greatest number of contracted gene families (1,518). Among ancestral nodes, theApatococcusancestors had the most expanded gene families (449), while ancestors ofPicochlorum, and the ancestors of the three generaAuxenochlorella,HelicosporidiumandProtothecahad the most contracted gene families (1,481, 1,442, respectively).

Due to their diverse habitats, we specifically examined three marine or saltwaterPicochlorumstrains, two subaerialApatococcusspecies, and three parasitic genera (Helicosporidium,Prototheca, andAuxenochlorella). To investigate whether the evolution of gene families correlates with habitat adaptation, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for expanded and contracted gene families in their respective ancestors. The expanded gene families in theApatococcusancestor were enriched in 58 GO terms (Table S1), including vitamin B1biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, chlorophyll biosynthesis, peroxisome and mitochondrion. TContracted gene families inHelicosporidiumand the parasitic ancestor ofHelicosporidium,Prototheca,and Auxenochlorellawere enriched in GO terms related to nitrogen, amino acid, sulfur, and starch metabolism (Tables S2–S3). The contracted gene families of thePicochlorumancestor (72 GO terms; Table S4) were associated with nitrogen and lipid metabolism, sugar and glycosylation processes, ion transport, and specific enzyme activities.

The branch model and branch-site model of PAML were used to detected rapid evolution genes and positive selection genes respectively. When the threePicochlorumstrains were labelled as the foreground branch, 9 orthogroups showed both positive selection and rapid evolution (Table S5). These were enriched in 6 GO terms (Fig.4a), mainly related to peptide transport and utilization. For the twoApatococcusspecies were labelled as the foreground branch, 11 orthogroups showed evidence for positive selection and rapid evolution (Table S6, Fig.4b), with enriched GO terms including mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase activity and TCA cycle-related malate dehydrogenase activity. When the species of the three parasitic generaHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorellawere labelled as the foreground branch, 18 orthogroups were rapidly evolving and under positive selection at the same time (Table S7), with enrichment in 12 GO terms (Fig.4c), associated with ion balance, osmotic regulation, carbon metabolism, and energy supply.

We compared the distribution of ten types of biosynthetic gene clusters among Trebouxiophyceae genera (Fig.5). Clade I exhibited a relatively higher abundance of BGCs, withCoccomyxathe only genus containing all ten types of BGCs, including the Mate type, which was exclusive to this genus.Coccomyxaalso displayed the largest number of Type III polyketide synthases (T3PKS) and terpenes.

Other genera typically had relatively lower overall counts of BGCs, and the alkaloid was absent in most genera. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) was missing in three parasitic genera,MyrmeciaandMicractinium, and NRPS-like (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-like) was missing inHelicosporidium,Elliptochloris, andSymbiochloris. Polyketide was found only inPicochlorumandCoccomyxa. Type I polyketide synthases (T1PKS) were rare and absent in clade II species. Saccharides were found in all exceptHelicosporidium,Prototheca, andSymbiochloris. In contrast, T3PKS was present in all genera, and terpenes were present in all \ exceptHelicosporidium.

To further understand the nitrogen utilization in Trebouxiophyceae, we surveyed 13 genes involved in nitrogen transport and assimilation across all the 31 Trebouxiophyceae genomes (Table S8). Of the five nitrate transporter types assessed, both the nitrate transporter and the urea active transporter were absent in the three parasitic genera. In the assimilation process, nine enzyme types/accessory proteins were examined, with urease and its two urease accessory proteins nearly absent in all the species. The urea cycle included 5 enzymes, arginase was absent in all the species except for theChlorella ohadii.

Using HUPs fromChlorella kesslerias queries homologous searches identified three HUP homologs (HUP1,HUP2, andHUP3) in all 31 Trebouxiophyceae species (Table S9), except forHUP2, which was absent inProtothecaandPicochlorum. In Chlorellales, the copy number of HUP genes order wasHUP1=HUP2>HUP3; inCoccomyxa,HUP2>HUP1>HUP3; and inTrebouxia,HUP1>HUP2>HUP3.Notably,CoccomyxaandTrebouxiaexhibited higherHUP1 andHUP2 copy numbers than Chlorellales, withCoccomyxahaving the mostHUP2copies.Trebouxiahad the fewestHUP3. Within Chlorellales,Apatococcusexhibited higher copiesof all three HUP genes. AmongChlorellaspecies,Chlorella ohadiicollected from desert soil, displayed high copy numbers ofHUP1andHUP2, but fewer copies ofHUP3.

In land plants, C4photosynthesis is typically divided into three subtypes, NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PCK-based on different decarboxylation models. The key enzymes include malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) for NADP-ME, malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NAD+) for NAD-ME, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK, ATP-dependent) for PCK. In this study, we identified the C4-related enzymes of across the 31 Trebouxiophyceae genomes (Table S10). All the strains possessed both the NAD-ME and PCK subtype genes. Notably, malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) was identified only in the four freshwater strains belonging toChlorellaandCoccomyxa.

Trebouxiophyceae, a class of green algae, are known for their remarkable ecological adaptability and morphological diversity. Members of this class play crucial roles in various ecosystems, including lichens, extreme environments, and biotechnological applications. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of six Trebouxiophyceae strains, includingChlorella vulgaris(three strains),Coccomyxa arvernensis,Coccomyxa rayssiaeandCoccomyxa simplex.

Molecular phylogenetic analysesbased on 18 S rDNA and single copy orthologues confirmed the species identification. The inferred phylogenetic relationships were largely consistent with previous studies [1,31–34], with one notable exception:Apatococcusclustered within the Trebouxiales rather than the Chlorellales. Further data and high-quality genomes aboutApatococcuswill be essential to resolve this incongruence.

Across the 31 Trebouxiophyceae species examined, there were significantly differences in genome size, gene number, GC content and repeat content. Comparative genomic analyses indicated thatPicochlorum,Auxenochlorella,Helicosporidium,Protothecapossessed the most streamlined genomes. By contrast,Apatococcusexhibited the largest genome size, the highest gene count, relatively low GC content, and nearly the highest repeat content. However, thePicochlorumspecies, despite their small genome size and low GC content, had relatively low gene numbers and comparatively high repeat content. While genome size, the proportion of repetitive sequences, and gene counts are generally interrelated [35–37], this relationship does not fully align with the patterns seen in Trebouxiophyceae. Expanded genomic sampling and more high-quality assemblies will be instrumental in clarifying these correlations.

Trebouxiophyceae species inhabit a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Some representatives have evolved parasitic heterotrophic lifestyles, while others have evolved as integral components of lichen symbioses. Our analyses investigated the genomic basis of environmental adaptation across this diversity. For instance, the genusPicochlorum, comprising marine and brackish water unicellular microalgae, is known for its broad halotolerance, with the ability to adapt to a wide range of salinities from freshwater to hypersaline conditions [38–40]. All the examinedPicochlorumstrains possessed compact genomes with a reduction of the highest number of gene families. Previous studies suggested that genome reduction is a dominant mode of genome evolution, consistent with the optimization of initially more complex larger genomes, witnessing the acquisition of adaptive innovations [41]. The gene family contraction inHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorellamay be a consequence of their lifestyle as an obligate parasite [30]. However, the reason for the large number of losses in thePicochlorumgenus remains enigmatic, as these species do not show parasitic lifestyles. Notably, genes involved in organic nitrogen utilization inPicochlorumwere subject to rapid evolution and positive selection. As inorganic nitrogen availability fluctuates in marine systems, the capacity to exploit organic nitrogen sources (e.g., urea or free amino acids) likely confers a competitive advantage [42,43]. Consistent with this, both urea active transporter and amino acid transporter genes were present inPicochlorumgenomes (Table S8), suggesting these species are capable of utilizing multiple nitrogen sources to adapt to dynamic environments.

The subaerialApatococcusspecies appear to adapt to the terrestrial habitats through the expansion of gene families and the rapid evolution and positive selection of the key genes. Gene families related to vitamin B1, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism, chlorophyll biosynthesis, peroxisome activity, and mitochondria were notably expanded. Previous studies have highlighted that vitamins B1play crucial roles in plant resistance to oxidative stress and biotic stress [44,45]. Additionally, chlorophyll and chlorophyllin have been found to possess antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties [46,47]. Fatty acids, peroxisomes, and mitochondria are also implicated in adaptations to terrestrial habitats. Two genes were identified as undergoing rapid evolution and positive selection inApatococcus: mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NAD+). Mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase is likely involved in the production of glycoproteins [48], N-glycan processing and cell-wall structure [49]. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) catalyzes the interconversion of oxaloacetate and malate coupled to the oxidation/reduction of coenzymes NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+, this family of enzymes participates in important reactions in plant cells including photosynthesis, photorespiration, lipid metabolism, and NH4 + metabolism. MDH also helps regulate cellular energy balance and may assist plants in coping with various environmental stresses [50,51]. TheProtothecaandHelicosporidiumspecies, whose closest photosynthetic relatives are the heterotrophic free-living algaeAuxenochlorella protothecoides[52,53], have lost their photosynthetic capabilities and adopted a parasitic lifestyle [54,55]. These algae no longer utilize light energy or carbon fixation, but instead use sugars as carbon sources. Previous study shows thatProtothecaandHelicosporidiumhave convergently lost a similar set of genes related to photosynthesis [23]. In our study, the common ancestor of the three parasitic generaHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorellashowed extensive gene family contraction, particularly in pathways involved in nitrogen, amino acid, sulfur, starch, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, likely reflecting adaptation to parasitism [23].

Microalgae are highly valued for their ability to synthesize a wide range of natural products [56,57]. Investigation of biosynthetic genes in microalgal genomes provides insight into the diversity of their metabolite production [58]. Previous studies identified genes for terpene, NRPS, and Type III PKS biosynthesis in Trebouxia [59]. In this study, Type III PKS (T3PKS) and terpene BGCs were widespread across Trebouxiophyceae. The subaerial genera such asApatococcus,Symbiochloris,Trebouxia, andCoccomyxahad the capacity to synthesize alkaloids, which are a diverse group of complex low molecular weight, having antibacterial activity and can inhibit efflux pump [60,61], protein synthesis, DNA transcription, and prevent toxin production [62].Coccomyxawas found to synthesize Mates, which are large, multi-pass membrane peptides and assist in the removal of metabolic waste products, and facilitate the extrusion of xenobiotics from cells [63,64]. The presence of MATEs may also protect cells against oxidative stress [65], potentially aiding adaptation to subaerial habitats. Additionally,Picochlorum,TrebouxiaandCoccomyxadisplayed the potential to synthesize Polyketides, which comprise a highly diverse class of compounds in terms of biological activities [66], including cytotoxic, anti-tumor, antibiotic, antifungal, immunosupressant, and neurotoxic.Elliptochloris,Symbiochloris, andCoccomyxaexhibited the potential to synthesize T1PKS. This enzyme is essential during the sexual cycle for the synthesis of a normal zygote cell wall and the maturation of newly formed zygotes into zygospores, a dormant state that confers resistance to harsh environmental conditions [67]. These findings collectively suggested that the diverse distribution of BGCs among Trebouxiophyceae contributed to secondary metabolite production, bolstering ecological adaptability.

In plants, both carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are critical for cellular functioning, acting both as nutrients and as environmental signals to regulate metabolism [68]. Different organisms have their preferred N sources, and various transporters and assimilation systems are involved in nitrogen uptake and utilization. In Trebouxiophyceae, the parasitic generaHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorellalacked the nitrate and the urea transporter, indicating these species these species likely prefer ammonium and amino acids as nitrogen sources and may not be able to grow in media containing nitrate or urea, consistent with findings inChlorella protothecoides(Cp0710) [29,69]. The ornithine-urea cycle (OUC), a metabolic pathway crucial for detoxification of excessive ammonia in animals [70], is absent from green plants and algae. However, it has recently been identified in diatoms [71]. Similarly, all the Trebouxiophyceae species examined in this study lacked two key enzymes and urease accessory proteins: arginase, which catalyzes the conversion of arginine to ornithine and urea, and urease, which breaks down urea to produce ammonia. An exception wasChlorella ohadii, which exhibited urease accessory protein D and arginase. Similar toChlorella protothecoides(Cp0710), most species possessed all the genes necessary for the aspartate-argininosuccinate shunt. This pathway connects the OUC and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a well-established function in animal cells [70], diatoms [71], andChlorella protothecoides(Cp0710) [29]. The nitrogen regulatory protein PII and glutamate synthase, two key components in regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism [72], may help link the TCA cycle and nitrogen assimilation, thereby controlling the flow of carbon and nitrogen in these species.

Algae capable of both autotrophic and heterotrophic growth must actively transport sugars into cells to utilize glucose from heterotrophic media to support cell growth. InChlorella kessleri, three H+/hexose cotransporter genes (HUP1,HUP2, andHUP3) have been identified, each displaying different affinities for glucose and galactose [29,73]. In this study, all these Trebouxiophyceae strains exhibited H+/hexose cotransporter genes, except forPicochlorumandPrototheca, which lacked theHUP2 gene, suggesting that most of these species can grow heterotrophically under certain conditions, as previously reported in laboratory cultures [74–77]. Different genera showed varying rates ofHUP1,HUP2, andHUP3, indicating diverse metabolic strategies adapted to different environments.

In this study, all the Trebouxiophyceae strains possessed NAD-ME, and PCK subtypes of C4-related enzymes, which was identical with previous study based on algal transcriptomic and genomic data [78]. And the malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) was identified only in four freshwater strains belonging toChlorellaandCoccomyxa, which can be explained that the NAD-ME and PCK subtypes are more adaptive than the NADP-ME subtype for species in arid environments [79].

This study generated high-quality genomes for six Trebouxiophyceae strains and performed comprehensive comparative genomic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary analyses. Our phylogenetic analyses based on single-copy orthologues largely corroborated previous work, except for the position ofApatococcus, underscoring a need for further data to resolve this genus’s placement. Our findings suggested that gene family expansion, rapid evolution, and positive selection played crucial roles in adaptation to diverse terrestrial and marine environments, while extensive gene loss and genome streamlining possibly contributed to the parasitic heterotrophic lifestyles. Moreover, the distribution of BGCs, nitrogen transport proteins and HUP-like genes, and the types of C4-related enzymes perhaps highlighted their potential ability to adapt to complex environmental conditions. Collectively, these results enriched the genomic resources for this algal group and advanced our understanding of their ecological adaptation, evolutionary dynamics, and biotechnological potential.

Six Trebouxiophyceae strains were obtained from the Freshwater Algae Culture Collection at the Institute of Hydrobiology (FACHB collection), Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The strains includedChlorella vulgaris(FACHB-895, FACHB-276 and FACHB-417),Coccomyxa arvernensis(FACHB-1300),Coccomyxa rayssiae(FACHB-1235), andCoccomyxa simplex(FACHB-14/UTEX 274). Among these, FACHB-895, FACHB-276, FACHB-1235, and FACHB-14 were collected from freshwater habitats, FACHB-417 was isolated from a wall in Tibet, and FACHB-1300 was found in symbiosis with mosses. All strains were cultured at 25 °C in liquid BG11 medium under a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Universal DNA Isolation Kit (Axygen, Suzhou, China) [80]. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEB Next Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were sequenced using the DNBSEQ platform.

The quality of the raw sequencing reads was initially assessed using FastQC v0.11.6, a widely used quality control tool for high-throughput sequence data (available athttp://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, accessed on 24 June 2021). Low-quality reads and adapter sequences were removed using SOAPnuke [81]. Cleaned reads were then assembled using MEGAHIT v1.0.3 [82] with default parameters. Anvio 7.0 [83] was utilized to filter out prokaryotic sequences from the assembled genomes. Initially, Bowtie2 [84] was applied to align the assembled genomes to the fq files, generating BAM files. Subsequently, the ‘anvi-gen-contigs-database’ tool was used to create a contig database, followed by ‘anvi-run-hmms’ to detect single-copy genes within the database. Sample information was then imported into the database using ‘anvi-profile.’ The results were visualized interactively through ‘anvi-interactive,’ enabling a detailed examination of the data. Finally, ‘anvi-export-collection’ was employed to isolate the eukaryotic bins, and ‘anvi-export-contigs’ was used to extract the sequences of the targeted bins, producing the final assemblies.

Ab initio gene prediction was performed by AUGUSTUS version 3.2.1 [85] with four three-trained organism models:volvox, chlamy2011, andchlorella. GeMoMa-1.9 [86] was employed for homolog-based gene prediction and integration of gene prediction results, with genomes and protein ofChlorella variabilis(GCA_000147415.1),Micractinium conductrix(GCA_002245815.2),Chlorella ohadii(GCA_025026875.1) for the annotation of Chlorella species, andChlorella variabilis(GCA_000147415.1),Chlorella ohadii(GCA_025026875.1),Micractinium conductrix(GCA_002245815.2) andCoccomyxa subellipsoideaC-169 (GCA_000258705.1) forCoccomyxaspecies. InterProScan [87] was used to functionally annotate predicted proteins and map GO terms. Genome assembly and annotation completeness were assessed using the BUSCO tool [88] was employed, with the chlorophyta_odb10 database for a quantitative evaluation.

Ortholog gene groups for the Trebouxiophyceae samples, including those newly added in this study and those from the public database with annotation completeness exceeding 80%, were identified using OrthoFinder [89] with default parameters to obtain single-copy orthologs. Additionally,Volvox carterif.nagariensis(GCA_000143455.1) andDunaliella salina(GCA_002284615.2) were included as outgroups to estimate shared orthologs. These shared orthologs were subsequently used for divergence time estimation and gene family evolution analysis.

The PEP sequences of each single-copy orthologues were aligned using MAFFT v7.394 [90] with the parameters -maxiterate 1000 and -globalpair. Regions with poor alignment were trimmed using TrimAl v1.2 [91] with the -automated1 option. The resulting trimmed alignments of orthologous groups were then used for subsequent phylogenomic analysis. Coalescent-based analyses were employed to construct the phylogenetic tree. For these analyses, RAxML [92] was used to perform maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of each single-copy orthologue, applying the PROTGAMMA GTR model. Additionally, ASTRAL [93] was used to infer the coalescent-based species tree (ST) phylogeny.

The 18 S rDNA sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7 [90], and ambiguous regions were manually adjusted and refined using MEGA7 [94]. To locate the positions of 18 S rDNA sequences within the sequenced genomes, nhmmer [95] was used to align the final assembled genomes to the rDNA database, based on rDNA sequences downloaded from NCBI. Subsequently, SSU sequences were extracted using Perl scripts. To understand the phylogenetic relationships of the strains in this study, additional Trebouxiophyceae 18 S rDNA sequences were downloaded from the public database. The 18 S rDNA sequences were analyzed using jModelTest2 [96] to select the best-fit model, which was found to be GTR + I + G. Bayesian inference (BI) method was applied to infer the phylogeny.

PhyloSuite [97] was used to concatenate all the shared single-copy orthologous groups from the Trebouxiophyceae and the outgroup, resulting in a concatenated sequence of 35,684 amino acids. This concatenated alignment, along with the species tree constructed by ASTRAL [93], was used for Bayesian divergence time estimation using the approximate likelihood method described by dos Reis & Yang, implemented in MCMCtree v. 4.9 [98].

The number of gene copies per family were used to analyze gene family expansion and contraction with CAFE v. 5.1 [99]. Expanded and contracted genes were then extracted for Gene Ontology (GO) functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. For GO enrichment, all the predicted protein sequences (PEP) were imported into InterProScan [108] for GO term mapping. The analysis was carried out using the clusterProfiler [100] package, with a significance cutoff ofp< 0.05, and the false discovery rate (FDR) method was applied to adjust for multiple testing [101].

The CODEML program of PAML v4.9 [119] was used to estimate positive selection and rapidly evolving genes based on common orthologues as described by Xiong et al. [102]. The branch model was employed in the calculation of dN/dS ratios for different genera with different habitat of Trebouxiophyceae, and the species ofApatococcus,Picochlorumand the three parasitic genusHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorella werelabeled as foreground branches respectively. A null model (model = 0), where one dN/dS ratio was fixed across all strains, was compared with an alternative model (model = 2), where foreground branches were allowed to have a different dN/dS ratio. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to assess model fit, a chi-squared test was used to analyzepvalues, and multiple testing was corrected using false discovery rate (FDR). The genes were considered putative rapidly evolving genes if they had an FDR-adjustedpvalue < 0.05 and a higher dN/dS ratio in the foreground branch than in the background branches.

Branch-site model was utilized to find genes that possibly underwent positive selection. The improved branch-site model (model = 2, Nsites = 0) was used to detect signatures of positive selection on individual amino acids in a specific branch. The species ofApatococcus,Picochlorumand the three parasitic genusHelicosporidium,ProtothecaandAuxenochlorellawere set as the foreground branch respectively. The null model assumed that no positive selection occurred on the foreground branch (fix_omega = 1, omega = 1), and the alternative model assumed that sites on the foreground branch were under positive selection (fix_omega = 0, omega = 1.5). LRT were used to test model fit and Chi-square test was applied for examining thePvalues. A correction was performed for multiple testing using an FDR criterion, and BEB method was employed to statistically identify sites under positive selection. Genes with an FDR-adjustedP< 0.05 were considered as putatively selected. For the genes belonging to both under positive selection and putative rapidly evolving were performed for gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses as above.

Further, repeat content for each genome was determined by RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker. Repeat libraries werecreated for each assembly using RepeatModeler (Version 2.0.1) and all repeats were masked using RepeatMasker (Version 4.1.0). The identification of BGCs were performed using plant versions of antiSMASH (http://plantismash.secondarymetabolites.org).

To identify the proteins about nitrogen transport and assimilation, the 13 genes about nitrogen transport and assimilation reported in previous study [69] were downloaded from NCBI, then blastp was used to align all protein sequences against the protein dataset of all species with cut-off E-values of 1e-5. A homologous search was conducted across the 31 Trebouxiophyceae species using BLASTp, with the HUP sequences fromChlorella kesslerias queries. The search applied a stringent cut-off E-value of 1e-5 to ensure specificity. The C4-related genes about green algae have been downloaded as queries [78], and then blastp was used to perform homologous search with cut-off E-values of 1e-5.
