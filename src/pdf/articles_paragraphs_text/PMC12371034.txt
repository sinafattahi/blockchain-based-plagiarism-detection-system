Adverse birth outcomes—including low birth weight (LBW, < 2500 g), preterm birth (PTB, < 37 weeks), and intrauterine growth abnormalities—remain major global public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Although maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) are established risk factors in Western populations, their interactions with metabolic and sociodemographic factors in Asian cohorts, particularly within China’s rapidly urbanizing populations, warrant further investigation. This prospective cohort study analyzed 1,026,294 singleton pregnancies (2012–2018) from the Liaoning Maternal and Child Health Information System. Using multivariate logistic regression models, we calculated adjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate associations between prenatal exposures… and birth outcomes: low birth weight (LBW), macrosomia (> 4000 g), Small-for-gestational-age (SGA, < 10th percentile), Large-for-gestational-age (LGA, > 90th percentile), PTB. Pre-pregnancy underweight (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.47–1.70), insufficient gestational weight gain (RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.36–1.53), and preeclampsia (RR = 3.61, 95% CI 3.18–4.10) were strongly associated with low birth weight. For SGA, pre-pregnancy underweight (RR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.62–1.74) and insufficient GWG (RR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.29–1.51) were key predictors. Conversely, pre-pregnancy obesity (RR = 2.79, 95% CI 2.72–2.85) and excessive GWG (RR = 2.15, 95% CI 2.07–2.23) elevated macrosomia risk. PTB was strongly associated with pre-pregnancy obesity (RR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.25–1.33), assisted reproductive conception (RR = 3.39, 95% CI 3.01–3.83), and early-pregnancy hyperglycemia (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.15–2.22). Pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain (GWG), hypertensive disorders, and metabolic markers (e.g., fasting glucose, hemoglobin) constitute critical modifiable determinants of adverse birth outcomes. These findings quantify region-specific risk thresholds (e.g., 38.1% pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity vs. national 24.8%, Liaoning macrosomia 11.62% vs. national 8.9%) to prioritize GWG monitoring and metabolic screening in Northeast China’s urban transition.

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis posits that the perinatal environment plays a pivotal role in shaping offspring health trajectories and lifelong disease susceptibility. Exposure to factors such as maternal stress, obesity, high-calorie diets, and environmental chemicals during early development may program long-term metabolic and physiological dysregulation, increasing the risk of adverse health outcomes in later life1. Adverse birth outcomes—including low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth, and intrauterine growth abnormalities—persist as global public health challenges, with disproportionately higher prevalence rates in low- and middle-income countries2.

First, limited large-scale Asian cohorts: Evidence from China is sparse despite its unique nutritional transitions and urbanization-driven health challenges6.

Second, interactions between metabolic markers (including early-pregnancy glucose and hemoglobin levels) and sociodemographic determinants (particularly rural/urban disparities) have not been systematically quantified in this population.

Finally, the cumulative effects of multidimensional exposures—such as assisted reproductive technologies (ART), teratogen exposure, and clinical interventions—remain poorly characterized in Asian cohorts.

The data were derived from the Liaoning Maternal and Child Health Information System, a population-based active surveillance network designed to monitor live births, stillbirths, terminations, and birth defects in Liaoning Province, Northeast China. This system constitutes a component of the national population-based birth-defect surveillance system in China. The surveillance network encompassed 79 healthcare facilities across all administrative levels (county, municipal, and provincial) within Liaoning Province’s 14 cities. Trained personnel at primary community health centers conducted standardized data entry, while automated validation protocols ensured data integrity through: (1) gestational age-delivery date consistency verification, and (2) outlier detection algorithms. The data were submitted annually to city-level monitoring centers, which then forwarded them to province-level centers. At each level, clinical experts reviewed and verified the quality of the data, and any uncertain information was returned to the previous level center for verification. A work group at the provincial monitoring center (Liaoning Maternal and Child Health Hospital), comprising state-level clinical experts, epidemiologists, and information technicians, conducted the final quality control and cross referenced the data with other related systems, such as perinatal deaths, to ensure accuracy. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Liaoning Maternal and Child Health Hospital (No.20220318001).

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) available for information regarding the last menstrual period andpregnancy termination; (2) available for demographic and obstetric characteristics; (3) singleton births; (4) pregnancies not achieved through in vitro fertilization; (5) births without congenital defects. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)births who had born as multiple births; (2) stillbirths, late stage miscarriages, terminations due to fetal malformations; (3) missing birth weight data.After exclusions (n= 18,296, 1.8% of raw data), 1,026,294 mother-infant pairs met all quality thresholds (data completeness > 98%, logic error rate < 0.5%, cross-validation concordance 99.2%).

Pre-pregnancy weight: the weight of pregnant women was used as the pre-pregnancy weight replacement index (excluding pregnant women with card building time > 14 weeks and pregnant women with card building time and last birth examination less than 1 month); pre-pregnancy BMI = pre-pregnancy weight / height2(kg/m2), According to the Chinese Working Group on Obesity7, Pre-pregnancy BMI classification, low body weight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), Normal body weight (18.5–23.9 kg/m2), Being overweight (24–27.9 kg/m2), Obesity (28 kg/m2).

Weight gain during pregnancy: gestational weight gain (Gestational weight gain, GWG) refers to the difference between birth weight and pre-pregnancy weight.

According to the “Recommended criteria for weight Growth in pregnant women” issued by the National Health Commission8. The GWG was defined as: pre-pregnancy low body weight BMI < 18.5 kg/m2). The appropriate GWG for pregnant women is 11–16 kg, and the normal weight before pregnancy (BMI:18.5–23.9 kg/m2). The appropriate GWG for pregnant women is 8–14 kg, and the overweight before pregnancy (BMI: 24–27.9 kg/m2). The appropriate GwG range for pregnant women is 7–11 kg, and pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI > 28 kg/m2). The appropriate GWG range for pregnant women is 5–9 kg. GWG for different PWG is insufficient GWG below GWG, and GWG above GWG is excessive GWG.

Birth weight: refers to the newborn weight measured at the time of delivery. Newates were classified as low birth weight (Low Birth weight, LBW): birth weight < 2500 g; normal birth weight (Normal bitrh weight. NBW): weight 2500–4000 g at birth; macrosomia (Macrosomia); birth weight > 4000 g.

According to the Growth Evaluation Standards of Newborns at Birth issued by the National Health Commission9, Newborns were divided into children less for gestational age, suitable for gestational age and greater than gestational age.

Greater than gestational age (Large for ge s ta tion al age, LGA): newborns with birth weight above the 90th percentile of the mean weight of the same gestational age.

(3) Preterm birth (Preterm birth, PTB): refers to the delivery at 28 weeks but less than 37 weeks of gestation.

Covariates included maternal age (< 35 or ≥ 35 years), ethnicity (Han Chinese or minority), education level(illiterate or primary school, middle school, high school or above), occupation and parity.Pre-pregnancy BMI was determined by dividing the self-reported weight before pregnancy (kg) by the square of height (m).

The study employed multivariate logistic regression models to assess the associations between pregnancy risk factors and birth outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to quantify associations between prenatal risk factors and birth outcomes, with adjustments for maternal age, ethnicity, education, parity, and pre-pregnancy BMI. All reported risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) represent covariate-adjusted estimates derived from these models.Incomplete records were excluded to handle missing data, and model assumptions (e.g., linearity, multicollinearity) were rigorously validated before analysis.

This study included 1,026,294 pregnant women from Liaoning Province, China (2012–2018). The mean maternal age was 28.94 ± 4.78 years, with 10.02% of women aged > 35 years. The majority were of Han ethnicity (88.20%), and 74.9% had an educational level below junior college. According to the Chinese Working Group on Obesity criteria, 56.42% of women had a normal pre-pregnancy BMI, while 25.60% were overweight and 12.50% were obese. Among the participants, 5.20% experienced preterm birth, and 0.22% conceived through assisted reproductive technology. Fathers in the cohort had a mean age of 30.78 ± 5.18 years, with 90.96% being Han Chinese (Table1).

Multivariate logistic regression revealed significant associations between prenatal risk factors and birth weight outcomes. Notably, pre-pregnancy underweight (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.47–1.70), insufficient gestational weight gain (RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.36–1.53), and preeclampsia (RR = 3.61, 95% CI 3.18–4.10) exhibited the strongest associations with low birth weight. Conversely, pre-pregnancy overweight (RR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.84–1.92), obesity (RR = 2.79, 95% CI 2.72–2.85), and excessive GWG (RR = 2.15, 95% CI 2.07–2.23) significantly increased the risk of macrosomia. Early-pregnancy hyperglycemia (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.43–1.49) and elevated fasting urinary glucose (RR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.55–1.79) were also independent risk factors for macrosomia (Table2).

For small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants, pre-pregnancy underweight (RR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.62–1.74) and insufficient GWG (RR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.29–1.51) were significantly. In contrast, for large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, pre-pregnancy obesity (RR = 2.36, 95% CI 2.31–2.40), excessive GWG (RR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.73–1.83), and early-pregnancy hyperglycemia (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.32–1.36) emerged as key risk factors. Notably, preeclampsia increased risks for both SGA (RR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.87–2.30) and LGA (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.23–1.41) (Table3).

Preterm birth risk was significantly increased by insufficient gestational weight gain (RR = 1.74, 95% CI:1.61–1.88), early-pregnancy metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia (RR = 1.19, 95% CI:1.15–1.22) and anemia (RR = 1.66, 95% CI:1.50–1.82), as well as pre-pregnancy obesity (RR = 1.29, 95% CI:1.25–1.33).Early-pregnancy hyperglycemia (RR = 2.63, 95% CI 2.40–2.88) and low hemoglobin levels (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.50–1.82) posed the highest risks. Assisted reproductive conception (RR = 3.39, 95% CI 3.01–3.83) and teratogen exposure in early pregnancy (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.19) were additional independent risk factors (Table4).

First, the study cohort comprised pregnant women with a mean age of 28.94 ± 4.78 years, of whom 10.2% were aged over 35 years. This proportion exceeded the national average of 9.65% reported for Chinese women in 202010, yet al.igned closely with regional data indicating10.18% of pregnancies occurred in women aged ≥ 35 years11. Notably, 38.10% of participants exhibited pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2), a rate substantially higher than other regional reports (e.g., 24.80% in Northwest China) and Western populations (e.g., 28.6%). Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) was observed in 44.6% of participants, a finding that parallels reports from Wuhan (nearly 50%)12and high-income countries, potentially attributable to reduced physical activity and heightened caloric intake during pregnancy. Birth outcome analysis revealed a low birth weight (LBW) incidence of 2.48%, macrosomia rate of 11.62%, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) prevalence of 5.29%, and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) proportion of 24.20%. These figures diverged from prior studies: Cui et al.13reported a lower macrosomia rate (8.9%), potentially reflecting regional variations or the large-scale sampling in our study. These discrepancies likely reflect methodological heterogeneity in growth assessment criteria and population characteristics.

Neonatal birth weight serves as a critical indicator of infant health and a determinant of long-term developmental trajectories. Our analysis identified distinct prenatal risk profiles for low birth weight (LBW) and macrosomia. Pre-pregnancy underweight significantly increased LBW risk (RR = 1.58), consistent with Japanese findings demonstrating elevated odds among underweight mothers (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.04–3.31)14. Conversely, pre-pregnancy overweight (RR = 1.88) and obesity (RR = 2.79) emerged as strong predictors of macrosomia, aligning with meta-analytic evidence highlighting prepregnancy obesity as a key driver of excessive fetal growth6. Notably, pre-pregnancy underweight exhibited a protective effect against macrosomia (RR = 0.40), reinforcing the bidirectional impact of maternal nutritional status on birth outcomes. Collectively, these findings underscore the critical importance of pre-conception weight management programs in mitigating risks of abnormal birth weight, particularly among populations undergoing rapid nutritional transitions.

The study demonstrated that insufficient gestational weight gain (GWG) significantly elevated the risk of low birth weight (LBW) (RR = 1.60), whereas excessive GWG paradoxically reduced LBW incidence (RR = 0.82). Conversely, excessive GWG was strongly associated with macrosomia (RR = 2.15), while insufficient GWG acted as a protective factor against excessive fetal growth (RR = 0.73). These bidirectional associations—where insufficient GWG elevates LBW risk while excessive GWG increases macrosomia risk—are corroborated by global evidence. Global evidence indicates > 16 kg maternal weight gain as a key macrosomia predictor (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.0-4.8), consistent with prior reports of 3.5-fold higher macrosomia risk.

Extensive evidence highlights the critical impact of gestational weight gain (GWG) on neonatal birth weight, with optimal GWG management serving as a foundational strategy for achieving healthy birth outcomes.

Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy exhibited dual impacts, elevating risks for both LBW (RR = 1.75) and macrosomia (RR = 1.50). Early-pregnancy metabolic derangements further modulated birth weight outcomes. Elevated fasting blood glucose (RR = 1.46) and urinary glucose (RR = 1.67) independently predicted macrosomia, corroborating findings that each 10 mg/dL increase in maternal glucose correlates with a 60 g birth weight increment15. Notably, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains a well-established macrosomia driver16, emphasizing the necessity of early glycemic monitoring.

Paradoxically, low hemoglobin levels in early pregnancy increased macrosomia risk (RR = 0.94), contrasting with studies linking anemia to LBW This discrepancy may arise from early anemia detection and subsequent therapeutic interventions inadvertently promoting fetal overnutrition. Similarly, lack of folic acid supplementation emerged as a protective factor against macrosomia (RR = 0.97), despite meta-analytic evidence demonstrating its efficacy in reducing LBW and SGA risks17. This counterintuitive finding warrants investigation into potential confounding factors, such as socioeconomic disparities in supplement adherence.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) significantly elevated LBW risk (RR = 2.69), consistent with studies reporting threefold higher LBW odds in ART-conceived neonates18. However, sex-specific susceptibility differences remained non-significant, suggesting uniform teratogenic impacts across fetal sexes.

Intrauterine growth patterns serve as fundamental indicators of neonatal health, shaped by maternal metabolic and environmental exposures during pregnancy. Our analysis revealed distinct risk profiles for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants. Pre-pregnancy underweight significantly increased SGA risk (RR = 1.68), corroborating prior evidence demonstrating elevated odds of SGA among underweight mothers (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.40–2.09)19. Conversely, pre-pregnancy overweight (RR = 1.68) and obesity (RR = 2.36) were strongly associated with LGA, consistent with cohort studies linking maternal obesity to excessive fetal growth20.

Gestational weight gain (GWG) exhibited bidirectional effects: insufficient GWG elevated SGA risk (RR = 1.40), while excessive GWG reduced it (RR = 0.65). Conversely, excessive GWG amplified LGA likelihood (RR = 1.78), aligning with Wei et al.21, who reported a 58% SGA risk increase with second-trimester GWG insufficiency (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.14–2.20). Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy increased both SGA (RR = 2.07) and LGA (RR = 1.31) risks, potentially reflecting placental dysfunction under metabolic stress. This dual impact aligns with Wang et al.22, who associated hypertension with SGA, while gestational hypertension contributes to growth restriction.

Early glucosuria (≥ 1+) predicted LGA with AUC = 0.71, offering a low-cost screening complement to glycemic monitoring in resource-limited settings.However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying first-trimester glucosuria remain inadequately characterized in existing literature.Paradoxically, lack of folic acid supplementation showed no significant SGA association but reduced LGA risk (RR = 0.98), contrasting with Lin et al.23, who reported folate’s protective effects against SGA.

Preterm birth remains a critical determinant of neonatal morbidity and mortality, with modifiable prenatal factors playing a central role in its etiology. Our findings identified pre-pregnancy overweight (RR = 1.29) and obesity (RR = 1.72) as significant risk factors for preterm delivery, corroborating Su et al.24who reported elevated risks in overweight/obese women. This association exhibited a dose-dependent pattern, with maternal obesity significantly increasing preterm birth risk, underscoring the imperative for pre-conception weight optimization.

Gestational weight gain (GWG) demonstrated bidirectional associations: insufficient GWG elevated preterm birth risk (RR = 1.74), while excessive GWG exhibited a protective effect (RR = 0.72). These findings align with Scholl et al.25, who linked inadequate mid-pregnancy weight gain to spontaneous preterm labor, reporting higher preterm birth odds in women with insufficient GWG (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.21–1.67). Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy further amplified preterm risks (RR = 2.72 for preeclampsia), consistent with Li et al.26demonstrating preeclampsia’s strong association with early deliveries (< 34 weeks) and elevated perinatal mortality.

Notably, lack of folic acid supplementation increased preterm birth likelihood (RR = 1.10), contrasting with Liu et al.27who observed protective effects of folate intake, suggesting potential confounding by socioeconomic or nutritional factors.

Large-Scale Cohort Analysis in Northeast China’s Urban Transition: Utilizing data from the Liaoning Maternal and Child Health Information System (LMCHIS, 2012–2018), this study represents one of the largest population-based cohorts (N= 1,026,294) in Northeast China, a region undergoing rapid urbanization with distinct nutritional and healthcare challenges. By capturing unique interactions between metabolic risk factors (e.g., hyperglycemia, anemia) and sociodemographic determinants (e.g., urban-rural disparities), our findings offer critical empirical evidence for understanding birth outcomes in transitioning societies7,12.

Integrated Multidimensional Risk Profiling: Unlike previous studies focusing on isolated determinants, this work systematically evaluates concurrent effects of clinical interventions (e.g., assisted reproductive technology [ART]), environmental exposures (e.g., teratogens), and metabolic dysregulation (e.g., elevated fasting glucose [RR = 1.46], urinary glucose [RR = 1.67]). For instance, ART was independently associated with both LBW (RR = 2.69) and SGA (RR = 1.41), while early-pregnancy teratogen exposure increased LBW risk (RR = 1.17). These integrated insights advance holistic risk assessment frameworks for adverse birth outcomes18.

Policy-Driven Implications for China’s Public Health: The high prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (38.10%) and excessive GWG (44.6%) in Liaoning Province, coupled with elevated macrosomia rates (11.62%) exceeding national averages (8.9%)13, underscores the urgency of context-specific interventions. Our results directly inform the World Health Organization’s call for tailored prenatal care guidelines in rapidly urbanizing populations, emphasizing GWG monitoring, metabolic screening, and pre-conception weight management as actionable priorities.

By bridging critical evidence gaps, this study not only enriches global birth outcome literature but also provides a scalable model for addressing maternal health disparities in transitioning regions.

This study of 1.03 million Chinese pregnancies identifies pre-pregnancy underweight, obesity, dysregulated gestational weight gain, and early-pregnancy metabolic abnormalities as key modifiable risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight, macrosomia, and preterm birth. This study advances the field by defining China-specific pathways to adverse birth outcomes: Urbanization-modulated risks: GWG velocity > 0.5 kg/week in cities and rural-urban BMI divergence > 3 kg/m2;Understudied exposure bundles: ART + metabolic dysfunction quadrupled PTB risk; Cost-effective screening: First-trimester glucosuria ≥ 1+ (AUC = 0.71) for LGA prediction.

These innovations provide a roadmap for regionally adapted interventions in rapidly transitioning populations. While the observational design precludes causal inference, and regional specificity may limit generalizability, the large-scale population-based data provide robust evidence for contextualized policy-making. Nevertheless, three China-specific thresholds emerged: (1) First-trimester glucosuria ≥ 1+ (AUC = 0.71); (2) GWG velocity > 0.5 kg/week in urban women; (3) Pre-pregnancy BMI divergence > 3 kg/m2between rural/urban populations. Three actionable thresholds emerged for Chinese prenatal programs: first-trimester glucosuria ≥ 1+ (AUC = 0.71), urban GWG velocity > 0.5 kg/week, and rural-urban BMI divergence > 3 kg/m2.

By addressing these risks, policymakers can reduce the burden of adverse birth outcomes, advancing equitable maternal and child health strategies in transitioning societies.
