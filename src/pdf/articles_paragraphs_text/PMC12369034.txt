is a pathogen that causes community-acquired pneumonia in children, and it is often accompanied by various extrapulmonary complications. While intestinal necrosis is relatively rare among these extrapulmonary manifestations, they can be severe and life threatening.

We present an uncommon extrapulmonary complication of intestinal necrosis caused by nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) in a six-year-old child withM. pneumoniaepneumonia. Although the patient exhibited segmental embolism in their pulmonary artery and right atrial appendage, neither computed tomography angiography nor postoperative pathology revealed mesenteric vascular thrombosis. The patient’s mesenteric arteries were patent without occlusion or thrombosis, and the pathological findings indicated ischemic enteritis, which is consistent with NOMI.

Intestinal necrosis caused by NOMI is a rare but severe extrapulmonary complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Compared to acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia, diagnosing NOMI is significantly more challenging due to the inherent difficulty in detecting vasospasm through imaging studies, often resulting in delayed intervention and higher mortality. Thus, integrating other diagnostic methods, clinical manifestations, and multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment in medical practice are essential for ensuring accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment.

M. pneumoniaepneumonia (MPP) is prevalent among children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide [1,2], and it is associated with a wide array of extrapulmonary complications. While respiratory symptoms are the hallmark ofM. pneumoniaeinfection, the organism can also trigger systemic immune responses or vasculitis, thereby involving multiple organ systems [3]. While gastrointestinal complications are relatively rare among these extrapulmonary manifestations, they can be severe and life threatening.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) encompasses a spectrum of disorders marked by compromised blood flow to different portions of the intestine, leading to ischemia and secondary inflammatory responses. Although mesenteric ischemia is uncommon, it can be life threatening; therefore, its accurate diagnosis is crucial [4]. AMI can manifest as either occlusive mesenteric ischemia or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI). NOMI accounts for approximately 20% of all AMI cases and is a condition characterized by ischemia and necrosis of the intestinal tract without organic obstruction of the mesenteric vessels; furthermore, it is known to have an extremely high mortality rate reaching up to 50%~80% [5,6]. The disease is particularly challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and the difficulty in detecting vasospasms via imaging studies [7]. NOMI diagnosis is often delayed, leading to late treatment and poor outcomes.

This case report describes an unusual extrapulmonary complication of intestinal necrosis secondary to NOMI in a six-year-old child with MPP. To our knowledge, no reports of intestine necrosis due to NOMI associated with MPP have been published.

On May 17, 2024, a six-year-old boy was admitted to our unit after having fever and cough for eight days and vomiting and abdominal pain for one day. He was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful birth history. His vital signs included a low-grade fever (38.2 °C), tachypnea (36 breaths/min), tachycardia (126 bpm), and a blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg. The boy’s physical examination revealed signs of peritonism, particularly in the lower quadrants. The laboratory results showed an elevated D-dimer 13.57 µg/ml (normal < 0.5 µg/mL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 612 U/L (normal < 295 U/L), an elevated white blood cell count of 38.49 × 109cells/L (normal 4–12 × 109cells/L) with 86.8% neutrophils, hemoglobin at 133 g/L, platelet levels at 422 × 109/L, an elevated C-reactive protein 90 mg/L (normal < 10 mg/L), fibrinogen of 2.49 g/L (normal 1.80–4.00 g/L), and total protein (TP) of 72.5 g/L (normal 65.0–84.0 g/L). The throat swab nucleic acid test (Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex Detection Kit, PN.1060071, Ningbo Health Gene Technologies Co., Ltd.) was positive forM. pneumoniae. The patient’s chest radiography revealed atelectasis in the left upper lung (Fig.1A), and computed tomography of the chest indicated left upper lobe pneumonia with atelectasis (Fig.1B). After admission, the patient was administered azithromycin for anti-mycoplasma (10 mg/kg/day intravenous infusion) as well as anti-inflammatory low-dose methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 12 h). The use of corticosteroids was based on the confirmed diagnosis of severe MPP and the presence of elevated inflammatory markers, including CRP, LDH, and D-dimer, which collectively indicated a strong systemic inflammatory and immune response. Electronic bronchoscopy was utilized to extract mucus plug obstructing the left upper lobe bronchus (Fig.1C-E). Additionally, in consideration of the possibility that the patient had peritonitis, the patient was administered cefoperazone sulbactam for anti-infection treatment (80 mg/kg/day intravenous infusion). In addition, he was kept nil per os (NPO), and received nasogastric (NG) decompression, fluid replacement and parenteral nutrition to maintain hemodynamic stability and nutrition support. Notably, the patient did not require any inotropic or vasopressor support throughout the course of treatment, indicating stable hemodynamic status despite the severity of illness.

An abdominal standing radiograph revealed localized intestinal dilation with multiple fluid levels evident (Fig.2A). To better evaluate the patient’s condition and potential thrombosis, we performed computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of the pulmonary and abdominal regions on hospital day 2. The pulmonary CTA effectively identified pulmonary artery embolisms (Fig.2B) and a filling defect in the right atrial appendage (Fig.2C). The echocardiogram found a strong echo area at the opening of the pulmonary artery, consistent with thrombus formation (Fig.2D). However, the CTA did not directly detect any thrombi within the abdominal vessels; instead, it revealed dilated and thinned intestines with extensive gas and fluid accumulation in the bowels (Fig.2E-F), suggesting the possibility of ileus and peritonitis.

As the patient’s abdominal pain and vomiting persisted, so a diagnostic paracentesis was performed that yielded yellow, turbid ascitic fluid classified as an exudate. A nucleic acid test of the ascitic fluid confirmed the presence ofM. pneumoniae. Given the patient’s ongoing symptoms, CT findings, and paracentesis results, the possibility of intestinal obstruction or necrosis could not be ruled out. After actively communicating with the patient’s family about the patient’s condition, we conducted an exploratory laparotomy on the third day after admission. Necrosis was intraoperatively identified in the ileocecal region (Fig.3A). The mesenteric arteries were patent and palpable, exhibiting no evidence of occlusion or thrombosis. During the surgery, adhesiolysis was performed to relieve intestinal adhesions. Additionally, a segment of approximately 15 cm of necrotic ileum, located about 8 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, was resected, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis. A histopathological examination of the resected tissue confirmed full-thickness hemorrhagic necrosis of the ileum; no arterial or venous thrombi were identified in the resected specimen (Fig.3B).

The child’s abdominal pain and vomiting were significantly relieved after the operation, and there were no instances of chest pain or hemoptysis throughout the course of the illness. The patient initially received anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin sodium. Subsequently, the patient was gradually transitioned to a semiliquid diet. As the patient’s condition improved, he was discharged home and given instructions to continue oral anticoagulation therapy using rivaroxaban (5 mg once daily) for one month, pending confirmation of thrombus resolution on follow-up imaging. One month after discharge, follow-up pulmonary CTA revealed a complete resolution of the pulmonary artery thrombus and right atrial appendage thrombus as well as the significant absorption of the left-sided pneumonia compared to previous findings. At 12-month follow-up, the patient has remained free of both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, with appropriate weight gain. Coagulation parameters have normalized, and no recurrence of thrombosis has been observed during the follow-up period.

WhileM. pneumoniaeinfection is primarily known to cause respiratory infections, it can affect almost every organ in the body, including those in the cutaneous, hematologic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems [8,9]. The mechanisms underlying these extrapulmonary manifestations can be categorized into five distinct pathways [10,11]. The first pathway involves the direct effects ofM. pneumoniaeat the site of inflammation mediated by host cytokine release [12,13]. The second pathway encompasses immune-mediated vasculitis due to deposition of circulating immune complexes in small vessel walls (including mesenteric vessels), potentially leading to vascular occlusion [14]. The third pathway involves transient antiphospholipid antibodies triggered byM. pneumoniaeinfection, which increase the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis [15]. The fourth pathway involves arterial vasospasm triggered by systemic inflammation, which may result in nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia—particularly in younger individuals [16]. The fifth pathway involves endothelial dysfunction caused by both directM. pneumoniaeeffects and the inflammatory milieu, leading to platelet aggregation and microvascular thrombosis. The extrapulmonary manifestations that receive high amounts of attention include dermatological disorders [17], the central nervous system [18], and thrombus formation [13,19], while there are relatively fewer reports of gastrointestinal complications. A variety of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms commonly accompany mycoplasma respiratory infections; however, there is little data validating specific explanations for this phenomenon.

Our case indicated intestinal necrosis in the clinical course of MPP. Although intestinal necrosis is a rare complication in patients with severe pneumonia, it still occurs occasionally, often due to AMI. Ayman Nada et al. presented an uncommon thromboembolic complication of the superior mesenteric artery and small bowel necrosis in a 49-year-old male with COVID-19 pneumonia [20]. Bao et al. reported a case involving severeKlebsiellapneumoniae pneumonia complicated by acute intra-abdominal multiple arterial thrombosis and bacterial embolism [21]. The occurrence of AMI and subsequent bowel necrosis is exceedingly rare in the context of MPP. To date, only one adult case has been reported involving an acute superior mesenteric artery (SMA) thrombosis and four feet of resected ischemic small bowel were reported literature [22]. There are no documented cases ofM. pneumoniae-induced bowel necrosis in pediatric patients, although sporadic instances ofM. pneumoniae-related mesenteric ischemia or thrombosis have been observed [13,23]. AMI, which can manifest as either occlusive or nonocclusive (NOMI), is a potential cause of small bowel necrosis [6]. The occlusive etiology is further classified into mesenteric arterial embolism, mesenteric arterial thrombosis, or mesenteric venous thrombosis [4]. NOMI is a rare and severe pathological condition that can lead to intestinal necrosis without the mechanical obstruction of the mesenteric artery. The cause of necrosis in our patient was not confirmed before emergency surgery was conducted. Although the patient exhibited segmental embolism of the pulmonary artery and right atrial appendage, neither CTA nor vascular ultrasound revealed mesenteric vascular thrombosis. The intraoperative findings indicated that the cause of necrosis was NOMI. In addition, the necrotic small intestine appeared to be segmented into dark purple to black sections in the ileocecal region, yet no evidence of obstruction in the mesenteric artery was found. The pathological examination, histological analysis, and findings consistent with ischemic enteritis further supported NOMI as the underlying cause of the patient’s necrosis.

NOMI is a hypoperfusion syndrome believed to result from low cardiac output and persistent vasoconstriction, commonly observed in patients with underlying systemic hypotension, sepsis, myocardial failure, hemodialysis, and dehydration, or patients receiving vasopressors [24,25]. NOMI generally occurs in patients of advanced age. Several case reports have described NOMI in pediatric patients, although rarely in children. Martinez et al. reported two pediatric cases of NOMI receiving propranolol as a treatment for burn injuries [26], while Frontino et al. reported a case of NOMI in a 13-year-old female with diabetic ketoacidosis, hypovolemic shock, and hyperosmolar state [27]. Cases involving a 34-month-old girl with interstitial 6q25 microdeletion syndrome and associated shock [28] and a 16-month-old boy who experienced cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation from foreign bodies in the airway [29] were also reported. In our case, the patient was definitively diagnosed with MPP, and his persistent vomiting and unrelenting abdominal pain prompted us to perform an exploratory laparotomy. This surgical exploration ultimately revealed that the cause of the symptoms was intestinal necrosis due to NOMI.

The presence of AMI in the patient was determined by the constellation of findings, including elevated D-dimer levels, electrolyte disturbances, LDH, white blood cell count (WBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP). While these markers are nonspecific, they collectively suggest an ongoing inflammatory process with potential tissue hypoxia and necrosis [30]. Thrombosis was found in the patient’s other organs, supporting a systemic hypercoagulable state. The clinical symptoms of NOMI, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension, are typically subtle and nonspecific, which frequently leads to delayed diagnosis. Imaging studies, particularly CTA, play a critical role in diagnosing vascular abnormalities [31]. NOMI, however, involves vasospasm rather than occlusion, which limits the sensitivity of CTA [32]. In our case, abdominal CTA showed dilated and thinned intestines, which did not provide sufficient evidence for NOMI diagnosis. Vasospasms may not always be visible in conventional imaging modalities, potentially leading to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. As a result, NOMI carries a high mortality rate [5,6]. Timely diagnosis and intervention are critical to reducing mortality [33,34]. Doctors who suspect NOMI in their patients should focus on correcting underlying causes and improving mesenteric perfusion. Immediate fluid resuscitation is essential to enhance visceral blood flow; moreover, electrolyte imbalances should be promptly corrected and nasogastric decompression initiated. Prompt laparoscopy or laparotomy should be conducted for patients with overt peritonitis. Infarcted bowel should be resected without delay to prevent further complications [6].

Given the rarity of MPP-caused intestinal necrosis, determining specific preventive measures is difficult. However, the early identification of atypical symptoms, especially signs of acute abdomen, in patients withM. pneumoniaeinfection is crucial for timely intervention. Clinical doctors should be highly suspicious of extrapulmonary complications, particularly in cases of hypercoagulable blood. Patients suspected of having mesenteric ischemia should immediately undergo diagnostic evaluation and consider emergency surgical consultation. In conclusion, although the association between MPP and intestinal necrosis is rare, it underscores the necessity for comprehensive patient assessment, multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment involvement, and aggressive management strategies to prevent fatal outcomes.
