Rapid industrial development has led to the discharge of significant amounts of untreated industrial wastewater into the environment, resulting in substantial effects on natural ecosystems and human health. Consequently, there is a need to develop new environmentally friendly alternatives for water remediation. In this regard, chitosan (CS) aerogels possess high porosity, low density, and biodegradability, and act as effective sorbents for the removal of various ionic pollutants from water, air, and soil. The presence of numerous amino (–NH2) and hydroxyl (OH) groups enhances the adsorption of ionic pollutantsviaelectrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and chelation mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the use of chitosan-based aerogels as eco-friendly gels to remove different contaminants from water such as dyes, heavy metals, microorganisms, and pharmaceuticals, by improving the mechanical strength, decreasing hydrophilicity, and increasing acid stability. These improvements are accomplished using different modification methods, such as blending with nanofillers, chemical and/or ionic crosslinkers, and designing composite aerogels. The modified aerogel exhibits excellent adsorption ability against different contaminants, as well as antibacterial properties, making it promising candidates for a wide range of applications.

Aerogel, a three-dimensional solid developed through the physical or chemical cross-linking of polymer chains followed by the drying of gels using various techniques (e.g., supercritical drying or freeze-drying), demonstrates exceptional efficacy in the removal of dyes and metal ions owing to its high specific surface area, porosity exceeding 80.00%, and low densities ranging from 0.005 to 0.5 g cm−3, in addition to its superior capacity for separation and recycling from aqueous solutions while maintaining structural integrity.36–39Fig. 2illustrates the preparation procedures for chitosan aerogel, which use epichlorohydrin (ECH) and itaconic acid (IA) as chemical and ionic crosslinkers. Chitosan is dissolved in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) solvent and stirred for 3 hours at 120 °C, followed by mixing with ECH. For dual crosslinking, IA was included; the solutions were immersed and agitated in a 0.1 M NaOH solution at ambient temperature for 48 hours. Subsequent to dialysis, the hydrogels were rinsed with distilled water to eliminate unreacted ECH. Ultimately, the hydrogels underwent freeze-drying for 24 hours at – 95 °C, while the aerogels were maintained in a vacuum oven overnight.40To the best of our knowledge, many reviews have studied the preparation, characterization, and application of chitosan aerogel. However, the adsorption abilities of chitosan aerogel as an eco-friendly gel toward various types of contaminants, such as dyes, heavy metals, microorganisms, and pharmaceuticals, have not been extensively reviewed.

CS is being used widely as an adsorbent because of remarkable properties as explained earlier. The amino (–NH2) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups in CS facilitate chemical interactions and crosslinking, which contribute to the formation of robust, acid-stable films and interactionsviahydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. These properties make CS an exceptional adsorbent for dyes and various contaminants in wastewater treatment.32,41–43In the following sections, we will explain the adsorption ability of CS-based aerogels against different water contaminants, such as dyes, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals waste, microorganisms and their removal mechanisms.

The textile products have increased by about 7 × 105tons per year worldwide, and due to discharged untreated dye effluents (approximately 2.8 × 105tons) to the water bodies, causing water contamination, which has posed many serious threats to the ecological system, plant growth, and human health.44Furthermore, these dyes are poisonous, hydrophilic, mutagenic, resistant to degradation, and reduce the rate of photosynthesis and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in aquatic environments.45In this regard, CS is abundant in amine and hydroxyl groups, enabling it to interact with anionic and cationic dyes. Anionic dyes can attach to the amino group due to the electrostatic attraction between the positive charge on the amino groups and the negative charge on the dye's molecules.46However, chitosan aerogels have some drawbacks, such as low mechanical strength, water stability and high hydrophilicity, which hinder their interactions with hydrophobic organic contaminants.47,48To overcome this issue, CS-based aerogel should be combined with other materials. For instance, Varamesh and his co-worker developed composite biobased aerogel containing CS, cellulose filament (CF), and citric acid (CA) for methylene blue (cationic dye 50 mg L−1) removal. The results demonstrated that the composite-based aerogel has high mechanical properties (up to ∼65 kPa m3kg−1) and high dye adsorption removal (619 mg g−1, 99%, pH = 6) due to electrostatic interactions between CF and CS leading to enhanced diversity of functional groups (carboxylic acids, hydroxyls, and amines) on the surface of the materials. In addition, CA acts as a covalent crosslinker.49Tanet al.synthesized a CS and quinoa polysaccharide (QS) composite aerogel and investigated the adsorption capacity toward two types of dyes, Congo red (CR, 50 mg L−1) and methylene blue (MB, 5 mg L−1), which are anionic and cationic, respectively. They found the maximum adsorption capacity for CR was 342 mg g−1at pH = 6. It could be attributed to the zeta potential of the composite being positive when pH increased from 4 to 6 while decreased with pH increase from 6 to 12. On the other hand, the adsorption capacity for MB was 57.80 mg g−1at pH = 12. Because of the low pH value of the solution likely caused a high concentration of H+ions surrounded the adsorption site, which prevented the dye's approach. Furthermore, at lower pH levels, the amino group in the CR structure became protonated and subsequently polymerized with the shell. The protonated amino groups and hydroxyl groups on the sugar molecule chain produce electrostatic repulsion. As the pH value rises, the repulsive force decreases, leading to an increased adsorption capacity. However, with further increases in pH, the gravitational force between the aerogel and CR also decreases, resulting in a decrease in adsorption capacity.50Some scientists' efforts tried to use by-product waste to improve the adsorption ability of CS-based aerogel; in this regard, Martina and Mariano prepared composite aerogel made from CS and soot to enhance the adsorption ability toward cationic and anionic dyes such as MB and indigo carmine (IC), respectively. They concluded that the adsorption properties of modified CS-based aerogel against MB were higher than pristine CS-based aerogel due to electrostatic interactions between amino groups and MB molecules, whereas pristine CS-based aerogel had a higher adsorption ability toward IC than CS/soot aerogel; this could be attributed to the interaction between soot particles and CS blocking the CS active sites.51As mentioned earlier, one of the drawbacks of chitosan (CS) is its hydrophilicity, which negatively affects its mechanical strength. To address this issue, Natáliaet al.prepared highly hydrophobic composite aerogel containing CS beads, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), and hydrophobized tannic acid (HTA) and tested the adsorption performance for removing basic blue 26 and basic brown 4 dyes in batch and fixed-bed assays. In batch experiments, the results show that the CS@CNC-HTA beads aerogel has higher adsorption removal of 375.58 mg g−1and 235.39 mg g−1than pure CS, 330.59 mg g−1and 213.74 mg g−1for basic blue 26 and basic brown 4, respectively. Meanwhile, in fixed bed experiments, the CS@CNC-HTA beads aerogel has efficiently removed basic blue 26.52In another study, the impact of functionality on the adsorption capacity of CS-based aerogel has been studied by Zhang and his colleagues. They prepared ferrocene (Fc)-functionalized CS-based aerogels and examined their adsorption ability against MB with and without H2O2. The results demonstrated that the adsorption performance of Fc/CS-based aerogel without using H2O2was low (<40 mg g−1, 8.2%), whereas it was 9.29% for pristine CS aerogel; on the other hand, the adsorption efficiency for Fc/CS-based aerogel in the presence of H2O2was 92.79% in comparison with pristine CS aerogel (19%).53Another drawback to limiting the use of CS-based aerogels in some applications is the dense structure, which may limit the adsorption capacity. To solve this problem, Kuanget al.developed a 3D hierarchically macro–meso–microporous structure with a high-strength chitin/chitosan-based composite aerogel (HPS-aerogel) and investigated the adsorption ability to remove CR (500 mg L−1). The HPS-aerogel has high adsorption capacity (2074 mg g−1) at pH = 6.5. Because under acidic conditions, the amino groups are protonated, making H+ions occupy the active sites on the aerogel, causing low absorbability for CR, while, at alkaline conditions, the amino groups are deprotonated, making OH−ions occupy the active sites, leading to decreased electrostatic interactions. The maximum adsorption ability is attributed to the high porosity of the 3D aerogel structure.54Marottaet al.synthesized a zeolite/chitosan (CS) aerogel and assessed its adsorption efficacy for cationic (methylene blue, MB) and anionic (indigo carmine, IC) dyes. The maximal adsorption capabilities were determined to be 221 mg g−1for IC and 108 mg g−1for MB. The significant adsorption was ascribed to the abundant active sites in the microporous structure of the aerogel, which enabled fast diffusion and effective pollutant elimination.55Other studies have used CS-based composite aerogel as an eco-friendly gel to remove different types of cationic and anionic dyes, as shown inTable 1.

The adsorption ability of CS-based different composite aerogels as an eco-friendly gel for removing different types of dyes has been explained earlier. Now, we need to address a crucial question: how do these aerogels remove dyes from water? Dyes ions can exist either cationic (positive charge) or anionic (negative charge) and each type has a special mechanism. In general, the adsorption mechanism responsible for removing these dyes involves electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, and n–π interaction. Heet al.presumed the adsorption mechanism between the (MO anionic dye) and regenerated cellulose/chitosan composite aerogel (RC/CSGA) using glutaraldehyde (GA) as the crosslinking agent as follows: in acidic conditions; the amino group of aerogels is protonated, producing (–NH3+and –NH2+) cationic groups with positive charges on the aerogel surface and the negative charge of the sulfonate group (–SO3−) on MO dye, leading to strong electrostatic attraction. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds formed between hydrogen on the aerogel surface and oxygen/nitrogen in MO, the adsorption mechanism illustrated inFig. 3.65While, in alkaline conditions, the amino groups on the aerogel surface are deprotonated, changing –NH3+into neutral –NH2which reduces the surface positive charge and may enhance the adsorption capability with cationic dyesviahydrogen bonding or other interactions.

Numerous industrial and human activities, including industrial facilities, transportation, metallurgy, wastewater, combustion processes, mining, and agriculture, are the principal contributors to the release of heavy metals into aquatic ecosystems.66Heavy metals such as chromium, copper, nickel, cadmium, zinc, mercury, lead,etc., existing in water are a critical problem that should be handled effectively due to the substantial threat they pose to the sustainability of ecosystems and human health.67,68The non-biodegradability, toxicity, and ability to accumulate in the human body present significant issues, posing long-term risks to human health and natural ecosystems.69Researchers have explored and tried many technologies, such as ion-exchange, electrolysis, flocculation, and chemical precipitation, to mitigate the risks posed by heavy metals in aqueous solutions.70–73Using these processes, a significant amount of contaminated water has been partially remediated. Nevertheless, the majority of these approaches are accompanied by drawbacks, including secondary pollutants, high costs, and low effectiveness, which restrict their wide use.74In contrast, bio-adsorption has been demonstrated to be the most suitable approach due to its operational flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and absence of secondary pollutants.75For instance, Wang and Li developed a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous chitosan aerogel that incorporates a combination of chitosan gelation and soft fine bubbles. The templates were initially employed using ultrasonic technology, with natural genipin, derived from the hydrolysis of geniposide by β-glucosidase, selected as the crosslinker. After that they investigated the adsorption ability toward copper ion (Cu2+) and the results demonstrated that the aerogel has excellent adsorption performance with an adsorption capacity of 116.7 mg g−1. The existence of numerous interconnected pores facilitates the exposure of active adsorption sites, resulting in enhanced adsorption efficiency.76Tanet al.successfully prepared pineapple leaves and chitosan composite aerogels with different drying techniques. The as-prepared aerogels were highly porous, had strong acid resistance and were ultra-lightweight. The adsorption capacity has been examined to remove Cr(vi) from water, and they found that the drying technique does not affect the adsorption capacity, whereas the optimum pH was 3 with 211.4 mg g−1of high adsorption of Cr(vi).77To protect the environment not only by eliminating the pollutants but also by using waste materials, Li and his co-workers prepared aerogel by combining chitosan and waste office paper to remove (Cu2+). They have aerogels with acid resistance, excellent mechanical strength, and high adsorption capacity (156.3 mg g−1).78In another work, Liet al.modified chitosan with ethylenediamine tetraacetic anhydride to improve adsorption ability toward different types of heavy metals such as Cu2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+. The adsorption capacity at pH = 5 was 108.14, 143.73 and 84.62 mg g−1for Cu2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+, respectively.79To investigate the adsorption capacity of CS-based aerogels against different heavy metals, Shahnazet al.prepared a composite aerogel containing nanobentonite-incorporated nanocellulose/chitosan aerogel (NCNB) and examined its adsorption capacity for Cr(vi), Co(iii), and Cu(ii) at different pH levels. They found that the maximum removal efficiency was 98.9% (Cr(vi)), 97.45% (Co(iii)), and 99.01% (Cu(ii)) at optimum pH levels of 4, 2, and 5, respectively.80As mentioned before, Cs-based aerogels have many features, among them high porosity, and to explore their relevance in adsorptive removal of heavy metals, Liet al.developed a cross-linked aerogel as an environmentally sustainable adsorbent characterized by low density (0.0283 g cm−3) and high porosity (97.98%) and examined its adsorption capability for copper ions. The findings indicated that the synthesized aerogel demonstrated an exceptional adsorption capacity of 21.38 mg g−1. They concluded that the adsorption mechanism was facilitated by the aerogel's high porosity, which enabled liquid absorptionviacapillary forces produced by the porous structure and reinforced by hydrogen bonding.81In the same context, Varedaet al.synthesized CS/silica aerogel with (96% porosity, 17 cm3g−1pore volume, 33 μm pore diameter and 2.05 m2g−1specific surface area) and evaluated its adsorption capacity for copper ions. The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of 40 mg g−1and they also observed decrease in porosity because of the interaction between aerogel and metal ions as well as the pore filling.82Many studies investigate the adsorption performance of CS-based different composite aerogels to remove different types of heavy metals, as summarised inTable 2.

The WHO states that infectious diseases are induced by harmful microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi. These infectious diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly between individuals. Zoonotic diseases are infectious ailments originating in animals that can be transmitted to humans, resulting in illness,90make them seriously threatening to human health, living organisms, and the environment. Much effort focuses on removing these threats; however, it is still a challenge due to some limitations, such as high cost, limited efficiency, and harmful byproducts. As mentioned before, biopolymer has remarkable features; among them are low cost and no intermediate product. Chitosan possesses many amino (–NH2) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups, which can act as sites of coordination to form complexes with pollutant ions.91Nevertheless, CS alone is inadequate owing to its weak chemisorption and limited antimicrobial efficacy. Consequently, it is extremely important to develop a scalable and eco-friendly approach to transform CS into multifunctional material exhibiting superior performance across various fields,92hence, chitosan aerogel, with the aforementioned advantages, demonstrates significant potential for the effective removal of various microorganisms. Nonetheless, limitations persist, including the low mechanical strength and high hydrophilicity of pure chitosan aerogel. To address these obstacles, an effective approach is the incorporation of appropriate fillers into the chitosan matrix.93Ko and Kim prepared dual crosslinked chitosan aerogel using itaconic acid (IA) and epichlorohydrin (ECH) as ionic and chemical crosslinking, respectively, and evaluated the antibacterial performance against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (C. glutamicum). The results show that the dual crosslinked aerogel has excellent antibacterial properties against both bacteria. It is attributed to the positive charge of NH3+groups on aerogel electrostatic interaction with the negative charge cell of bacteria, leading to destroying it ref.40. Tanget al.prepared a multifunctional biomass composite aerogel containing chitosan (CS), nanocellulose (NC), and sodium phytate (PA-Na) and investigated its antibacterial properties against Gram-positiveS. aureusand Gram-negativeE. coli.The results demonstrated that the composite aerogel has good antimicrobial activity with the removal rate of 78.5% forS. aureusand 89.2% forE. coli. They proposed the removal mechanism based on the zeta potential of composite aerogel with a high positive charge that could adhere to the bacteria surface by electrostatic attraction, causing the destruction of the membrane cell and then cell death.94Julia and her co-workers synthesized chitosan-based aerogel modified with Tiliaplatyphyllos extract as a crosslinker and evaluated the antibacterial properties againstS. aureus(Gram-positive bacteria). They observed that the modified aerogel has good antibacterial activity due to electrostatic attraction between the NH3+on the aerogel surface and the negative charge of lipoteichoic acids on the bacterial cell membrane, which causes blocking nutrient diffusion to the cell.95In other work, Rizalet al.fabricated cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and chitosan (CS) aerogel and examined the antibacterial ability towards Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with initial bacteria counts of 1.34 × 108CFU mL−1and 1.56 × 108CFU mL−1forE. coliandS. aureus, respectively. They found the aerogel showed a 2-log reduction (99%) against both bacteria.96Similarly, Zhang and his colleagues investigated the antibacterial performance of as-prepared chitosan-based aerogel embedded amino-functionalized molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (CS/NMNSs) againstE. coliandS. aureusand concluded the inactivation rate of bacteria forE. coliwas 97.52% and forS. aureus was99%. Gram-positive bacteria have significantly lower isoelectric points than Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in a considerably larger negative charge at the same pH level. Chitosan is positively charged, resulting in a stronger connection between the CS/NMNSs composite aerogel andS. aureusdue to electrostatic interactions.97Hebaet al.studied the effects of nanoparticles on antibacterial properties by developing a chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol composite, modifying it with different weight percentages of NiO nanoparticles, and testing its antibacterial ability against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureusandBacillus cereus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coliandSalmonella Typhimurium). The results show that the modified NiO/chitosan/PVA aerogel has higher antibacterial activity than the unmodified chitosan/PVA aerogel because the presence of thiol groups (–SH) on the protein outer cell membrane attracts metallic ions, leading to damage to the bacterial membrane.98Another study by Batistaet al.investigated the antibacterial efficacy of alginate-chitosan aerogel fibres againstStaphylococcus aureusandKlebsiella pneumoniaeand compared them with Kaltostat's efficiency. Kaltostat is a calcium alginate-based wound dressing used for absorbing exudate and protecting wounds. The findings show that the alginate-chitosan aerogel fibres have a higher antibacterial activity than Kaltostat.99Panet al.developed an alginate/chitosan aerogel and assessed its antibacterial efficacy againstStaphylococcus aureusandEscherichia coli.The aerogel demonstrated significant antibacterial efficacy, owing to its porous structure that enables direct interaction with bacteria. This interaction happens eitherviachemical bonding between the active cites within the pores and bacterial cells, or through the physical entrapment of bacteria within the porous matrix.100Table 3illustrates different CS-based aerogels used for microorganism removal.

The growth of population and developments in healthcare technology are driving the escalation of pharmaceutical drug production and consumption. Nevertheless, untreated hospital and pharmaceutical effluents, along with insufficient pharmaceutical waste management, have resulted in the discharge of medications into the environment. Pharmaceutical residues are enduring pollutants that present a considerable threat to human health, even at acceptable doses, due to their high toxicity and low biodegradability.107Kimet al.synthesized a thermally-activated gelatin–chitosan aerogel and tested the removal efficiency toward ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX) with an initial concentration of 3 mg L−1and pH = 6. The results showed that the removal efficiency was 99.28% for IBP and 96.39% for NPX.108In another study, Ravi and his co-workers prepared covalent organic polymers (COPs)/chitosan multifunctional aerogels and examined their removal ability against diclofenac sodium (DFS). The results showed that the aerogels exhibit effective (DFS) removal capabilities; nevertheless, their powdered nature renders them unsuitable for industrial use. For that, they developed an amine- and carboxyl group-rich aromatic COP (CCP-NH2)/chitosan aerogel and evaluated the adsorption ability to remove DFS from water. The findings indicate that the aerogel demonstrated a substantial surface area and mechanical strength, minimal density, remarkable stability in diverse solvents, and ease of processing into various forms. Furthermore, a substantial DFS adsorption capacity of 501 mg g−1.109Natáliaet al.prepared hydrophobic CS@CNC-HTA beads aerogel to solve the hydrophilicity issue; they investigated the adsorption capacity for removing sildenafil citrate and cetylpyridinium chloride in water. The findings demonstrated that the removal rate of sildenafil citrate was 86 mg g−1(73%), whereas it was 390 mg g−1(90%) for cetylpyridinium chloride 52. Recently, Keliet al.synthesized crosslinked chitosan aerogel using bifunctional aldehydes (glutaraldehyde) as cross-linking agent and examined the adsorption removal of ibuprofen from water. The results showed that the cross-linked chitosan aerogel has excellent adsorption ability to remove ibuprofen with 596 mg g−1adsorption capacity. The adsorption mechanism of ibuprofen onto chitosan aerogel is elucidated by the protonation of chitosan's amine groups (NH3+) under acidic conditions, resulting in a positively charged molecule. Ibuprofen includes carboxyl groups (–COOH) that can ionize, acquiring a negative charge (–COO−). Consequently, these attributes promote electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between the protonated amino groups of chitosan and the ionised carboxyl groups of ibuprofen. Moreover, van der Waals interactions facilitate the adsorption of ibuprofen onto the porous surfaces of the aerogel, particularly in regions of near molecular contact.110Balkiset al.synthesized chitosan/silica (CS/silica) aerogels characterized by high surface area and porosity and examined their adsorption efficacy for three pharmaceutical compounds at different silica weight ratios. The incorporation of silica markedly enhanced internal porosity and surface area, resulting in improved removal efficiency.111Many studies used different CS-based aerogels to remove various types of pharmaceuticals, as shown inTable 4.

Chitosan-based aerogels have garnered interest as sustainable and multifunctional materials for addressing diverse water pollutants, such as dyes, heavy metals, microbes, and pharmaceutical residues. Nevertheless, despite their potential, several significant restrictions persist. Their structural stability typically deteriorates in neutral and alkaline pH environments, adversely affecting both durability and reusability. A significant concern is that numerous studies conducted to date focus on single-pollutant systems in controlled batch environments, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of real wastewater streams. The development of aerogel formulations with improved chemical stability and the capability to target multiple contaminants is essential. Integrating chitosan aerogels into hybrid systems, such as membrane technologies or catalytic platforms, may improve their operational efficacy. Furthermore, incorporating studies on virus elimination could enhance their environmental and medicinal significance. The ultimate goal of future initiatives continues to be bridging the gap between successful laboratory experiments and real-world application.

Recent advancements in application of chitosan-based aerogel adsorbents demonstrate their potential as environmentally friendly, efficient, and biodegradable materials for the removal of various contaminants, including dyes, heavy metals, microorganisms, and pharmaceutical waste ions, which are detrimental to aquatic ecosystems and living organisms. Furthermore, chitosan-based aerogel possesses a high number of –NH2and –OH groups, acting as binding sites for the removal of these contaminant ionsviaelectrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, or chelation. However, it exhibits some drawbacks, such as poor mechanical strength, dense structure, hydrophilicity, and lower porosity, which could affect the adsorption capacity. These issues have been solved using different techniques like blending with nanofillers, chemical and/or ionic cross-linkers, and designing composite aerogels. The modified chitosan aerogel exhibits remarkable adsorption capabilities toward different types of dyes, heavy metals, microorganisms, and pharmaceutical ions due to the abundance of –NH2groups that exist on the aerogel surface. Many factors affect adsorption performance, among them pH. For instance, at acidic conditions, the –NH2groups are protonated, making the aerogel positively charged, which binds with the negative charge of contaminant ions by electrostatic interaction. Meanwhile, in alkaline conditions, the –NH2groups deprotonated, leading to the aerogel having a negative charge, causing it to bind electrostatically with the positive charge of contaminant ions. Also, the modified aerogel presented excellent antibacterial activity not only by adsorbing the microorganisms but even by eliminating them, making it a promising candidate in biomedical applications.
