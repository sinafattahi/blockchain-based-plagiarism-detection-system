Microalgae are promising sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel production. Among the primary carbon reservoirs in microalgae, starch and lipids are the main targets for metabolic engineering aimed at enhancing productivity. Redirecting carbon flux from starch toward lipid biosynthesis has been considered an effective strategy to improve lipid yield, and manipulating upstream regulators may allow broader control over metabolic networks. DYRKP1, a plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase conserved in photosynthetic eukaryotes, has been implicated in regulating intracellular carbon partitioning. In this study, we investigated the physiological and metabolic effects of DYRKP1 deficiency in a cell-wall-less strain ofChlamydomonas reinhardtii. To further enhance lipid accumulation, we additionally knocked out ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP), a key enzyme involved in starch biosynthesis. The total fatty acid content ofDYRKP1-AGPdouble knockout (dKO) mutants was higher than that of their parental strain (CC4349) under both nitrogen-replete and deplete conditions, and was even 1.2-fold higher than that of theAGPsingle knockout (agp) mutant under nitrogen-deplete conditions. TheDYRKP1single knockout mutants exhibited fatty acid composition similar to the parental strain, regardless of nitrogen depletion. The fatty acid composition of thedKOmutants resembled that of theagpmutant under nitrogen-replete conditions, but diverged upon nitrogen starvation, suggesting a conditional interaction between upstream regulation and metabolic flux. This finding implies that disrupting upstream regulators like DYRKP1 may offer limited additional benefit when key downstream bottlenecks, such as starch biosynthesis, are already removed. Overall, our study underscores the layered complexity of carbon partitioning inC. reinhardtiiand the importance of context-dependent metabolic regulation in optimizing lipid production.

Microalgae have the remarkable ability to convert CO2or organic carbon in the culture medium into industrially valuable bioproducts such as lipids, starches, and proteins [1]. Owing to their photosynthetic capacity and carbon fixation potential, microalgae are considered a promising bio-feedstock for sustainable industrial applications [2]. In this context, extensive research has been dedicated to producing biofuels from microalgal biomass [2–4], with growing societal demand for sustainable aviation fuels further underscoring the importance of such efforts [5].

Recent advances in genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have enabled targeted metabolic engineering to optimize carbon flux toward desired bioproducts [1]. A widely adopted strategy involves repressing metabolic pathways that compete with lipid biosynthesis for carbon allocation. For instance, suppression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP), a key enzyme in starch metabolism, has been shown to increase lipid content by up to 81% in the model green microalgaChlamydomonas reinhardtii[6]. Meanwhile, direct manipulation of lipid metabolism has also been extensively explored through overexpression of lipid biosynthetic enzymes [7,8] and inhibition of lipases responsible for lipid degradation [9,10]. More recently, the focus has shifted to upstream regulators, such as transcription factors, which can be involved in broader metabolic changes [11,12]. For instance, the overexpression of bZIP1 and MYB1 transcription factors enhanced lipid accumulation in microalgae [13,14]. These studies suggest that modulating upstream regulatory elements may be an effective strategy for enhancing lipid accumulation in microalgae.

The plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRKP) has been implicated in the regulation of intracellular carbon metabolism [15,16]. InC. reinhardtii, a knockout mutant ofDYRKP1(Cre07.g337300) in a cell-walled strain exhibited significant starch accumulation under nitrogen depletion when cells were grown in autotrophic conditions with a 2% CO2supply [15]. This phenotype was proposed to be linked to increased photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II due to an elevated capacity for electron dissipation [15]. Similarly, in the unicellular microalgaEuglena gracilis, knockdown of DYRKP homologs markedly delayed cell growth but led to substantial accumulation of wax esters under anaerobic conditions [16]. Under aerobic conditions, increased levels of paramylon (a storage polysaccharide) further supported the association between DYRKP homologs and intracellular carbon metabolism, particularly starch metabolism [16]. Phosphoproteomic analysis inC. reinhardtiirevealed a 2.1-fold increase in phosphorylation at Ser76 of DYRKP1 from 24 to 72 h of nitrogen depletion [17], suggesting that nitrogen-deficient stress induces phosphorylation of DYRKP1, potentially leading to rapid shifts in carbon partitioning. These results collectively indicate that repression ofDYRKP1could be an effective strategy to enhance starch accumulation in microalgae.

Based on this, we hypothesized that a double knockout ofDYRKP1andAGPcould maximize lipid accumulation by diverting excess starch, induced byDYRKP1knockout, into lipid biosynthesis. However,DYRKP1deficiency impairs degradation of cell wall glycoproteins, forming multicellular structures [18] that hinder accurate normalization of starch and lipid contents by cell number. To overcome this, we investigated nitrogen-deplete responses under the culture conditions tested in the previous work (autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions) using adyrkp1mutant generated in a cell-wall-lessC. reinhardtiibackground, to assess their potential for improved lipid accumulation.

Three independentdyrkp1mutants (dyrkp1-1,dyrkp1-2, anddyrkp1-3), generated fromChlamydomonas reinhardtiiCC4349 (cw15, mt⁺), were previously constructed and genotyped in our previous study [18]. In addition, thedyrkp1mutant obtained from the cell-walled strain 137AH was kindly provided by Gilles Peltier and Yonghua Li-Beisson [15]. Cells were cultured under mixotrophic or autotrophic conditions using Tris-acetate phosphate (TAP) medium or MOPS-buffered minimal medium (MM-MOPS), respectively [19]. Cells were grown in 100 mL flasks containing 20 mL of medium, maintained at 25 ± 1 °C with continuous shaking (120 rpm) under constant light irradiation (80 ± 10 µmol photons m− 2s− 1).

To generate the double knockout (dKO) mutant ofDYRKP1andAGP, the AGP small subunit gene (Cre03.g188250) was disrupted in thedyrkp1-1mutant background using a CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, following the protocol previously described [20]. The sgRNA target was designed using Cas-Designer (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-designer) and selected in the range of 5’UTR and 1st exon (5′-TAGCATGGCCCTGAAGA.

TGCGGG-3′). To help with mutant screening, we combined the insertion and expression of the paromomycin resistance (ParR) gene cassette. A total of 100 µg of purified Cas9 protein (Cas9 expression plasmid: pET-NLS-Cas9-6xHis (Plasmid #62934)) and 70 µg of sgRNA synthesized using the GeneArt™ Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) were mixed to form the RNP complex and co-transformed with theParRgene cassette. After transformation, cells were plated on a TAP medium containing 1.5% agar and 25 µg/mL of paromomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, United States). To screendKOmutants, colonies grown onto the selection plate were confirmed by genomic PCR using the target-specific primer sets (forward: 5′-TGGGCACGACTTGCATTGTGT-3,’ reverse: 5′- AATGGGCCAGCGCGAG.

CATA-3′). The PCR products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea).

All the cell lines were adapted to autotrophic (MM-MOPS, 2% CO2) or mixotrophic (TAP, air) conditions for one week before starting the growth measurement. The cell was inoculated to make an initial cell number of 0.2 million cells. The cells were manually counted using Neubauer Counting chambers (Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) on the light microscope (ECLIPSE Ni; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) during the experiment.

For starch extraction, 1 mL of culture was collected in a 2 mL screw cap tube and centrifuged at 15,000×gfor 2 min. The pellet was completely dried after pigment extraction using 1 mL of methanol. The sample tube was filled with 0.4 mL of distilled water and autoclaved for 15 min at 120 °C to solubilize starch. Then, starch was digested to glucose by 0.2 mL of amyloglucosidase solution (Starch Assay Reagent; Sigma-Aldrich), and glucose concentration (µg mL− 1) was assayed using an automated sugar analyzer (model 2700 select; YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). The measured glucose concentration was normalized by cell number (106cells mL− 1) of particle volume (mm3mL− 1) in each sample.

Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a Dual Pam-100 (Heinz Walz, Germany). Cells were placed into a cuvette under constant stirring at room temperature and were dark-adapted for 15 min before measurements. Light curves were recorded by increasing stepwise (3 min per step) the light intensity (0, 25, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 950 µmol photons m− 2s− 1). Saturating flashes (10,000 µmol photons m− 2s− 1, 200 ms duration) were applied to determine PSII yield [21].

For lipid extraction and esterification, 20 million cells were harvested in a 2 mL screw cap tube by centrifugation (15,000×g, 5 min, 20 °C). The sample tube was filled with 0.9 mL of acetyl chloride: methanol solution (5:100 (v/v)), 0.1 mL of methyl heptadecanoate (C17:0, internal standard; 3 mg mL− 1dissolved in hexane), and glass micro-beads (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Then, the sample tube was vortexed vigorously for 2 min, and incubated for 1 h at 80 °C with gentle mixing (200 rpm). After chilling for 5 min on the ice, 1 mL of n-hexane was added, and the separated supernatant was transferred to a GC glass vial.

Total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed using a gas chromatograph GC2400 (PerkinElmer, MA, USA). Instrumental parameters for GC-FID analysis of FAMEs were set following the protocol described in the reference paper [22]. FAME species were identified based on the peak retention times of the reference standard (Supelco 37-component FAME mix; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and were quantified based on the peak area compared to the internal standard.

Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels inC. reinhardtiiwere measured using the DCFH-DA (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) fluorescence assay [19]. To exclude interference from extracellular substances, approximately 2 mL of algal culture was harvested by centrifugation (15,000×g, 5 min, 20 °C), and the cell pellet was resuspended in fresh TAP medium containing 5 µM DCFH-DA (Invitrogen, MA, USA). The cells were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA was measured using the Guava HT Flow Cytometer (Millipore, MA, USA). For analysis, approximately 200,000 cells were acquired per sample. A fluorescence window was established by comparing it with a negative control to isolate the DCFH-DA-positive population, and the mean fluorescence intensity was determined. The excitation and emission wavelengths for DCFH-DA detection were 488 nm and 525/30 nm, respectively.

Data related to ROS scavenging were collected from RNA-seq and pellet proteome data of the cell-walled strains: the 137AH strain and thedyrkp1mutant (137AH background). The transcriptome data (BioProject: PRJNA1042620) and pellet proteome data (PRIDE: PXD047255) used in this study were produced using the cells cultured under autotrophic conditions with a 2% CO2supply, and the analysis parameters of the data were described in our previous study [18].

All the experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates. Data were statistically analyzed using the Student’s t-test, and are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Significant differences with a significance level of 95% (p< 0.05) are clearly indicated in the figure legends for each figure.

To enable normalization by cell number, we selected three independentdyrkp1mutants (dyrkp1-1,dyrkp1-2, anddyrkp1-3) generated from the cell-wall-lessC. reinhardtiibackground, CC4349 (parental strain). These correspond to mutants previously designated asdyrkp1-7,dyrkp1-8, anddyrkp1-9[18]. In the previous study, thedyrkp1mutant generated from the cell-walled background (137AH strain), exhibited elevated starch accumulation and enhanced photosynthetic performance following nitrogen depletion [15]. These phenotypes may vary depending on the presence or absence of the cell wall. To determine whether DYRKP1 plays a role in starch accumulation regardless of the presence of the cell wall, we examined starch accumulation and the effective quantum yield of Photosystem II under autotrophic conditions with 2% CO2and mixotrophic conditions supplemented with acetate.

Cells were initially cultured in a nitrogen sufficient medium for two days and subsequently exposed to nitrogen depletion (Fig.1A). Under autotrophic conditions, the starch content ofdyrkp1mutants was significantly lower than that of their parental strain after nitrogen depletion (Fig.1B). Meanwhile, in mixotrophic conditions, the starch content of thedyrkp1mutants was significantly higher than those of the parental strain before and after nitrogen depletion, respectively (Fig.1B). Nevertheless, the photosynthetic parameter of photosystem II (Y(II)) did not differ significantly before and after nitrogen depletion (Fig.1C).

To assess lipid accumulation, we conducted FAME analysis under mixotrophic conditions. Alldyrkp1mutants showed elevated total fatty acid (TFA) content even before the onset of nitrogen depletion (Fig.2A), and further increased TFA content (25–40% higher than CC4349) was observed after nitrogen depletion (Fig.2B). Before nitrogen depletion, the fatty acid composition was largely comparable across strains (Fig.2C); however, after nitrogen depletion, several fatty acid species, particularly C16:0 and C18:2 cis (n6), showed significantly higher accumulation in thedyrkp1mutants relative to the CC4349 strain (Fig.2D). Despite these increases, the overall fatty acid composition did not differ markedly between CC4349 strain and thedyrkp1mutants across the nitrogen depletion (Fig. S1).

Given that thedyrkp1mutants exhibit enhanced starch and lipid accumulation, we hypothesized that the combined knockout of DYRKP1 and AGP might further improve lipid accumulation by redirecting carbon flux from starch to the lipid pathway. To test this, we knocked out the AGP small subunit gene in thedyrkp1-1mutant background, which exhibited the highest starch accumulation under mixotrophic conditions. Transformation was performed using an RNP complex consisting of sgRNA and Cas9 protein targeting the first exon ofAGP(Fig.3A). Colonies were selected on the TAP agar plate containing paromomycin, and successful insertions of the resistance cassette were identified through colony PCR. Three AGP-knockout mutants were confirmed by gDNA PCR (Fig.3B), and Sanger sequencing (Fig.3C), and designated asdKO #1,dKO #2, anddKO #3.

Under mixotrophic conditions, the CC4349 strain and theagpmutant exhibited similar growth. In contrast, both thedyrkp1-1mutant anddKOmutants showed significantly reduced growth (Fig.4A). To assess starch accumulation, cell cultures were stained with Lugol’s iodine solution after nitrogen depletion. The cell cultures of the CC4349 strain and thedyrkp1-1mutant were stained, but theagpmutant anddKOmutants were not stained (Fig.4B). This indicates that starch accumulates in the CC4349 strain and thedyrkp1-1mutant, but not in theagpmutant anddKOmutants, which is consistent with the quantitative analysis results of starch (Fig.4C).

We then compared the lipid contents of the double knockout mutants with those of the single knockout mutants under mixotrophic conditions, where thedyrkp1mutants showed higher starch contents than their parental strain (Fig.1). In nitrogen-replete conditions, the TFA content indKOmutants was more than 3-fold higher than that of thedyrkp1mutant and similar to that of theagpmutant (Fig.5A). This trend remained the same after nitrogen depletion, and thedKOmutants even showed a 1.2-fold higher TFA content than theagpmutant; only thedKO #1mutant showed significantly higher TFA contents than theagpmutant (Fig.5B). The FAME species analysis of theagpanddKOmutants before nitrogen depletion showed that both of them had higher contents of C16:0 and C18:0, C18:1 cis(n9), C18:2 cis(n6), and C18:3n3 than CC4349 strain (Fig.5C). TheagpanddKOmutants showed high proportions of C16:0 and C18:0 in the fatty acid composition, whereas the proportions of C18:2 cis (n6), C18:3n6, and C18:3n3 were reduced (Fig. S2). Under nitrogen-replete conditions, theagpanddKOmutants had similar proportions of their overall fatty acid composition, but this similarity was not confirmed under nitrogen-deplete conditions (Fig. S2). ThedKO #1anddKO #2mutants had significantly higher C16:0 than theagpmutant, whiledKO #3had significantly lower C16:0. And C18:1 trans (n9) was higher in alldKOmutants than in theagpmutant, while C18:2 cis (n6) and C18:3n3 were lower in alldKOmutants than in theagpmutant. Consistent with this trend, in the per cell quantitative results of FAME species, C16:0 and C18:0, C18:1 trans (n9) ofdKO #1anddKO #2were significantly higher than those of theagpmutant (Fig.5D).

In this study, we analyzed the physiological characteristics and metabolic changes associated with DYRKP1 deficiency in the cell-wall-less strain, after minimizing the physical effects of palmelloid structures that were previously observed in thedyrkp1mutants [15,18]. Thedyrkp1knockout mutants accumulated more lipid under mixotrophic conditions, consistent with previous observations linking DYRKP1 deficiency to altered carbon partitioning [15]. To further enhance lipid accumulation, we additionally knocked outAGP, a key enzyme involved in starch biosynthesis [23]. Under nitrogen-depletion, theDYRKP1-AGPdouble knockout (dKO) mutants exhibited 2.4-fold and 1.2-fold higher TFA content compared to their parental strain (CC4349) and theagpmutant, respectively. However, considering the dramatic starch accumulation in thedyrkp1mutant observed in a previous study [15], the consequences of reallocation of carbon flux toward lipid metabolism through the double knockout ofDYRKP1andAGPwere less dramatic. These results underscore the complexity of metabolic regulation, where upstream genetic modifications do not always have synergetic effects due to the multilayered controls in carbon flux and feedback-regulated networks [3,24].

The absence of dramatic increases in lipid accumulation may be related to the unexpectedly low increase in starch accumulation due toDYRKP1knockout. In the case of the cell-walled strain 137AH, thedyrkp1mutant accumulated 1.8–2.5 times more starch after nitrogen depletion under autotrophic conditions and approximately 4 times more starch even before nitrogen depletion (Fig. S3A). In contrast, thedyrkp1mutants generated from the cell-wall-less strain (CC4349) showed lower starch content per cell than the parental strain under the same conditions (Fig.1B), and no significant difference in starch content per particle volume (Fig. S3A). While these results cannot be directly compared due to impaired cell wall degradation in 137AH [18], the undigested parental cell wall may have affected intracellular metabolism.

ROS-related measurements further support these speculations. DCFH-DA fluorescence analysis revealed that the 137AH strain exhibited stronger ROS signals than the CC4349 strain, with thedyrkp1mutant of the 137AH strain showing a markedly higher signal than its parental line. In contrast, thedyrkp1mutants from the CC4349 strain did not differ significantly from their parent strain (Fig. S3B). Although the loss of intracellular ROS during medium replacement in the cell-wall-less background cannot be excluded, the high ROS levels in thedyrkp1mutant of the 137AH strain suggest that DYRKP1 deficiency may cause oxidative stress. Indeed, transcriptome analysis detected increased expression of ROS scavenging enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and Mn superoxide dismutase) in thedyrkp1mutant compared to the 137AH strain, as well as an increase in protein content (catalase and Mn superoxide dismutase) (Figures S3C and S3D). Given that cells have been reported to increase the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes in response to increased ROS [25–28], thedyrkp1mutant (137AH background) appears to have already been under high levels of ROS stress. ROS is known to induce starch and lipid accumulation in cells [29,30], which explains the relationship between high ROS levels and starch accumulation in thedyrkp1mutant (137AH background). Another possible explanation is that daughter cells trapped within an undigested parental cell wall in 137AH experience spatial restriction, impairing nutrient uptake and carbon utilization. Consequently, excess carbon may be stored as starch. Therefore, the starch accumulation observed in thedyrkp1mutant (137AH background) could be attributed to oxidative stress or unutilized carbon surplus, although further research is needed to confirm the precise mechanisms.

Knockout ofDYRKP1andAGPdid not significantly increase lipid production compared to a singleAGPknockout, a limitation often reported in algal biotechnology. Comprehensive metabolic engineering strategies, along with manipulation of nutrient signaling, can be a promising solution. For example, in the oleaginous yeastYarrowia lipolytica, coordinated rewiring of central carbon metabolism, enhancement of acetyl-CoA supply, and disruption of competing pathways have led to lipid contents exceeding 60% of dry cell weight [31–33]. Similarly, in microalgae such asC. reinhardtii,Nannochloropsisspecies, andPhaeodactylum tricornutum, overexpression of key enzymes in lipid biosynthesis combined with manipulation of nutrient signals has significantly enhanced triacylglycerol production [1,34–36]. Even in cyanobacteria likeSynechocystisspecies, similar approaches have enabled redirection of carbon flux toward fatty acid synthesis [37]. These successes highlight that substantial lipid enhancement often requires a systems-level strategy involving multi-gene regulation, pathway balancing, and environmental tuning. Therefore, to achieve higher lipid yields, future work should focus on integrated approaches that combine transcriptomic, proteomics, metabolomic, and carbon flux data to identify key nodes of regulation. Additionally, implementing CRISPR-based multiplex editing or inducible gene circuits targeting upstream regulators such as DYRKP1 could offer more precise and tunable control over carbon partitioning.
