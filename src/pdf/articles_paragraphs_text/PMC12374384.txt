To assess the prognostic relevance of androgen receptor (AR) expression in patients following modified radical surgery for invasive breast cancer.

A cohort of 515 patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer from July 2016 to November 2017 was analyzed. Immunohistochemistry was employed to determine the expression levels of AR, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), cell proliferation nuclear antigen (Ki-67), oncogene (P-53), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), topoisomerase-2 (TOPO-2), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The correlation between AR expression and clinicopathological features as well as prognosis was examined. Multifactorial analysis using Cox proportional risk regression identified independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS), and a nomogram model was developed based on these factors.

AR expression holds varying prognostic implications across different breast cancer subtypes, with AR positivity indicating a favorable prognosis, particularly in ER-positive tumors.

Breast cancer stands as the most prevalent malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1]. Within China, the incidence of breast cancer has been on the rise annually, with approximately 300,000 women diagnosed each year [2]. Despite advancements in early diagnostic technologies, 5% to 10% of patients still present with distant metastasis at diagnosis [3]. Current standard chemotherapy and hormonal treatments yield limited reduction in recurrence and metastasis, contributing to the demise of 90% of patients with breast cancer [4–6]. Therefore, amidst the escalating incidence and mortality rates, it is imperative to identify more reliable breast cancer-related prognostic markers and novel treatment modalities.

The primary risk factors for breast cancer encompass lifestyle, diet, hormones, age, gender, race, and genetic predispositions. Among them, steroid hormone receptors and their coactivators significantly influence breast cancer pathogenesis [7,8]. Therefore, breast cancer is widely acknowledged as a hormone-dependent tumor [9]. The estrogen receptor (ER) holds relevance in breast cancer, with estrogen significantly promoting tumor growth through ER binding [10]. Approximately 70% of patients with breast cancer express ER and may benefit from antiestrogen therapy [11]. Androgen receptor (AR), another steroid hormone receptor and a member of the nuclear receptor family alongside ER and progesterone receptor (PR), also plays a pivotal role in breast cancer carcinogenesis. AR exhibits broader expression than ER and PR [12], and similar to other steroid hormone receptors, it resides in the cytoplasm in the absence of androgens, forming complexes with heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones like immunophilin [13]. After activation by androgens, AR dissociates from heat shock proteins, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to androgen response elements near target genes, modulating DNA transcription [14]. AR dimers can both positively and negatively regulate gene transcription, influencing tumor cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis [15].

AR has emerged as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment [16]. Despite efforts to explore AR’s prognostic role, results remain controversial. The recent research highlights crosstalk between the AR pathway and ER, HER-2, as well as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK, and WNT/β-Catenin signaling pathways, with AR exerting differential effects across breast cancer subtypes [17]. When considering the high heterogeneity of breast cancer at the clinical and molecular levels, researchers hypothesize that the prognostic effect of AR on breast cancer is closely related to breast cancer classification, although subgroup analyses have yielded inconclusive results [18–22]. Further investigation is warranted to ascertain AR’s role across breast cancer subtypes and solidify its status as a valuable prognostic biomarker.

Recently, comprehensive treatment incorporating surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, and endocrine therapy has become standard, substantially improving patient survival rates [23]. Among them, endocrine therapy constitutes a cornerstone of breast cancer treatment, significantly enhancing patient survival outcomes [24]. In ER-positive breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with competitive antagonists like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, which impede androgen conversion to estrogen, often proves efficacious in inhibiting disease progression [25]. However, approximately half of patients with ER-positive breast cancer eventually develop endocrine resistance, posing a major clinical challenge [26]. DeAmicis et al. [27] first reported that in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and animal models, high AR expression was correlated to tamoxifen treatment resistance, whereas the AR inhibitor bicalutamide sensitized tumors to tamoxifen. A study involving 192 patients with ER-positive primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen concluded that when the AR/ER ratio exceeds 2, tamoxifen resistance significantly increases, leading to poor prognosis [28], suggesting that this ratio is related to the prognosis of ER-positive breast cancer.

Currently, the prognostic impact of AR on breast cancer subgroups is still unclear, with limited studies investigating the AR/ER ratio as a prognostic indicator for ER-positive breast cancer. Further validation of its predictive role is warranted. This study retrospectively investigates 515 female patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer post-modified radical surgery. Stratified by ER and HER-2, patients were categorized into ER(−)/HER-2(−), ER(−)/HER-2(+), ER(+)/HER-2(−), and ER(+)/HER-2(+) groups to explore the AR expression and its prognostic significance across breast cancer subtypes. In addition, we speculate on AR’s potential as an effective target for breast cancer treatment, advocating personalized molecular-level interventions alongside standard therapies to innovate breast cancer treatment strategies.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 515 female patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy and received postoperative pathological confirmation of invasive breast cancer from July 1, 2017, to November 30, 2018. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University approved this study. The deadline for follow-up is November 30, 2023.

Inclusion criteria: (1) Female patients with an initial diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer; (2) Pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer post-modified radical resection; (3) Availability of relatively complete clinical and pathological data; (4) Absence of distant metastasis based on the imaging evaluation; (5) Absence of significant systemic diseases affecting the heart, liver, kidney or other organs. Exclusion criteria: (1) Male breast cancer; (2) Bilateral breast cancer; (3) Occult breast cancer; (4) Prior neoadjuvant treatment; (5) Presence of significant systemic diseases affecting the heart, liver, kidney, or other organs; (6) Coexistence of other malignant tumors at initial diagnosis; (7) Palliative surgery or breast-conserving surgery; (8) Loss to follow-up.

All invasive breast cancer specimens underwent immunohistochemical staining, adhering to the kit instructions. Staining results were independently interpreted by two pathologists. The immunohistochemistry process was as follows: (1) Dewaxing: Paraffin sections were sequentially immersed in dewaxing solution I (15 min), dewaxing solution II (15 min), and dewaxing solution III (15 min), followed by immersion in absolute ethanol I and II for 5 min each, 85% alcohol for 5 min, and 75% alcohol for 5 min, then rinsed with distilled water. (2) Antigen retrieval: Tissue sections were placed in a repair box containing EDTA antigen retrieval buffer (pH 9.0) and subjected to microwave heating: 8 min at medium heat, 8 min without heat, then 7 min at medium–low heat. During this period, care was taken to avoid excessive evaporation of the buffer and drying of the slices. Following natural cooling, the slides were rinsed thrice with PBS (pH 7.4) on a shaking platform for 5 min each time. (3) Endogenous peroxidase blocking: The section was incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 25 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by thrice washing for 5-min each time with PBS (pH 7.4) on a decolorizing shaking platform. (4) Serum blocking: Tissue was covered with 3% BSA and blocked at room temperature for 30 min. (5) Primary antibody incubation: After gently shaking off the blocking solution, the primary antibody prepared in PBS was added to the sections, followed by overnight incubation at 4℃ in a humidified chamber. Moreover, an appropriate amount of water was added to the wet box to prevent the antibody from evaporating. (6) Secondary antibody incubation: Sections were washed thrice with PBS (pH 7.4) on a shaking platform for 5 min each, then incubated with an HRP-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 50 min. (7) DAB color development: After washing thrice with PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min each time, sections were incubated with freshly prepared DAB chromogenic solution, which was added dropwise into the circle. A microscope was used to control the color development time. Positive results appeared brown under microscopy. Color development was stopped by rinsing with water. (8) Nuclei counterstaining: Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 3 min, washed with water, differentiated with hematoxylin differentiation solution for a few seconds, rinsed again with water, returned to blue with hematoxylin blue-returning solution, and finally washed with running water. (9) Dehydration and mounting: Place the slices in 75% alcohol (5 min) – 85% alcohol (5 min) – absolute ethanol I (5 min)—absolute ethanol II (5 min)—n-butanol (5 min) – Dehydrate and become transparent in xylene I (5 min). Take the sections out of xylene to dry slightly and seal them with mounting glue. (10) Microscopic examination, image collection, and analysis.

AR, P53, TOPO-II status judgment criteria: The entire section was evaluated. The presence of dark brown particles in tumor cell nuclear staining denotes positive cells. When positive cells comprise ≥ 10%, AR, P53, and TOPO-II were categorized as positive (+). PR and ER status determination criteria: The entire section was evaluated. Brown-yellow particles in tumor cell nuclei denoted positive cells. Positive PR and ER status was affirmed when positive cells were ≥ 1%. CK5/6 status determination criteria: The entire section was evaluated. Yellow or brown granular staining in tumor cytoplasm indicated positive cells. When the number of positive cells was ≥ 10%, CK5/6 was determined to be positive (+). EGFR status determination criteria: The entire section was evaluated. Clear brown-yellow particles on the tumor cell membrane denoted positive cells. When the number of positive cells was ≥ 10%, EGFR positivity (+) was confirmed. HER-2 status judgment criteria: (1) 0: No staining or ≤ 10% of infiltrating cancer cells exhibit light and incomplete cell membrane staining; (2) 1 + : > 10% of infiltrating cancer cells show light and incomplete staining; (3) 2 + : > 10% of infiltrating cancer cells display weak-moderate intensity of complete cell membrane staining, or ≤ 10% of infiltrating cancer cells exhibit strong and complete cell membrane staining; (4) 3 + : > 10% of infiltrating cancer cells demonstrate strong, complete, and uniform cell membrane staining. A result of 3 + in immunohistochemistry or 2 + with amplification in in situ hybridization FISH testing was deemed positive (+), while the absence of amplification rendered it negative (−). When immunohistochemistry yields 1 + or 0, it is categorized as negative (−). Ki-67 status determination standard: The percentage of positively stained nuclei in cancer cells was reported. For tumor cells with a relatively even positive cell distribution, the average Ki-67 index was calculated from three or more randomly selected invasive cancer high-power fields. If uneven positive distribution was observed, evaluation was conducted in the positive cell hotspot area across three or more high-power fields of invasive cancer. In this study, when ≥ 14% of tumor cell nuclei stained brown, Ki-67 expression was judged high (+).

The primary outcome measure is disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the duration from the first day after surgery to tumor recurrence or metastasis.

Statistical analyses were performed using R 4.2.0 software. Categorical data were presented as counts and percentages. Median DFS was estimated utilizing the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted, with variables exhibitingP< 0.05 in the univariate analysis included in the multivariate analysis to identify independent prognostic factors for DFS. A nomogram prediction model was constructed using independent prognostic factors derived from multivariate analysis of DFS, validated at 1, 3, and 5 years, and compared against actual outcomes. All significance tests were two-sided, withP< 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance.

Among 515 female patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer who underwent modified radical resection, complete data were available for most pathological parameters, except for TOPO-II data in 13 patients, P-53 data in 3 patients, CK5/6 data in 3 patients. AR positivity, defined as ≥ 10% of tumor cell nuclei staining dark brown, was observed in 83.3% (429/515) of cases. Notably, AR positivity rates were significantly higher in ER-positive tumors 333 (77.62%) as compared to ER-negative tumors 96 (22.38%), and in PR-positive tumors 316 (73.66%) as compared to PR-negative tumors 113 (26.34%) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the AR-positive rate of CK5/6-positive tumors was 67 (15.73%) which was significantly lower than the AR-positive rate of CK5/6-negative breast cancer tumors 359 (84.27%) (P< 0.001). The AR-positive rate of EGFR-positive patients was 91 (21.36%) whereas those with EGFR-negative breast cancer exhibited 335 (78.64%) (P< 0.001). The AR-positive rate of TOPO-II positive patients was 290 (69.71%), which was significantly higher than the AR-positive rate of TOPO-II negative patients with breast cancer 126 (30.29%) (P= 0.004). Patients in the AR-positive group were different from those in the AR-negative group in terms of age, tumor size, menstrual status, Histological grading, lymph node metastasis, tumor thrombus presence, nerve or vessel invasion, HER-2, Ki-67, and P-53 expressions was no significant difference between the patient groups (P> 0.05).In terms of histological subtypes, five cases of apocrine carcinoma were identified, all within the AR-positive group (1.17%). Invasive ductal carcinoma was more prevalent in the AR-positive group (93.01%) than in the AR-negative group (88.37%), whereas no clear trend in distribution was observed for invasive lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, or other special subtypes between the two groups (P= 0.119) (Table1).

A total of 515 cases of female unilateral invasive breast cancer were analyzed for DFS. DFS curve analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in prognosis between the two groups (P= 0.093) (Fig.1).

The 515 female patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer patients were divided into four subgroups based on ER and HER-2 expression: ER(−)/HER-2(−), ER−)/HER-2(+), ER(+)/HER-2(−), and ER(+)/HER-2(+). Among them, the positive expression rate of AR in the ER(−)/HER-2(−) group was 28 (6.53%), 68 (15.85%) in the ER(+)/HER-2(−) group, 257 (59.91%) in the ER(+)/HER-2(+) group, and 76 (17.72%) in the ER(-)/HER-2(+) group, with the difference being statistically significant (χ2= 128.970,P< 0.001) (Fig.2) (Table2).

In the ER(+)/HER-2(−) invasive breast cancer cohort, the 5-year DFS rate of patients in the AR-positive group was 86.8%, while that in the AR-negative group was 64.7%. Comparative analysis of the DFS curves revealed a significantly better prognosis in the AR-positive group as compared to the AR-negative group (Log Rank testP= 0.009) (Fig.3).

In ER(+)/HER-2(+) invasive breast cancer, the 5-year DFS rate of patients in the AR-positive group was 91.5%, which was significantly higher than the patients in the AR-negative group (57.1%). DFS curve analysis demonstrated a significantly better prognosis in the AR-positive group as compared to the AR-negative group, with a statistical difference in the survival curves (P= 0.027) (Fig.4).

In ER(−)/HER-2(+) invasive breast cancer, the 5-year DFS rate was 76.5% in the AR-positive group and 72.2% in the AR-negative. However, there was no statistical difference in the DFS curve between the two groups (Log Rank testP= 0.839) (Fig.5).

For ER(-)/HER-2(-) invasive breast cancer, the 5-year DFS rate was 64.3% in the AR-positive group and 75.0% in the AR-negative group. No statistically significant difference was observed in the DFS curves between the two groups (Log Rank testP= 0.398) (Fig.6).

To address the concern that survival analyses without adjuvant-therapy details may be incomplete, we performed Kaplan–Meier analyses within two subgroups: patients who received any adjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and/or targeted therapy) and those who did not.

Among nonrecipients, DFS did not differ significantly between AR-positive and AR-negative tumors (P= 0.104) (Fig.7A).

Among recipients, there was likewise no significant difference (P= 0.269) (Fig.7B).

To further clarify the impact of different expression levels of ER on survival, we classified ER into high ER expression (> 10%), low ER expression (1–10%), and ER negative according to the ASCO/CAP guidelines (2020)[29]. The results showed that 332 patients (64.5%) were highly expressed, 25 patients (4.9%) were expressed, and 158 patients (30.7%) were negative. Kaplan–Meier curve analysis showed that individuals with high expression of ER had a better prognosis, followed by those with low expression. Patients with negative ER had the worst prognosis, and the results were statistically significant (P< 0.05) (Fig.8).

When ≥ 10% of tumor cell nuclei are stained with dark brown granules, it is defined as AR-positive. Similarly, when ≥ 1% of tumor cell nuclei are stained with brown granules, it is defined as ER positivity. Among the 333 ER-positive and AR-positive patients with breast cancer, an AR/ER ratio was calculated, with 21 patients (4.1%) exhibiting AR/ER ≥ 2. Among the 333 patients, a total of 13 patients were lacking TOPO-II data; 2 patients, P-53 data; 3 patients, CK5/6 data; 2 patients, EGFR data. Patients with breast cancer exhibiting an AR/ER ratio ≥ 2 and AR/ER ratio < 2 had different ages, menstrual status, tumor size, regional lymph node metastasis, histological grade, tumor thrombus, nerve and vascular invasion, Ki-67 status,CK5/6, TOPO-II, and P-53 expression etc. were not statistically significant (P> 0.05) (Table3).

In the subset of 333 ER-positive and AR-positive patients with breast cancer, the 5-year DFS rate of patients with AR/ER ratio ≥ 2 was 61.9%, whereas that of those with AR/ER ratio < 2 was 88.5%. Comparison of the 5-year DFS curves of the two groups revealed a significantly better prognosis in the AR/ER ratio < 2 group compared to the AR/ER ratio ≥ 2 group (Log Rank testP< 0.001) (Fig.9).

After excluding patients with incomplete data, univariate analysis using the Cox regression risk model on 317 ER-positive and AR-positive patients with breast cancer identified AR/ER ratio [3.61(1.60–8.13)], histological classification [5.06(2.76–9.28)], and lymph node metastasis [3.17(1.68–5.96)] as prognostic factors (P< 0.05). In multivariate analysis, AR/ER ratio [3.42(1.50–7.77)], histological classification [4.14(2.23–7.67)], and lymph node metastasis [2.79(1.47–5.30)] were independent prognostic factors affecting DFS in patients with ER-positive/AR-positive invasive breast cancer (P< 0.05) (Table4). Utilizing these independent prognostic factors, nomogram prediction models for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year DFS (Fig.10). The C-index for the nomogram model training set was 0.7468, and for the validation set, it was 0.7205.

Patients were randomly assigned to the training dataset (n= 222) and internal validation dataset (n= 95) in a 7:3 ratio. The baseline characteristics of both datasets are shown in Table5. The AUCs for 1-year DFS in the training set and internal validation set were 0.753 and 0.877, respectively; for 3-year DFS, they were 0.799 and 0.976; and for 5-year DFS, they were 0.767 and 0.719, respectively (Fig.11A–9F). Subsequently, calibration curves for 1, 3, and 5 years showed that the model-predicted risk was consistent with the actual occurrence of risk (Fig.12A–10F).

In 2020, breast cancer surpassed lung cancer for the first time, becoming the most common cancer globally. With its high morbidity and mortality rates, it is also the primary health threat to women [30]. Molecular markers such as ER, PR, and HER-2 play pivotal roles in breast cancer prognosis and guide targeted and endocrine therapies. AR, akin to ER and PR as a steroid hormone receptor, exhibits high expression in breast cancer, garnering attention as a prognostic indicator and treatment target. However, the association between AR and breast cancer prognosis remains inconclusive, warranting further in-depth study.

The prevalence of AR-positive expression in patients with breast cancer varies greatly. A meta-analysis [31] reported AR-positive tumors in 28–84% of breast cancers, reflecting disparities possibly attributed to factors population, detection methods, and AR positivity definitions. This underscores differential AR expression across races, potentially linked to varying proportions of breast cancer molecular subtypes. At present, immunohistochemical method and AR mRNA expression measurement are mainly used to detect the expression of AR in breast cancer, of which immunohistochemical method is the most commonly used because of its economic applicability. In addition, most studies use a 10% threshold to define AR positivity, while a few studies use 1%, 5%, 35%, 45%, or 78% [18,32–35]. The detection method used in this study is the most commonly used immunohistochemical method, so we used the same commonly used 10% as the critical value for AR positivity [36]. However, some studies have reported that the positive expression rate of AR is mostly between 70 and 85% [37,38]. Herein, we statistically analyzed the clinicopathological data of 515 female patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer post-modified radical surgery, revealing an AR-positive rate of 83.3% (429/515), consistent with previous reports. Moreover, the positive rates of ER and PR were 69.3% (357/515) and 64.3% (331/515), respectively. The positive rate of AR was significantly higher than that of ER and PR, consistent with Bronte's study [37]. The expression status of AR correlates with certain clinicopathological parameters. Additionally, there were differences between the AR-positive group and the AR-negative group in terms of age, tumor size, menstrual status, lymph node metastasis, presence of tumor thrombus, nerve and vascular invasion, and expression of HER-2, Ki-67, and P-53; however, they were not statistically significant (P> 0.05). There was likewise no significant difference in AR expression status across histological subtypes. Apocrine carcinoma, recognized as a histological subtype with a relatively favorable prognosis, was observed in only five cases in this study, accounting for an extremely low proportion—consistent with its biological rarity. This minimal representation precludes any meaningful impact on the overall patient prognosis. Furthermore, survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier method demonstrated a significantly better prognosis in the AR-positive group as compared to the AR-negative group, underscoring AR’s potential prognostic value in breast (LogRank testP= 0.004).

Preclinical studies suggest AR’s mechanism of action is linked to ER and HER-2 expression status [17]. In this study, breast cancer was divided into four groups based on the ER and HER-2 expression for further investigation. In the ER (+)/HER-2(−), ER(+)/HER-2(+), ER(−)/HER-2(+), and ER(−)/HER-2(−) groups, the AR expression rates were 93.8%, 91.6%, 79.1%, and 38.9%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P< 0.001).

Lanzino et al. [39] found that in transiently transfected HeLa cells, the steroid receptor coactivator ARA70 binds to ERα when ERα: AR = 5:1; conversely, when ERα:AR = 1:5, ARA70 binds to AR, activating the AR signaling pathway and promoting cell proliferation. Thus, the AR/ER ratio reflects the crosstalk between these receptors. When AR is highly expressed and ERα is low, AR may promote cell proliferation instead of inhibiting estrogen-mediated breast cancer cell growth, underscoring the importance of the AR/ER ratio in breast cancer biology.

Subsequent research [28,40,41] has consistently suggested a worse prognosis for patients with a high AR/ER ratio, emphasizing its predictive role in ER-positive breast cancer prognosis.

This study calculates the AR/ER ratio for 317 patients with breast cancer who are ER positive and AR positive. Given that multiple studies have used ROC analysis to demonstrate that an AR/ER ratio of 2 is the optimal cutoff value [28,40], this study divided 333 patients into groups with AR/ER ratios ≥ 2 and AR/ER ratios < 2 to explore their relationship with clinical and pathological features. It revealed a high AR/ER ratio (≥ 2) in cases where HER-2 was positive, EGFR was positive, and PR was negative, with statistically significant differences (P< 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between patients with AR/ER ratio ≥ 2 and AR/ER ratio ≤ 2 in terms of age, menstrual status, tumor size, regional lymph node metastasis, histological grade, tumor thrombus, nerve and vessel invasion, and Ki-67, CK5/6, TOPO-II, and P-53 levels (P> 0.05). In addition, the 5-year DFS rate of patients with an AR/ER ratio ≥ 2 was significantly lower than that of the AR/ER ratio < 2 group (P< 0.05). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified histological type, AR/ER ratio, and lymph node metastasis as independent prognostic factors for DFS. A nomogram prediction model incorporating these independent risk factors illustrated histological classification’s greatest impact on DFS, with lymph node metastasis exerting the least impact on DFS. Additionally, we calculated the c-index and plotted a calibration curve to validate the nomogram prediction model. The C-index of the nomogram model training and validation sets were 0.7468 and 0.7205, respectively. Moreover, the calibration curve shows that our model agrees well with the actual observations, illustrating the reliability and accuracy of our model.

The AR/ER ratio emerges as a potential independent predictor of response to conventional endocrine therapies targeting estrogen and ER signaling pathways. While AR expression is generally associated with a favorable prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer, immunohistochemical assessment of AR and ER expression levels, especially the AR/ER ratio, can enhance prognostic prediction and therapeutic response to hormonal therapy in invasive breast cancer. The previous failure of AR antagonists in the treatment of breast cancer might stem from overlooking the unique significance of the AR/ER ratio in ER-positive breast cancer. Consequently, the AR/ER ratio introduced novel considerations for breast cancer therapy, especially in addressing endocrine resistance among ER-positive/AR-positive breast cancer patients with an AR/ER ratio ≥ 2, who might benefit from AR-targeted therapy.

As a retrospective study, the research results will be influenced by the accuracy and completeness of data collection. In addition, all specimens in this study were tested using immunohistochemistry, which has significant differences in sensitivity and specificity as compared to other detection methods, which may cause bias in the results. Notably, in the cohort of 317 ER-positive and AR-positive patients with breast cancer, HER-2 failed to emerge as a significant prognostic factor, likely attributable to the high proportion of anti-HER-2 treatment among included patients. Similarly, the significance of Ki-67 as a prognostic factor may stem from the small number of patients with low Ki-67 expression and the study’s utilization of 14% as the cutoff value; additionally, inter-reader variability in Ki-67 values underscores the need for meticulous evaluation in future studies [42,43].

Furthermore, apocrine breast carcinoma accounts for only about 1% of all breast cancers, and the five apocrine cases identified in our cohort were insufficient for a separate subgroup analysis. Detailed records of specific adjuvant systemic regimens (e.g., chemotherapy protocols, endocrine agents, or HER2-targeted therapies) were not uniformly available; therefore, we could only stratify outcomes by “any” versus “no” adjuvant treatment, which limits the precision of prognostic interpretations. Lastly, the study population was limited to patients who underwent upfront modified radical mastectomy without neoadjuvant therapy; thus, whether our findings can be generalized to patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy or breast-conserving surgery requires further validation. Future investigations should also explore the differential efficacy of anti-AR therapies across distinct AR-positive breast cancer subtypes.

This study suggests that an AR/ER ratio ≥ 2 serves as an indicator of adverse prognosis in ER-positive/AR-positive breast cancer. However, it is important to note that our study is based on non-randomized retrospective observational data, offering limited evidence on the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, these findings should not be solely relied upon for clinical decisions without further evidence-based confirmation. Future prospective studies featuring extended follow-up periods and larger sample sizes are imperative to validate our findings and furnish stronger evidence for clinical decision-making.
