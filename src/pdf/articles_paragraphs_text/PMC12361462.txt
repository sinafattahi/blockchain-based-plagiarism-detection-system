This article focuses on the design and development of a flexible hexagonal microstrip patch antenna fabricated on a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate for potential use in 5G and wearable applications. The antenna geometry was selected to operate in a higher-order resonant mode to enhance performance under mechanical bending. To accelerate the design process and determine the most effective model for predicting optimal geometrical parameters that yield improved impedance matching at the target frequency, four supervised machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM were evaluated and compared. These models were trained using a dataset generated from full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations, and the Random Forest model exhibited the best predictive accuracy, with an R² value of 0.99. Additionally, a low-cost and scalable fabrication approach was demonstrated to realize conductive traces on PDMS, and a functional prototype was manufactured and tested. The prototype demonstrated consistent performance, with measured gain of 3.2 dB. An electrical equivalent lumped-element circuit model was also formulated to analytically validate the antenna’s EM simulation results. This integrated approach of data-driven optimization, low-cost fabrication, and circuit-level validation contributes to the practical realization of flexible RF antennas.

The field of flexible electronics has advanced rapidly, driven by the increasing demand for applications in humidity sensing1, health monitoring2,3, and emerging technologies such as wireless body area networks (WBAN)4,5and wireless local area networks (WLAN)6. A critical component in these applications is the flexible antenna, which offers a compelling alternative to traditional rigid substrate-based designs. While a variety of flexible substrates are being explored, including textile7,8, felt9,10, and various polymers11,12, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has emerged as a particularly promising candidate. PDMS offers several key advantages, including a low dielectric constant and loss tangent, which are crucial for achieving efficient antenna performance in flexible configurations13. P.K.Sharma, et al. provided a detailed characterization of the complex dielectric constant and anisotropy of PDMS substrates14. These properties, combined with its inherent flexibility and biocompatibility, make it well-suited for applications requiring conformal and wearable antennas.

To realize the antenna for flexible electronic applications, particular attention is given to the fabrication of conductive traces on PDMS substrates, which serve as the foundation for achieving mechanical flexibility without compromising electrical performance. The copper foil was used for conductive traces for a flexible antenna15. Alternatively, the conductive traces are fabricated using silver paste and a stencil printing method16. However, the stencil method may result in uneven paste distribution, affecting the consistency of the printed traces. Graphene nanoparticles (GNP) have been used for conductive traces using screen-printing17and spray-coating techniques18. However, screen-printing can lead to dispersion inconsistencies, while spray-coating demands precise control for uniformity and repeatability. The conductive traces were fabricated by depositing Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) for both the patch and ground plane on PDMS substrate using a Fujifilm inkjet Dimatix material printer (DMP-3000)19. Droplet jetting of nano-silver inks onto oxygen plasma-treated PDMS was utilized to fabricate a flexible tri-band antenna20, though the need for surface treatment adds to the overall process complexity. The conductive copper mesh is precisely cut with a razor to serve as the radiating dipole21, while in another study22, a laser-patterned conductive fabric was bonded to a cured PDMS substrate using PVA glue. However, the razor-cut copper mesh suffers from low precision and repeatability, while the PVA-bonded conductive fabric risks long-term delamination and poor mechanical integrity. In this context, the current article employs a commercially available copper sheet for forming conductive traces. This choice ensures uniform conductivity, mechanical stability, and ease of patterning, offering a more repeatable and scalable alternative.

Traditional antenna design processes are often experience-driven and rely heavily on iterative full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming. As antenna requirements become more application-specific and design complexity increases, the limitations of conventional methods become increasingly evident. In response to these challenges, machine learning (ML) techniques offer a data-driven alternative capable of improving efficiency and design accuracy. In recent years, ML techniques have emerged as powerful tools for optimizing antenna parameters23, predicting performance metrics24, and accelerating the design process in flexible RF systems. The sidelobe levels of a slotted waveguide antenna are optimized using various machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and Random Forest25. Multi-adaptive neuro-fuzzy model is used to predict the notch frequency in UWB slotted antenna26. Neural networks are computationally expensive and harder to interpret, while fuzzy models struggle with large, complex datasets. In contrast, tree-based models are efficient, interpretable, and well-suited for large datasets, offering better speed and performance. Building on the advantages of tree-based models, this study investigates the use of four popular machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM, to optimize the design of the antenna. The focus is on improving the performance, streamlining the parameter optimization process, and evaluating the effectiveness of different algorithms in redesigning the same antenna for varying frequency targets with minimal error.

In this article, the PDMS layer of 1.8mm thickness is used as substrate with copper being conductive material to form radiator and ground. The performance of the antenna under both flat and bent conditions is evaluated, highlighting the flexibility of design. Additionally, a comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, is conducted to optimize the antenna design. The study evaluates the performance of each algorithm in streamlining the parameter tuning process and minimizing error for varying frequency targets.

Figure3(a) illustrates the equivalent circuit model for the proposed flexible antenna. The componentsandrepresent the resistance, inductance, and capacitance of the patch through which the primary current flows. Additionally, as shown in Fig.2, another current flows along the rectangular slot cut on the patch, whose equivalent is represented byand. All these values are computed based on the equations provided in30. Figure3(b) depicts the simplified circuit model of the proposed antenna. Table1presents the calculated lumped parameters alongside the optimized values obtained through tuning in the Path Wave Advanced Design System 2024 (ADS) software (https://www.keysight.com/zz/en/products/software/pathwave-design-software/pathwave-advanced-design-system.html). The correspondingcurves, compared with the EM-simulated results, are shown in Fig.4. The discrepancy between the EM-simulated and initial circuit responses can be attributed to the lumped parameters being calculated using analytical expressions for rectangular patch geometry, while the proposed design features a hexagonal patch.

Comparison of EM-simulated and circuit-simulated response of the proposed model.

To investigate the effects of bending, the performance of the hexagonal patch antenna was analyzed both in its unbent (planar) form and under cylindrical deformations with radii of curvature of r = 20 mm, 30 mm, and 40 mm as depicted in Fig.5. The simulatedcurves, shown in Fig.6(a), indicate a consistent upward shift in the resonant frequency as the bending radius decreases, while impedance matching remains largely unaffected. The depth of thedip, shown in Fig.6(a), confirms that the antenna continues to maintain a good match to the 50feed line despite the curvature. For outward bending of the proposed antenna, bending is applied such that the current maxima (as seen in Fig.2) are separated on either side of the bend. Theplots shown in Fig.6(b) exhibit minimal deviation from the unbent state, further confirming that bending at a current null has negligible impact, thereby highlighting that higher-order mode excitation in the proposed flexible antenna design ensures stable performance under mechanical bending. Consequently, the analysis emphasizes inward bending, where the impact on antenna performance is more evident.

Radiation patterns for both the planar and bent configurations of inward bending are illustrated in Fig.7. These results show minimal distortion in pattern shape, although a noticeable reduction in gain is observed as the bending radius decreases. A comprehensive comparison of the performance parameters across all configurations is provided in Table2.

Performance parameters of the proposed antenna across different bending configurations.

To investigate the influence of slot dimensions on antenna performance, a parametric analysis was conducted. As illustrated in Fig.8(a), increasing the slot width resulted in an upward shift in the resonant frequency from 3.51 GHz to 3.61 GHz and a reduction in the quality factor. This indicates that impedance matching is sensitive to slot width variations, as evident from the Fig.8(a). Furthermore, an increase in slot length effectively segments the patch, extending the current path and thereby lowering the resonant frequency from 3.7 GHz to 3.5 GHz, as can be seen in Fig.8(b). However, within the range of slot lengths from 20 mm to 26 mm, the frequency shift was found to be minimal, suggesting a region of reduced sensitivity to this parameter.

With the increasing complexity of antenna geometries and the demand for rapid prototyping of flexible designs, traditional parametric sweep methods often become time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address this, ML techniques offer a promising alternative for efficient design space exploration and optimization. In this study, four distinct ML algorithms were employed to establish predictive models capable of identifying optimal combinations of geometrical parameters that minimize the reflection coefficient () at a desired operating frequency. These models were trained on a dataset generated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations, enabling rapid prediction and parameter tuning with significantly reduced computational overhead. Specifically, the parametervaried from 15 mm to 22.5 mm in steps of 1.5 mm; slot widtharanged from 0.5 mm to 5 mm in steps of 0.5 mm; and slot lengthbvaried from 5 mm to 35 mm in 2 mm increments were combined to create a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating the machine learning models. All simulations were conducted on a Windows 10 64-bit system equipped with an Intel core i7 9700KF processor and 32 GB RAM, using MATLAB R2024b.

The workflow of the tree-based machine learning models is depicted in Fig.9. During model training, the dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Training dataset is used to learn the underlying patterns, whereas testing dataset is used to evaluate the generalization performance. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using grid search and cross-validation, optimizing parameters such as the number of estimators, maximum tree depth, and learning rates to enhance predictive performance. The models were trained to predict the minimumvalue based on the geometric input parameters, allowing for rapid estimation of antenna performance under different design conditions. Figure10illustrates the comparison between actual and predicted values of the proposed antenna using four machine learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. Points lying closer to ideal fit line indicate higher predictive accuracy, reflecting minimal deviation between predicted and actual outputs. All models were implemented in Python, with scripts executed via the Anaconda Prompt to manage dependencies and environments. The selection of these specific models for this study was guided by their proven effectiveness in handling regression problems involving structured tabular data with nonlinear relationships. These models are all based on decision tree ensembles, which are known for their robustness, interpretability, and capability to model complex dependencies without requiring feature normalization.

In general, lower values of mean squared error (MSE) indicate better predictive accuracy, reflecting minimal deviation between predicted and actual outputs. Table3summarizes the performance of each model on the test dataset. Among the models evaluated, the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated the best performance, achieving an MSE of 0.08137,score of 0.996455, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.061535. These results underscore the strong predictive capability of the RF model in capturing the underlying relationships between design parameters and antenna performance.

Performance evaluation of the different ML algorithms.

Several fabrication methods for PDMS substrates have been reported in the literature including the the conventional one31, although many of these involve relatively complex procedures. In contrast, the approach presented in this article is simple, resource-efficient, and does not require specialized equipment, making it particularly suitable for educational purposes and student-led research initiatives. Nevertheless, for advanced practical applications, more refined fabrication techniques are recommended to achieve higher precision and repeatability.

PDMS, commonly available as Sylgard 184, consists of two liquid components: the base and the curing agent as shown in Fig.11(a). The substrate is prepared by mixing the base and curing agent in a 10:1 ratio. A PLA mold with dimensions of 100 mm100 mm, shaped like a shallow tray, was fabricated using a commercially available fused-deposition modeling (FDM) printer, as shown in Fig.11(b). The mold has a 0.8 mm base, 5 mm thick walls around circumference with a 1.8 mm height, to ensure a uniform PDMS thickness when the mixture is poured. A heat gun was used to ensure that no air bubbles remained in the mixture without affecting the PLA mold. Care must be taken with heat application, as excessive heat may deform the PLA. Once the air bubbles were removed, the setup was kept at room temperature (C) for 24 hours for curing. While pouring the PDMS mixture into the mold, there is a possibility that the mixture may not be uniformly distributed due to the nature of PDMS and factors such as the viscosity of the mixture and pouring technique. As a result, the thickness of the prepared PDMS substrate may vary across different points of the layer. After curing, the PDMS substrate can be easily peeled off from the PLA mold using tweezers and was then cut into the required shape. Use a release agent such as silicone-based spray on the PLA mold beforehand to minimize adhesion and facilitate smooth removal of PDMS.

Once the PDMS substrate was prepared, the next step involved forming conductive layers for the top and bottom surfaces to realize an antenna. The literature outlines several methods for creating conductive patterns on flexible substrates, including the use of conductive fabrics, copper spray coatings, screen printing with silver pastes, laser-cut conductive tapes or sheets (e.g., copper or steel), and metallic meshes. Various techniques were experimentally evaluated in this work to identify a suitable approach. Initially, a commercial copper spray (RS EMI/RFI 400 mL shielding aerosol) was applied to the PDMS surface. Although this method demonstrated ease of application and acceptable initial conductivity, it exhibited poor adhesion to the PDMS surface. However, the copper coating developed cracks and began to peel off within a few hours after drying, as depicted in Fig12. Similarly, conductive paste with electrical conductivity of 5.5106 S/m32was applied to create the conductive traces. While this approach provided a straightforward fabrication process, it too suffered from poor adhesion similar to the copper spray. Upon drying, the conductive layer developed cracks and delaminated from the substrate surface, as depicted in Fig.12. Although both the methods mentioned above, are simple and cost-effective, their inadequate adhesion to the PDMS substrate limits their viability for durable applications.

Following these observations, copper tape33was investigated as a more reliable alternative. Using a vinyl cutter, the tape was accurately shaped and then affixed to the PDMS substrate. However, upon repeated bending of the prototype, noticeable warping and wrinkling developed on the copper tape surface as shown in Fig.13, indicating potential reliability issues for long-term use. To address this, 0.2 mm thick copper sheets were employed as a more robust alternative. These sheets were manually cut into the desired geometry and bonded to the cured PDMS substrate using uncured PDMS as an adhesive layer, as shown in the inset of Fig.14(a). Compared to copper tape, metallic sheets offer superior shape retention and resist deformation during handling. While copper tape offers greater flexibility, the enhanced mechanical stability and durability of copper sheets make them the preferred choice for prolonged use. Although stereolithography (SLA)-printed molds can provide smoother surfaces and plasma treatment can enhance adhesion for conductive layer application, these methods were intentionally omitted in this study to keep the fabrication process low-cost and accessible with available resources.

The fabricated prototype was experimentally validated using a vector network analyzer (Model: MS46122B). Figure 14(a) shows the experimental setup for the proposed flexible antenna. A comparison between the EM-simulated and measuredparameters is shown in Fig.14(b), showing that fabricated prototype is resonating at 3.63 GHz. The observed discrepancies can be attributed to several factors, including variations in PDMS thickness at different points on the substrate. Additionally, the measured radiation patterns for both the prototypes are presented in Fig.15, with the antenna exhibiting a measured gain of 3.2 dB. Table4provides a comparison of the conductive materials used and the application methods on PDMS in the proposed antenna relative to the literature.
