Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally, and its management imposes a significant economic burden on patients. This study assessed the economic costs incurred by patients in accessing hypertension care at the Ho Teaching Hospital, a tertiary facility in Ghana.

A cross-sectional study was conducted from July to September 2024 among 116 adult patients (≥ 18 years) clinically diagnosed with hypertension and on antihypertensive treatment. Cost analysis was conducted from the patient perspective, focusing on out-of-pocket payments (OOPPs) for direct medical costs (consultation fees, medications, and laboratory services), direct non-medical costs (transportation to and from healthcare facilities), and indirect costs associated with productivity losses. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital approach, based on the number of hours lost while seeking hypertension care, including travel and waiting time. Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE) was estimated using thresholds of 10% and 40% of individual income, based on both total costs and direct costs alone. Individual income was proxied using Ghana’s 2024 national monthly minimum wage.

The study involved 116 respondents, the majority of whom were female (55. 17%), about 33.62% of respondents earned less than USD33.33 a month, with 96.55% enrolled in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). On average, patients incurred monthly direct medical costs of USD11.01 per visit—comprising USD5.15 for consultations, USD2.56 for medications and USD15.27 for laboratory services. Direct non-medical costs per visit, primarily for transportation, averaged USD7.33. Indirect costs, mainly due to productivity losses due to time spent for care, averaged USD1.31 per visit. The total average monthly cost per patient was USD19.52 (Median: USD13.91), translating to an estimated annual cost of USD234.29. Notably, 49.14% of patients experienced catastrophic health expenditure, exceeding 40% of the minimum national monthly wage. CHE prevalence on total cost was 49.14% and 99.14% at 40% and 10% thresholds respectively (total cost).

Despite being enrolled on the NHIS, hypertensive patients face considerable economic burdens, with high rates of catastrophic health expenditure. There is, therefore, an urgent need for improve access to affordable antihypertensive medications at NHIS accredited health facilities and reduce geographic barriers to care, particularly transportation costs and time spent accessing services.

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.28 billion adults aged 30–79 years are living with hypertension, with two-thirds of them in low- and middle-income countries [1].

In Ghana, the prevalence of hypertension among adults is high. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies reported a pooled prevalence of 30.3% (95% CI: 26.1–34.8%) [2]. Hypertension and its complications are among the leading causes of admissions and deaths [3,4]. Effective management of hypertension requires consistent adherence to medication, lifestyle modifications, and routine clinical monitoring to prevent complications and improve the quality of life [5,6]. However, many patients face significant financial burdens when seeking hypertension care, primarily due to out-of-pocket payments (OOPPs) [7–9]. OOPPs refer to direct payments made by individuals at the point of service, excluding reimbursements from third-party payers such as health insurance schemes [7,8,10].

High levels of OOPPs can create financial barriers to accessing care, potentially resulting in delayed treatment, poor adherence, and increased risk of complications. These effects are especially pronounced in resource-limited settings where social protection mechanisms are often inadequate [10,11].

Although Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) aims to offer financial risk protection, patients still suffer substantial costs, particularly for non-medical expenses such as transportation and productivity losses due to long wait times at health facilities [10]. As a result, OOPPs remain a dominant form of health financing for many patients in Ghana, even among those enrolled in the NHIS [10,12].

This study quantified the direct and indirect OOPPs incurred by hypertensive patients seeking routine care at Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH) in the Volta Region of Ghana. With limited studies on the economic burden of hypertensive management by patients in Ghana, this study findings will shed light on the economic burden to hypertension care and inform policies and strategies to enhance affordability and accessibility of hypertension management in the country.

This cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2024. It was a cost of illness study in which cost data were collected from the patient’s perspective.

The study was conducted at the Cardiothoracic Centre of the Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH), located in Ho, the capital of the Volta Region of Ghana. The HTH is a 320-bed referral facility with a staff strength of approximately 650, providing specialized healthcare services across various departments to residents of the Volta Region and neighbouring areas [13]. The Cardiothoracic Centre serves as the designated unit for outpatient hypertension care at HTH.

The study population comprised individuals aged 18 years and above who received a clinical diagnosis of hypertension and were under anti-hypertensive treatment for a minimum of four months at the HTH.

The sample size was determined using the Krejcie and Morgan (1970) [14] sample size determination table, which has been widely applied in various studies [15,16]. Based on this method and a known population of approximately 170 hypertension cases who attended the Cardiothoracic Centre for care in May 2024, the estimated sample size was 118 patients.

A systematic sampling technique was employed to select participants for the study. Based on an estimated monthly sampling frame of 170 hypertensive cases, a target sample size of 118, and a three-month data collection period, every fourth hypertensive patient attending routine outpatient appointments at the Cardiothoracic Centre of the HTH was approached for participation. Sampling began with the fourth eligible patient in the consultation queue to allow sufficient time for completing the interview before the patient entered the consulting room.

Data were collected by five student nurses from the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS), Ho, Ghana, as part of their research project. Prior to the start of data collection, the team received training on the study protocol, ethical considerations, and standardized data collection procedures.

A structured questionnaire was developed based on a review of relevant literature [7,16–19] and this was used for data collection. The questionnaire captured information on participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, direct Out-of-pocket payments (OOPPs) as well as indirect costs related to hypertension treatment.

OOPPs for antihypertensive medications were recorded after participants purchased their prescribed drugs from the hospital pharmacy. In cases where the prescribed medications were not available at the hospital, the prescriptions were documented, and prices were determined based on the average cost of those medications from five major pharmacy shops within the Ho municipality.

Indirect costs, like the time spent traveling to the hospital, were based on their current visit. Participants were also asked to estimate the time they expected to spend at the hospital to determine waiting times for care.

Data were captured using the REDCap platform and subsequently imported to STATA version 14 for cleaning and analysis. Descriptive statistics, using frequencies, percentages, were computed and presented on socio-demographic variables. Due to skewed nature of costs data, mean and median values were reported for all costs.

Total treatment cost was calculated as the sum of direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs (Table1). Direct medical costs included OOPPs for consultations, medications and laboratory services, while direct non-medical costs comprised OOPPs for transportation to and from healthcare facility.

Consultation Cost: Calculated as the total out-of-pocket payments (OOPPs) incurred by patients for consultation fees.

Medication Cost: Calculated as the total OOPPs incurred for antihypertensive medications.

Laboratory Cost: Calculated as the total OOPPs incurred for laboratory services, including blood tests, urine tests, and imaging procedures such as electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.

Total Medical Cost: Estimated by summing the OOPPs incurred for consultations, medications, and laboratory tests.

All data were initially recorded in Ghana cedis (GHS) and converted to U.S. dollars(USD) using an average exchange rate for July-September 2024 of USD1 = GHS15 [20] (https://www.bog.gov.gh/economic-data/exchange-rate/) during analysis.

Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) for hypertension treatment was assessed based on the proportion of income spent on healthcare that exceeds a specified threshold within a given period. Commonly used thresholds range from 10 to 40% of income or expenditure [9,10,17,19]. In the absence of reliable income data within the study sample, individual income was proxied using Ghana’s 2024 national monthly minimum wage of GHS544.50 (USD36.30) [21].

CHE was computed for two categories of costs: (i) total costs (sum of direct and indirect costs), and (ii) direct costs alone. For each category, CHE was evaluated at both a lower threshold (10%) and a higher threshold (40%) to reflect varying degrees of economic burden.

Of the 118 hypertensive patients approached for interviews at the Cardiothoracic Centre (HTH), 116 successfully completed the survey, resulting in a 98.31% response rate. The average age of respondents was approximately 56 years, with 38.79% and 7.76% in the age groups of 50–59 and 30–39 years respectively (Table2). Most of the respondents were females (55.17%) and 62.07% are currently married. In terms of respondents’ educational level, more than a third (37.07%) of the respondents had attained tertiary education, and about a third (32.72%) had basic education (JHS or middle school). Most of the respondents were traders (23.28%), and 22.41% were unemployed.

Additionally, almost all respondents identified as Christians (91.39%). In terms of average monthly income, about 33.62% of respondents reported earning less than USD 33.33 a month, while about 20.69% earned more than USD100 a month. Most of the respondents (43.10%) reported residing in rural areas, while about 34.5% reported residing in urban areas. Almost all respondents (96.55%) were enrolled onto the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) (Table2).

The monthly cost of hypertension treatment was categorized into direct and indirect costs (Table3). Direct costs—including both medical and non-medical expenses—accounted for 93.29% of the total healthcare expenditure.

On average, patients incurred a direct medical cost of USD11.01, which included USD5.15 for consultations and USD2.56 for antihypertensive medications such as bisoprolol, losartan, amlodipine, nifedipine, and hydrochlorothiazide. The majority of respondents (57.4%) used Nifedipine 10 mg (mean: USD2.1) and 32.21% used Amlodipine 10 mg (mean: USD1.1).

Additionally, 26.72% patients underwent laboratory investigations, including lipid profile (mean: USD6.7) and imaging procedures such as electrocardiograms (mean = USD3.33) and echocardiograms (mean = 26.67), with an average cost of USD15.27 per patient. Overall, direct medical costs constituted 56.41% of the total monthly healthcare expenditure.

The average direct non-medical cost—primarily transportation to and from the hospital—was USD7.33, representing 36.88% of the total cost. Most respondents (63.79%) used public transport (taxis), 25.00% used tricycles, and 1.72% walked. The average one-way travel time to the hospital was 1 h and 45 min. In total, patients spent an average of USD18.21 on direct costs related to hypertension management.

Indirect costs, mainly due to productivity losses from time spent seeking care, were estimated at USD1.31 per visit. The times spent at the hospital varied between participants. About 4% patients reported spending 1–2 h, 6.38% spent 3–4 h, 54.31% spent 5–6 h and the remaining 25.86% spent > 7 h at the hospital.

Overall, the total average monthly cost per patient—including both direct and indirect costs—was USD19.52 (median USD13.91), amounting to an estimated annual expenditure of USD234.29 per patient. When costs were disaggregated by insurance status, patients enrolled in the NHIS incurred lower average costs (mean: USD 19.21) compared to those not enrolled (mean: USD 28.30).

The estimated monthly cost of hypertension care per patient was USD19.52. Using Ghana’s 2024 daily minimum wage of GHS18.15 (equivalent to USD1.21), the estimated monthly income is GHS544.50 or USD36.30. This means that approximately 54% of a patient’s monthly income was spent on hypertension management per month.

To further assess the economic burden, catastrophic health expenditure was evaluated at various thresholds. At the 40% threshold, 49.14% of patients were found to incur catastrophic health expenditure. When the threshold was reduced to 10%, nearly all patients (99.14%) were considered to have experienced catastrophic health expenditure.

In addition, when we estimated CHE using the total direct medical costs incurred against income, the results showed that 24.1% experienced CHE at 40% threshold and 78.45% at 10% threshold (Fig.1). The proportion of individuals experiencing CHE increases dramatically when the threshold is lowered to 10%, highlighting the sensitivity of CHE estimates to the choice of threshold.

The growing prevalence of hypertension in Ghana has significant implications for increased healthcare spending among the population. However, there is a scarcity of research on the out-of-pocket costs borne by patients in managing hypertension, leading to limited evidence to guide national interventions aimed at reducing this financial burden.

This study, therefore, aimed to estimate the economic burden incurred by hypertension patients receiving care at the Ho Teaching Hospital in the Volta Region of Ghana.

Our study results indicate that patients incur an average monthly expenditure of USD19.52 (median USD13.91), representing a significant economic burden. Several studies have reported on the economic impact of hypertension treatment [22–25].

In our study, monthly direct medical costs of USD11.01 per patient is lower than what was reported in a previous study in Ghana were direct medical expenditure amounts to USD25 per patient per month [26]. In addition, the estimated annual cost of USD234.29 in our study is higher than figures reported in other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For example, two studies in Ethiopia found annual costs of USD91.72 [27] and USD113.40 [7] respectively. Conversely, in our study, monthly cost was lower than a study in Ethiopia that reported a monthly cost of USD22.3 [28].

Despite 96.55% of patients in our study being enrolled in the NHIS, they still incurred direct medical costs averaging USD11.01, which accounted for 56.41% of their total healthcare expenditure. Although Ghana’s NHIS is designed to cover over 95% of disease conditions, including hypertension treatment [29], patients continue to make OOPPs, particularly in tertiary healthcare settings. This could be due to long delays in NHIS reimbursement claims [30]which sometimes result in the unavailability of covered medications including antihypertensive medications and frequent stockouts at hospital pharmacies, forcing patients to purchase drugs from private pharmacies.

Additionally, essential laboratory and imaging services are not covered under the NHIS at the HTH, similarly to other tertiary hospitals in the country. At the hospital, for example, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms cost GHS50 (USD3.33) and GHS400 (USD26.67), respectively. Furthermore, outpatient consultations at the Cardiothoracic Centre are not covered by NHIS, requiring patients to pay a fee of GHS50 (USD 3.33) per visit.

Despite these gaps, in our study, patients enrolled in NHIS incurred lower average costs (USD19.21) compared to those not enrolled (USD28.30). These findings are consistent with previous studies in Ghana, which have documented significant OOPPs despite high NHIS enrolment [23,26,31,32]. This highlights the need for the NHIS to enhance its operations by addressing reimbursement delays and expanding its benefit package to cover essential antihypertensive medications, laboratory tests, and imaging services at tertiary hospitals. Such measures would enable hospitals to improve their medication supply and ensure consistent availability of services healthcare facilities. Ultimately, these improvements would reduce the economic burden on patients and lessen their dependence on expensive private providers. We acknowledge that having more detailed data on the proportion of hypertension-related costs covered by the NHIS would have strengthened our analysis. We therefore recommend this as a key area for future research.

Transportation costs represented a significant economic burden for patients in our study, averaging USD7.33 per month and constituting approximately 36.88% of their total healthcare expenditure. This high proportion is largely attributable to the fact that 43.1% of patients reside in rural areas and must travel long distances to access care at the Ho Teaching Hospital. This figure is however higher that the previous study in Ghana that reported direct non-medical expenditure as USD4 per patient per month [26]. When extrapolated, the monthly transport cost translates to an annual expense of USD87.96. This is lower than findings from a study in Kenya, which reported mean annual transportation costs of USD126.70 for outpatient hypertension visits across five public health facilities—representing 42.2% of total direct costs and 21.88% of overall care costs [19]. Similarly, in Southwest Nigeria, transportation costs accounted for 12.59% and 10.89% of total healthcare expenses among patients attending hypertension clinics in urban and rural tertiary facilities, respectively [33]. These findings highlight the disproportionate economic strain placed on rural and peri-urban populations who require frequent travel for chronic disease management, underscoring persistent geographical barriers to healthcare access [34]. The findings call for urgent policy action. Health authorities in Ghana should consider decentralizing or task-shifting hypertension care to lower-level facilities like Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds and health centres to reduce travel costs and improve access [35,36]. Integrating telemedicine—through virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and e-prescriptions—can further lower transportation costs and enhance care continuity. Additionally, implementing structured appointment systems or fast-track lanes at tertiary facilities could reduce waiting times and minimize productivity losses [37–39].

Indirect costs, primarily stemming from productivity losses due to travel and waiting times, were relatively low at USD1.31, representing only 6.71% of total costs. However, this likely underestimates the true economic burden, as it does not account for time lost due to hypertension-related illnesses outside of hospital visit days. Nonetheless, the data indicate that patients spend significant productive hours at the hospital, especially since hypertension clinics operate twice weekly and serve patients from multiple districts. This results in long waiting times with fewer doctors available to attend to the patients. Consequently, patients spent an average of 5 to 6 h at the hospital and an additional 3 h travelling, indicating that routine clinic visits often consume an entire working day. Waiting time is common in public health facilities and has been identified as a major disincentive to seeking care in these settings [19,33,40].

There is a high prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) among patients. Based on total treatment costs, 49.14% of patients experienced CHE at the 40% threshold, while 99.14% did so at the 10% threshold. When considering only direct medical costs, 24.1% of patients incurred CHE at the 40% threshold, and 78.45% at the 10% threshold. These findings align with previous studies in Ghana that have reported high levels of CHE despite the presence of the NHIS. For example, one study using household income thresholds of 10% and 40% of capacity to pay found that 65% and 58% of participants, respectively, experienced catastrophic or impoverishing health expenditures [26].

This study has some limitations that warrant careful consideration when interpreting the findings.

Firstly, the study was conducted at a single tertiary health facility—Ho Teaching Hospital—which may limit the generalizability of the results to other tertiary facilities across Ghana. While tertiary hospitals generally operate under similar administrative and clinical protocols, regional variations in service delivery, resource availability, and patient demographics could influence cost structures. Therefore, while the findings offer valuable insights, they should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to other settings.

Secondly, the estimation of indirect costs may be conservative, as it only considered productivity losses associated with the day of hospital visits. It did not account for additional time lost due to hypertension-related morbidity on non-clinic days, such as days off work due to illness or reduced productivity at home. This underestimation potentially leads to a lower total economic burden being reported. However, the inclusion of time lost on clinic days still underscores the broader economic implications of hypertension on individuals and households.

Thirdly, the use of a uniform national daily minimum wage to estimate productivity losses introduces potential bias. This approach may underestimate the economic losses for higher-income earners while simultaneously overestimating losses for those unemployed or engaged in low-income informal sector work. Despite this, it was adopted as a pragmatic solution due to the challenges associated with accurately collecting income data in contexts characterized by informal and fluctuating earnings. While this method limits the precision of indirect cost estimates, its impact on the overall conclusions is likely minimal, especially given that the majority of respondents were engaged in informal sector employment.

Fourthly, catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) was calculated based on individual income rather than household income. This may have led to an overestimation of CHE, particularly in households where financial burdens are shared among multiple earners. The decision to use individual income was driven by the difficulty of obtaining accurate and consistent household income data in settings with irregular or unreported earnings. Although this limitation affects the magnitude of the reported CHE, it does not diminish the significance of the economic strain posed by hypertension treatment.

Despite these limitations, the study makes a critical contribution by being the first to assess the economic burden of hypertension at the Ho Teaching Hospital in the Volta Region, Ghana. It employs a standardized costing tool that captures both direct and indirect costs, offering foundational data that can inform policy, resource allocation, and strategies to improve financial protection for hypertensive patients.

This study underscores the significant economic burden faced by patients with hypertension, with average monthly costs reaching USD19.52. These costs encompass direct medical and non-medical expenses, as well as indirect costs related to lost productivity. Despite being enrolled in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), many patients continue to incur catastrophic health expenditures.

To alleviate this burden, several key actions are needed. The NHIS should expand its medicine list to cover a wider range of hypertension medications and streamline the reimbursement process to improve the reliability of the medication supply chain at tertiary hospitals.

Furthermore, policymakers should consider strategies to enhance access to care and reduce costs. This includes decentralizing hypertension care to primary health facilities, introducing mobile outreach services, and leveraging digital health innovations and fast-track clinics for chronic care. These measures would help minimize transportation expenses and reduce waiting times, ultimately improving the lives of those living with hypertension in Ghana.

The authors sincerely thank the hypertension patients who participated in this study—their involvement was vital to deepening our understanding of the economic burden of hypertension treatment at Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH). We also extend our appreciation to the Cardiothoracic Centre and the management of HTH for granting access to the facility for data collection. Lastly, we acknowledge the commitment and effort of the data collectors, the student nurses, whose diligence made this study possible.
