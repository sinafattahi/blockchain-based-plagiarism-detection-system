Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common benign vascular tumors of infancy, although intracranial IHs remain exceedingly rare. Diagnosis is typically postnatal, with some cases requiring medical or surgical intervention. Here, the authors report the first case of a congenital cavernous sinus IH diagnosed via prenatal imaging and managed conservatively with successful spontaneous regression.

A 28-year-old female underwent routine fetal ultrasound at 32 weeks’ gestation, revealing a 1.8-cm perithalamic lesion. Fetal MRI at 33 weeks confirmed an extra-axial mass in the right middle fossa with a dural attachment. Postnatal MRI on day 1 of life demonstrated imaging features consistent with an IH. Given the neonate’s asymptomatic status, conservative management was pursued. Serial MRI at 10 weeks and 6 months showed progressive lesion regression, with near-complete resolution. The infant remained asymptomatic with normal neurodevelopmental progress.

This case highlights the potential for spontaneous regression of congenital intracranial IHs diagnosed prenatally. Despite the risk of bleeding, conservative management with close clinical and radiological follow-up may be a viable option in select asymptomatic cases, particularly in the neonatal period when surgical risks are significant.

We present the first reported case of a congenital cavernous sinus IH diagnosed via prenatal MRI and managed conservatively with a rapid spontaneous regression of the mass over the first 6 months of life, thus emphasizing the potential for noninterventional management in select cases.

A 28-year-old female with a stable medical history of Crohn’s disease and a nonspecific collagenosis was monitored with serial fetal ultrasound from the 24th week of gestation because of the risk of preterm labor (early contractions). Ultrasounds showed no abnormalities until the 32nd week of gestation, when a new 1.8-cm hyperechoic spherical perithalamic lesion was seen. Subsequent fetal MRI performed at the 33rd gestational week confirmed the presence of an extra-axial mass located in the right middle fossa, with a dural attachment (Fig. 1). Of note, the suspected diagnosis at that time was meningioma or infant glioma; the possibility of IH was not evoked as the images did not seem typical for it.

A:Obstetric ultrasound obtained at the 32nd week of gestation, showing a new homogeneous hyperechoic round perithalamic lesion (arrow).B and C:Fetal MR images obtained at the 33rd gestational week, confirming the presence of an extra-axial mass with dural attachment, located in the right middle fossa on coronal T2-weighted (T2W) single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) (B) and axial T2W SSFSE (C) images (arrows). The signal is not as high signal as expected for a hemangioma.

The patient underwent vaginal delivery at 39 weeks without complications, with APGAR scores of 9 and 10. MRI performed on day 1 of life confirmed the lesion’s location centered on the cavernous sinus and Meckel’s cave. The lesion, measuring 30 × 20 × 15 mm, was hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, and showed homogeneous and intense enhancement, with no restriction on diffusion and no susceptibility artifact; all these characteristics were suggestive of a benign vascular tumor. The diagnosis of IH was favored (Fig. 2). Meningioma was considered in the differential diagnosis, although it was considered very unlikely considering the age of the patient. Genetic analysis, including a panel for mutations associated with intracranial tumors, revealed no mutations, including in theNF2gene, thus ruling out the possibility of a neurofibromatosis type 2–associated meningioma.4Of note, on clinical examination, the child had 2 minor hemangiomas (on the neck and on the trunk).

MRI performed on day 1 of life confirmed the lesion’s location centered on the cavernous sinus and Meckel’s cave. It is hyperintense (arrows) on TW2 images (A and D), hypointense (arrowheads) on T1-weighted (TW1) images (B and E), and showed homogeneous and intense enhancement (arrowheads) on T1W postgadolinium images (C and F). No restriction on diffusion imaging and no susceptibly artifact on gradient echo images was noted (not shown).

A follow-up MRI at 10 weeks of age showed a significant reduction in the lesion size, which was then measuring 20 × 8 × 15 mm. Subsequent MRI at 6 months of age revealed near-complete resolution of the mass (Fig. 3). Her serial complete blood counts remained normal.

Follow-up MR images obtained at 6 months of age, showing a significant reduction in the size of the lesion, with only discrete residual asymmetry (arrows) on T2W (A) and T1W (C) images, better appreciated on T1W postgadolinium (B and D) images.

From a clinical perspective, the child remains asymptomatic with a normal neurological and developmental status. The two known hemangiomas on the neck and on the trunk have slightly increased in size at the 6-month follow-up.

The most reported intracranial IH location is the cerebellopontine angle, although cases have been described in the middle cranial fossa, cavernous sinus, and Meckel’s cave, as was the case for our patient. Unlike previous cases, no biopsy was performed in our newborn due to the absence of symptoms, the bleeding risk related to a biopsy, and postnatal imaging features consistent with intracranial IH. Furthermore, the negativeNF2genetic testing made even more unlikely the possibility of a meningioma, which was in the differential diagnosis.

Intracranial IHs are rare lesions that typically exhibit rapid proliferative growth in the 1st year of life, with 80% of their final size reached by 5 months and a peak at 9 months. This is followed by a gradual involutional phase, in which 90% of lesions regress by 5 years of age.8However, given the potential for early growth, neurological compromise, and the risk of intracranial bleeding, clinicians may decide to initiate medical treatment even in asymptomatic cases to prevent complications. While propranolol was recognized as a potentially safe and effective therapy, the rapid spontaneous regression justified a conservative, watchful waiting strategy. This case demonstrates that congenital intracranial IHs detected prenatally could undergo rapid spontaneous regression, suggesting the possibility of a conservative approach in select asymptomatic cases.

This case highlights the potential for rapid spontaneous regression of congenital intracranial IHs diagnosed prenatally, like previously reported for postnatally diagnosed intracranial IHs. While IHs can exhibit initial rapid growth and have an inherited risk of spontaneous bleeding, our findings suggest that in asymptomatic neonates, a conservative approach with serial imaging and regular clinical and laboratory follow-up may be a valid and safe alternative. The limitations to this report are the absence of biopsy, the short follow-up time, and the limitations inherent to case reports. Further evidence is needed before establishing a standardized management strategy for these patients (observation vs medical and/or surgical treatment).
