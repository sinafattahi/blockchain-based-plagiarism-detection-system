Polypharmacy, defined as the concurrent use of multiple medications, is a growing concern among the elderly, especially in low-income and middle-income countries such as Iran. This study aims to explore the prevalence and patterns of polypharmacy among the elderly in Iran, using health insurance claims data to identify common drug classes and coprescribed medications, with a focus on informing policy decisions and improving medication management.

Retrospective population-based observational study.

Nationwide data from the Iran Health Insurance Organization (IHIO) across 24 provinces.

1 876 527 individuals aged 65 years and older, insured by the IHIO from 2014 to 2017. Individuals with incomplete demographic information or lacking medication records in the database were excluded from the analysis.

Prevalence and patterns of polypharmacy, demographic factors associated with polypharmacy, and common drug classes used. Medications were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system. Polypharmacy was defined as the use of five or more medications, with cumulative polypharmacy considering total drug use over time, and consecutive polypharmacy focusing on the frequency of monthly drug use. Logistic regression and association rule mining were applied to explore demographic factors and medication patterns associated with polypharmacy.

Of the study population, 74.9% experienced cumulative polypharmacy over 6 months and 64.6% over 1 month, with 7.6% experiencing consecutive polypharmacy. Females and those aged 75–79 were more prone to polypharmacy. Systemic glucocorticoids were the most commonly used medications (50.02%), followed by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (42.73%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (41.92%). Polypharmacy was most strongly associated with medications related to the alimentary tract and metabolism, cardiovascular system, nervous system and blood and blood-forming organs.

Polypharmacy is highly prevalent among the elderly in Iran, with significant variations by gender, age, insurance fund and region. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to manage polypharmacy and improve medication safety in this population.

This study used a large, nationwide dataset covering 38% of the Iranian elderly population, providing robust statistical power.

Cumulative and consecutive definitions of polypharmacy were employed, capturing different dimensions of medication use.

Association rule mining provided novel insights into common drug combinations and their implications for polypharmacy.

Limitations include the use of claims data lacking clinical details, such as adherence and reasons for prescriptions.

Our analysis did not account for non-prescription medications, such as over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, which may lead to an underestimation of polypharmacy prevalence.

Understanding the prevalence and patterns of polypharmacy is essential for developing strategies to manage this issue effectively. The Iran Health Insurance Organisation (IHIO), one of the principal insurers in Iran, covers about 50% of the population,13offering a valuable resource for large-scale data analysis. Using health insurance claims data provides a cost-effective method to investigate medication use patterns and polypharmacy across different demographics and regions. This study aims to explore the prevalence of polypharmacy and identify the most frequently used drug classes and coprescribed medications among the elderly in Iran, using health insurance claims data from 2012 to 2015. These insights are crucial for informing policy decisions and improving medication management systems to enhance patient outcomes and achieve sustainable development.

This retrospective population-based observational study analysed prescription data extracted from health insurance claims of individuals aged 65 years and older who were insured by the IHIO across 24 provinces of Iran. The study encompassed a period from 21 March 2014 to 19 March 2017. In total, 19 726 266 prescription records were extracted, representing data from 1 876 527 elderly individuals with complete demographic information and medication records. According to the 2016 census, there were 4 871 518 people aged 65 and older in Iran.14Therefore, this study covered approximately 38% of the Iranian elderly population.

The extracted data incorporated individuals’ date of birth, sex, province of residence, insurance fund, prescription date and medication records. Each insured individual was identified by a unique anonymised code, facilitating identification of multiple prescriptions for the same individual. As part of the data preparation process, we assessed the completeness of demographic variables and medication records in the database, which led to the exclusion of 3341 individuals with missing birth dates. To ensure the accuracy of age classification, we calculated individuals’ ages based on their date of birth relative to the prescription date. Only prescriptions where the recipient was aged 65 or older at the time of each prescription were included for analysis.

Our dataset initially included a broad spectrum of medications. However, after careful consideration and in consultation with an expert panel in gerontology, internal medicine and pharmacology, we excluded medications falling under specific ATC codes. These exclusions encompassed stomatological preparations (A01), blood substitutes and perfusion solutions (B05), topical anti-haemorrhoid (C05A) and anti-varicose drugs (C05B), hormonal contraceptives (G03A), immunoglobulins (J06), vaccines (J07), topical products for joint and muscular pain (M02), anaesthetics (N01), ectoparasiticides (P03), throat preparations (R02), respiratory stimulants and surfactants (R07), medications classified under ‘various’ (V) ATC group, topical dermatological agents, and local ophthalmological and otological agents (except for anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-glaucoma/miotic and mydriatic/cycloplegic agents). These exclusions were based on their predominant use in hospital settings, diagnostic applications, infrequent administration, lack of relevance to the elderly population, minimal interaction risks with other medications and negligible clinical significance. Ultimately, our dataset comprised 2298 drugs categorised under 789 unique ATC-5 codes after applying these exclusion criteria.

Based on the available data, measuring simultaneous polypharmacy was not feasible as it requires information on the duration of each drug’s administration. Additionally, using defined daily doses (DDD) was limited due to the lack of DDD information for many medications in the dataset and the discrepancy between DDD and national prescribing practices, which reduces its accuracy and generalisability. Therefore, we employed a cumulative definition of polypharmacy, considering the total number of different medications administered over a given period. For each individual, we calculated the number of different medications (based on ATC-5) received in 1-month and 6-month intervals. For individuals with multiple prescriptions, polypharmacy was assessed across all intervals generated from each prescription date. Individuals who received five or more different medications in at least one of these intervals during the 3-year study were identified as experiencing cumulative polypharmacy. To evaluate the severity of polypharmacy, we introduced a new definition: consecutive polypharmacy. This was defined as receiving five or more different medications every month or at least once every 2 months within a 6-month period. This definition focuses on prescription frequency rather than chronicity, as the drugs received consecutively could vary from month to month.

Quantitative variables were summarised using mean and ±SD, while categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages with 95% CIs. Prevalence rates of polypharmacy were calculated for various demographic and provincial groups, as well as for different drug classes based on ATC-1, stratified by polypharmacy status, age and sex. The associations between polypharmacy and various demographic factors, as well as consumption of different drug classes, were analysed using univariate and multiple logistic regression, with results reported as crude OR and adjusted ORs (AOR), all with 95% CI. The multiple logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, insurance fund and province.

Association rule mining was employed to identify commonly used drugs (based on ATC-4), drug combinations and their relation to polypharmacy. This data mining technique searches for frequent if-then patterns with significance assessed using Support, Confidence and Lift metrics.

We used different levels of the ATC classification system in this study, each chosen to fit the specific needs of our analyses. The ATC-5 level was used to define polypharmacy, as it provides the most detailed subclassification of medications, critical for identifying the use of multiple distinct drugs accurately. For logistic regression analysis, we applied the ATC-1 level, which organises medications into broad therapeutic groups, allowing us to focus on high-level patterns that influence polypharmacy without getting lost in detailed classifications. For association rule mining, we selected the ATC-4 level, which strikes a balance by grouping medications into clinically relevant therapeutic categories—detailed enough to uncover meaningful associations while remaining aggregated enough for the analysis to be manageable and interpretable.

The analysis was conducted using Python programming language V.3.11.4, with Pandas and NumPy libraries for data preparation, Matplotlib for visualisation, SciPy and statsmodels for statistical analysis, and mlxtend for association rule mining.

Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this research. This study used anonymised secondary data from national health insurance claims, precluding direct engagement with patients or members of the public.

The study assessed polypharmacy prevalence among 1 876 527 elderly individuals who received at least one prescription. Polypharmacy was evaluated using different time windows: cumulative polypharmacy over 6-month and 1-month periods, and consecutive polypharmacy over a 6-month period. The results, along with baseline characteristics of the study population, are presented intable 1.

Overall, 74.907% of the population experienced cumulative polypharmacy in a 6-month window, 64.554% in a 1-month window, and 7.615% experienced consecutive polypharmacy in a 6-month window. Females were more likely to experience polypharmacy across all measures compared with males. Age stratification revealed that polypharmacy prevalence increased with age, peaking in the 75–79 age group, while individuals aged 85 and older had the lowest rates of polypharmacy compared with all other age groups. Significant variations were also observed across different insurance funds, with the highest prevalence found in the ‘Other Social Strata’ group, while the ‘Foreign Citizens’ and ‘Rural’ groups had the lowest prevalences.

Table 2summarises drug usage and polypharmacy metrics by polypharmacy status. On average, the total population used 16.10 medications, compared with 3.29 medications for those not exposed to polypharmacy. In polypharmacy groups, usage increased significantly, with consecutive polypharmacy showing the highest average of 41.08 medications. Polypharmacy groups also had more prescriptions, with a mean of 13.44 for cumulative polypharmacy over 6 months and 36.29 for consecutive polypharmacy. The number of prescriptions with five or more drugs was notably higher in polypharmacy groups, especially in consecutive polypharmacy, which averaged 11.79. The mean number of drugs per prescription was similar across consecutive and cumulative polypharmacy groups.

Figure 1shows the distribution of drug consumption across main anatomical groups (ATC-1) by sex, age group and polypharmacy status. The most commonly used medications belonged to the alimentary tract and metabolism group (A). Females generally had higher consumption rates across most drug classes compared with males. However, males had higher consumption rates than females for anti-infectives (J), genitourinary drugs (G) and antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (L). Consumption patterns remained fairly consistent across age groups, increasing with age until declining after the 80–84 age group. However, consumption of antiparasitic products (P) consistently decreased with age. Individuals with consecutive polypharmacy exhibited higher consumption rates across all anatomical groups, while those without polypharmacy had lower consumption rates.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses are summarised intable 3. Females had significantly higher odds of experiencing polypharmacy compared with males, with 1.484 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.467 to 1.501) for consecutive polypharmacy. Among age groups, individuals aged 75–79 had the highest odds of consecutive polypharmacy compared with the 65–69 group (AOR=1.317, 95% CI: 1.297 to 1.338). However, the trend reversed in individuals aged 85 and older, who had significantly lower odds of polypharmacy (AOR=0.744, 95% CI: 0.728 to 0.761).

Adjustment variables: age group, sex, fund and province.

A, alimentary tract and metabolism; ATC, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification; B, blood and blood-forming organs; C, cardiovascular system; D, dermatologicals; G, genitourinary system and sex hormones; H, systemic hormonal preparations excluding sex hormones and insulins; J, anti-infectives for systemic use; L, antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents; M, musculoskeletal system; N, nervous system; P, antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents; R, respiratory system; S, sensory organs.

Insurance status also influenced polypharmacy risk. Compared with the Civil Servants fund, those in the Rural Fund and Iranian and Universal Health Insurance had lower odds of polypharmacy, while individuals in the Other Social Strata fund had a much higher risk. Foreign citizens had the lowest odds of cumulative polypharmacy (AOR=0.231, 95% CI: 0.214 to 0.249), but no cases of consecutive polypharmacy were observed in this group.

Logistic regression analysis revealed that having a prescription history of medications from certain main anatomical groups (ATC-1) was strongly associated with an increased likelihood of polypharmacy. Specifically, those with a prescription history from the alimentary tract and metabolism group (class A) were 29.711 times more likely (95% CI: 27.985 to 31.544) to experience consecutive polypharmacy compared with those who had never been prescribed medications from this class. Following class A, class C (cardiovascular system), class N (nervous system) and class B (blood and blood-forming organs) also showed strong associations, with AORs of 22.597, 11.463 and 9.272 for consecutive polypharmacy, respectively. For all drug classes, the AORs were lower than the crude ORs. In general, AORs for consecutive polypharmacy were similar to or lower than those for cumulative polypharmacy across most drug classes. However, exceptions were seen in classes A, C and N, where the ORs for consecutive polypharmacy were higher than those for cumulative polypharmacy.

The analysis revealed significant regional variation in polypharmacy across provinces (figure 2). Prevalence rates ranged from 60.69% (Hormozgan) to 80.85% (Isfahan) for cumulative polypharmacy and 2.76% (Hormozgan) to 13.60% (Ilam) for consecutive polypharmacy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Fars had the highest odds for cumulative polypharmacy (AOR=2.36), while Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari had the highest odds for consecutive polypharmacy (AOR=4.21), both in comparison to Tehran.

Table 4presents the most commonly used medications by pharmacological subgroup (ATC-4) overall and by polypharmacy status. Systemic glucocorticoids were the most commonly used overall (50.02%), followed by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (42.73%) and platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin (41.92%). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were the most prevalent in consecutive polypharmacy (83.54%), followed by platelet aggregation inhibitors (82.84%), while glucocorticoids were the most common in non-polypharmacy (18.26%) and cumulative polypharmacy (60.66%) groups. As shown intable 5, platelet aggregation inhibitors had the strongest association with organic nitrates (lift=2.01) and were coprescribed in 20.78% of the population. Additionally, platelet aggregation inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were strongly associated with each other, as well as with beta-blockers and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs). Glucocorticoids were also associated with acetic acid derivatives, third-generation cephalosporins and anilides.

The simultaneous presence of glucocorticoids and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in an individual’s prescription history showed the most prominent relationship with consecutive polypharmacy (confidence=20.6%, lift=2.71). Additionally, simultaneous consumption of ARBs with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (confidence=20.4%, lift=2.68) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (confidence=20.2%, lift=2.65) significantly increased the possibility of consecutive polypharmacy. Other medications, such as H2-receptor antagonists, third-generation cephalosporins, anilides, vitamin D and acetic acid derivatives, showed notable but less frequent associations with consecutive polypharmacy (table 6).

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and characteristics of polypharmacy among the elderly population in Iran over a 3-year period using IHIO claims data. Our findings revealed a high prevalence of polypharmacy among older adults, with approximately 75% of the study population being prescribed more than five different medications within a 6-month period. Additionally, one-third of these individuals (7.6% of the total population) experienced sustained exposure to polypharmacy, a measure we defined as consecutive polypharmacy. The analysis revealed significant demographic patterns, with females more likely to experience polypharmacy across all measures, and the highest prevalence observed in the 75–79 age group. There were also substantial variations in polypharmacy prevalence across different insurance funds and provinces, indicating the influence of socioeconomic and regional factors.

When comparing our findings to similar studies conducted in other countries, the prevalence of polypharmacy among the elderly in Iran is notably high but consistent with global patterns. In the same region, a retrospective analysis in Qatar in 2017 found a polypharmacy prevalence of 75.5% among older adults using Electronic Medical Records from primary healthcare centres over a 6-month period, closely matching our results.17Similarly, a 2016 study in Saudi Arabia found that 66.3% of those aged 60 and above were on five or more medications based on a 6-month study of outpatient electronic health records.18In East Asia, the highest prevalence was observed in Korea, where 86.4% of the elderly were affected, according to data from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service from 2010 and 2011.19In Tokyo, Japan, 63.5% of outpatients aged 75 and older were prescribed five or more drug types during a 6-month period in 2014.20In contrast, a study in Switzerland using 2016 health insurance claims data found that 50.4% of the elderly experienced polypharmacy during a 3-month period.21These comparisons highlight that the high prevalence of polypharmacy in Iran is part of a broader global trend, with variations likely due to differences in healthcare systems, prescribing practices and population health profiles.

Consistent with other studies, polypharmacy prevalence was significantly higher among females in our study,17 18 21 22though some studies have reported higher rates in males.19 20These inconsistencies may stem from differences in physicians’ prescribing attitude towards males and females,23 24as well as variations in health-seeking behaviours between sexes.25Polypharmacy is also strongly linked to non-communicable diseases and the number of chronic conditions.10 17An Iranian study using latent class analysis found females more likely to fall into cardiovascular-metabolic and cognitive-metabolic multimorbidity classes, both associated with polypharmacy.26Thus, the higher polypharmacy prevalence in females may be partly due to their greater burden of certain multimorbidities.

The most commonly prescribed drug classes associated with consecutive polypharmacy in our study included those related to the alimentary tract and metabolism, cardiovascular system, nervous system and blood and blood-forming organs. Specifically, vitamin D and analogues, H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors were frequently prescribed for alimentary tract and metabolism issues, while HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers and organic nitrates dominated cardiovascular prescriptions. In the nervous system category, anilides and benzodiazepines were prominent, and platelet aggregation inhibitors were common among drugs acting on blood and blood-forming organs. This pattern of medication use aligns with the chronic conditions prevalent in the elderly population.30Supporting our findings, a study in Tehran found that cardiovascular drugs accounted for 20.8% of all prescriptions among elderly patients, with a significant portion also receiving drugs for diabetes and nutritional supplements.31Additionally, the Pars Cohort Study in Iran highlighted that cardiovascular drugs, drugs acting on blood and blood-forming organs, and alimentary tract and metabolism drugs were the most frequently used among patients with cardiovascular diseases.32Consistently, association rule mining analysis in our study showed that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, ARBs and platelet aggregation inhibitors were most commonly used together in patients with polypharmacy.

Systemic glucocorticoids were the most prevalent pharmacological subgroup (ATC-4) in our study, with half of the elderly population having used them during the study period. This high prevalence is consistent with other studies that highlight the widespread use of glucocorticoids, particularly dexamethasone, among general physicians.11The popularity of glucocorticoids can be attributed to their rapid alleviation of disease symptoms, making them a favoured choice for both doctors and patients despite their well-documented side effects, including hypertension, weight gain, increased blood sugar, osteoporosis, mood swings, cardiovascular diseases, increased risk of infections and delay in diagnosis and treatment of diseases.33However, the frequent use of glucocorticoids is concerning, as overprescription exacerbates health risks for patients and increases healthcare costs by prolonging treatment and leading to additional complications. The high rate of glucocorticoid prescriptions may reflect a combination of factors, including gaps in physician knowledge, strong patient demand, limited access to alternative treatments and weak regulatory oversight.34Addressing these issues by enhancing physician education and improving regulatory frameworks is crucial to curbing the overuse of glucocorticoids and reducing their associated risks.

While prescribing multiple medications can be clinically justified and isn't inherently inappropriate, it does increase the risk of adverse drug events and healthcare costs. Polypharmacy also raises the concern of overtreatment, where medications offer little clinical benefit for the patient’s remaining lifespan or where the risks outweigh the potential benefits of additional treatments.35Our study sheds light on medication use patterns and polypharmacy, providing valuable insights for healthcare providers, emphasising the need for targeted interventions to manage and optimise medication use among the elderly. Implementing regular medication reviews, deprescribing strategies and, when appropriate, represcribing—the addition of beneficial medications that are often omitted—could help minimise the risks associated with both overtreatment and undertreatment.36,39In this context, structured tools such as the Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment/Screening Tool of Older Persons’ Prescriptions (START/STOPP) criteria and the Fit fOR The Aged (FORTA) list, which have demonstrated clinical benefits in randomised trials, offer promising patient-centred approaches. Unlike purely drug-oriented listing tools like the Beers criteria, these instruments consider both potentially inappropriate medications and potentially omitted medications, supporting a more holistic medication optimisation strategy known as represcribing.39Further research should focus on exploring the long-term impacts of polypharmacy on patient outcomes and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce inappropriate prescribing.

This study has several strengths, including the use of a large, nationwide dataset that allows for analysis with sufficient statistical power and provides a comprehensive overview of polypharmacy among the elderly in Iran. Furthermore, we employed association rule mining to investigate patterns of polypharmacy and identify drugs commonly used together, which is a novel method in this context and adds depth to our analysis. The focus on consecutive polypharmacy offers valuable insights into the persistence of polypharmacy, a critical factor in understanding its potential risks.

However, there are several limitations to consider. The use of claims data, while extensive, lacks detailed clinical information such as the rationale for prescriptions and patient adherence, which limits our ability to fully assess the appropriateness of polypharmacy. Additionally, our analysis did not account for non-prescription medications, such as over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, which may lead to an underestimation of polypharmacy prevalence. Another significant limitation is the lack of a standardised definition for polypharmacy across different studies. This variation in definitions makes it challenging to directly compare our findings with those from other research, as the criteria for what constitutes polypharmacy can differ widely. Finally, while our study is representative of the elderly population in Iran, the findings may not be fully generalisable to the entire population of interest, as our data were limited to elderly individuals covered by the IHIO who received at least one medication during the study period.

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of polypharmacy prevalence and patterns among the elderly population in Iran using health insurance claims data. The findings highlight the widespread occurrence of polypharmacy, with nearly three-quarters of the elderly experiencing cumulative polypharmacy and a smaller yet significant portion affected by consecutive polypharmacy. Polypharmacy was more common among females and those aged 75–79, with significant variations across insurance funds and provinces. The study underscores the significant role of specific drug classes, such as those related to the alimentary tract, cardiovascular system and nervous system, in driving polypharmacy. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of polypharmacy in the Iranian elderly population, providing a foundation for future research and policy initiatives aimed at improving medication safety and health outcomes in this vulnerable group.
