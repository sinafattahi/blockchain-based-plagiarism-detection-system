In this work, we introduce a novel Micro Circular Log-Periodic Antenna (MCLPA) optimized with an advanced Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN) algorithm, specifically designed to enhance terahertz (THz) radiation detection. By leveraging the adaptive capabilities of the ENN framework, the antenna design efficiency is significantly improved, enabling rapid prototyping and yielding highly optimized structures tailored for practical THz applications. Extensive characterization confirms that the proposed MCLPA achieves outstanding performance, including an ultra-broad operational bandwidth of 372 GHz (0.135–0.507 THz), a peak gain of 5.51 dBi, an optimalS-parameter (S11) of −13.68 dB, and a maximum radiation efficiency of 82.39%. In addition, the MCLPA exhibits superior sensitivity, low noise susceptibility, and fast response, which are key attributes for reliable and precise THz detection. When configured in array form, the design further enhances gain and directional responsiveness, demonstrating the scalability and deployment potential of the MCLPA. This ENN-driven MCLPA represents a significant breakthrough in THz antenna engineering, introducing a transformative design paradigm that synergistically integrates algorithmic intelligence with structural innovation. By substantially reducing design time and cost while achieving exceptional performance, the proposed ENN framework sets a new benchmark for the development of next-generation THz detection and communication systems, offering broad implications for future high-frequency technologies.

Terahertz (THz) radiation, situated between microwave and infrared bands, exhibits a unique set of electromagnetic properties that distinguish it from other spectral regions. THz is known for their non-ionizing characteristics, making them intrinsically safe for interaction with biological tissues and sensitive materials. Additionally, THz radiation can penetrate a wide variety of non-metallic and non-polar materials while remaining highly responsive to changes in material composition and structure. This dual capability of transmission and sensitivity enables precise probing of internal features without destructive impact1,2. Furthermore, THz waves are characterized by their short wavelengths, which support high spatial resolution in imaging and enable the miniaturization of integrated systems. From a spectral standpoint, many molecules and crystalline structures exhibit distinctive vibrational and rotational resonances in the THz range, offering rich spectral information for material identification and structural analysis. The inherently broad bandwidth and large available spectrum also make THz frequencies highly attractive for high-capacity signal transmission3,4. Collectively, these attributes define THz technology as a powerful platform for advanced sensing, precise imaging, and high-speed communication applications. The ongoing exploration and development of THz technology are catalyzing significant advancements across multiple disciplines, opening new avenues for scientific research and practical applications5–7.

Despite the remarkable potential of THz technology across various domains, its successful integration into practical systems hinges on the development of highly efficient and precisely engineered components, particularly in THz antenna design. As the primary interface for emitting and capturing electromagnetic radiation, the antenna exerts a decisive influence on key system attributes, including physical dimensions, operational bandwidth, and overall system performance8,9. However, the high-efficient THz antenna design continues to pose a major technical challenge, constrained by persistent limitations that hinder both scientific advancement and industrial deployment10,11. One fundamental issue stem from the extremely short wavelength of THz waves, which necessitate physically miniature antenna structures. These size constraints not only complicate fabrication but also degrade radiation efficiency due to increased material and surface losses12,13. In addition, achieving broadband operation across the THz spectrum is particularly difficult, as traditional antenna geometries often exhibit narrowband responses and poor frequency agility. The gain and impedance matching of conventional THz antennas are typically suboptimal, further limited by intrinsic material losses and the complexity of integrating them with other microscale or on-chip components2,14,15. These limitations indicate an urgent need for innovative antenna architectures that can simultaneously achieve compactness, broadband high gain, effective impedance matching, and enhanced radiation control. Addressing these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of THz technology in next-generation sensing, imaging, and high-speed communication systems.

To effectively address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a novel micro circular log-periodic antenna (MCLPA) architecture, structurally designed and optimized using an advanced evolutionary neural network (ENN) algorithm. The ENN algorithm has been extensively adapted and tailored in our study to suit the specific demands of THz antenna design, enabling efficient and precise tuning of critical variables. This advanced algorithm-driven design framework enables automated optimization of MCLPA structure, ensuring miniaturization, broadband operation and stable impedance matching across the targeted THz frequency range. The proposed ENN-guided MCLPA demonstrates an exceptional performance profile, achieving a wide 372 GHz bandwidth (0.135–0.507 THz), a peak gain of 5.51 dBi, an optimalS-parameter (S11) of −13.68 dB, and the maximum radiation efficiency of 82.39%, comprehensively demonstrating its broadband operation and efficient signal transmission. The compact architecture, coupled with the substantial overall system performance, enables highly responsive and reliable THz radiation detection. Comprehensive experimental evaluations including radiation-dependent electrical responses and signal-to-noise ratio analysis further validate the antenna’s high sensitivity and robust performance under realistic operational conditions. Additionally, the time-domain measurements validate rapid and consistent response of MCLPA to THz radiation, reinforcing the MCLPA’s suitability for advanced THz detection and imaging platforms. Moreover, the design’s inherent scalability, particularly in array configurations, significantly amplifies its gain and directional responsiveness, paving the way for integration into high-resolution and high-throughput THz systems.

By leveraging the geometric flexibility of the MCLPA architecture alongside the intelligent global optimization capabilities of the ENN framework, this study introduces an advanced, scalable and high-efficiency design paradigm that accelerates antenna development while preserving exceptional electromagnetic performance. The synergistic integration of structural innovation and advanced algorithmic optimization not only enhances the reliability and adaptability of THz antenna designs but also significantly improves design efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This innovation establishes a new benchmark in THz antenna engineering, offering a powerful and flexible framework for the development of next-generation THz sensing, imaging, and communication platforms across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.

This logarithmic decrement in frequency enhances the wideband characteristics of the antenna, which is essential for the practical applications requiring robust and continuous spectral coverage.

While conventional linear LPAs perform well over broad bandwidths, their adaptation to the THz regime introduces considerable challenges. Designed primarily for lower-frequency operation, these linear LPAs often require relatively large physical dimensions, complicating their integration into miniaturized systems, which is a key requirement in modern THz applications22,23. Furthermore, maintaining high performance at THz frequencies demands extreme precision in element spacing and alignment, significantly increasing fabrication complexity and cost. These constraints limit the practical applicability of traditional LPAs in scenarios that demand both compactness and economic scalability24–26. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the MCLPA architecture that reconfigures the conventional linear layout into a compact circular topology. This structural innovation preserves the essential broadband characteristics of the original design while dramatically enhancing spatial efficiency and integration potential. As illustrated in Fig.1b, c, a comparative analysis reveals that when the minimum element lengths and the distance between the first two elements are aligned for both the linear and circular configurations, the circular design results in a significantly more compact size. Notably, for 20 elements, the linear LPA occupies nearly twice the area required by the circular counterpart, clearly demonstrating the spatial advantage of the MCLPA. This compact geometry not only reduces the physical dimensions but also enables seamless integration with state-of-the-art THz detectors, offering a practical solution to advance the deployment of high-performance THz technologies in portable and embedded systems.

Although the MCLPA differs geometrically from conventional linear LPAs, it retains the fundamental principles outlined in Eqs. (1,2,3) comprising a sequence of scaled radiating elements to achieve wideband functionality. As illustrated in Fig.1d, e, the proposed MCLPA architecture features a sophisticated design framework, defined by a high-dimensional set of interdependent parameters. These include the number of elements(n), the scale factor(τ), the element widths proportion (β=WnRn−Rn+1), and a series of physical dimensions including lengths(L1,L2,…,Ln), radii(R1,R2,…,Rn), widths(W1,W2,…,Wn), as well as the angular parameters(α1,α2). While this intricate configuration enables compact integration and broadband operation without compromising electromagnetic performance, it also introduces substantial design complexity, rendering conventional trial-and-error or manual tuning approaches less effective at THz frequencies27,28. Leveraging recent advances in algorithmic intelligence, this study applies a customized ENN framework to address the complex design challenges associated with the MCLPA. While conventional approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been explored in antenna design, their application to intricate THz MCLPA structures is hindered by substantial computational costs and slow convergence, which primarily due to their reliance on extensive full-wave simulations in high-dimensional, nonlinear parameter spaces29,30. In contrast, the proposed ENN framework combines surrogate modeling with evolutionary strategies, substantially accelerating the optimization process while dramatically reducing the number of simulation evaluations required. This integrated approach enhances optimization efficiency, scalability, and robustness, making it particularly well-suited for the design of sophisticated THz MCLPA31–33.

The ENN algorithm, illustrated in Fig.2a, facilitates the optimization of the MCLPA design through a dynamic and iterative evolutionary process. The optimization begins with the generation of an initial population of 20 individuals, each encoding a unique configuration defined by specific geometric parameters and performance characteristics of the MCLPA. Subsequent optimization is governed by standard evolutionary operators including crossover, mutation, performance evaluation, and selection. Crossover promotes the exchange of favorable traits between high-performing designs to explore beneficial configurations in the solution space, while mutation introduces controlled stochastic variations to enhance diversity and prevent premature convergence to local optima. After performance evaluation, the top 5 high-performing candidates are selected based on a predefined fitness function. These elite individuals are retained directly, and new offspring are generated by applying crossover and mutation operations on them to replenish the population back to its original size of 20. This strategy ensures a balance between exploration and exploitation, maintaining diversity while preserving high-quality solutions. Following each evolutionary iteration, all top-rated candidates are validated via high-fidelity COMSOL simulations. The simulation results are then used to iteratively retrain the ENN model, continuously refining its predictive accuracy and guiding the optimization process toward globally optimal MCLPA designs.

The proposed ENN model adopts an efficient architecture consisting of five input neuronsn,τ,βandα1,α2, which define the fundamental geometric parameters of the MCLPA. The corresponding element lengths, radii and widths can be subsequently calculated using the scaling laws described in Eqs. (1) and (2). During the optimization of the proposed MCLPA via the advanced ENN framework, a well-defined search space for the input neurons was established to ensure convergence within practical manufacturing and operational constraints. Specifically, the number of elementsnwas restricted to the range of 1–10 to maintain structural compactness. The scale factorτwas restricted to the range of 0.7-0.95 to ensure the physically realizable progression of element dimensions. The element widths proportionβwas limited to values below 1, satisfying the conditionWn≤Rn−Rn+1, which ensures appropriate spacing between adjacent elements. The angular parametersα1andα2were confined within the range of 10 to 80 degree to preserve a balanced angular distribution. Furthermore, the aggregate angular coverage was constrained by the inequality2θ1+θ2<π, ensuring that the antenna geometry remains within a semi-circular domain. These carefully formulated search spaces guide the ENN’s search trajectory, enabling the generation of high-performance MCLPA designs that are not only electromagnetically efficient but also practically realizable.

Although fixed in the current implementation, the ENN framework offers considerable flexibility and can be effectively extended to application-specific tasks by adjusting the weight scheme and performance matrix.

The integration of a multi-objective fitness function within the ENN framework substantially enhances the optimization process by simultaneously assessing multiple performance metrics. This advanced approach subsequently enables each top-rated candidate antenna configuration to undergo comprehensive performance evaluation and iterative refinement. The optimization process continues for a minimum of 200 epochs and terminates early if neither the fitness score nor the mean square error (MSE) loss shows significant improvement over twenty consecutive epochs. The optimal geometric outcomes of this robust ENN-enhanced optimization process are detailed in Fig.2b, demonstrating the ENN algorithm’s high efficacy and robustness in tailoring geometric parameters of MCLPA. To rigorously assess the performance of our antenna design methodology, we conducted a comparative analysis between the proposed ENN framework and a conventional deep neural network (DNN) comprising four hidden layers. As depicted in Fig.2c, the fitness evolution in 200 training epochs demonstrates that the ENN achieves a steady and sustained improvement, ultimately surpassing the DNN at epoch 119. In contrast, the DNN exhibits a sharp initial increase in fitness but stagnates after epoch 75, indicating its susceptibility to premature convergence within the high-dimensional and nonlinear optimization landscape characteristic of the MCLPA design space. The training and testing loss trajectories for both models are presented in Fig.2d. In this context, the MSE loss function quantifies the deviation between the predicted and validated fitness values, guiding the model’s optimization process. Both models exhibit decreasing training and testing loss, reflecting improved predictive accuracy over time. However, the ENN demonstrates superior generalization, as evidenced by a continued reduction in testing loss until epoch 157, whereas the DNN’s testing performance plateaus after approximately 50 epochs. These findings underscore the ENN’s enhanced capability in navigating complex multi-objective design constraints and achieving robust optimization in THz antenna development.

The practical realization of the proposed structure is illustrated in Fig.2e, which presents the fabricated MCLPA prototype developed using the ENN framework. With a diameter near 5 mm, the antenna exhibits a highly compact form factor, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into portable and space-constrained THz platforms. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig.2freveals the high-precision microfabrication of the antenna, characterized by logarithmically scaled radiating elements extending radially from the center. This finely structured geometry is instrumental in achieving broadband operation and enhanced sensitivity, which are crucial for efficient THz radiation capture and transmission in next-generation imaging, sensing, and communication systems.

Figure3presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the evolutionary performance metrics over 200 training epochs for the ENN-optimized THz MCLPA. At each epoch, the critical performance indicators of all 20 unique antenna configurations were evaluated and recorded, including gain,S11,Y-parameter, VSWR, and the overall fitness score. The resulting plots capture the distribution of these performance metrics across a total of 4000 evaluated MCLPA instances, with error bars representing standard deviations and central markers indicating mean values. Collectively, this analysis offers a multidimensional perspective on the influence of geometric parameters on antenna behavior across the THz spectrum, and the evolution of fitness serves as a critical indicator of the overall performance and adaptability of the MCLPA. As illustrated in the bottom row of Fig.3, each subplot presents the relationship between the fitness score and specific geometric parameters, including the number of elements (n), the scale factor (τ), the element widths proportion (β), and the angular parameters (α1,α2). The fitness trajectory with respect tonreveals a generally increasing trend, reaching its maximum atn=8. This observation indicates a positive correlation between the number of radiating elements and the antenna’s overall performance within our experimental domain. The widening distribution of fitness values with increasingnfurther highlights the trade-off between performance improvements and the compactness or fabrication complexity of the antenna. Forτ, the fitness response exhibits pronounced variability across the tested range, underscoring the critical influence of inter-element scaling on antenna behavior. A gradual rise in average fitness is observed up to aroundτ=0.76, beyond which performance declines. Although a partial recovery is noted afterτ>0.87, the fitness values remain significantly below the earlier peak. Regardingβ, the results reveal a generally increasing fitness trend with larger element widths proportion. This suggests that broader elements improve the antenna’s efficiency in capturing THz radiation. The fitness distribution forα1reveals a distinct peak at 10 degree and remains relatively stable till 47.5 degree, beyond which the fitness values decline. This trend suggests that excessiveα1configurations may impair the formation of efficient radiation patterns or degrade impedance matching. In contrast, the response toα2shows a global fitness maximum around 62 degree, with a high-performance window between 60 and 70 degree. The broad spread in fitness values within this range illustrates the antenna’s sensitivity to variations inα2, reflecting its critical role in mediating electromagnetic interactions among the elements. The fitness metric serves as a comprehensive performance indicator, reinforcing the ENN’s effectiveness in optimizing complex geometric parameters to achieve superior antenna functionality. The observed correlations between fitness and individual parameters substantiate the algorithm’s capacity to converge toward optimal configurations, confirming the results previously illustrated in Fig.2b. These findings underscore the ENN’s precision and reliability in designing compact, broadband and high-performance antennas, marking a significant advancement in automated, algorithm-driven design methodologies. The successful implementation of this framework in the development of the MCLPA exemplifies a paradigm shift from conventional approaches to intelligent optimization strategies in THz antenna engineering.

To validate the structural robustness and material adaptability of the proposed MCLPA, we systematically evaluated its performance using two conventional antenna materials: copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al). A comprehensive comparative analysis was conducted throughout the characterization process as demonstrated in Fig.4a–d. In addition, we performed an extended tolerance analysis to assess the antenna’s resilience to material property variations and fabrication imperfections. This included ±10% deviations in the conductivity of Cu and Al, ±10% changes in substrate permittivity, and ±10% geometric scaling of the MCLPA structure. The results reveal that while material and fabrication tolerances tend to have a more pronounced negative effect at higher frequencies, the MCLPA consistently maintains stable and reliable performance across the 0.1-0.6 THz range, indicating its robustness for practical implementation.

Figure4aillustrates the frequency-dependent peak gain of the Cu- and Al-based MCLPAs across the 0.1–0.6 THz range. Both variants exhibit similar gain trends over the spectrum, with the Cu-based configuration consistently achieving slightly higher peak values. Notably, the Cu implementation attains a maximum gain of approximately 5.51 dBi at 0.5 THz, indicating its superior radiative efficiency. Figure4bpresents the correspondingS11performance. For both materials implementations,S11consistantly remains below −7.53 dB across the target THz band, indicating strong impedance matching. The Cu-based MCLPA demonstrates particularly strong performance, withS11values maintained below −10 dB from 0.135 to 0.507 THz, signifying a wide operational bandwidth. Notably, a peakS11of −13.68 dB is achieved, corresponding to 95.7% of the incident power being efficiently coupled into the antenna. These results highlight the MCLPA’s excellent broadband impedance characteristics and confirm its suitability for high-efficiency THz applications. Figure4cdisplays the real part of theY-parameter across the 0.1–0.6 THz frequency range. For the Cu-based MCLPA, theY-parameter remains within 0.0165 to 0.0283 S, while for Al, it ranges from 0.0157 to 0.0260 S. On average, both configurations exhibitY-parameter values centered around 0.02 S throughout the operational bandwidth. This stable input admittance is critical for consistent energy absorption and minimal transmission loss, thereby enhancing overall antenna efficiency across the target spectrum. Figure4dpresents the practical VSWR observed during operation, which remains consistently around a value of 2. This stable impedance matching behavior reinforces the performance trends indicated by theS11results. The minor deviation between the trends ofS11and VSWR arises from differences in their measurement perspectives, whereS11characterizes reflection at the port level, while VSWR represents impedance mismatches observed along the physical transmission line. Figure4edetails the radiation patterns of the Cu-based MCLPA in both theE-plane andH-plane across six representative frequencies within the 0.1–0.6 THz range. While certain deviations from ideal pattern symmetry are observed particularly at higher frequencies, these variations are typical characteristics of broadband log-periodic structures, where multiple resonant elements contribute concurrently to the radiation. Despite this complexity, the antenna maintains a well-defined main lobe between 0.1 and 0.6 THz, with steady angular directivity and moderate side lobe levels. Notably, the gain remains consistently strong across the band, demonstrating the proposed design’s robustness and applicability for high-resolution THz detecting systems that demand wideband operation.

Across the full 0.1–0.6 THz frequency range, the performance disparity between Cu-based and Al-based MCLPAs remains minimal, verifying the structural robustness and material tolerance of the proposed design. This consistency affirms the antenna’s reliability across commonly used THz conductor materials, ensuring broad applicability in diverse fabrication scenarios where material availability or compatibility may vary. Notably, the antenna maintains excellent impedance matching, stable admittance characteristics, and efficient signal transmission throughout the wide THz spectrum, these capabilities are a direct outcome of the advanced ENN-driven optimization framework, which enables precise tuning of complex geometric parameters to maximize electromagnetic efficiency. Collectively, the results position the proposed MCLPA as a broadband, high-performance, scalable solution for next-generation THz applications, exemplifying the practical and technical advantages of our ENN-driven antenna design strategy.

Following thorough evaluations, the novel MCLPA device, optimized using the advanced ENN algorithm, was fabricated for practical validation and testing. Figure5apresents a schematic of the THz signal detection process, and Fig.5bdetails the experimental setup, featuring meticulously arranged components applied to ensure precise THz signal capture and analyze. THz radiation was generated using a Newport Oriel 67030 blackbody source, with a radiation filter carefully positioned within the optical path to ensure that only radiation within the target spectrum range was received by the MCLPA. The MP-285 stage system facilitated precise positioning and angular adjustments of the device under tests, optimizing alignment with the THz radiation for accurate measurements. The MCLPA converts incident THz radiation into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to measurement devices including a Keithley 6500 multimeter and a LeCroy LT322 oscilloscope. On the other hand, to facilitate real-time detection and ensure precise time-domain analysis, weak electrical signals are initially amplified using our specially customized low-noise amplifier (LNA) for this MCLPA. The amplifier boosts signal amplitudes and reduces interference, incorporating a bandpass filter to minimize noise, thereby enhancing the clarity and quality of the detected signals. Subsequently, these enhanced signals are digitized via an analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) system, operated through an Arduino microcontroller. This digitization enables real-time signal processing and supports precise data collection and analysis, which are essential for evaluating and validating the antenna’s performance.

Figure5cdisplays the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for the THz MCLPA fabricated from both Cu and Al. The linearI–Vresponse from both materials confirms their ohmic behavior and excellent impedance matching. The Cu-based antenna shows a steeperI–Vresponse than the Al-based antenna, indicating better electrical performance for THz applications. Figure5ddisplays the voltage response of Cu and Al-based MCLPAs as a function of the THz radiation source temperature, ranging from 400 °C to 900 °C. The data demonstrates a distinct positive correlation between the source temperature and the voltage output for both materials. The Cu-based antenna consistently generates higher voltage outputs, with its voltage increasing from 7.86 µV to 13.90 µV as the radiation source temperature rises. In contrast, the Al-based antenna exhibits a relatively slower voltage increase, peaking at approximately 11.37 µV. These results illustrate the typical response of THz radiation detection systems, where higher temperatures enhance radiation intensity, thereby boosting signal output. Figure5eillustrates the variation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of radiation temperature for our MCLPA. Both materials show a steady improvement in SNR with increasing source temperature, indicative of the antennas’ effective design and performance. The Cu MCLPA demonstrates a notable SNR increase from 10.65 dB to 13.91 dB as radiation temperatures rise from 400°C to 900°C, and the Al MCLPA exhibits a growth from 10.25 dB to 12.88 dB in the same temperature range. The consistent growth in SNR across the temperature spectrum correlates with the increased intensity of THz radiation from the blackbody source, suggesting a stronger signal contribution relative to background noise as the source temperature rises. Figure5fillustrates the directional detection performance of the fabricated MCLPAs under obliquely incident THz radiation. In the experimental setup, the antenna was initially positioned at a 30° angle relative to the incident wave and mounted on a high-precision rotational stage. Voltage outputs were systematically measured at 60° rotational increments to evaluate angular sensitivity. Despite observable variations across different orientations, the MCLPA exhibits consistently strong detection capability, with the Cu-based prototype delivering higher and more stable signal output. This responsiveness indicates the antenna’s robustness and adaptability, suggesting its potential for integration in practical THz imaging and communication platforms where dynamic angle-of-incidence performance is critical. The results described in Fig.5gcapture the time-domain response of the MCLPA to cyclic THz radiation exposure, effectively simulating on and off states. Using the MP-285 stage system, the MCLPAs were periodically positioned within and removed from the path of the radiation beam. The captured THz signals were amplified, digitalized and then recorded for detailed analysis. The experimental data reveals a rapid rise in output voltage for both materials upon radiation exposure, with the Cu-based MCLPA reaching a peak of approximately 14.46 mV and the Al-based counterpart peaking at 12.03 mV. After the radiation source was turned off, the voltage levels for both quickly dropped to nearly zero. These results reveal the MCLPA’s robust time-domain response and reliability, indicating its applicability in dynamic THz environments like real-time detection. Additionally, all the above comparative results between Cu and Al-based MCLPA indicate the potential for material optimization in THz antenna design. This reveals a promising direction for further enhancements in MCLPA performance, warranting detailed exploration in future studies. Figure5hillustrates the MCLPA’s performance across the target frequency range, with a peak directivity of 5.27 dBi at 0.3 THz, supporting THz detection in practical scenarios with multidirectional incident radiation. Alongside, the radiation efficiency achieves an exceptional average of 69.75% across the target frequency spectrum, with peaks reaching as high as 82.39%. This impressive efficiency underscores the innovative antenna design and the advanced optimization process, which refine energy utilization and enhance power transfer in our MCLPA.

By configuring the proposed MCLPA into an array architecture, we achieved a substantial enhancement in its peak gain and directivity. As shown in Fig.5i, theE-plane radiation pattern of the 8×8 MCLPA array at 0.3 THz demonstrates the superior performance of our advanced MCLPA array. In this array configuration, each MCLPA is uniformly spaced by half the wavelength in both horizontal and vertical directions, forming a rectangular lattice. This layout represents a well-established compromise that effectively minimizes mutual coupling and suppresses sidelobes, as evidenced by the well-formed array radiation pattern and a main-to-side lobe ratio exceeding 11 dBi. Compared to the single-element MCLPA, the array demonstrates significantly enhanced angular selectivity and directional response, with a peak gain of 17.1 dBi attributed to the coherent radiation of multiple elements. This strategically arranged MCLPA array also yields a well-formed radiation pattern with dual-lobe coverage, delivering an optimal balance of gain, directivity, and angular symmetry across a wide field. Figure5jpresents the analysis of theS11andY-parameter for an individual MCLPA element within the 8 × 8 array configuration across the 0.1–0.6 THz frequency range. TheS11remains consistently below −10 dB across a wide spectral range with pronounced minima surpassing –15 dB at multiple frequencies, indicating strong impedance matching and minimal reflection. Simultaneously, theY-parameter maintains an average value near 0.02 S despite several fluctuations, reflecting stable input admittance and effective power coupling. The close alignment of lowS11, stable admittance values, and a well-formed array radiation pattern confirms that array integration does not introduce significant mutual coupling or impedance mismatch. These results affirm that the proposed array configuration preserves the intrinsic impedance characteristics of individual antenna elements while enhancing array-level performance in terms of gain and directionality. The broadband impedance integrity retained in the array further validates the effectiveness and robustness of the ENN-guided optimization strategy for both standalone and arrayed THz antenna systems.

Compared to previously reported state-of-the-art THz antenna architectures, the proposed MCLPA demonstrates a substantially broader operational bandwidth while maintaining strong gain performance and excellent impedance matching, underscoring its technical significance and practical applicability in advanced THz systems. As shown in Table1, conventional THz antennas based on patch, slotted, and waveguide designs typically achieve bandwidths ranging from 4.42 to 229 GHz, often constrained by limited spectral coverage or elevated reflection losses. In contrast, our antenna achieves an expanded bandwidth of 372 GHz (0.135–0.507 THz), representing a notable advance in fractional bandwidth among miniaturized THz antenna designs. This broad spectral range is realized alongside a peak gain of 5.51 dBi, an optimalS11of -13.68 dB, and the highest radiation efficiency of 82.39% across the operational band, demonstrating superior and well-balanced performance in the miniaturized THz antenna domain.

These integrated performance advantages are realized through the synergistic combination of compact structural innovation and intelligent algorithmic optimization, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ENN framework in refining antenna functionality, accelerating the design cycle, and reducing computational cost. The resulting MCLPA not only ensures robustness and consistency across the target frequency band but also exhibits exceptional suitability for advanced THz applications, including high-resolution imaging, ultrafast wireless communications, and precision detection systems. The novelty and efficacy of the proposed design methodology establish a transformative foundation for scalable THz antenna technologies, positioning our MCLPA as a leading solution in the evolving landscape of broadband, high-performance THz systems.

This work presents a novel Micro Circular Log-Periodic Antenna (MCLPA), systematically optimized using an advanced Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN) framework, marking a significant advancement in the field of THz engineering. This novel methodology not only accelerates the antenna design process but also ensures robust and high-performance outcomes.

Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that the ENN-guided MCLPA achieves an exceptional balance of ultra-compact form factor, wideband operation, and superior performance. The close agreement between measured and simulated results validates the reliability and predictive accuracy of the proposed design approach. Notably, the antenna achieves a remarkable 372 GHz bandwidth (0.135–0.507 THz) alongside a peak gain of 5.51 dBi, an optimalS11of −13.68 dB, and a maximum radiation efficiency of 82.39% across the operational band, establishing a benchmark for miniaturized THz antennas with broad bandwidth. Further performance evaluations, including radiation temperature-dependent electrical responses, signal-to-noise ratio analysis and the time-domain response confirm the antenna’s high sensitivity and stable performance in real-world THz detection scenarios. Time-domain measurements also reveal rapid and reliable signal acquisition, reinforcing its suitability for advanced sensing and imaging applications. Comparative studies involving Cu- and Al-based prototypes underscore the design’s robustness and material adaptability, while the implementation of an 8×8 antenna array significantly enhances gain and directivity. These findings collectively establish the proposed ENN-optimized MCLPA as a highly scalable and efficient solution for next-generation THz systems, offering transformative potential in accurate THz detection.

Looking ahead, our research will focus on further refining the ENN framework to accelerate convergence and enhance the precision of the optimization, thereby enabling broader adaptability across diverse design tasks. We also aim to seamlessly integrate the MCLPA with state-of-the-art THz detectors to establish a unified, high-efficiency platform for real-time detection and imaging. Furthermore, recognizing the influence of material-dependent properties, we will explore the use of advanced nanomaterials for micro-scale MCLPA fabrication. These materials are anticipated to unlock new regimes of sensitivity and operational efficiency, driving the development of intelligent, high-performance THz systems.

Overall, this work not only delivers a high-efficient antenna design paradigm for THz applications, but also exemplifies the transformative robustness and precision of integrating advanced algorithms in the sophisticated, multifunctional, and customizable THz antenna design. This synergistic methodology establishes a reliable and generalizable foundation for development in next-generation THz detection, imaging, and wireless communication systems.

Our MCLPA features dual-material architecture, combining a Cu-based radiating structure and feedline with an Al circular ring reference element. This configuration strategically exploits the high electrical conductivity of Cu for efficient THz absorption, while utilizing Al’s lightweight properties to maintain structural balance and integration flexibility. A low-loss PCB with a pre-deposited high-frequency connector interface was cleaned using an ultrasonic isopropanol (IPA) bath, followed by nitrogen drying to remove surface contaminants. The Al circular reference ring was deposited using electron beam (E-beam) evaporation at a rate of approximately 2 A/s under a vacuum pressure of3.9×10−7Torr, yielding a uniform thickness of 200 nm. The antenna geometry was precisely defined through a custom-designed mask, allowing accurate pattern transfer of the MCLPA structure onto the substrate. The Cu antenna layer was subsequently deposited via E-beam evaporation, forming a 300 nm thick film. Post-deposition, the antenna undergoes a final cleaning process to eliminate residual chemicals or particulates, thereby preserving surface quality and electrical integrity. The Cu feedline is then connected to the connector using the high-conductivity solder to ensure stable electrical interfacing. The completed device is mounted on a dielectric holder to minimize external interference. Final inspection includes SEM imaging to verify the fidelity of geometric alignment and deposition accuracy. This robust and reproducible fabrication workflow ensures high-performance, application-ready THz antennas with excellent mechanical stability, optimized impedance matching, and integration compatibility for advanced THz systems.

To characterize the structure of our MCLPA, we employed a JEOL JSM-7200F SEM with settings of 10.0 kV voltage and a 10 nA beam current. During the characterization process, a Newport Oriel 67030 blackbody source was used, and an optical cutoff lens was applied to filter frequencies, thereby minimizing spectral interference for the detailed MCLPA analysis. The measurement equipment comprised a Keithley Model 6500 digital multimeter and a LeCroy LT322 oscilloscope, which ensured precise data acquisition. The experimental setup maintained a 10 cm distance between the MCLPA and the source throughout the experiments.
