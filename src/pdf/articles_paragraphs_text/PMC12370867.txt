Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can significantly impact patients’ life, leading to long-term complications. Cellular senescence plays a significant role in the occurrence and development of enteritis. The purpose of this study is to identify a specific drug and potential target that can inhibit intestinal cell senescence, thereby improving the clinical outcomes of enteritis. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the drug and target that associated with cellular senescence and ulcerative colitis. LPS-induced in vitro models and DSS-induced in vivo colitis models were used to confirm the association between colitis and aging, as well as the ability of the drug to alleviate colitis symptoms. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that Fenretinide (4-HPR) may influence the progression of ulcerative colitis by targeting LCN2 to modulate cellular senescence. Western blot analysis revealed high expression of LCN2 in patients with ulcerative colitis (p- value < 0.05). In the in vivo experiments utilizing a DSS-induced colitis model, 4-HPR was shown to be both safe and effective in inhibiting colitis progression. Western blot analysis indicated the downregulation of the senescence markers P16 and P21 following 4-HPR treatment (adjustedp-value < 0.0001). Moreover, β-galactosidase staining of intestinal tissues revealed a reduction in the accumulation of senescent cells in the 4-HPR-treated group compared to the DSS group (adjustedp-value < 0.0001). The potential mechanism might be related to the regulation of the Treg/Th17 balance. 4-HPR reduced the intestinal cell senescence by inhibiting the expression of LCN2 that alleviated the symptoms of ulcerative colitis.

Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a lifelong inflammatory disease that affects the rectum and colon to varying extents. It was estimated that there were 5 million cases of UC worldwide in 2013, and the incidence of UC is on the rise globally [1]. Genome-wide studies have identified multiple genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease, which are involved in pathways related to intestinal barrier function and T-cell immunity [2,3]. The pathogenesis of UC is complex, with intestinal barrier dysfunction playing a critical role in disease progression [4,5]. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents such as infliximab, adalimumab and cytokine inhibitors are the biologics used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [6].

Cellular senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest induced by various stress factors. Senescent cell accumulation in various tissues promotes chronic inflammation that accelerates age-related dysfunctions [7]. The senescence of intestinal epithelial cells refers to the gradual decline in physiological function and structural integrity of these cells, a process that is associated with multiple factors. Wang Z et al. have previously found that aging significantly affects the persistent fucosylation of the apical surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells, thereby creating a favorable environment for tumor growth [8]. The chronic inflammatory response in UC patients accelerates the process of cellular senescence. DNA damage and oxidative stress caused by chronic inflammation are important inducers of cellular senescence [9].

In our study, we employed bioinformatics analysis to identify key genes associated with UC and cellular senescence, and conducted drug enrichment analysis for these key genes. Subsequently, we utilized both in vivo and in vitro experiments to verify our hypotheses and to preliminarily explore the underlying mechanisms.

The data used for our analysis were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). We selected gene expression profiles from GEO datasets (GSE134025,GSE42911,GSE87473) that composed of 124 samples in total. The expression data were normalized and integrated by the “limma” and “sva” package in R. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to enhance the accuracy of different sample data.

“limma”, “dplyr”, “pheatmap”, “ggplot2” packages in R were utilized for differential expression analysis of gene expression data. The filtering criteria for differentially expressed genes was set as |log2FC|> 1 andp-value < 0.05. The genes related to cellular senescence were obtained from the database of cell senescence genes (http://genomics.senescence.info/cells/). “VennDiagram” was applied to draw Venn diagrams displayed the intersecting genes between differentially expressed genes in UC and cellular senescence genes.

To elaborate understand the roles of the intersecting genes in different biological processes, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the “clusterProfiler”, “org.Hs.eg.db”, “enrichplot”, “ggplot2”, “GOplot”, “circlize”, “RColorBrewer”, “ComplexHeatmap” R packages. “clusterProfiler”, “org.Hs.eg.db”, “enrichplot”, “ggplot2” R packages was used for KEGG enrichment analysis to determine which pathways these genes are significantly enriched in.

We conducted protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis on the intersecting genes using the STRING website (http://cn.string-db.org/), excluding unbound proteins from downstream analysis. Cytoscape software was employed for visualizing the PPI networks, with upregulated and downregulated genes distinguished by different colors. The MCODE plugin in Cytoscape was used to generate subnetworks, while the CytoHubba plugin and the UpSetR package were utilized to identify and visualize hub genes within these networks. Additionally, we constructed networks of hub genes using the GeneMANIA database (http://genemania.org/). A Perl script was employed to predict miRNAs that bind to the hub genes. The spongSPAN tool and Perl scripts were used to identify IncRNAs that interact with these miRNAs. The ceRNA regulatory network of the hub genes was constructed using Cytoscape software. The TRRUST database (http://www.grnpedia.org/trust/) and a Perl script were utilized for the enrichment analysis of transcription factors associated with the hub genes and for constructing the transcription factor regulatory network. Finally, Cytoscape software was used to visualize the transcription factor regulatory network of the hub genes.

DSigDB database (http://dsigdb.tanlab.org/) was utilized to obtain the relationships between drugs and genes. “clusterProfiler”, “org.Hs.eg.db”, “enrichplot”, “ggplot2” packages in R were applied to drug enrichment analysis. To conduct molecular docking, we downloaded the 3D conformers of the drugs from the PubChem database (http://pubchem.ncbi.nih.gov/) and protein structure from RCSB database (http://www.rcsb.org/). CB-DOCK2 website (http://cadd.labshare.cn/cb-dock2/index.php) was employed to generate protein–ligand docking diagram.

The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 was obtained from the ATCC, the experimental cells were first maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37℃ and 5% CO2. For the LPS (MedChemExpress) group, Caco-2 cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h.

Total RNA from tissue cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted using SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme), with GAPDH as the internal control, primer oligonucleotide sequences are as follows. To delineate the mechanistic pathway, P21 and P16 expression levels were assessed after LPS stimulation in the presence or absence of either the LCN2 inhibitor ZINC00640089 (MedChemExpress) or 4-HPR (MedChemExpress). qRT-PCR was also employed to verify the overexpression of LCN2 in CD4+cells.

To detect the expression level of LCN2 in UC, the tissue samples from four UC patients were collected to detect the expression of LCN2. The intestinal tissues of mice in the in vivo experiments were used to detect the expression of P16, P21, and LCN2. The tissues were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. After BCA quantification, the samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed, transferred onto PVDF membranes, blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4℃. The next day, the membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with a secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) one hour at the room temperature.

Animal experiments were performed in the Laboratory Animal Center of Peking University First Hospital. We performed a dose-ranging study of 4-HPR in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, MP Biochemica)-induced acute colitis mouse model. Healthy male C57BL/6 J mice aged 8 weeks (n = 5) were used as experimental mice in vivo studies. We randomly assigned mice into five groups, which respectively received the following treatments for 7 consecutive days: normal drinking water (Control), 3% DSS drinking water (DSS), 3% DSS drinking water + 4-HPR (25 mg/kg), 3% DSS drinking water + 4-HPR (50 mg/kg), and 3% DSS drinking water + 4-HPR (100 mg/kg). 4-HPR was intraperitoneally injected every day in treated group. During the 7-day experimental period, we continuously monitored body weight and inflammatory scores in mice, with colon length measurements obtained following sacrifice at study termination. Following dose optimization, 4-HPR was re-administered in the murine acute colitis model, with consistent evaluation criteria. All mice were divided into three groups: Control group, DSS group, DSS with 4-HPR (50 mg/kg) treated group. During the whole experimental period, disease progression was systematically evaluated through daily assessment of colitis severity markers: Body weight variation (expressed as percentage change from baseline); Stool characteristics (scored 0–3: 0 = formed pellets, 3 = liquid diarrhea); Fecal occult blood (graded 0–3: 0 = negative, 3 = gross bleeding). Peripheral blood was collected from the mice prior to euthanasia, and biochemical indicators (AST, ALT, BUN, CREA) were measured for safety assessment.

Intestinal permeability was evaluated using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 (FD4, Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, mice were fasted for 12 h before oral gavage of FD4 (500 mg/kg), diluted in PBS. After 4 h, Blood from the eyeballs was collected in the anticoagulant tube. FD4 levels in serum were quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 492/520 nm. A standard curve was generated using serially diluted FD4 to calculate sample concentrations. In addition, LPS levels in the serum were determined by mouse lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ELISA kit (CUSABIO).

The colon tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning at 5 μm thickness. The sections were deparaffinized and subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological observation under a microscope, with representative fields of view selected for analysis. We evaluated histopathological changes using the scoring criteria [10]. The scoring system evaluated from three pathological parameters: crypt architecture (0: normal structure; 1: slight loss of crypt fossae; 2: majority of crypt fossae missing; 3: severe crypt fossae loss), inflammatory cell infiltration (0: normal tissue architecture; 1: mild infiltration; 2: moderate infiltration; 3: severe/dense infiltration), and muscle layer thickening (0: normal muscularis propria; 1: mild hypertrophy; 2: moderate hypertrophy; 3: marked hypertrophy). Each parameter is scored independently on a 4-point scale (0–3). The total histopathological score was calculated by summing the individual scores of three parameters.

To explore the Intestinal epithelial barrier function, the intestinal tissues were embedded and sectioned. These slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated, antigens were retrieved using pH 9.0 Tris–EDTA buffer. Slides were blocked and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse ZO-1 and Occludin antibody (Thermo Fisher) overnight at 4℃. The slides were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies Goat anti-rabbit Alex Fluor 488 and 647 (Thermo Fisher) and the nuclear counter stain was DAPI (Thermo Fisher).

Fresh colon tissues were processed into cryosections at 8–10 μm thicknesses. Tissues were fixed with β-galactosidase staining fixative at room temperature for 20 min, followed by three 5-min PBS washes. Sections were incubated with sufficient β-galactosidase solution at 37 °C in the dark overnight. Then sections were washed twice with PBS and twice with distilled water. Nuclear counterstaining was performed using Nuclear Fast Red (G1035, Servicebio) for 3 min, followed by three water rinses. Dehydration was achieved via two 5-min ethanol (100%) incubations, cleared in xylene (5 min), and mounted with neutral resin. Senescent cells were identified by cytoplasmic blue puncta.

The spleens of the mice were ground and then red blood cell lysis buffers were added and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min. The isolated cells were incubated with anti-CD3-APC (BioLegend), anti-CD4-PE (BioLegend), anti-CD45-FITC (BioLegend), anti-FOXP3-BV421 (BioLegend), anti-RORγt-BV650 (BD Biosciences) and 7AAD. The distribution of Th17 and Treg cells in CD4+T cells was calculated.

IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10 and IL-17A were measured using cytokine-specific ELISA kits (Elabscience). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, standards, blanks, and samples were added to a pre-coated microplate and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Then 100 µL of biotinylated detection antibody working solution was added, followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The plate was washed three times and then incubated with 100 µL HRP conjugate working solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Following five additional washes, 90 µL substrate reagent was added, and the reaction proceeded for 15 min (protected from light). The enzymatic reaction was stopped with 50 µL stop solution, and absorbance was immediately measured at 450 nm using a pre-warmed microplate reader.

When comparing data between two groups, if both groups follow a normal distribution and have equal variances, the t-test is used for statistical analysis; otherwise, the non-parametric rank sum test(e.g., Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is employed. When comparing data across multiple groups, if the data meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s or Dunnett post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons is used for statistical analysis. The Tukey test is employed when pairwise comparisons of mean differences among three or more groups are required. The Dunnett test is utilized when multiple treatment groups need to be compared with a single control group. If these conditions are not met, non-parametric tests (e.g., the Kruskal–Wallis H test) followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons should be applied. (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001, **** < 0.0001).

PCA effectively reduced the data dimensionality and mitigated batch effects, as illustrated in Fig.1A. The differential expressed genes between the UC and Control groups were shown in Fig.1B. In Fig.1C, a heatmap was utilized to illustrate the most significantly altered differentially expressed genes. Notably, LCN2 expression was markedly upregulated in the UC cohort. Then, we cross-linked the DEGs with Cellular senescence genes to yield 24 differentially expressed genes (Fig.1D).

We conducted the GO and KEGG enrichment analysis to explore the potential functions and mechanisms between UC and cellular senescence (Fig.1E,F). GO enrichment analysis revealed that the overlapping genes are primarily implicated in biological processes such as muscle cell proliferation and the regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation. Inflammatory mediators exert a direct influence on the functionality of colonic smooth muscle, resulting in diminished contractile force [11]. The inflammatory microenvironment in UC generates a substantial amount of ROS, leading to oxidative stress, which in turn induces senescence in smooth muscle cells [12]. At the cellular-component level, these genes are enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and the collagen-containing extracellular matrix. In terms of molecular function, the genes are associated with cytokine activity, G-protein-coupled receptor binding, transcription coregulator binding, and related functions. Various cytokines released during the inflammatory response, such as IL-17A, can attenuate intestinal motility by inducing the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages [11].

The KEGG analysis pinpointed significant enrichment of these genes in pathways such as TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway and Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. These signaling pathways play a significant role in both the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and the process of cellular senescence. The level of TNF is significantly elevated in UC, leading to exacerbated intestinal inflammation and mucosal damage. TNF can facilitate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, enhance vascular permeability, and induce apoptosis of epithelial cells, thereby disrupting the intestinal barrier [13,14]. In addition, chronic inflammation and sustained TNF signaling can induce premature cellular senescence, leading to cellular dysfunction and tissue damage. Senescent cells release various pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF, through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), further exacerbating the inflammatory response and creating a vicious cycle [15].

The protein–protein interaction network of the intersecting genes was shown in Fig.2A, where 3 genes were downregulated in UC and 20 genes were upregulated in UC (protein that is not connected to any other protein in the network was excluded from the analysis), meanwhile, the subnetworks were displayed in Fig.2B. We conducted 16 core genes and performed the networks of hub genes from GeneMANIA database (Fig.2C,D), the hub genes were IL6, MMP9, CCL2, CXCL1, PPARG, STAT1, LCN2, FOS, CXCR2, MMP7, TWIST1, WNT5A, IGFBP5, IL24, PLA2G2A, IFI16. We conducted the ceRNA regulatory network of hub genes by Cytoscape software as shown in Fig.2E. The transcription factor regulatory network of hub genes was shown in Fig.2F.

The result of drug enrichment analysis was shown in Fig.3A-4-HPR was predicted to act on targets such as LCN2, IGFBP5, IL24, PPARG. We conducted the molecular docking between Fenretinide and LCN2 (Fig.3B).

We validated the high expression of LCN2 in patients with UC using the external datasetGSE92415(Fig.3C). qPCR results showed that the expression levels of P21, P16 and LCN2 that related to cellular senescence were all upregulated in Caco-2 cells after the treatment of LPS (Fig.4A). The differentially expressed LCN2 between the normal and UC tissues were shown in Fig.4B. The WB results showed that the expression level of LCN2 was up-regulated in UC tissues. To validate the pharmacological function, the experiment employed a selective LCN2 inhibitor and compared its effect with that of 4-HPR. The results demonstrated that both 4-HPR and the LCN2 inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of P16 and P21, with 4-HPR exhibiting a superior effect (Fig.4C).

Mice in the low-dose 4-HPR group showed a slight increase in colon length, while both the medium-dose and high-dose 4-HPR groups demonstrated significant amelioration of DSS-induced colon shortening. However, no significant difference was observed between these two dose groups (Fig.4D,E). All treatment groups experienced body weight loss compared to controls (Fig.4F). The DSS group showed the most pronounced reduction, whereas 4-HPR attenuated this effect in a dose-dependent manner, with medium and high doses exhibiting the least weight loss. Consistent with body weight and colon length changes, the DSS group showed the highest DAI scores (Fig.4G). 4-HPR treatment dose-dependently reduced these scores, with medium and high doses achieving similar effectiveness, demonstrating clear therapeutic efficacy.

In the mouse model, we performed grouped interventions using intraperitoneal injection of 4-HPR, with the experimental design schematic shown in Fig.5A. 4-HPR treatment markedly attenuated DSS-induced colitis symptoms relative to the DSS model group, including improved colon length preservation (Fig.5B,C), reduced weight loss and DAI scores (Fig.5D,E). Through HE staining analysis, we found that compared to the DSS model group, the 4-HPR treatment group alleviated intestinal tissue damage (Fig.5F,G).

The results of serum FITC-dextran 4 KD concentration and LPS concentration of three groups showed that the DSS group had a higher level of secretion (Fig.5H, I). We proceeded immunofluorescence experiments to investigate whether 4-HPR had a protective effect on intestinal epithelial barrier function. As shown in Fig.5J, the expression levels of ZO-1 and Occludin in the DSS group were lower than those in the control group and the 4-HPR group, in addition, the DSS group exhibited more severe morphological damage.

The WB results showed that after 4-HPR administration, the expression of senescence markers P16 and P21 in the intestinal tissue was reduced, and the expression level of LCN2 was also downregulated (Fig.6A). Then SA-β-gal staining was performed on colon tissues from all three experimental groups (Fig.6B). Distinct blue staining was observed in the DSS-treated group, indicating significant senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. In contrast, minimal detectable staining was observed in both the control group and the 4-HPR + DSS group. The biochemical blood analysis revealed that the hepatic and renal functions of the mice were not significantly affected following treatment with 4-HPR (Fig.6C).

The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the DSS group were significantly higher than those in the control group and the treated group, indicating that 4-HPR alleviated the systemic inflammatory response in mice (Fig.7A). The fresh spleen tissues were digested into the single-cell suspensions to detect the distribution of Th17/Treg by flow cytometry analysis. Following exclusion of doublets in the FSC/SSC plot, live cells were gated as 7-AAD−, CD45+leukocytes were then selected, and CD3+T cells were subsequently identified. Within the CD3+gate, CD4+cells were delineated and further subdivided into Foxp3+and RORγt+populations (Fig.7B). There was an increase in the Treg cells, additionally, the population of Th17 cells in treated group was less than DSS group (Fig.7C).

To investigate the role of LCN2 in the treatment, we generated LCN2-overexpressing CD4+T cells via transduction with a lentiviral vector (Fig.7D). The ELISA results showed that the balance of Th17/Treg was affected after the overexpression of LCN2 (Fig.7E).

Recent studies from various perspectives have concluded that inflammation is a common hallmark of aging tissues [16]. Currently, the most commonly used marker of senescence is SA-β-gal, which is closely related to the lysosomal stress response [17]. In addition, P16, P21 and P53 can be used as auxiliary markers [18]. There are various theoretical studies on the mechanisms underlying the continuous increase of inflammatory markers during the aging process.

Oxidative stress is closely related to inflammaging. Oxidative stress can lead to DNA damage and the oxidative modification of proteins and lipids, which in turn trigger inflammatory responses. De La Fuente proposed an oxidation-inflammatory theory of ageing and proposed that the intracellular mechanisms are related to the activation of the NF-κB pathway in immune cells [19]. During the process of inflammation, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α and IL-6) are significantly elevated, and these cytokines play an important role in inflammaging.

There is a close interaction between cellular senescence and inflammation. Cellular senescence can trigger inflammatory responses, while chronic inflammation, in turn, accelerates cellular senescence [20]. How to reduce cellular senescence through drugs to alleviate inflammation is currently a research hotspot.

4-HPR has demonstrated clear effects in certain diseases. 4-HPR has demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against a range of flaviviruses, such as the dengue virus [21]. Paola Tiberio et al. found that 4-HPR might be a promising chemosensitizing agent in acute myeloid leukemia therapy [22]. A clinical trial found that 4-HPR has some therapeutic effects on advanced malignant tumors [23].

A study has shown that the expression level of LCN2 is significantly increased in senescent alveolar type II cells and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, the researchers used mouse models and primary cells to demonstrate that aging can inhibit the initiation and progression of lung cancer by reducing the stemness of alveolar type II (AT2) cells, which is directly suppressed by functional iron deficiency caused by the overactivation of the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis [24]. Qingchen Zhu et al. found that LCN2 is highly expressed in senescence-like neutrophils (RLSNs), which are more commonly found in the tumor microenvironment of male bladder cancer patients and exhibit strong immunosuppressive effects [25]. In the Parkinson’s disease model, the cGAS-STING-YY1 axis exacerbates neurodegenerative changes in PD model mice by promoting the expression of LCN2 to regulate the senescence of astrocytes [26]. Also, a study utilized the HEK-293 cell line and transfected it with a recombinant plasmid containing an LCN2 fragment. The study found that LCN2 promotes cell proliferation under normal culture conditions, but under oxidative stress conditions, the increased expression of LCN2 leads to cellular senescence [27].

Our study linked 4-HPR with the regulation of LCN2 and cellular senescence. We found that 4-HPR targets on LCN2 to alleviate intestinal cell senescence in UC patients, thereby reducing inflammatory responses and maintaining intestinal barrier function.

The etiology and pathogenesis of UC are still not fully understood, involving multiple factors such as environment, genetics, gut microbiota, and intestinal immune regulation. Among them, the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells is one of the important mechanisms for the onset of UC, affecting both the occurrence and progression of UC. Xin V Li et al. have proposed that an increased proportion of Th17 cells can serve as an effector indicator for UC and used this to explore the pathogenic role of fungi in UC [28]. A study has shown that Treg cells (regulatory T cells) play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and suppressing inflammation. Research indicated that Treg cells alleviated intestinal inflammation by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10 and TGF-β) and inhibiting the activity of pro-inflammatory cells (such as Th17 cells) [29].

In conclusion, our research suggests that 4-HPR may reduce intestinal cell senescence through inhibition of LCN2 activity, which is associated with alleviation of ulcerative colitis symptoms. A potential underlying mechanism could involve LCN2-mediated regulation of the Treg/Th17 balance. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms and pathways involved have not been fully elucidated in this study and require further investigation in future research. Moreover, for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, monotherapy may not be adequate to achieve disease control [30]. The potential benefits of combining 4-HPR with other anti-inflammatory agents in such cases remain to be determined.
