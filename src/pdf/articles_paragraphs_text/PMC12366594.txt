Central venous catheters (CVCs) are commonly used in intensive care but should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed to reduce infection risk. Peripheral venous access then becomes necessary, but can be challenging due to oedema. Near-infrared light devices, simple non-invasive tools, may assist nurses in this procedure. We hypothesise that a near-infrared light device (AccuVein AV500) could improve the first-attempt success rate of peripheral venous catheter (PVC) placement in intensive care patients no longer requiring a central catheter.

This investigator-initiated, prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled superiority trial compares the near-infrared light device to the landmark approach for PVC insertion in critically ill patients with an existing CVC. A total of three hundred and eighty patients are to be randomised in two parallel groups with a stratification on centre and anticipated difficulty of peripheral venous access.

The study objective is to compare the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement in adult critical care patients for whom a central catheter is no longer indicated.

The protocol and amendments have been approved by the French ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Ouest et Outre Mer II, Toulouse, France, number 2023-A00429-36), and patients are included after informed consent. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

This is a multicentre, randomised, superiority trial evaluating a near-infrared light device compared with the landmark approach in critically ill patients with an existing central venous catheter.

Stratified randomisation by centre and anticipated difficulty ensures balanced allocation and methodological robustness.

The intervention is protocolised, and all critical care nurses have been trained on the device prior to study initiation.

Blinding is not possible due to the nature of the intervention, which is an inherent limitation of the design.

Other parameters, such as infection monitoring within 7 days of success and patient pain, are also assessed.

Near-infrared light devices and transilluminators have been developed to assist nurses in PVC insertion and have mainly been studied in the paediatric population, with heterogeneous results.17,27However, in the subpopulation of difficult-to-insert patients, these devices appear to improve infusion success compared with the traditional method.19,21These techniques also appear to improve success when performed by less experienced nurses.23 24The near-infrared light device is a non-invasive technique that uses infrared spectroscopy to project a real-time vein map onto the patient’s skin. Depending on the model, infrared light can penetrate up to 10 mm beneath the surface.

Only two studies conducted outside the ICU, one in adults in emergency departments and the other in adults with haemophilia patients requiring blood sampling, have shown no significant difference between the landmark approach and the vein-illuminating device.25 26This is probably because these patients have a low risk of difficult venous access, unlike critically ill patients in the ICU.

To our knowledge, no study has yet evaluated the usefulness of a vein illuminator in adult hospitalised patients in the ICU. We hypothesise that the use of a near-infrared light device in critically ill adult patients for whom a CVC is no longer indicated would increase the success rate of first-attempt peripheral venous line placement.

Our main hypothesis is that near-infrared light improves the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement in adult critical care patients for whom a CVC is no longer indicated. A total of three hundred and eighty patients are to be randomised in two parallel groups.

The trial is carried out in 4 French ICUs. The sponsor (Hospital University Centre of Orléans, France) delivers on-site training and support sessions throughout the study on all procedural aspects.

Patients, or their relatives if they cannot be informed due to the patient’s condition, are informed of the study by a physician or nurse if they are eligible. The patient signs the consent form if possible; otherwise, the investigator signs to attest to the patient’s consent. If the patient is unable to consent, the relative signs the consent form, or if the relative is not present, the investigator signs to attest to the oral consent. A copy of the information letter and consent form is given to the relative as soon as possible. Copies of information sheets and consent forms are provided in theonline supplemental materials.

Refusal or consent is documented in the patient’s medical record. If consent is initially obtained from a relative, the patient’s consent to continue is sought as soon as possible.

Patients who accept participation are declared enrolled and then are randomised. The date and time of randomisation determine the beginning of the intervention period.

Patients have the right to withdraw their consent and discontinue their participation at any time for any reason.

Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this research.

Blinding of participants, clinical investigators and assessors is not possible due to the nature of the intervention.

A centralised web-based management system (EOL Random, Medsharing, France) is used for randomisation. Patients are allocated to either the near-infrared light device or the landmark approach for peripheral venous access in a 1:1 ratio using block sizes unknown to the investigators. Stratification is based on the centre and anticipated difficulty of peripheral venous access.

Anticipated difficulty is defined by at least one of the following criteria: upper limb oedema, absence of palpable veins with tourniquet application, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), or an increase in body weight of >10% between admission and inclusion.

The group to which the patient is assigned is recorded in the patient’s medical chart, and a dedicated chart gathering the whole randomised trial population.

No longer require CVC (ie, no need for vasopressors, chemotherapy, clinician-deemed necessary parenteral nutrition or hypertonic solutions).

Absolute contraindication or anatomical impossibility (eg, transhumeral amputation) for placing a peripheral venous line in the upper limbs.

Patient not affiliated or excluded from social protection, or under law protection (ie, minors, persons deprived of their liberty by court or administrative decision).

Figure 1presents the study outline and interventions.

All nurses received formal training on the device, followed by a 1-month familiarisation period prior to the start of the study.

Once enrolled and randomised, the nurse in charge sets up the PVC according to the patient’s randomisation group as soon as possible.

Interventional phase: this phase includes the attempted placement of the PVC using the method assigned by randomisation. A successful PVC attempt within the initial five protocol-defined attempts marks the end of this phase and the beginning of the follow-up phase. Each nurse may attempt up to three insertions per patient and may allow another nurse to try. A maximum of five attempts per patient is permitted using the allocated method. All attempts, whether successful or not, along with the device used, will be recorded. If PVC placement fails after the initial five attempts, the study procedure is considered a failure. Attempts must be made within 6 hours of randomisation.

Follow-up phase: if a PVC is successfully placed within the first five attempts, monitoring continues. If one of the initial attempts is successful, the study continues until the PVC is removed (maximum 7 days) or the patient is discharged from the ICU, whichever occurs first, to assess the occurrence of local complications.

No follow-up phase: if PVC placement is only successful after the initial five attempts, no follow-up phase is conducted. If PVC placement fails after five attempts, the paramedical team may use any available device (eg, a vein illuminator for patients in the control group or ultrasound) or decide not to attempt further placement. From the day after randomisation, if all attempts have failed, no further data are collected.

The study is conducted using the AccuVein AV500 vein illuminator (AccuVein, New York, USA).

For patients in this group, nurses must locate the target vein for PVC insertion using the near-infrared light device. A tourniquet is applied, and the light is focused on one of the upper limbs. The recommended projection distance is approximately 20 cm, though it may vary between 10 and 45 cm.

Once the vein is identified, the nurse disinfects the site and performs the insertion with the device switched on, projecting the venous network map directly onto the patient’s skin. A 10 cc flash of isotonic solution (NaCl 0.9%) is administered at the end of catheterisation to confirm perfusion functionality.

PVC is inserted using the landmark approach: the vein is located with a tourniquet, and techniques to enhance vein visualisation (eg, alcohol-soaked compresses, vein tapping) are permitted.

The nurse then proceeds with the standard procedure, disinfecting the puncture site and performing catheterisation. A 10 cc flash of isotonic solution (NaCl 0.9%) is administered at the end of catheterisation to confirm perfusion functionality.

The primary objective is to compare the first-attempt success rate of PVC placement in adult critical care patients for whom a central catheter is no longer indicated.

Successful PVC placement is defined by venous return in the reflux chamber during catheterisation, complete catheter insertion and the administration of a flash of isotonic solution (NaCl 0.9%) without extravasation. An attempted puncture is defined as the catheter breaking through the skin barrier. During a puncture, repositioning or changing the catheter’s direction is allowed. Peripheral venipuncture will only be performed by nurses.

A subgroup analysis will be conducted according to nurses’ experience, categorised into three groups: ‘<1 year post certification’, ‘1–5 years post certification’ and ‘>5 years post certification’.

The number of attempts required for successful PVC placement.

The incidence of local complications (venitis and extravasation) in patients with successful PVC placement.

During the 7 days following successful PVC placement (within the initial five attempts), the follow-up phase continues until catheter removal or patient discharge, whichever occurs first. The main local complications assessed are venitis, thrombophlebitis and extravasation. Observed local signs include pain, redness, swelling and induration. The presence of any of these signs during follow-up requires catheter removal. For this study, only medically confirmed cases of venitis and extravasation will be recorded.

The PVC placement success rate in patients with difficult venous access.

Difficult venous access is defined by at least one of the following criteria: upper limb oedema, absence of palpable veins with tourniquet application, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²), or an increase in body weight of >10% between admission and inclusion.

Insertion time is defined as the duration between tourniquet placement and successful PVC insertion (within a maximum of five initial attempts). A staff member other than the one performing the insertion manages the timer. In the case of failure, insertion times are excluded for comparison.

Pain during PVC insertion is assessed using a visual analogue scale if the patient is able to evaluate it. The highest pain level reported during the initial interventional phase is recorded. If placement is unsuccessful after five initial attempts, pain is no longer recorded.

For this research, we did not plan to set up an independent data safety and monitoring board.

Patients are expected to be included during a 24-month period starting in February 2024. The duration of participation for each patient in the protocol is 7 days maximum after randomisation. The first patient was included in dates in February 2024.

Research assistants appointed by the sponsor regularly monitor all the centres on site to check adherence to the protocol and the accuracy and completeness of the data recorded.

Data management is performed by the Direction de La Recherche, Hospital University Centre of Orléans. A centralised web-based management system (EOL Random, Medsharing, France) and a centralised electronic case report form (eCRF) are used (EOL, Medsharing, France). A blind review of data will be performed prior to locking the database.

Patients are expected to be included during a 24-month period starting in February 2024.

First approval by the French Ethics Committee: November 2023.

Estimated study completion date (last patient, last visit): March 2026.

2026: cleaning and closure of the database. Data analysis, writing of the manuscript and submission for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

In patients with difficult venous access, the first-attempt success rate would increase from 33% to 50% with the vein illuminator.

In patients without anticipated difficult venous access, the success rate would rise from 60% to 75%.

Two-thirds of the included patients will have anticipated difficult venous access.

Considering a 10% rate of non-analysable patients (eg, patients whose condition evolves and require continued central venous access before any PVC attempt), the required sample size is 380 patients (190 per arm).

Analyses will be conducted on a modified intention-to-treat, including only analysable patients who underwent the intervention and for whom the primary endpoint is available.

Complication analysis following PVC insertion will be conducted in the subgroup of patients with successful placement within the first five attempts.

Per-protocol analyses may be performed if any patients receive a PVC insertion method different from their allocated randomisation arm.

The analysis will include descriptive statistics for each quantitative variable, presented as mean and SD or median and quartiles, depending on the normality of the distribution. Deviations and the number of missing values will also be reported. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies with 95% CIs.

Analyses of the primary outcome—successful placement of a PVC on the first attempt—as well as all other binary categorical outcomes, will be performed using logistic regression, considering the treatment arm and stratification factors. Centre, ‘difficult venous access’ status, randomisation group and the interaction between randomisation group and ‘difficult venous access’ status will be included as fixed effect variables. The relative risk of first-attempt success between randomisation groups will be estimated using the OR with a 95% CI.

The subgroup analysis of the primary outcome according to nurses’ experience will be performed using a logistic regression model including the randomisation group, nurses’ experience, their interaction term and adjusted for the stratification factor.

The effect of the study intervention will be estimated separately in the ‘anticipated difficult venous access’ and ‘no difficult venous access’ subgroups, regardless of whether an interaction exists between the randomisation group and the ‘difficult venous access’ status. Additionally, these subgroups will be further analysed based on the number of difficulty criteria present at inclusion.

The time required (in minutes) for successful PVC placement, the number of attempts per patient, and all other continuous endpoints will be compared between the two arms using a Mann-Whitney U test, accounting for stratification. Additionally, the time to successful PVC insertion will be analysed using a multivariate Cox model, adjusted for centre and the ‘difficult venous access’ status, subject to verification of the proportional hazards assumption. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the effect of the near-infrared light device based on potential criteria for difficult venous access.

The study protocol and amendments were approved for all centres by the institutional review board of Orléans’ University Hospital Centre, as well as by the French ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Ouest et Outre Mer II, Toulouse, France, number 2023-A00429-36).

The study is conducted in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, 1996, International Conference on Harmonisation Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice and the applicable French regulatory requirements.
