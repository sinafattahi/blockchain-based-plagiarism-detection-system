While people with lived experience (PLE) are increasingly included in health professions education, their role in simulation often remains limited to narrative sharing. This initiative explored how involving PLE throughout the design and delivery of a pharmacy simulation on PrEP (a preventive HIV treatment) and sexual and gender diversity shaped students' learning about inclusive, person‐centred communication in consultations involving stigma and marginalisation.

A PrEP‐related simulation involving a non‐binary patient was integrated into a third‐year pharmacy course. Sessions took place in a fully equipped lab replicating a community pharmacy, with 10 stations and professional actors as standardised patients. Six PLE informed learning objectives, scenario design and debriefing. One PLE trained the actors, observed simulations and participated in debriefings. Their involvement supported inclusive, person‐centred communication around sexuality, gender diversity and HIV prevention.

A mixed‐methods design assessed impact. Survey responses (n= 109) indicated increased confidence in PrEP‐related care and strong appreciation for PLE's presence. Most students had little personal and professional exposure to PrEP, and 93% agreed the PLE enriched their learning. Interviews (n= 14) highlighted how PLE involvement helped demystify stigmatised topics, fostered self‐reflection and emphasised the value of lived experience. Students noted enhanced realism and psychological safety.

Involving PLE throughout simulation—from codesign to debriefing—helped reduce stigma, promote inclusive communication and enhance scenario authenticity. Students felt better prepared for consultations involving PrEP or sexual and gender diversity. This approach may help amplify the patient's voice in health education and could be adapted to other sensitive or stigmatised health topics.

Simulation‐based education provides health professions students' opportunities to develop clinical skills in a safe, realistic environment. Integrating patients' voices into healthcare education is gaining momentum, shifting from passive to active partnerships that offer valuable [1,2], practice‐based insights. In simulation‐based education, involving people with lived experience (PLE) has been linked to improved communication and positive attitudes toward stigmatised populations [3,4,5]. Yet their contributions often remain limited to narrative sharing or portraying patients, leaving much untapped potential [4,6,7].

Inclusive, respectful communication is vital for high‐quality care, especially when addressing sensitive topics or working with stigmatised populations. Many health professionals feel unprepared to discuss issues like sexuality or gender diversity, which can undermine trust and contribute to health disparities among LGBTQ+ populations [8,9,10]. Pharmacists, for example, play a key role in HIV prevention through PrEP consultations but often report gaps in knowledge, confidence or appropriate language. Engaging directly with PLE during training simulations may help address these challenges [11].

‐ LGBTQ+: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning and others: An umbrella term referring to people from sexual and gender diversity.

‐ Non‐binary person: A person whose gender identity falls outside the male–female binary.

‐ PLE: People with lived experience: People who bring firsthand knowledge of a health‐related issue through personal experience, rather than professional training.

‐ PrEP: Preexposure prophylaxis: A preventive HIV treatment taken by HIV‐negative individuals to reduce the risk of infection.

The activity took place in February 2024 during a mandatory third‐year course in a 4‐year pharmacy programme in Québec, Canada, which offers limited but growing opportunities to engage with PLE. By then, students had received some training in communication and professionalism, as well as PrEP and HIV treatment, completed about 15 simulations and done 11 weeks of community internships.

The simulations took place in a fully equipped lab replicating a community pharmacy, with 10 stations and professional actors as standardised patients. Students, in groups of 30 and subgroups of three, participated as pharmacists or observers. Sessions lasted 90 to 105 min, including debriefing.

A clinical simulation activity codeveloped and co‐delivered with PLE, featuring actors as simulated patients, to support inclusive, person‐centred communication skills.

Six PLEs were interviewed to inform the scenario design, learning objectives and simulation debriefing, based on their experiences with PrEP access and stigma. Four later helped revise the script and validate patient profiles to ensure accuracy and reduce stigma. One PLE, selected for their communication skills and experience leading workshops on sexual and gender diversity, played a larger role. In addition to preparing actors, they observed simulations and contributed to debriefings. They also met with the instructor after each session to adjust the approach if necessary.

‐ All received guidance on feedback expectations, such as confirming the scenario's realism, validating actors' scripts, and providing input on how they would express themselves in a PrEP consultation (e.g., concerns, questions, adverse effects).

‐ One was trained by the course instructor on simulation‐based teaching principles, including session flow, debriefing, question formulation, student expectations, and psychological safety.

‐ All received a $50 CAD (approx. £29 GBP) prepaid card.

‐ One received additional compensation at the faculty's speaker rate (CAD $202/hour, ~£109 GBP) for participating in simulation sessions.

Students were informed that the simulation was codeveloped with PLE and that one of them would be present during the session.

This mixed‐methods study used a sequential explanatory design to assess the simulation's impact on students' learning. The project was approved by our university ethics committee, and written consent was obtained for both phases. All data were anonymized and handled securely.

Immediately after the simulation and debriefing, students completed a brief online survey assessing their role (pharmacist or observer), prior PrEP experience and perceptions of the simulation. The 10‐item Likert‐type questionnaire was reviewed by experts, pilot‐tested and is presented in Table1, along with response data.

Means (M) and standard deviations (SD) of participants' responses to the simulation with PLE on the appreciation scale (N= 109).

1, totally agree; 2, partially agree; 3, neutral; 4, partially disagree; 5, totally disagree.

Of 142 eligible students, 109 responded (77%). Most had no personal (0%) and little professional (8%) experience with PrEP. After the simulation, 83% strongly agreed it improved their awareness of PrEP‐related issues, and 93% credited the PLE's presence. A Wilcoxon test showed significantly increased confidence in providing PrEP services postsimulation (p< 0.001).

To complement the survey data, 14 students participated in individual (n= 3, ∼25 min) or small group (n= 2, ∼50 min) semistructured interviews conducted outside class time. Interviews were transcribed and analysed inductively using thematic analysis [12] to explore learning outcomes following the simulation and factors shaping the effectiveness of PLE integration for inclusive, person‐centred communication.

The design of the simulation helped students demystify PrEP and gain familiarity with sexual and gender diversity. Direct engagement with a PLE, coupled with insights shared by instructors from other PLEs during debriefing, deepened their understanding of stigmatised identities, helping them confront biases, reduce discomfort with non‐binary individuals and increase confidence in addressing these topics.

It also simplified the perceived complexity of providing PrEP, making students feel more credible when serving LGBTQ+ patients.

Students highlighted how the presence of a PLE, combined with PLE‐trained actors, made the simulation more authentic than traditional role‐playing. This setup encouraged them to move beyond pharmacological aspects, engage more meaningfully with patients and reflect on their language and behaviour. By confronting discomfort in real time, students identified actions to improve their approach and adapt to real‐world scenarios.

Interacting with a PLE enhanced participants' recognition of lived experience as expertise, deepening their understanding of patient realities and bridging theoretical knowledge with a more inclusive, bidirectional approach to care.

Participants emphasised that PLE's communication skills and ability to create a safe environment were key to maximising learning. Students highlighted clarity, empathy and facilitation skills as key attributes of effective PLE. These qualities fostered reassurance, encouraged engagement and allowed questions without fear of mistakes, normalising uncertainty and reducing apprehension.

Participants noted that the impact of a PLE could be particularly strong when simulations addressed sensitive or stigmatised topics, such as mental health, substance use, higher body weight, abortion and emergency contraception. These themes often created barriers to engagement, which the PLE could help to demystify.

The chosen scenario, which involved asking intimate questions about sexuality with patients outside sexual and gender norms, directly addressed these challenges.

Participants recognised the value of the PLE's presence, but due to logistical constraints, only a few teams received direct observation and personalised feedback. Many expressed a desire for more PLE involvement during the simulation.

This educational innovation builds on prior work linking PLE involvement in simulation‐based education to improved communication and more inclusive attitudes toward stigmatised populations [3,4,5]. While many initiatives limit PLE to narrative roles [4,6,7], our approach demonstrates the value of engaging them throughout the process—from defining objectives and codesigning scenarios to training actors, observing simulations and contributing to debriefings.

Multiple PLE helped identify stigmatising content, refine clinical language and ensure the scenario reflected real‐world experiences. The presence of a well‐prepared PLE during sessions also added emotional realism and relational depth. Students described the activity as particularly memorable and useful in preparing them for sensitive consultations. These outcomes echo findings that authentic clinical scenarios and psychological safety are key to effective simulation learning [13,14,15].

Two takeaways for educators stand out. First, PLE should be carefully selected and supported to contribute meaningfully. Second, simulation design should maximise opportunities for students to receive personalised feedback from PLE—whether through rotating facilitators or structured debriefs.

Interestingly, the impact extended beyond learners. Instructors reported that PLE insights revealed blind spots in their teaching and prompted critical reflection. The lead PLE also described the experience as empowering and reparative—an opportunity to help future professionals avoid the dismissive care they received when accessing PrEP.

This model illustrates how sustained partnerships with PLE can amplify the patient's voice in simulation and enhance person‐centred learning. Future work should explore how such approaches translate into practice and promote equity in care delivery.

‘This model illustrates how sustained partnerships with PLE can amplify the patient's voice in simulation and enhance person‐centered learning’.

‐ Engaging PLE throughout simulation—from design to debrief—may enhance authenticity, reveal bias and support inclusive, person‐centred learning.

‐ Students felt better prepared to address sensitive topics like PrEP among LGBTQ+ populations following the activity.

‐ To maximise impact, PLE should be well supported and involved in structured feedback for all learners; this model may be adapted to other contexts involving stigma or marginalisation.
