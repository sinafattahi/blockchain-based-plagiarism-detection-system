Radical hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, cervix, upper vagina, parametria, and associated tissues, along with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, is the global gold standard for treating early-stage cervical carcinoma. Over 110 early-stage cervical cancer patients have undergone this procedure at our institution for the past 10 years. However, data on long-term survival outcomes in the region remain unavailable. Including this information highlights the scale of the institution’s experience, adding valuable context to the study. This study evaluates the institution’s performance since adopting the procedure and aims to inform patient selection and treatment strategies, leveraging insights from studies conducted in varied clinical settings.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed women who underwent radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer (IB1–IIA2) at Bugando Medical Centre (2014–2020). Data were collected from patient charts, including demographics, histology, clinical stage, surgical details, therapies, and follow-up outcomes. Patients with incomplete procedures, histology, or follow-up data were excluded. Data analysis, performed using Epi Info™ and STATA version 13, included survival probabilities calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and group comparisons using the log-rank test. Descriptive statistics summarized patient characteristics, and chi-square tests analyzed categorical variables. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

86 patients were reviewed, with the majority (80.2%) being under 60 years of age and a mean age of 51 ± 10.0 years. The 3-year overall survival rate was 96.5%, disease-free survival was 79.1%, and the recurrence rate was 20.9%. Factors significantly associated with 3-year disease recurrence included: tumour size ≥ 4 cm (log-rank χ²(1) = 19.53,p< 0.001), poorly differentiated tumour grade (log-rank χ²(2) = 11.27,p= 0.004), adenocarcinoma histology (log-rank χ²(1) = 18.79,p< 0.001), vaginal vault involvement (log-rank χ²(1) = 83.03,p< 0.001), and surgical margin involvement (log-rank χ²(1) = 67.81,p< 0.001). No significant association was found between the mode of treatment (neoadjuvant, surgery alone, or adjuvant) and disease recurrence (p= 1.553).

The 3-year overall survival rate following radical hysterectomy was 96.5%, with a recurrence rate of 20.9%. Factors associated with recurrence included tumour size ≥ 4 cm, poorly differentiated tumour grade, adenocarcinoma histology, vaginal vault involvement, and positive surgical margins.

Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer among women globally, following breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. In 2020, an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths were reported worldwide. The burden is disproportionately high in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 85-90% of both new cases and deaths [1]. In Tanzania, cervical cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality [2]. The incidence of cervical cancer is estimated at 40.6 per 100,000 women, with approximately 7,515 new cases annually—ten times higher than the rates observed in developed countries [2,3]. Globally, approximately 65-70% of cervical cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage [4]. At Bugando Medical Centre (BMC), however, only about 53% of cervical cancer patients present with early-stage disease [5,6].

Early-stage cervical cancer, encompassing stages IA to IIA2, is classified according to the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system. Treatment options typically include radical hysterectomy, with or without adjuvant chemoradiation, or primary chemoradiation for cases where surgery is not feasible [7]. Cervical cancer disease recurrence refers to the return of cancer after a period of remission or initial treatment, which can occur locally or at distant sites. Disease-free survival is the time after treatment during which a patient remains free from detectable cancer, serving as an indicator of treatment effectiveness and long-term recovery potential. Death due to cervical cancer occurs when the disease progresses or metastasizes [7]ultimately leading to the patient’s death, often due to complications related to cancer spread or treatment.

This study evaluates the 3-year survival outcomes and associated factors among women undergoing radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer at BMC. By addressing these gaps, the findings aim to contribute to the optimization of cervical cancer management in similar resource-constrained settings.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania, between October 2023 and April 2024. BMC is a 1,000-bed tertiary zonal referral and teaching hospital affiliated with the Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences (CUHAS), serving a population of 21.2 million across eight regions. It is one of five hospitals offering cervical cancer treatment in Tanzania and the only facility currently performing radical hysterectomy in the country, with approximately 15–25 cases performed annually. BMC began performing radical hysterectomies in 2014, followed by the introduction of radiation therapy in 2018. The hospital manages over 400 new cervical cancer cases annually and is equipped to provide both surgical and chemoradiation treatment options.

Eligibility criteria included all patients with cervical cancer stages IA to IIA2 who underwent radical hysterectomy, with or without adjuvant therapy, at Bugando Medical Centre between 2014 and 2020. Patient’s charts were included if they were either still under follow-up or had died within three years of treatment. Exclusion criteria were incomplete medical records, including missing details on surgical procedures, histopathology, or follow-up outcomes; patients lost to follow-up within three years; cases with advanced-stage disease misdiagnosed preoperatively; patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation but did not proceed with surgery; and those who underwent radical hysterectomy for non-cervical malignancies or benign conditions.

Cases were identified through a comprehensive review of patient charts, which included electronic records, hard copy data, theatre logs, and laboratory data for histology. The process began with a search of the hospital’s electronic medical records system to identify patients diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2014 and 2020, focusing on those with stages IA to IIA2 who underwent radical hysterectomy. These records were cross-checked with physical charts, theatre logs, and histology reports to verify eligibility and gather complete information on demographics, clinical stage, surgical details, adjuvant therapy, and follow-up outcomes. Incomplete records were supplemented with additional data from pathology reports or follow-up clinic notes.

Two trained researchers collected data from electronic and hard-copy patient charts, theatre logs, and laboratory histology reports. They used a structured data collection tool that was pretested for accuracy and reliability to capture the relevant information. The data were entered into Epi-Info™ software and then exported to STATA version 13 for statistical analysis.

Descriptive statistics, including medians and ranges for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, were used to summarize patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment details. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to calculate cumulative observed probabilities for survival, including disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival curves were generated for relevant subgroups, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. Chi-square tests analyzed associations between categorical variables, such as tumour characteristics and recurrence. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The study recruited 110 patients, of whom 24 (22%) were excluded. Reasons for exclusion included: 1 underwent radical hysterectomy for non-cervical cancer, 3 had missing case notes, and 20 were lost to follow-up Table1: Shows the social demographic data of 86 study participants, with the majority aged 40–59 (69.8%), married (83.7%), and having primary education (50%). Most were peasants (81.4%), had ≥ 5 children (72.1%), resided in urban areas (57%), were referred from other health facilities (76.7%), and had HIV-negative status (67.4%). After exclusion, 86 (72.2%) participants remained eligible for inclusion.

Table2Shows that 93% of patients had abnormal vaginal bleeding, 68.6% had squamous cell carcinoma, and 75.6% had tumours smaller than 4 cm. Most patients were treated with surgery alone (61.6%), while 12.8% had surgical margin involvement.

The Kaplan-Meier analysis shows favourable survival outcomes with approximately 80% survival at 36 months, with the most notable decline occurring between months 18–24.

Factors significantly associated with 3-year disease recurrence included tumor size ≥ 4 cm (log-rank χ²(1) = 19.53,p< 0.001), poorly differentiated tumor grade (log-rank χ²(2) = 11.27,p= 0.004), adenocarcinoma histology (log-rank χ²(1) = 18.79,p< 0.001), vaginal margin involvement (log-rank χ²(1) = 83.03,p< 0.001), and surgical margin involvement (log-rank χ²(1) = 67.81,p< 0.001). Parametrial and lymph node involvement showed a trend toward significance (p= 0.057). At the same time, the mode of treatment (neoadjuvant, surgery alone, or adjuvant) was not significantly associated with recurrence (p= 0.155), as indicated in Table4.

The findings of this study highlight the effectiveness and challenges of radical hysterectomy as a treatment modality for early-stage cervical cancer at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC). The 3-year overall survival rate of 96.5% is comparable to international benchmarks [12,13]. Treatment for early-stage cervical cancer (stage I-IIA) with chemoradiation shows overall survival rates comparable to those achieved with radical hysterectomy. Studies indicate that patients who received radiotherapy only or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) had a three-year overall survival (OS) rate of 90–96% [14,15] Indicating that radical hysterectomy remains a viable treatment option in resource-limited settings. The high recurrence rate may be attributed to limited experience when the procedure was first introduced in 2014. Additionally, clinical staging at the time lacked radiological support, as CT and MRI imaging only became available in 2019, significantly improving staging accuracy. Fortunately, all patients with recurrence received chemoradiation, which contributed to improved overall survival outcomes.

The significant association between larger tumour size (≥ 4 cm) and recurrence (p< 0.001) aligns with existing literature, where tumour size is a well-established prognostic factor [7,10]. Since the adoption of the 2018 FIGO cervical cancer staging system, it has been recommended that patients with tumours≥4 cm receive primary chemoradiation or adjuvant therapy post-surgery. Previously, many patients were staged using the 2009 FIGO classification, which relied solely on clinical findings and lacked these recommendations [16]. The 2018 update introduced improved staging accuracy through imaging techniques like MRI and CT, incorporated imaging and pathological findings into the staging process, and emphasized a multidisciplinary approach for better treatment planning [7]. Since 2020, our institution has aligned with these updated guidelines, avoiding surgery for patients with large tumour sizes or providing adjuvant radiotherapy.

The study also revealed a higher recurrence risk in poorly differentiated tumours and adenocarcinoma histology (p= 0.004 andp< 0.001, respectively). This is consistent with the understanding that poorly differentiated squamous cell tumours and adenocarcinomas are more aggressive and less responsive to standard treatment modalities, as noted in previous studies [7,11]. Adenocarcinoma of the cervix carries the highest risk of recurrence, and for early-stage disease, treatment is typically individualized, often combining surgery with adjuvant therapy whenever feasible [10,17].

Surgical outcomes, such as vaginal vault and surgical margin involvement, were significantly associated with recurrence (p< 0.001), emphasizing the importance of achieving clear margins and the potential role of adjuvant radiation therapy for high-risk patients. Early challenges in surgical treatment at our institution, likely due to limited experience, have improved with the adoption of advanced practices, including radiological, clinical, and pathological staging, as per updated FIGO guidelines [7,16,18]. Encouragingly, most patients with recurrence received adjuvant treatment and survived, and all high-risk patients now routinely receive adjuvant therapy to reduce recurrence risk, reflecting enhanced care and outcomes.

Although parametrial and lymph node involvement did not reach statistical significance (p= 0.057), the trends suggest these factors may still contribute to recurrence risk, as reported in other studies [10,18]. This study’s minimal recurrence may be attributed to the small proportion of patients with parametrial and lymph node involvement and the consistent administration of adjuvant therapy following surgery.

In this study, the absence of a statistically significant association between treatment modality and recurrence may be attributed to the limited sample size or the efficacy of adjuvant therapies in high-risk patients. Existing WHO 2018 guidelines [10] and pivotal studies, including GOG 92 and GOG 109, support the role of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments in reducing recurrence and improving survival in early-stage cervical cancer. GOG 92 demonstrated reduced recurrence with pelvic radiotherapy, while GOG 109 showed improved progression-free survival with combined chemoradiation, albeit with increased toxicity [19,20]. These findings underscore the clinical benefit of multimodal approaches, though the balance between therapeutic gain and adverse effects remains critical. Continued research is essential to optimize treatment strategies that maximize survival while minimizing harm in early-stage cervical cancer patients.

The findings of this study emphasize the need for enhanced preoperative staging using advanced imaging techniques to improve treatment planning, particularly for high-risk patients. Individualized treatment strategies, including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies, should be prioritized for patients with high-risk features such as tumour size ≥ 4 cm, poorly differentiated histology, or adenocarcinoma. Achieving clear surgical margins through optimized techniques is critical to reducing recurrence risks. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating oncology, radiology, and pathology teams, is essential for improved outcomes, guided by updated FIGO guidelines. Additionally, robust long-term follow-up protocols and continued capacity building through training and mentorship are necessary to ensure consistent quality of care and early detection of recurrence.

This observational study at Bugando Medical Centre indicates that radical hysterectomy is an effective treatment option for early-stage cervical cancer in resource-limited settings, with a three-year overall survival rate of 96.5% comparable to global benchmarks. Improvements in imaging and adherence to updated FIGO guidelines have enhanced staging accuracy and patient outcomes. Recurrence was more common in cases with tumor size ≥ 4 cm, poor differentiation, adenocarcinoma, and positive surgical margins. The routine use of adjuvant therapy for high-risk patients also contributed to improved survival. Although early institutional limitations have been addressed, leading to better care, the findings should be interpreted with caution given the study’s observational nature and single-center scope.

While this study provides valuable insights into the outcomes of radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer, several limitations must be acknowledged. The retrospective design inherently limits control over data quality and introduces potential biases in data collection and interpretation. Being a single-center study, the findings may reflect institutional practices and patient characteristics unique to Bugando Medical Centre, thereby limiting generalizability to other settings. Additionally, the absence of advanced imaging modalities during the early years of the study may have affected staging accuracy and patient selection, potentially influencing treatment outcomes. Future prospective, multicenter studies with standardized imaging and larger sample sizes are recommended to validate and build upon these findings.
