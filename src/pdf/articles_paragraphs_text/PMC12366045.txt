With the aging of the population, the number of hip and knee replacements worldwide continues to increase. Postoperative enhanced recovery has become a clinical focus, and an increasing number of hip and knee replacement surgeries are completed on an outpatient basis. Spinal anesthesia is the most widely used anesthetic method in clinical practice, but its disadvantages, such as slow recovery of lower limb muscle strength after operation, have hindered the rapid recovery of such patients. We found that the duration of lower limb motor block under spinal anesthesia with warmed ropivacaine was significantly shortened in clinical practice. We hypothesized that spinal anesthesia with warmed ropivacaine resulted in rapid recovery of lower limb muscle strength, improved limb mobility after hip/knee replacement surgery, increased ambulation from bed and reduced postoperative hospital stay.

Patients scheduled for hip or knee replacement surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to normal temperature ropivacaine group (Group N: 1.0 ml of 1% ropivacaine with normal temperature 22.0–25.0 °C and 1.5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid are to be used for performing spinal anesthesia) and warmed ropivacaine group (Group W: 1.0 ml of 1% ropivacaine warmed to 36.0–37.0 °C and 1.5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid are to be used for performing spinal anesthesia). The incidence of patients achieving muscle strength grade 4 or higher in the operative limb within 3.5 h after anesthesia and the time to achieve grade 5 muscle strength, onset of sensory and motor block, duration of sensory block, intraoperative muscle relaxation score, the frequency of turning over in bed and the number of active functional exercises, the angles of knee joint flexion at 6 h and 24 h post-operation, first ambulation time, post-operative resting and motion pain score, the proportion of unilateral block, the time of first drinking and feeding, postoperative hospital stay and total hospital stay were record and analyzed.

A total of 96 patients were recruited, 94 were randomized and 75 were finally analyzed, 38 in the Group N and 37 in Group W. The primary outcomes which were the proportion of patients with operative limb muscle strength not less than grade 4 at 3.5 h post-anesthesia was significantly increased 28.5% by warmed ropivacaine compared to room temperature ropivacaine and the time of operation limb achieving grade 5 muscle strength was significantly decreased in the Group W (3.7 [2.8, 5.0] hours) compared to the Group N (5.5 [3.7-7.0] hours). Secondary outcomes: The median active knee curvature on the operative side significantly increased by 17 degrees and 15 degrees, respectively, at 6 and 24 h after anesthesia. The onset time of sensory and motor nerve block were significantly decreased by warmed ropivacaine compared to room temperature ropivacaine. The unilateral block rate was significantly increased 36.2% by warmed ropivacaine compared to room temperature ropivacaine. Moreover, the median first walking time, post-operative hospital stay and the length of total hospital stay were significantly decreased 3 h, 3 days and 3 days, respectively. Although there are differences in the assessment of intraoperative muscle relaxation, the clinical significance is not obvious.

Warmed ropivacaine shortens the time for the recovery of lower limb muscle strength after spinal anesthesia, which is beneficial for the rapid recovery of patients undergoing lower limb joint replacement surgery and reduces the length of hospital stay.

Joint replacement surgery has become an increasingly common therapeutic option for elderly patients suffering from severe knee or hip diseases, with the continuous increase in life expectancy. It is projected that by 2030, the demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) will reach approximately 3.48 million surgeries annually in the United States [1]. Femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are common causes of mortality, immobility, and economic burden in the elderly, with an expected number of 2 million people disabled from this disease each year [2], and hip arthroplasty, including total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty (HA), is a generally recommended treatment option for displaced FNFs. The annual growth rate of hip replacement surgeries in China has reached as high as 19.96%. From 2011 to 2024, the number of surgeries has reached 1.55 million cases (data sourced from the National Orthopedic Surgery Robot Information Management System:www.orthorobotics.cn). Over the past decade, orthopedic surgeons have focused on implementing programs aimed at enabling patients to recovery from surgery not only safely and rapidly but also increasingly as outpatients [3]. Furthermore, spinal anesthesia is strongly recommended by a recent international consensus group [4]. Although spinal anesthesia is recommended for joint surgery, lower limb weakness and sensory disturbances resulting from this technique can delay mobilization and discharge. Anesthesiologists have been dedicated to optimizing spinal anesthesia techniques with the aim of facilitating early postoperative mobilization. Studies have shown that mepivacaine significantly promotes early ambulation after hip replacement surgery compared with bupivacaine, with 70% of patients who received mepivacaine spinal anesthesia able to walk 3–3.5 h postoperatively [5]. However, ropivacaine is more widely used in spinal anesthesia. In our clinical experience, the slower recovery of muscle strength caused by ropivacaine is a key factor affecting early patient mobilization. Improving early recovery of lower limb muscle strength following ropivacaine spinal anesthesia has not been extensively reported. Our preliminary clinical observations suggested that warmed ropivacaine (to 37.0°C) to be used spinal anesthesia can shorten motor nerve block time, significantly improve lower limb muscle strength recovery, and enhance early limb movement.

The primary outcome measure of this randomized, double-blind trial was to determine the incidence of patients achieving grade 4 or higher muscle strength in the operative limb within 3.5 h postoperatively and the time required to achieve grade 5 muscle strength of the operative limb. We hypothesized that patients receiving warmed ropivacaine would exhibit faster recovery of lower limb muscle strength and earlier ambulation from bed compared to those receiving room-temperature ropivacaine.

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at The Affiliated Hospital of Yan’an University, China, in accordance with the CONSORT-2010 guidelines. The Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Hospital of Yan’an University approved the study protocol ((NO. S-S20210007, NO. S-S20240143), and all subjects provided written informed consent before the trial by each participant themselves or their legal representatives.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients aged 55–75 years scheduled for total knee or hip replacement under spinal anesthesia; (2) normal preoperative muscle strength in both lower limbs with a daily life rating scale score of ≥ 6 points; (3) no contraindications to spinal puncture. Exclusion criteria included: (1) BMI > 30 kg/m²; (2) abnormal mental state during surgery; (3) conversion to general anesthesia; (4) emergency reoperation due to postoperative complications; (5) surgery duration exceeding 2.5 h, (6) cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog test, score < 3). Patients were randomly assigned to either the Group N (22–24°C ropivacaine) or group W (36.5–37°C ropivacaine) in a 1:1 ratio. Figure 1 illustrates the participant assignment flowchart.

A total of 94 random numbers were generated using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA, 2017). The software randomly allocated 94 of these numbers into two groups: the Group N and the Group W. Participants were enrolled in the order of their registration time, corresponding to the sequence of random numbers from smallest to largest. Each random number was matched with a patient’s admission ID. A full-time researcher (A) conducted the randomization process, and the researcher (A) instructed a nurse in the anesthesia preparation room on how to prepare the ropivacaine that was to be used in another room. After successfully performing the subarachnoid puncture, the anesthesiologist immediately informed the nurse to send the prepared ropivacaine to the operating room. The anesthesiologist then extracted the required amount of ropivacaine according to the experimental protocol. The time taken is no more than 1 min (only including the delivery of the drug to the operating room time, the extraction of ropivacaine time, and the subarachnoid injection of ropivacaine time). The research participants recorded the relevant data during and after the operation according to the requirements of the trial. The anesthesiologist, the patient, and the trial follow-up personnel were all unaware of the specific temperature at which the ropivacaine was administered.

Patients were randomly divided into two groups. In the Group N (n= 47), 1.0 ml (10 mg) of 1% ropivacaine at room temperature (22.0–25.0°C) plus 1.5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid was used for spinal anesthesia. In the Group W (n= 47), 1.0 ml (10 mg) of 1% ropivacaine pre-warmed to body temperature (36.0–37.5°C) plus 1.5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid was used for spinal anesthesia.

All of patients were positioned in the lateral decubitus position (affected side up). An anesthesiologist performed a puncture at the L3-L4 interspace, aligning the tip of the 16G epidural needle with the midline of the epidural space. Following successful epidural puncture, a 25G spinal needle was inserted into the subarachnoid space, ensuring smooth cerebrospinal fluid flow. A 1.5 ml sample of cerebrospinal fluid was extracted and mixed with 1.0 ml of 1% ropivacaine, then rapidly injected into the subarachnoid space (1 ml/10 s). The drug outlet of the lumbar anesthesia needle was directed toward the surgical limb, an epidural catheter was placed 3–5 cm deep after the injection.

A 10 ml vial of ropivacaine (1% Ropivacaine Injection 100 mg, AstraZeneca) was placed in a water bath maintained at 37.5°C for 10~30 minutes prior to use. The time from removing the ropivacaine from the water bath to its injection into the spinal space did not exceed 1 min.

For patients undergoing TKA, saphenous nerve block combined with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) was administered as previously reported [6]. The block solution consisted of 0.25% ropivacaine and 5 mg dexamethasone in a 20 ml syringe. For patients undergoing THA, supra-inguinal fascia iliaca nerve block combined with PCIA was administered as previously reported [7]. The block solution included 0.25% ropivacaine and 8 mg dexamethasone in a 40 ml syringe. PCIA involved administering sufentanil at a rate of 0.025 µg/kg/h for the first 12 h postoperatively, followed by 0.05 µg/kg/h for the subsequent 36 h.

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving muscle strength grade 4 or higher in the operative limb within 3.5 h after anesthesia and the time to achieve grade 5 muscle strength of operative limb. Muscle strength was graded as follows: grade 0, complete paralysis; grade 1, visible muscle contraction without movement; grade 2, limb movement along the bed surface but unable to lift against gravity; grade 3, limb can be lifted off the bed surface but cannot resist applied force; grade 4, able to resist some force but weaker than normal; grade 5, normal muscle strength. Secondary outcomes included the onset of sensory block (the time interval from spinal administration to the onset of numbness in the L1 region), duration of sensory block (time from spinal administration to regression to L1 level), onset of motor block (time from spinal administration to onset of the surgical side lower limb’s Bromage score ≥ 1), intraoperative muscle relaxation score (assessed by the surgeon on a scale of 0–10, where 0–3 is poor, 4–5 is fair, 6–7 is good, and 8–10 is excellent), the frequency of turning over in bed and the number of active functional exercises (extension, flexion of the affected limb, ankle pump movement) within 6 h post-operation; the angle of active bending of the knee joint on the surgical side at 6 and 24 h post-anesthesia; first ambulation time was defined as the time to first walk at least 5 m after surgery, consistent with previous studies [8]; post-anesthesia resting and motion pain score; unilateral block was defined as total motor block (level 3 according to the bromage scale and loss of pain sensation based on the pin-prick test at the T10 dermatome level on the operated side, while maintaining somatic sensation and motor block level < 2 on the non-operated side according to the pin-prick test and bromage scale at 15 min post-anesthesia, as per previous reports [9]; the timing of first drinking, feeding, postoperative hospital stay and total hospital stay.

Based on our pilot studies, 50% of patients in the Group N had muscle strength not less than grade 4 at 3.5 h post-anesthesia, which increased to 80% in the Group W. With α = 0.05, the power is 80%, and a dropout rate of 20%, using PASS 15, we calculated a minimum sample size of 47 cases per group (totaling 94 cases).

After normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk test), normally distributed data were expressed as means ± SD, and non-normally distributed data were expressed as median [interquartile range]. Discrete variables are expressed as frequencies (%) and were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. For main result statistical analysis, the proportion of patients with operative limb muscle strength not less than grade 4 was expressed as frequencies (%), thus Fisher’s exact test was used for comparisons between groups, the time to achieve grade 5 muscle strength was non-normally distributed by Shapiro-Wilk test, thus Mann-Whitney test was applied for comparisons between groups. The active knee curvature at 6 h and 24 h after anesthesia were also non-normally distributed by Shapiro-Wilk test, thus Mann-Whitney test was applied for comparisons between groups. The sex, ASA Physical Status, kind of surgery and unilateral block are expressed as frequencies (%) and were performed by Pearson chi-square test (two-tailed). The age, operation time, motion pain score at 6 h after anesthesia, resting pain score at 24 h after anesthesia, motion pain score at 24 h after anesthesia, onset time of sensory block, duration of sensory block, onset time of motor nerve block, active function exercise within 6 h after anesthesia, turn over within 6 h after surgery time, first turn over after surgery time, first drinking time, first feeding time, first ambulation time, postoperative hospital stay and total hospital stay were non-normally distributed by Shapiro-Wilk test, thus theses variables were performed by Mann-Whitney test (two-tailed). The subjects’ cognitive abilities were assessed by Mini-Cog test, the data was expressed as frequencies (%) in 3, 4 and 5 score, thus this variable was performed by Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed). Body mass index and albumin level were normally distributed by Shapiro-Wilk test, thus theses variables were performed by two independent samples T-test (two-tailed). Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05. Data processing was conducted using SPSS 25.

A total of 96 patients were recruited, excluding 2 patients, leaving 94 patients for randomization. Of these, 19 were excluded for various reasons (Fig.1), resulting in 75 patients for primary analysis: 38 in the Group N and 37 in the Group W. The study period was from April 1, 2022, to March 30, 2023. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics (such as age, weight, BMI, sex, ASA physical status, albumin level, kind of surgery, operation time and Mini Cog score) between the groups (Table1).

At 3.5 h post-anesthesia, the proportion of patients with operative limb muscle strength not less than grade 4 was significantly higher in the Group W (81.1%) compared to the Group N (52.6%) (Fig.2A). And moreover, the time to achieve grade 5 muscle strength was significantly shorter in the Group W (3.7[2.8, 5.0] hours) compared to the Group N (5.5 [3.7, 7.0] hours) (Fig.2B). Therefore, warm ropivacaine can promote the rapid recovery of lower limb muscle strength after spinal anesthesia, which is beneficial to the early limb movement of patients.

To investigate potential effect modifiers, we conducted subgroup analyses. As shown, among all 75 patients, Group W was associated with a notably elevated odds ratio compared to Group N (OR = 3.86, 95%CI: 1.36–10.92,P= 0.011) (Table2), implying a stronger effect in Group W at the overall level. Age - stratified analyses indicated that in patients > 65 years (representing 54.67% of the cohort), Group W had a statistically significant OR of 4.50 (95%CI: 1.13–17.99,P= 0.033), whereas in the 55–65 years subgroup, the OR of 3.00 (95%CI: 0.61–14.86) did not reach significance (P= 0.178) (Table2). The non - significantPfor interaction (0.707) (Table2) suggested that age did not substantially modify the effect between the two groups. Regarding surgical procedures, in Total Hip surgery (n= 24), the OR of 6.75 (95%CI: 0.66–68.77,P= 0.107) (Table2) for Group W versus Group N lacked significance. However, in Total Knee surgery (n= 51), Group W demonstrated a significant OR of 3.50 (95%CI: 1.04–11.73,P= 0.042) (Table2). With a P for interaction of 0.623 (Table2), surgery type did not appear to be a strong effect modifier. These subgroup findings collectively highlight that while there are differential effects across some subgroups, age and surgery type do not exert prominent interaction influences, and the overall trend favors Group W in terms of the studied outcome.

In this study, the angle of active bending of the knee joint on the surgical side in the Group W was 70° [60°, 80°] at 6 h post-anesthesia and 90° [70°, 95°] at 24 h post- anesthesia, significantly higher than that in the Group N 53° [41°, 74°] and 75° [53°, 90°], respectively) (Fig.3). There were no statistically significant differences in motion pain scores at 6 h post-anesthesia between groups (Table3). However, both motion pain scores and resting pain scores at 24 h post-anesthesia were lower in the Group W (motion pain: 1 [0, 2], resting pain: 3 [3, 4]) compared to the Group N (motion pain: 2 [2, 3], resting pain: 4 [3, 4]), withp< 0.001 andP= 0.004, respectively (Table3).

We found that the onset time of sensory block and duration of sensory block were 79[57.8, 115.3] seconds and 103[87.8, 114.8] minutes, respectively, significantly longer in the Group N compared to the Group W (40[29.5, 45.5] seconds and 86[78.5, 95.5] minutes, respectively), withp< 0.001 (Table4). Further evaluation of motor nerve block showed that the onset time was 3[2, 4] minutes in the Group N, significantly longer than in the Group W 2[2, 3], withp= 0.006 (Table4). Additionally, the unilateral block rate of the operative limb in the Group W (73.0%) was significantly higher than in the Group N (36.8%), withp= 0.002 (Table4). Although the assessment of muscle relaxation by the surgeon did not affect the operation, the score of the Group W 9 [8–10] was significantly higher than that of the Group N 7.5 [7–9] (Table4).

After spinal anesthesia, early recovery of lower extremity motor nerve block facilitates early limb movement. Our study found that within 6 h post-operation, the Group W had significantly higher active limb movements 15(10, 24.5)times and turning over frequency13(10, 15) times compared to the Group N (10[5.75, 13] and 6 [4, 8] times, respectively;p< 0.001). Additionally, the first post-operative turn-over time was in the Group W 2.70[1.63, 3.50] hours and in the Group N 3.30(2.45, 5.58) hours, there was no significant,p= 0.06. Further evaluation revealed that the first post-operative drinking time and eating time were also significantly shorter in the Group W [1.85(1.00, 3.90) hours and 5(4, 6.45) hours] compared to the Group N [3.00(1.50, 6.50) hours and6.9(0.88, 9.00) hours], withp= 0.017 andp< 0.001, respectively. Notably, the first walking time was significantly shorter in the Group W [9 (8, 10) hours] compared to the Group N [12(7.75, 18) hours],p= 0.029. A Japanese retrospective study identified anesthesia as a risk factor for prolonged hospital stay after knee replacement surgery [10]. Consequently, we evaluated post-operative hospital stay length and found a significant reduction in both post-operative and total hospital stays in the Group W [8(7, 9) days and 12(10, 15) days] compared to the Group N [11(9, 13.25) days and 15(12, 17) days] withp< 0.001 andp= 0.005, respectively (Table5).

Early ambulation within 24 h post-total TKA or THA has been associated with reduced hospital length of stay, improved knee function, lower hospitalization costs, decreased incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary infections in Chinese populations [5,11]. However, spinal anesthesia has been criticized for causing increased urinary retention, sustained postoperative hypotension, and prolonged motor blockade, leading to delayed recovery. As a result, general anesthesia was used in 74.8% of joint replacement surgeries (including TKA and THA) [12]. Therefore, promoting early recovery of lower limb muscle strength after spinal anesthesia remains a priority for anesthesiologists. This study demonstrates that warmed ropivacaine significantly improves the percentage of patients achieving at least grade 4 muscle strength in the operative limb in 3.5 h post-operation (81.1%) compared to room temperature ropivacaine (52.6%). Although, the subgroup findings collectively highlight that age and surgery type do not exert prominent interaction influences, and the overall trend favors that warming ropivacaine spinal anesthesia promotes the early recovery of lower limb muscle strength. But, for patients over 65 years old, warmed ropivacaine seems to be more conducive to promoting the recovery of lower limb muscle strength after anesthesia, Group W had a statistically significant OR of 4.50 (95%CI: 1.13–17.99,P= 0.033). In total knee surgery (n= 51), Group W demonstrated a significant OR of 3.50 (95%CI: 1.04–11.73,P= 0.042) compared Group N, Perhaps this is because among the 51 people who underwent knee joint replacement, the proportion of those over 65 years old was as high as 67.7%. Therefore, in the future, we need to further explore the impact of different age groups on the recovery of lower limb muscle strength after spinal anesthesia with warmed ropivacaine.

It also significantly shortens the time to achieve grade 5 muscle strength (3.7 h [range: 2.8–5.0 h] vs. 5.5 h [range: 3.7–7.0 h]) and reduces postoperative hospital stay 8(7, 9) days vs. 12(10, 15) days) by warmed ropivacaine compared to normal temperature ropivacaine. These findings are encouraging for outpatient programs that prefer spinal anesthesia due to its outcome benefits [13] and offer a new option for anesthesiologists implementing enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols for joint replacement surgery. Ropivacaine exhibits a shorter duration of motor blockade after spinal anesthesia compared to bupivacaine. Studies have shown that 15 mg of ropivacaine provides faster motor recovery (150 min) than 10 mg of bupivacaine (210 min) [14]. Kim S. Khaw et al. reported that for cesarean sections, 15 mg of ropivacaine required a median of 120 min to achieve a bromage score of 1, with the longest duration being 210 min [15]. However, Contino Vatel’s study indicated that the time to first ambulation after spinal anesthesia using ropivacaine was 11.2 ± 6.59 h versus 12.9 ± 8.58 h for bupivacaine in hip replacement patients [16]. For patients undergoing lower limb joint replacement surgery, early recovery from motor blockade is crucial for facilitating early ambulation. Our research shows that warmed ropivacaine substantially reduces the time required for first ambulation compared to room temperature ropivacaine (9 h [range: 8–10 h] vs. 12 h [range: 7.75–18 h]). In our study, the time required for the first walking after spinal anesthesia with normal temperature ropivacaine aligns with Contino Vatel’s findings. Previous studies have demonstrated that warmed intrathecal local anesthetic solutions above room temperature results in a more rapid onset of spinal block and/or a higher cephalad level of anesthesia [17,18]. Our research corroborates these findings, showing that compared with normal-temperature ropivacaine, warmed ropivacaine significantly shortens the onset time of sensory and motor nerve block during spinal anesthesia as the above results show. Specifically, warmed ropivacaine for peripheral nerve block reduces the onset time of sensory and motor nerve block by several minutes compared to normal-temperature ropivacaine, supporting the reliability of our findings [19].

Additionally, our study found that the duration of sensory block provided by warmed ropivacaine is significantly shorter than that of normal temperature ropivacaine. Furthermore, we discovered for the first time that spinal anesthesia with warmed ropivacaine significantly shortened the time required for recovery of muscle strength in the operated lower limb compared to normal-temperature ropivacaine, with a median reduction of approximately 1.8 h. Early recovery of lower limb muscle strength after spinal anesthesia facilitates early limb movement post-surgery. In our study, patients in the warmed ropivacaine group showed significantly increased turning over and active function exercise within 6 h compared to those in the normal-temperature ropivacaine group. Roshdi R. Al-Metwalli’s research found that after spinal anesthesia using 10 mg of heavy bupivacaine, knee joints recover the ability to completely bend on their own last, taking about 330 min [20]. Therefore, we evaluated the angle of spontaneous knee curvature at 6 and 24 h post-operation. The angles of active knee flexion at 6 and 24 h were significantly greater in the warmed ropivacaine group compared to the normal-temperature ropivacaine group, increasing by 17 degrees and 15 degrees, respectively. Thus, earlier muscle strength recovery promotes better knee flexion.

A multicenter retrospective cohort study in China suggested that early ambulation within 24 h post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with reduced hospital length of stay, improved knee function, and lower hospitalization costs [11]. In our study, the first ambulation time was significantly reduced by approximately 3 h in the warmed ropivacaine group compared to the normal-temperature ropivacaine group. Similarly, post-operative and total hospital stays were significantly shorter by approximately 3 days in the warmed ropivacaine group compared to the normal-temperature ropivacaine group. Additionally, an observational, propensity score-matched cohort study indicated a strong association between the addition of peripheral nerve block (PNB) to routine spinal or general anesthesia and decreased risks of 90-day all-cause mortality and pulmonary complications [21]. In TKA, PNB use was associated with fewer complications (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75–0.90]) and less prolonged length of stay (OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86–0.95]) [22]. In our study, PNB was also used as an analgesia option. Studies suggest that 4 mg of perineural dexamethasone increases the mean duration of analgesia for long-acting local anesthetics from 11.1 h (95% CrI 9.4–13.1) to 16.5 h (95% CrI 14.0-19.3), with a dose-dependent effect up to 8 mg [23]. Consequently, pain scores were below 2 in both groups, but rest and move pain scores were lower in the warmed ropivacaine group at 24 h post-operation. Furthermore, the rest and movement pain scores in the warmed ropivacaine group were significantly lower than those in the room temperature ropivacaine group at 24 h post-operation. As previously mentioned, dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of peripheral nerve blocks. Our study demonstrates that the same dose of warmed ropivacaine exhibits a stronger nerve-blocking effect during spinal anesthesia compared to room temperature ropivacaine. This finding is supported by a study on warm bupivacaine used for spinal anesthesia in cesarean sections, which found that the dose required in the warm group was reduced by 16% compared to the room temperature group (6.7 [5.7–7.6] mg vs. 8.1 [7.7–8.6] mg) [24].

The density of 10 mg ropivacaine decreases with increasing temperature, from 1.00381 (0.00002) g/mL at 23.0°C to 0.99950 (0.00010) g/mL at 37.0°C [25]. Cerebrospinal fluid at 37°C has a density of 1.000646 ± 0.000086 g/mL [26], making warmed ropivacaine lighter and conducive to unilateral spinal anesthesia. We evaluated the effect of heating ropivacaine on unilateral spinal anesthesia in a lateral puncture position. The proportion of unilateral block with heated ropivacaine was 73%, significantly higher than the 36.8% observed with normal temperature ropivacaine. Administering a small dose of ropivacaine immediately after anesthesia completion eliminated the need to lie on the side waiting for the anesthesia plane to stabilize. Muscle strength was assessed 15 min post-anesthesia, aligning with previous studies indicating a motor block score of 3 within 15–40 min [27]. Hypobaric unilateral spinal anesthesia leads to fewer episodes of severe intraoperative hypotension compared to general anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery [28], suggesting that low-dose spinal anesthesia with warmed ropivacaine can prevent intraoperative hypotension.

Limitations of our study include: (1) Although the number of patients undergoing knee and hip replacements did not differ between groups, future RCTs with a single surgical category are warranted to eliminate potential confounding factors. (2) Preoperative peripheral nerve block might have partially masked some insufficient anesthetic effects exerted by low-dose 10 mg for the younger patients (55–65 y) were included in our study. (3) The 10 mg single dose used in this study may result in different muscle strength recovery rates among different age groups. Further research will require a larger sample size to conduct a more stratified and multi-center RCT study based on age. (4) The criteria for patients’ first post-operative walking varied across multiple wards, lacking a unified standard. (5) Although we implemented a blinding procedure for the anesthesiologist administering the drug to ensure that they were unaware of the temperature of the ropivacaine to be used, complete blinding of the administering anesthesiologist may not have been fully achievable.

In summary, the earlier return of motor function likely allowed patients who received warmed ropivacaine to meet physical therapy milestones sooner, contributing to faster discharge.
