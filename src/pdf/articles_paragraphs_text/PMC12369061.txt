Bladder diverticulum presents significant surgical challenges in traditional laparoscopic approaches, including difficulty in locating diverticular openings and risks of ureteral injury. This study introduces a novel “modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy” featuring an inside-out approach with CO2gas bladder insufflation, addressing these limitations and offering an innovative minimally invasive solution for giant bladder diverticula.

Between 2022 and 2024, a case series of 10 patients (9 males, 1 female; mean age 70.6 years) underwent the modified procedure. Among them, 3 patients simultaneously underwent the modified procedure and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), while the remaining 7 patients underwent the modified procedure alone. The diverticula (mean maximum diameter: 5.94 cm) were predominantly located on the posterior bladder wall (8 cases, 80%). For 7 patients undergoing isolated diverticulectomy, mean operative time was 1.13 h with 7.86 ml blood loss. Postoperative hospitalization averaged 4.29 days, and catheter retention lasted 9.29 days. Three patients with concurrent transurethral prostate resection showed prolonged operative time (2.73 h). The 30-day complication rate was 14.3% (1 case of deep vein thrombosis). All patients demonstrated significant symptom resolution without recurrence during follow-up.

This modified technique enhances surgical precision through cystoscopic visualization and CO2insufflation, achieving shorter operative duration (40% reduction vs. traditional methods), minimal blood loss (< 8 ml), and low complication rates. Its simplified workflow and compatibility with concurrent prostate surgery make it particularly advantageous for complex cases. This study establishes a promising paradigm for giant bladder diverticulum management, warranting further validation through larger cohorts and long-term follow-up.

Bladder diverticulum is a common urological condition, predominantly affecting adults, particularly males [1]. It occurs when the bladder mucosa protrudes through a weak area of the detrusor muscle, forming a type of “hernia” [2,3]. The outer wall of the diverticulum contains a small amount of disorganized smooth muscle bundles, which are non-functional [4,5]. Surgical intervention is necessary when a bladder diverticulum is large and associated with recurrent lower urinary tract symptoms, complicated urinary tract infections, bladder emptying difficulties (secondary urination) [4,6] or when there are concomitant tumors, stones, or bleeding within the diverticulum [7–9]. Traditional treatment methods primarily involve diverticulectomy, which can be performed via open surgery [4] laparoscopic techniques (including robotic assistance), or a combination of laparoscopy and cystoscopy [5,8,10]. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery presents several challenges in the excision of bladder diverticula: (1) difficulty accurately determining the location of the diverticulum’s opening, leading to excessive or incomplete resection [11]; (2) complications due to difficulty protecting the ureteral orifice and ureters, resulting in potential ureteral injuries [10]; (3) challenges in distinguishing between the diverticular wall and normal bladder wall, complicating proper layer separation [12]; and (4) imprecise suturing of the bladder wall post-resection, raising the risk of urine leakage [5]. Addressing these issues, recent studies have highlighted the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery, which offers enhanced visualization and precision during procedures [13,14]. The high-definition 3D visual system and the dexterity of the wristed instruments allow for accurate localization of the diverticulum neck and meticulous dissection. Moreover, the magnified field of view and refined movements contribute to reduced intraoperative bleeding, enhancing the safety of the surgery [15]. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated that robotic assistance significantly improves patients’ postoperative urinary symptoms and quality of life [16]. However, it should be noted that robotic-assisted surgery has not fundamentally resolved these issues.In response to these limitations, experts have proposed utilizing a dual-scope approach that combines laparoscopy and cystoscopy for enhanced visualization during surgery. Recent advancements include the use of a gas cystoscopy technique for bladder diverticulum resection. In a study by Badaw et al., an extraperitoneal approach was employed with the bladder inflated using gas, allowing for clearer visualization of the diverticulum during laparoscopic procedures [17]. Building upon these innovations, we have further explored surgical techniques, resulting in the development of the “Modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy”. When examining the advantages of our Modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy over existing surgical approaches, it is essential to acknowledge the contributions of Professor Vito Pansadoro. In his seminal work [18]. Professor Pansadoro demonstrated a surgical method for the excision of bladder diverticula via a transvesical three-port technique, utilizing one observational port and two working ports. This methodology provided a new perspective in the field of minimally invasive surgery at the time and has inspired subsequent technological innovations.

Our Modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy evolved from the foundational work of Professor Pansadoro. By using a single cystoscope as the visual instrument, it not only enhances the surgical maneuverability but also reduces the surgical complexity and patient trauma. This refined minimally invasive surgical access combines Professor Pansadoro’s innovative thinking with our further optimization of procedural steps. Considering the limited working space in the suprapubic region, our technique reduces the number of suprapubic channels by using the cystoscope as the sole visual instrument, thereby increasing the maneuverability of the two working channels and decreasing both the surgical difficulty and patient trauma. The aim of this study is to improve surgical efficacy, reduce operative time, and enhance patient satisfaction regarding minimally invasive approaches. To date, we have successfully performed ten cases of diverticulectomy using this Modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy.

We adopted a retrospective study and collected 10 patients who underwent Modified Laparoscopic Transvesical Diverticulectomy in the Department of Urology, Shandong Provincial Hospital between 2022 and 2024. Among them, 3 patients simultaneously underwent Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, in aspects such as the operation time and blood loss that were affected by TURP, only the data of the other 7 patients who underwent bladder diverticulum surgery alone were analyzed.

The collected data mainly included two aspects, namely the patients’ basic conditions and surgery-related data, such as age, gender, urinary tract infection status, the location of the diverticulum, as well as the duration of the operation, intraoperative blood loss, and the length of hospital stay.

In our study, we focused on evaluating the perioperative results and complications. The primary endpoint was to assess the efficacy and safety of the surgery, with the expectation of finding the fulcrum for promoting this surgical technique.

Surgical Procedure The patient was placed in the lithotomy position and underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Standard disinfection and draping procedures were implemented. A 70° cystoscope was inserted into the bladder through the urethra. The assistant, standing at the patient’s foot side, manipulated the cystoscope and filled the bladder with normal saline through the water inlet of the cystoscope to ensure its adequate distension. Under the cystoscopic view, the opening of the diverticulum and the bilateral ureteral orifices could be precisely located, thus preventing damage to the ureteral orifices during subsequent procedures. Subsequently, the bladder was pressed through its surface projection, and the corresponding bladder wall could be observed to bulge inward under the cystoscope. By this method, the most suitable trocar puncture points for the surgical operation could be determined. The appropriate puncture points were located 2 cm above the pubis, approximately 2–3 cm beside the midline on both sides. To find more favorable puncture angles for the two trocars, two Veress needles could be inserted into the bladder from the determined puncture points. The puncture angles of the Veress needles were adjusted based on the relationship between the two Veress needles and the opening of the diverticulum until the angles were conducive to the subsequent instrument manipulation. Additionally, the insertion points of the trocars usually tended to be biased towards the opposite side of the diverticulum (that is, if the diverticulum was on the left side, the two puncture points were appropriately shifted to the right as a whole, and vice versa) to provide a larger operative space for the surgery. (Refer to Fig.1for the specific surgical instrument layout). Subsequently, the normal saline in the bladder was drained, and CO₂ was injected at a flow rate of 20 L/min to maintain an intravesical pressure of 12 mmHg, establishing a “gas bladder”. The 70° cystoscope served as the viewing scope, and the two 5 mm trocars were used as the operating channels. Firstly, an electrocautery hook was used to make a circular incision along the edge of the diverticulum opening and dissect it to the bladder muscular layer. Then, the mucosa of the diverticulum was lifted, and an ultrasonic scalpel was used to further dissect along the submucosa until the diverticulum was completely detached. (See Fig.2for the surgical management of the giant bladder diverticulum). After that, the trocars could be removed, the cystoscope was inserted into the bladder through the abdominal wall puncture site for observation, and a grasping forceps was inserted into the bladder through the urethra. After grasping the resected diverticulum, it could be removed through the urethra. Next, 3 − 0 absorbable self - locking sutures were used to suture the incisions of the bladder muscular layer and mucosal layer. (Since the suture needle was too large to directly pass through the 5 mm trocar port into the bladder, it needed to be straightened a little outside the body so that it could be smoothly inserted into the bladder through the trocar port. After entering the bladder, it could be repositioned with two grasping forceps). Optionally, a double - lumen F14 catheter could be inserted through the left trocar puncture point above the pubis using a puncture kit for cystostomy. Finally, the abdominal wall puncture sites were routinely closed.

Notably, in this study, unlike traditional bladder diverticulum surgery, no patients required ureteric catheterization. This is because our modified technique enables direct visualization of the bladder’s internal anatomy via cystoscopy, allowing precise localization of the ureteral orifices and effective avoidance of ureteral injury during the procedure, thus eliminating the need for this step to streamline the surgical workflow. Additionally, due to the small diameter of the Trocar puncture sites and the relatively short operative duration, no gas leakage occurred from the trocars, and upsizing to 10 mm trocars was unnecessary. Furthermore, no peritoneal or retroperitoneal gas leakage was observed, and the bladder remained consistently well-distended after CO₂ insufflation. The gas-distended bladder physiologically mimics a saline-filled bladder, with ureteral orifices compressed to prevent pneumoureter, and renal function in patients was not impaired by this procedure. Intraoperatively, the Trendelenberg position was unnecessary; a horizontal lithotomy position was sufficient, as abdominal organs did not interfere with complete bladder insufflation or operative access.

Innovative Surgical Access: Unlike the conventional laparoscopic approach that conducts the excision from the outside of the bladder towards the inside, the Modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy adopts an inside-out approach. Specifically, it directly visualizes the internal structure of the bladder through the cystoscope, which significantly enhances the accuracy of precisely identifying the opening of the bladder diverticulum and the ureteral orifices. This allows for a more targeted and effective resection process as the dissection starts from within the bladder and proceeds outwards, in contrast to the traditional external-to-internal approach.

Application of CO2Gas Bladder: The technique employs the injection of CO2gas into the bladder instead of traditional saline, creating a “gas bladder.” This facilitates a clearer operational field for surgical instruments while also addressing the performance limitations of electrocautery and ultrasonic devices in fluid environments.

Precise Trocar Puncture Point Location: Utilizing the cystoscope allows for precise determination of trocar insertion points, thereby reducing damage to surrounding tissues and ensuring the accuracy and safety of surgical operations.

Simplification of Surgical Steps: The modified technique omits the bladder suspension step common in traditional surgeries. Due to the CO2-induced distension of the bladder and the strategic placement of two trocars, the bladder is naturally fixed, thereby simplifying the surgical procedure and reducing the operation time.

Enhanced Minimally Invasive Nature: By using only two 5 mm trocars for the procedure, the number and size of abdominal incisions are significantly reduced, leading to decreased postoperative pain and shorter recovery times.

A total of 10 patients underwent modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy. Among them, 9 were male and 1 was female. The ages ranged from 54 to 78 years old (with an average age of 70.6 years). The clinical symptoms included frequent urination, dysuria, double voiding, and urinary tract irritation. Preoperative urine tests confirmed that 5 patients had urinary tract infections, and among them, 3 patients had positive urine cultures. The culture results included Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The locations of the bladder diverticula were as follows: 9 were on the posterior wall, 1 was on the left wall. Most (7 cases) were located on the right posterior wall. The maximum diameter of the diverticula ranged from 4.2 to 9.6 centimeters, and the diameter of the diverticular openings ranged from 0.5 to 1 centimeter. The post-void residual urine volume of 5 patients exceeded 50 milliliters, with the maximum being 800 milliliters. The general information of the patients is shown in Table1.

All surgeries were completed smoothly. Indwelling urinary catheters were placed after the operations. Among all the ten patients, 3 underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) simultaneously. Compared with the preoperative situation, the postoperative clinical symptoms were significantly improved, and the surgical outcomes were satisfactory. In the 7 patients who did not undergo TURP simultaneously, the average duration of the operation was 1.13 h, the average estimated intraoperative blood loss was 7.86 milliliters, the average postoperative hospital stay was 4.29 days, and the average number of days for indwelling urinary catheters after the operation was 9.29 days. One patient developed a postoperative complication, namely deep vein thrombosis in both lower extremities, and the condition became stable after treatment. Since the surgical indicators of the other 3 patients who underwent TURP simultaneously were greatly affected, they were counted separately. The surgical indicators of all patients are shown in Table2.

The follow-up results (median follow-up time: 19 months, range: 10–32 months) indicated that the postoperative symptoms of all patients were significantly improved, and there were no reported recurrence cases. It is worth noting that due to the minimally invasive nature of this operation, it performed outstandingly in terms of patient satisfaction.

The present study evaluated a modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy in 10 patients with giant bladder diverticula, confirming its potential as a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment.

All patients showed significant postoperative improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms (e.g., frequent urination, dysuria), which we attribute to precise diverticulum resection. This precision was enabled by cystoscopic visualization of the diverticular opening and ureteral orifices—addressing a key limitation of traditional laparoscopic approaches, which often struggle with anatomical localization.

The overall complication rate within 30 days after the operation was 10.0%. Although one patient developed deep vein thrombosis in both lower extremities, this complication was effectively managed and the patient’s condition stabilized. The relatively low complication rate suggests that the modified technique is a statistically safe option, especially considering the potential risks associated with surgical interventions in the urinary system. To further validate its renal safety—a key concern in urological interventions—we analyzed preoperative and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data in the 7 patients who underwent isolated diverticulectomy (excluding TURP cases). Paired t-test results showed no significant difference in eGFR (t = −0.82,P= 0.44), confirming that bladder insufflation during the procedure does not adversely affect renal function.

The precise trocar puncture point location, guided by the cystoscope, reduced damage to the surrounding tissues. This not only minimized the intraoperative blood loss (as evidenced by the average estimated intraoperative blood loss of 7.86 ml in the 7 patients without concurrent TURP) but also decreased the risk of inadvertent injury to important structures such as the ureters.

Compared to traditional laparoscopic surgeries, our modified technique omits the bladder suspension step and simplifies the procedure through the use of CO₂ gas to distend the bladder and strategically placed trocars. This simplification led to shorter operative times (an average of 1.13 h in the 7 patients without concurrent TURP) and potentially less patient trauma.Compared with the most prevalent robotic surgery, the mean operative time for patients without concurrent TURP in this study was 1.13 h, which is significantly shorter than the median operative time of 166 min (approximately 2.77 h) reported in similar studies on robot-assisted bladder diverticulectomy (RBD). This advantage stems from the streamlined surgical steps of our modified technique. In terms of intraoperative blood loss, the average blood loss for patients without concurrent TURP was 7.86 mL, substantially lower than the average estimated blood loss of 75 mL in RBD—likely a result of the minimally invasive nature of our approach and the shorter operative duration. Regarding complication rates, the 14.3% rate in this study is lower than the 50% incidence of urinary tract infections within 30 days post-RBD, underscoring the superiority of our surgical technique in mitigating complication risks [11].

Notably, the modified laparoscopic transvesical diverticulectomy technique can be performed concurrently with transurethral resection or enucleation of the prostate, expanding its clinical applications. This is beneficial as it allows for a single scope to be used throughout the procedure, simplifying the surgical steps and reducing operative time. For example, Compared to the combined application of transurethral enucleation of the prostate (TUEP) with laparoscopic bladder diverticulectomy (LD) [19] which is not uncommon in clinical practice, the modified technique offers further conveniences. The continuous use of the cystoscope as the sole visual instrument eliminates the need for switching between scopes, which is often required in dual-scope techniques. This not only saves time but also reduces the potential for errors during the procedure.

Concurrent TURP prolonged operative time (2.73 vs. 1.13 h) and increased blood loss (66.67 vs. 7.86 ml) due to added complexity. Clinically, concurrent surgery may benefit patients with good physical tolerance, while staged procedures are preferable for those with higher risk.

Nevertheless, the relatively small sample size of 10 patients in this study is a limitation. A larger sample size would provide more robust data and allow for a more comprehensive analysis of the technique’s efficacy and safety. Future studies should aim to include a larger number of patients to further validate the findings of this study. Although the short-term follow-up results showed no recurrence cases and significant symptom improvement, long-term follow-up is essential to assess the durability of the treatment effect. Longer-term studies could monitor for potential late complications and determine whether the improvements in symptoms and quality of life are sustained over time. Further comparative studies with other established surgical techniques, such as robotic-assisted diverticulectomy and open surgery, would be beneficial. These studies could provide more detailed insights into the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach and help clinicians make more informed decisions regarding the most appropriate treatment option for patients with bladder diverticula.

In conclusion, this modified technique is a promising minimally invasive option for giant bladder diverticula, with advantages in efficacy, safety, and simplicity. Further research with larger cohorts and long-term follow-up is warranted to confirm its role.
