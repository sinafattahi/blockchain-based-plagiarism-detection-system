Studies on the relationship between physical activity (PA) and depression often rely on self-reported data, with a predominant focus on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). However, research examining accelerometer-measured PA, particularly light physical activity (LPA), and its impact on depression risk in the general population remains limited. This study explores the dose-response relationship between accelerometer-measured PA and depression, with a particular focus on varying PA intensities and high-risk groups for depression, including women and individuals with obesity. This prospective cohort study involved 90,585 participants with accelerometer-measured PA data from the UK Biobank Study. Total PA volume was assessed using the average overall acceleration (ACC). Weekly minutes of LPA, moderate PA (MPA), and vigorous PA (VPA) were recorded. Incident cases of clinical depression were identified through diagnostic codes linked to hospital records and death certificates. Cox proportional hazards models with restricted cubic splines were used to analyze the associations. During an average follow-up period of 8.35 ± 0.97 years, 1,641 participants (2.2 per 1,000 person-years) developed depression. Depression risk decreased as total ACC reached 30 mg and as time spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA increased to 2000, 500, and 50 min per week, respectively, beyond which no further reduction in risk was observed. Higher-intensity PA, particularly VPA, did not provide additional benefits for depression when total PA volume was comparable. The relationship between LPA and depression risk was moderated by gender and obesity status, with no significant risk reduction observed in women and individuals with obesity engaging in LPA. Device-measured PA across all intensities, including LPA, MPA, and VPA, was associated with a reduced risk of depression, though the reduction was more dependent on PA volume than intensity. A threshold effect was observed, beyond which additional benefits diminished. Nonetheless, MVPA remains recommended for women and individuals with obesity.

Depression is a major public health issue globally, contributing to significant economic and societal costs in both developed and developing regions [1]. Despite the availability of effective treatments, evidence suggests that even under ideal circumstances, only a portion of the overall burden of depression can be alleviated, underscoring the need for additional strategies to mitigate its impact [2]. One area of growing interest is the role of physical activity (PA) as a potentially modifiable factor that may help lower the risk and severity of depression [3].

Most existing research focuses on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and its association with reduced depression risk, often relying on self-reported questionnaires, which may inaccurately capture true activity levels [3,4]. These questionnaires primarily measure MVPA, but fail to accurately assess light physical activity (LPA). Critically, the interplay between PA and social engagement—a bidirectional relationship often disrupted in depression—may underlie both symptom maintenance and intervention efficacy [5–8]. For instance, social withdrawal, a hallmark of depression, reduces opportunities for activity participation (e.g., group exercises, outdoor walks), while inactivity further exacerbates isolation, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Even small amounts of LPA, such as standing or brief walks, may counteract depressive symptoms by not only mitigating sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g., psychomotor slowing) but also facilitating incidental social interactions (e.g., casual conversations during walks) that rebuild social confidence and engagement. However, to date, investigations into the association between LPA and depression have been relatively scarce.

Current guidelines recommend that adults engage in MVPA, such as brisk walking or more intense activities [9]. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises 150–300 min of moderate physical activity (MPA) or 75–150 min of vigorous physical activity (VPA) per week, based on evidence suggesting that MVPA provides greater health benefits than LPA such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced mortality [10], a reduced risk of cancer [11], and a lower risk of diabetes [12]. However, challenges in PA measurement accuracy and uncertainties surrounding the relationship between PA intensity and depression incidence complicate efforts to determine the precise dose-response relationship [13]. Additionally, depression is characterized by clinical features such as psychomotor retardation, fatigue, and reduced motivation, all of which may influence an individual’s ability to engage in PA [7,14–16]. Understanding how different intensities of PA, including LPA, interact with these clinical symptoms is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Furthermore, there is a gap in understanding how PA influences depression in high-risk groups such as women and individuals with obesity [17,18]. To address these limitations and refine public health recommendations, future research should employ device-based PA, such as accelerometers, which provide more accurate estimates of PA levels than self-reported data [19]. This study uses data from the UK Biobank, the largest study to date employing accelerometer-measured PA, to examine the dose-response relationship between accelerometer-measured PA and depression, with a focus on different PA intensities and high-risk groups, including women and individuals with obesity.

The UK Biobank study, a population-based prospective cohort study, was conducted across the UK between 2006 and 2010, enrolling over 500,000 participants aged 40–69 years. The study collected comprehensive baseline data, including demographic information, clinical characteristics, lifestyle factors, medical history, and biological samples, through physical examinations, interviews, and laboratory tests. The study design has been previously detailed, and it received approval from the North West Multi-Center Research Ethics Committee (299116). All participants provided informed consent. For further details, please refer to the UK Biobank website atwww.ukbiobank.ac.uk. We confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Between 2013 and 2015, PA data were collected from 103,686 participants of the UK Biobank using Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers [20]. Participants were invited randomly via email and asked to wear the accelerometer on their dominant wrist continuously for 7 days, without removing it at any time, including during work, walking, and sleep. They were informed in the invitation email and device mail-out letter that they should carry on with their normal activities while wearing the accelerometer. Participants were instructed to start wearing the device immediately upon receiving it in the post. After the monitoring period, participants were required to return the device to the coordinating center using a pre-paid return envelope. Raw acceleration data were collected at a 100 Hz resolution and calibrated for local gravity and ambient temperature. The calibration process involved selecting non-movement periods with a standard deviation of <13 mg across all three axes to ensure the vector magnitude was 1 g. If sufficient non-movement data were not available for an individual, calibration was based on data from the next user of the same device. In our study, we used the summary metrics provided by the UK Biobank (Data-Field 90012,90092-90158). Detailed methods for data collection and processing have been described in previous studies [19,20]. Participants with a history of depression (n = 8,308) or implausibly high activity readings were excluded, resulting in a total exclusion of 13,101 participants. Thus, 90,585 participants were included in the final analysis.

The total volume of PA was assessed using the average overall acceleration (ACC, 27.6 ± 13.4 mg). Weekly time spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA was defined based on the duration of activities with an ACC of 30–125 mg, 125–400 mg, and >400 mg, respectively [10,21]. The intensity of PA was defined as the percentage of the time of VPA in the total time of MVPA.

Incident depression events were ascertained from both hospital records and death certificates to ensure comprehensive capture of outcomes. The start of the follow-up period was defined individually for each participant as the date they completed the accelerometer wear period. Participants with a prior diagnosis of depression, identified via retrospective linkage to hospital records, were excluded from the analysis (Supplementary Figure1). Depression cases were defined using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes: ICD-9 (code 311) and ICD-10 (codes F32 and F33). In hospital records, depression was classified as present if either a primary or secondary diagnosis corresponded to these ICD codes.The follow-up period for each participant extended from the date of PA measurement completion until the first recorded diagnosis of depression or until May 31, 2022, whichever occurred first.

Baseline characteristics, such as age, gender (men/women), Race (White/Non-White), and, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of heart failure (HF), diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, dietary score, educational attainment, employment status, and the Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI), were gathered through questionnaires, interviews, and medical records. Smoking status was categorized based on self-reports as Never, Occasional, or Current smoker. Alcohol consumption was classified by participants’ self-reported average weekly intake, ranging from Daily, 3-4 times per week, 1-2 times per week, 1-3 times per month, to Occasionally or Never. The dietary score (on a scale of 0 to 4) was calculated based on the intake of key dietary components: daily consumption of at least four tablespoons of vegetables (either raw or cooked), at least three pieces of fruit per day, eating fish at least twice a week, and limiting processed meat to no more than twice weekly [10]. History of diabetes, HF, MI, and stroke were determined based on self-reported physician diagnosis, or hospital records. TDI was derived from national census data, identifying areas with varying levels of socio-economic deprivation and highlighting the challenges faced by residents in the most and least disadvantaged regions [21]. Measurements of physical health, including cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength (kg), body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), were collected at the study assessment center. Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by calculating net oxygen consumption based on participants’ body weight and maximum workload achieved during cycle ergometry on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) [10]. The equation used was: net oxygen consumption = 7 + 10.8 (workload)/weight. Grip strength was determined as the average of measurements from both the right and left hands, adjusted for body weight [10]. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m²).

Chi-square tests were used to analyze categorical variables, while continuous variables were assessed using either analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Mann–Whitney U-tests, depending on their distribution. Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to evaluate the relationship between PA – including total PA and time spent in LPA, MPA and VPA, both as categorical and continuous variables – and the incidence of depression, using two models. Model 1 was adjusted for age, gender, and race, while Model 2 included additional adjustments for grip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, TDI, MET, employment status, diet score, tobacco and alcohol consumption, BMI, diabetes, HF, stroke, MI, DBP, SBP, LDL, and HDL.Additionally, we employed restricted cubic splines with four knots to flexibly model the dose–response relationship between PA and depression risk. A two-piecewise linear regression model was also used to explore potential threshold effects of PA on depression risk [22]. The threshold value was determined through a trial-and-error method, whereby the turning point was moved along a predefined interval, and the value that maximized model likelihood was selected. To assess linear trends, we entered the median values of each PA category as continuous variables in both models. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated to estimate the proportion of depression cases that could have been prevented if individuals in specific PA categories were as active as those in the highest activity group, under the assumption that these associations were causal [23]. Previous research has indicated that not only the volume of PA but also its intensity plays a crucial role on cardiovascular outcomes or mortality [10,19]. Therefore, we examined the impact of PA intensity on depression risk by further adjusting for total PA or time spent in MVPA, recognizing that individuals with the same total PA but different intensity levels may experience differing risks of depression. The proportional hazards assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals for each model, confirming that the assumption was met across all Cox regression models. Given that previous studies have suggested that women and individuals with obesity may have a higher risk of developing depression, subgroup and interaction analyses were conducted based on age (≤60 years, >60 years), gender, and obesity status. Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding cases of depression within the first two years of follow-up, participants older than 65 years, those with a history of MI, HF, diabetes, or stroke, and participants with missing variables. Additionally, we further adjusted for sleep quality (total sleep time and insomnia), as insufficient or poor-quality sleep may influence the intensity, duration, or frequency of physical activity, potentially confounding the observed relationships with depression risk [24]. Competing risk models were also performed to account for all-cause mortality, as this could preclude depression onset. All statistical analyses were two-sided, with a significance level set at P < 0.05. The analyses were conducted using Stata/MP version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).

Of the 103,686 participants in the accelerometer-measured PA study, 90,585 were included in the final analysis after excluding those with problematic PA data and a history of depression (Supplementary Figure1). During a mean follow-up period of 8.35 ± 0.97 years, 1,641 participants developed depression, corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.2 per 1,000 person-years. The baseline characteristics of the included participants, stratified by depression status, are presented in Table1. Participants who developed depression tended to have lower levels of PA, including LPA, MPA, and VPA. They were more likely to be female, White, and have a history of MI, diabetes, or stroke. Additionally, they had lower grip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and higher consumption of alcohol and cigarettes. Furthermore, they exhibited higher TDI, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to those without depression.

We found no evidence of a violation of the proportional hazards assumption in our analysis. Total PA, LPA, MPA, and VPA was all inversely related to depression risk when adjusted for relevant confounders (Table2). A 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in total PA was associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of depression incidence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74–0.86; Model 2, Table2). Similarly, increased time spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA was each associated with a lower risk of developing depression. Specifically, the hazard ratios for each 1 SD increase were as follows: LPA (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82–0.94), MPA (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80–0.90), and VPA (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80–0.90) (Model 2, Table2). Meeting the WHO/ESC/AHA recommendations for PA was also associated with a reduced risk of depression for both MPA (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54–0.74; Model 2) and VPA (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52–0.82; Model 2, Table2).

The association between total PA and the time spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA with the risk of depression was non-linear. The risk of depression decreased sharply with increasing total PA up to 30 mg, after which the decrease plateaued (Fig.1A). Similarly, as time spent in LPA increased up to 2000 min per week, the risk of depression declined, but beyond this point, further increases in LPA did not result in additional risk reduction (Fig.1B). For MPA, the risk of depression declined steeply until reaching 500 min per week, after which the reduction remained relatively stable (Fig.1C). In the case of VPA, the risk of depression dropped sharply up to 50 min per week, with a more gradual decline observed beyond this threshold (Fig.1D).

We further examined the relationship between PA intensity (VPA/MVPA) and the risk of depression (Table3). As the quantiles of PA intensity increased, the risk of depression decreased accordingly when adjusting for Model 1 plus total PA (HR, 0.94 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00) or MVPA (HR, 0.91 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 0.86–0.96), while accounting for all participants having the same levels of total PA or MVPA. However, after adjusting for Model 2 plus total PA (HR, 0.98 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 0.93–1.04) or MVPA (HR, 0.96 per 5% increase; 95% CI, 0.91–1.02), there was no significant relationship between PA intensity and depression risk. With increasing levels of quantiles of PA intensity, the risk of depression did not decrease accordingly.

Subgroup analyses revealed that gender and obesity status interacted in the association between LPA and the risk of depression. A stronger association between LPA and depression risk was observed in women and participants without obesity (Fig.2). However, we did not find a significant protective effect of LPA against depression in men or participants with obesity. Additionally, age, gender, and obesity status did not demonstrate any interaction in the association between total PA, MPA, or VPA and depression risk (Fig.2). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our results, excluding cases of depression within the first two years of follow-up, participants older than 65 years, those with a history of MI, HF, diabetes, or stroke, participants with missing variables, as well as by further adjusting for sleep quality (Supplementary Table1).We used the competing risk model instead of the Cox proportional hazards model, and the results remained consistent (Supplemental Table2).

This study found that all forms of PA, including LPA, MPA, VPA, were associated with a lower risk of depression. However, PA intensity—particularly VPA—did not appear to play a significant role in further reducing depression risk. The benefits of PA plateaued at specific thresholds: 2000 min per week for LPA, 500 min per week for MPA, and 50 min per week for VPA. At the population level, considering that most individuals in the UK Biobank engaged in approximately 25 min of VPA per week, promoting VPA to align with the WHO’s recommendation could potentially help reduce the burden of depression. Furthermore, we found that gender and obesity status moderated the relationship between LPA and depression risk, with women and individuals with obesity more likely to benefit from engaging in MVPA rather than LPA.

There is a paucity of high-quality, longitudinal research using device-based measures to assess the association between PA and risk of depression.Consistent with previous studies measured by self-reported questionnaires, MVPA is associated with a reduced risk of depression [21,25,26]. It is important to note that PA levels measured by accelerometers are significantly higher than those reported through self-reported data. This discrepancy arises because self-reported methods often overlook shorter bouts of MVPA, capturing only sustained activities, whereas accelerometers record both sustained and intermittent activities with greater accuracy. Previous studies mainly focused on long-time MVPA because of lack of methods to accurately measure intermittent or short-time VPA, leaving a gap in understanding the effect of LPA on depression risk. Recent studies found that short bouts of high-intensity interval PA are also beneficial for health [27,28]. Furthermore, the accuracy of measuring sustained activity can be limited, particularly when relying on self-reported methods. For example, Hallgren et al. found no significant association between the recommended minimum weekly duration of MPA (150 min/week) and a reduced risk of depression, with lower depression risk observed only at levels exceeding 300 min per week [25]. This underscores the need to reassess current PA guidelines, which are predominantly based on self-reported data.

Due to the limitations of self-reported questionnaires, the benefits of LPA have often been overlooked in previous studies. Kandola et al. demonstrated that LPA reduces the risk of depression in adolescents by using accelerometers to objectively measure PA levels [29]. Our present study expands this finding to the adult population, which is particularly relevant for specific groups such as individuals with physical limitations or chronic conditions. These populations are also at a higher risk of depression compared to the general population [30,31]. Most importantly, we further explored the relationship between PA intensity and depression risk, as well as the dose-response relationship between various types of PA and depression risk. Our findings indicate that higher-intensity PA does not provide greater benefits for depression compared to lower-intensity PA when total activity levels are accounted for. Additionally, we found that most participants achieved the optimal levels of LPA (2,000 min per week) and MPA (500 min per week) associated with the most cost-effective reduction in depression risk. However, VPA remains well below the optimal target of 50 min per week for maximizing depression risk reduction. Our study provides individualized strategies for PA that may be more practical, appealing, and likely to be adopted by different individuals, offering a tailored approach to managing depression risk through PA.

This study has several key strengths. First, it utilized device-measured PA, providing an accurate reflection of participants’ actual PA levels and minimizing recall or reporting bias. To reduce the potential for reverse causation from subclinical or preclinical conditions, we conducted landmark analyses, excluding participants diagnosed with depression within the first two years of follow-up. Additionally, we examined comorbidities such as MI, diabetes, and HF, as well as missing variables, in the sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analyses yielded largely consistent results, bolstering confidence in the findings. Moreover, we adjusted for potential mediators or confounders, such as BMI, grip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and comorbidities. This study also accounted for competing risks from deaths due to other causes—an important consideration, as physically inactive individuals tend to have higher mortality and may not live long enough to develop depression.

The UK Biobank is not fully representative of the general UK population, as it exhibits a healthy volunteer selection bias [32]. These results should be interpreted with caution when applied to other populations, such as Asians, who may have different characteristics and lifestyles. The calculation of PFP assumes a causal relationship, which cannot be confirmed in an observational study. Although adjustments were made for a wide range of covariates, the possibility of residual confounding and reverse causation cannot be entirely ruled out. Thus, causal interpretations should be made with caution. Despite these limitations, the PFP estimates provided in this study remain valuable for comparison with existing literature. PA measurement and baseline characteristics were collected at different times. Lastly, PA data were gathered between 2013 and 2015, with a median follow-up period of 5.7 years. However, a previous study reported that baseline characteristics remained largely consistent in participants with multiple visits [19]. The physical activity thresholds were originally developed using a different accelerometer model, which may lead to discrepancies in activity classification [33]. Additionally, these thresholds were established based on a younger population, whereas the UK Biobank cohort consists mainly of middle-aged and older adults. Differences in device specifications and age-related movement patterns could affect the accuracy of activity classification.

Device-measured PA across all intensities, including LPA, MPA, and VPA levels was associated with a reduced risk of depression, though the reduction was more dependent on PA volume than intensity level. However, for all intensities, there appears to be a threshold beyond which additional benefits become less significant. Despite this, MVPA remains recommended for women and individuals with obesity.
