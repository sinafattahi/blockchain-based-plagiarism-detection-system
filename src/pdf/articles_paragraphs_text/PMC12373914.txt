In this study, the protective effect ofCalendula officinalisflower extract, which has many pharmacological and biological activities against molybdenum toxicity was investigated. Molybdenum toxicity and the protective effect of the extract were determined byAlliumtest. For this purpose, six different groups were formed and the protective effect was determined by determining the decrease in toxic effects on morpho-physiological, biochemical, cytogenetic and anatomical parameters induced by molybdenum. The phenolic component content ofC. officinalisflower extract was also determined by LC-MS/MS analysis and correlated with the protective effect. Molybdenum caused a multifaceted toxicity inAllium cepa; a decline in physiological development, a decline in germination percentage to 73%, accompanied by a significant reduction in root length and weight gain values in comparison to the control values. Molybdenum-treated group exhibited an increase in malondialdehyde, superoxidase and catalase activity, reaching 2.51, 1.68, and 2.64 times the levels observed in the control group, respectively. In this study, it was determined that the mitotic index decreased by 25.7% in the molybdenum -treated group compared to the control group, and it also significantly increased the micronucleus level. These molybdenum-induced abnormalities were regressed byC. officinalisextract application and this protective effect was dose-dependently accelerated. The decrease in root elongation, a critical parameter in physio-morphological development, was regressed in the range of 6.75–20.6% with extract application. In the genotoxic parameters of fragment, bridge, and micronucleus frequencies, 100 µg/mLC. officinalisextract application provided protection ranging from 25.8 to 34.9%, while 200 µg/mLC. officinalisextract showed protection ranging from 37.7 to 62.4%. Malondialdehyde level, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity values decreased by 37.76%, 23.12% and 46.97%, respectively, in the molybdenum + 200 µg/mLC. officinalistreated group. The chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b values in the same group showed improvement, reaching 1.65 and 1.87 times that of the molybdenum-treated group, respectively. In this study, the flower extract ofC. officinalisexhibited notable protective effects against molybdenum-induced toxicity. These findings suggest the potential therapeutic applications ofC. officinalisin mitigating metal-induced oxidative stress. Future investigations are required to further characterize and identify natural extracts with antioxidant properties, with a focus on their mechanistic pathways.

Environmental pollution increases the level of hazardous chemical agents that adversely affect all organisms. Chemicals that cause various toxic effects exhibit cytotoxic effects through oxidative stress associated with the production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause cell death1. In the reduction of these toxic effects, especially cytotoxicity, herbal extracts attract attention with their natural structure and strong antioxidant properties. Despite the plethora of studies conducted on these natural extracts, the vast array of plant biodiversity present in both Turkiye and the world renders existing research insufficient. In this study, the protective effects ofCalendula officinalisL., which was used for wound healing, digestive problems and various skin lesions in the Middle Ages in the XIIth century, against the toxicity of molybdenum were investigated.C. officinalisbelongs to the Asteraceae family and is distinguished by its herbaceous stem and whole or slightly dissected leaves2. The plant is capable of attaining a height of between 25 and 80 centimetres. The leaves measure between 5 and 15 centimetres in length and between 1 and 3 centimetres in width, with the leaves clasping the stem. The corollary is yellow or orange, with a length approximately twice that of the involucre and a width of 4–5 mm at the base. The tubular flowers are triangular-lanceolate and lobed. Notably, under optimal conditions, these flowers exhibit a persistent blooming capacity throughout the year. The flowers close when there is a chance of rain and are thus used in weather forecasting3,4. In ethnobotanical studies conducted in Turkiye,C. officinalishas been recorded as a treatment for psoriasis among the local population. It has been reported thatC. officinalisflowers are used externally for eczema and psoriasis in the form of a cream, and that the above-ground parts are used externally for eczema and psoriasis in the form of an ointment5.C. officinalishas been reported to be used in the treatment of jaundice, as an antispasmodic and as an effective agent for blood purification. The large colourful flowers of the plant also have important biological and pharmacological properties. In India, ointments obtained from the flowers are reported to be used in the treatment of herpes, wounds, scars and blood purification6,7.

Plants realise their protective effects especially through antioxidant activity. There are studies investigating the antioxidant activity ofC. officinalisin the literature. Coyago-Cruz et al.8reported thatC. officinalisflowers collected from Ecuador have significant radical scavenging activity and exhibit strong antioxidant activity, calculating ABTS radical scavenging activity to be 88%. Preethi et al.9found thatC. officinalisflower extract scavenged superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, exhibiting IC50values of 500 µg/mL and 480 µg/mL, respectively, thereby supporting its antioxidant effect. The pharmacological and biological effects ofC. officinalishave been associated with the active components it contains. A diversity of phytochemicals has been observed inC. officinaliscollected from different regions. In addition, the level of the same phytochemical varies according to the region from which it is collected. Terpenoids, flavonoids and phenolics, sterols, saponins, amino acids and essential oils are the main categories of phytochemicals contained inC. officinalis10. Flavonoids represent the most prevalent components inC. officinalisextracts, and the presence of flavonoids with diverse structures, including neohesperidoside, rutinoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, sorhamnetin-3-O-2G-rhamnosyl rutinoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-2G, has been documented in the literature11,12. A study of essential oils derived fromC. officinalisrevealed the presence of compounds with significant antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The essential oils detected in plant extracts collected from different regions include thujene, limonene, terpene-4-ol, 2-pentylfuran, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, α-cadinol, safranal, carvone, p-thymol, δ-cadinene, calamemene and cadalene13–15.

Molybdenum is a trace element for many organisms and is required in small amounts in biochemical reactions, particularly in cofactor function. Some of the metabolic pathways in which molybdenum is involved are nitrogen metabolism, purine catabolism, hormone biosynthesis and sulphur metabolism16. Extensive studies on abnormalities that may occur in plants in molybdenum deficiency are available in the literature17,18but studies on abnormalities that may occur in plants in the presence of molybdenum above the required amount are insufficient. Özkan et al.19reported that molybdenum exposure at doses above trace levels induced oxidative stress and exhibited genotoxic effects. In this study, the phytochemical content of flower parts ofC. officinaliscollected from Giresun (Türkiye) was investigated by LC-MS/MS and its protective effect against molybdenum-induced toxicity was investigated. The protective effect ofC. officinalisagainst morpho-physiological, cytogenetic, biochemical and anatomical abnormalities induced by molybdenum was determined and the radical scavenging activity of the extract was tested to determine the dose ofC. officinalisto be tested. Studies investigating the effects of heavy metals on agriculturally important plants, such as in this study, are very valuable, but investigating the solution while identifying a problem increases the original value and impact of the study. In this context, this study investigates the toxic effect of molybdenum and the solution that can be applied to eliminate this effect.

Calendula officinaliswas collected from Giresun (Türkiye) and the identification of the plant was made in Giresun University Department of Botany by Dr. Zafer TÜRKMEN. A sample was stored in the herbarium of the department with the voucher number BIO-C-off253/2024. Experimental research and field studies on plants, including the collection of plant material, comply with relevant institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. The colored flower parts of the plant were separated and dried at 35 °C for 2 days. 2 g of dry sample was incubated in 100 mL ethanol in a shaking oven. At the end of the incubation period, the liquid phase was cleaned of solid particles and evaporated with an evaporator20,21. The residue obtained at the end of evaporation was collected and used to determine the protective effect of the plant. Plants provide protection against many diseases and toxicities and this protective effect is closely related to the antioxidant effect and the antioxidant effect is closely related to the phenolic compounds contained in the plant. For this purpose, the superoxide removal activity ofC. officinaliswas first determined. In this way, both the antioxidant effect and the dose to be used in the study were determined. The method used in superoxide scavenging activity is given in Supp. Mat. The IC50value expresses the amount of extract required for the reduction of 50% of the superoxide radical22. The IC50value ofC. officinaliswas determined as 100 µg/mL (Sup. Fig.1). IC50and IC50× 2 values as 100 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL were used to determine the protective effect in the study. The dose of molybdenum used as toxic agent was chosen as 4000 mg/L, which was reported in the literature that the toxic effect was clearly observed19. The quantitative determination of phenolic compounds inC. officinaliswas conducted through LC-MS/MS analysis. For this purpose, approximately 1 g of driedC. officinalisflower parts were powdered and extracted with dichloromethane-methanol solvent (1:4) and analysed by LC-MS/MS (Thermo Scientific, ODS Hypersil 4.6 × 250 mm column). The analytical conditions, mobile phase and gradient profile are given in Sup.Mat. The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed at HUBTUAM (Hitit University)23,24.

Allium cepabulbs were purchased from Akdeniz Tarım (TR -55-K-009228) and used as a bioindicator in toxicity assays. Sodium Molybdate Dihydrate was obtained from Merck. Six groups were formed for molybdenum (Mo) andC. officinalisapplications. Group I: Distilled water (control); Group II: 100 µg/mLC. officinalisextract (Cos1), Group III: 200 µg/mLC. officinalisextract (Cos2). In Group II and Group III, only the extract was applied based on IC50values. The data from these two groups were used to assess whether the extract alone had any toxic effect. Group IV was treated with 4000 mg/L Sodium Molybdate Dihydrate (Mo). In this group only the level of abnormalities induced by Mo was determined. Group V and Group VI were treated with 4000 mg/L Sodium Molybdate Dihydrate + 100 µg/mLC. officinalisextract (MoCos1), Group VI: 4000 mg/L Sodium Molybdate Dihydrate + 200 µg/mLC. officinalisextract (MoCos2). The determination of the protective effect was calculated using the data of groups V and VI, based on the reductions in toxicity induced by molybdenum alone. Each bulb was germinated separately in glass beakers, Following a seven-day germination period at room temperature (20 °C) and 60% humidity, root tissues and leaves were collected for further analysis25,26.

Morpho-physiological parameters, especially those related to germination and growth, were used to determine morpho-phiological parameters. For germination percentage and weight gain, 10 bulbs were used in each group, and for determination of root length, 5 random roots were taken from each bulb, totaling 50 measurements for each group. Root length was determined by measuring the radicle length (cm) with the use of a caliper. Weight gain was calculated by weighing the bulbs at the commencement and conclusion of the germination period using a precision balance. Germination percentage was established by calculating the ratio of the number of germinated bulbs to the total number of bulbs27,28.

The impact of Mo andC. officinalisextract treatments on antioxidant-oxidant dynamics was assessed through the analysis of various parameters, malondialdehyde (MDA), chlorophyll a and b, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The activity of SOD was determined in accordance with the methodology proposed by Macar et al.29with the results expressed as U/mg. The activity of CAT was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm, and defined as OD240nmmin/g30. MDA levels were quantified in accordance with the methodology outlined by Demirtaş et al.31and expressed as µM/g. The extraction and measurement of chlorophyll were done using the protocol recommended by Kaydan et al.32. Analyses were performed in triplicate and the detailed analytical procedures for all parameters are provided in the supplementary material.

Cytogenetic effects of Mo andC. officinalisextract were determined by mitotic index (MI), micronucleus (MN), chromosomal abnormality (CAs) test33. Analyses were performed in triplicate and the detailed analytical procedures for all parameters are provided in the supplementary material.

Five root tips were randomly selected from each group and microscopic slides were prepared. Transverse sections of the roots were taken and stained with 5% methylene blue. A total of 100 images were obtained for each group by analysing 20 images from each sample. Anatomical damage was documented using a research microscope with a camera attachment34.

The results were statistically evaluated using the SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM SPSS, Türkiye) package program. The data were presented as mean ± SD (standard deviation) in the one-way ANOVA and Duncan tests. A p-value of less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.

The morpho-physiological alterations induced by Mo andC. officinalisinA. ceparoot meristem cells were analyzed using germination percentage, root length and weight gain (Table1). It was determined that the Cos1 and Cos2 groups treated with flower extract exhibited 100% germination, comparable to the control group. Additionally, the mean root length and weight gain of the Cos1 and Cos2 groups did not demonstrate statistical differences when compared with the control group (p> 0.05). Therefore, the selected extract doses did not function as a “growth suppressor” forA. cepa. In contrast, the Mo group demonstrated a decline in germination percentage to 73%, accompanied by a significant reduction in root length and weight gain values in comparison to the control values. The root length and weight gain in the Mo group were 39.47% and 56.32% lower than those observed in the control group, respectively. In accordance with the results obtained, Özkan et al.19also found that Mo caused growth inhibition inA. cepaand this effect was strengthened at higher doses of Mo. Yurdakul et al.35reported that elevated levels of Mo inTriticum aestivumresulted in spindly and unhealthy plant growth, as well as a decline in yield. Additionally, Gopal et al.36demonstrated that over-exposure to Mo reduced the total dry matter content ofVigna mungo. Furthermore, McGrath et al.37revealed that Mo induced retardation in shoot growth ofBrassica napusL.,Trifolium pretenseL.,Lolium perenneL., andSolanum esculentumplants. In another study, high dosage of Mo (1 mM) tested onPisum sativumL. plants decreased the growth of the shoot by 35% and the root by 50%38. In addition to its role as an essential component of nitrogenase and various other vital enzymes involved in redox reactions in plants, such as nitrate reductase, xanthine oxidase, sulfite oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase, Mo is also vital for the growth of the majority of other species. However, plants require extremely little levels of Mo and there is a thin line between toxicity and shortage37,39. Although it has been reported that the toxicity of Mo in plants can be understood by leaf pigmentation abnormality17the results of this study demonstrate that Mo in the root environment is also effective without being transported to the upper parts. Indeed, Xu et al.40reported that roots exhibited a greater accumulation of Mo than leaves in soybean seedlings. The underlying causes of Mo-induced growth retardation inA. cepamay be the result of either the restriction of water or macro- and microelement uptake necessary for growth, or the disruption of the anatomical structure of the root19. In addition, Macar et al.29reported that the toxicity of trace elements was responsible for the inhibition of cell division in the root tips of plants. Therefore, the decrease in mitotic activity in these regions may also be a contributing factor to Mo-induced delay of root formation inA. cepa. Mo is a heavy metal as well as a trace element. Another factor in the inhibition of growth may be oxidative stress, which develops due to heavy metal application and has the potential to damage cellular structures related to substance uptake and mitotic division33,41,42.

Protective role ofC. officinalisextract against molybdenum-induced physiological toxicity.

Means that are marked with different letters (a−d) in the same column are considered to be significant atp< 0.05.

In the MoCos1 and MoCos2 groups, whereC. officinalisextract was applied in mixture with Mo, germination percentages increased compared to the Mo group, and were determined as 79% and 86%, respectively (Table1). These groups also exhibited greater root length and weight increase values compared to the Mo-only treated group. Although the physiological parameter values in the MoCos1 and MoCos2 groups were unable to approach the levels of the control group,C. officinalisextract considerably reduced Mo-induced physiological deterioration when used in combination with Mo. This study provides the first evidence of the ameliorative effect ofC. officinalisextract against Mo-induced growth inhibition in plants. On the other hand, it has been reported that this extract accelerates cell division and wound healing in animals and humans43. Hormozi et al.44demonstrated thatC. officinalisextract increased the expression of growth factors and stimulated cell proliferation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.C. officinalisextract has also been documented to alleviate oxidative stress induced by deleterious agents such as aflatoxin and hydrogen peroxide, through its bioactive constituents and radical scavenging substances45. The findings of our study align with those of previous studies, which demonstrate that plant extracts with high antioxidant properties can mitigate heavy metal-induced growth retardation inA. cepa46–48.

The biochemical alterations resulting from the application of Mo,C. officinalisextract and Mo +C. officinalismixture inA. cepawere evaluated by measuring the levels of MDA and chlorophyll pigment, along with SOD and CAT enzyme activities (Table2). Statistically significant biochemical alterations were not identified in either the Cos1 or Cos2 groups treated withC. officinalisextract in comparison to the control group (p> 0.05). These results suggest that the selected doses ofC. officinalisdid not induce any biochemical toxicity inA. ceparoots. However, the Mo group exhibited an increase in MDA, SOD activity, and CAT activity, reaching 2.51, 1.68, and 2.64 times the levels observed in the control group, respectively. Conversely, Mo administration caused a remarkable decrease in chlorophyll levels in the fresh leaves ofA. cepa. The levels of chlorophyll a and b in the Mo group decreased by 62.25% and 63.04% respectively, compared to the levels in the control group. The present findings are in alignment with those of Özkan et al.19who demonstrated that Mo increased both MDA accumulation and SOD and CAT activities inA. ceparoot meristem cells. It has also been documented that the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD and CAT, was considerably elevated in soybean seedlings under extreme Mo stress compared to normal Mo conditions40. Furthermore, Boojar and Tavakkoli49revealed that the SOD, CAT, APX, and GR enzymes of plants grown in the Mo-contaminated zone in the mining region were higher than those grown in uncontaminated soil. Our results are also in agreement with the studies in the literature showing that Mo has an indisputable influence on chlorophyll levels of plants. Gupta et al.17reported that when Mo toxicity does occur, it is generally marked by chlorosis, yellowing, and other forms of leaf discoloration. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that elevated doses of Mo resulted in reduced levels of chlorophyll a and b inT. aestivum50. Nautiyal and Chatterjee51proposed that the chlorosis resulting from elevated levels of Mo inCicer arietinumcrops was attributable to the inhibition of iron translocation. Both low and high doses of Mo have also been shown to reduce iron uptake and accumulation in tomato plants52. This may finally limit the manufacture of chlorophyll by impeding the transformation of Mg-Proto-Me to protochlorophyll45. In addition to the decrease in chlorophyll biosynthesis, the destruction due to changes in membrane permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may also represent significant mechanisms underlying the observed reduction of chlorophyll pigment levels53.

As posited by Singh et al.54the toxicity that results from elevated trace element doses, such as Mo, can be attributed to a number of factors. These include a decline in chlorophyll levels, interference of antioxidant enzymes, impairment to nutrient transport and metabolic activities, and initiation of lipid peroxidation. ROS are continuously produced by plants during standard metabolic processes, particularly as byproducts of respiration, photosynthesis, and photorespiration. Nonetheless, when optimal conditions are disrupted, an uncontrolled increase in ROS production occurs in plants, leading to oxidative stress. Once cells undergo an oxidative burst, the structural integrity and function of critical cellular components such as membranes, proteins, enzymes, photosynthetic apparatus and DNA become jeopardized and are susceptible to damage. MDA accumulation and changes in the activities of SOD and CAT enzymes are among the biological markers of oxidative stress55–57. Thus, in our study,A. ceparoot tip cells exposed to Mo underwent oxidative stress. MDA is a metabolite that is formed as a consequence of the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids within cell membranes. Both ROS and the lipoxygenase enzyme have the capacity to initiate membrane peroxidation58. It can influence ion transitions across cell membranes and inhibits genes involved in plant defense against stressors by altering DNA structure33,34. In circumstances where plants are subjected to substantial levels of heavy metals, the antioxidant enzyme system assumes a pivotal function in mitigating oxidative damage. Superoxide radicals within cells are converted to hydrogen peroxide radicals by SOD enzyme, while CAT enzyme acts on hydrogen peroxide, facilitating its conversion to water and oxygen58,59. Even though enzymatic defense activities increased inA. ceparoot meristem cells exposed to Mo, the increase in MDA and the decrease in chlorophyll in this group indicated that oxidative stress was not suppressible in the Mo group.

The MoCos1 and MoCos2 groups, in whichC. officinalisextract was applied in mixture with Mo, exhibited a significant increase in chlorophyll pigment levels and a significant decrease in MDA levels and SOD and CAT activities, in comparison to the group treated with Mo alone (p< 0.05) (Table2). The severity of these alterations became more pronounced as the dose ofC. officinalisextract in the mixture increased. MDA level, SOD enzyme activity and CAT enzyme activity values in the MoCos2 group decreased by 37.76%, 23.12% and 46.97%, respectively, compared to the Mo group. On the other hand, the values of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in this group were 1.65 and 1.87 times those of the Mo group, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the mitigating effect ofC. officinalisagainst heavy metal stress in plants. However, it has been shown thatC. officinalisextract can partially suppress iron-induced oxidative stress in brain and liver homogenates of rats. In addition, there are many studies in the literature proving the protective potential of natural plant extracts against heavy metal-related stress in various organisms60–62. Preethi et al.9demonstrated thatC. officinalisextract has the capacity to scavenge superoxide radical as well as hydroxyl radical, which is produced from hydrogen peroxide radicals via Fenton reactions. Phenolic compounds in plants have the potential to show antioxidant effects by chelating metals thanks to their hydroxyl and carboxyl groups63,64.

The protective role ofC. officinalisextract against Mo-induced genotoxicity is given in Fig.1; Table3. Types of chromosomal abnormalities induced by Mo were given in Fig.2. The protective effects ofC. officinalisextract was determined by calculating the regression of chromosomal abnormalities induced by Mo. Very low and statistically insignificant abnormalities were detected in the control group, Cos1 and Cos2 groups (p> 0.05). The statistically insignificant difference between these groups indicates thatC. officinalisextract alone is not genotoxic. High levels of chromosomal abnormalities and micronucleus formation were detected in the Mo-only group. The highest chromosomal abnormality type in this group was fragment and a level of 24.8 ± 2.16 was detected in 1000 counted cells. Other chromosomal abnormalities induced by Mo were vagrant chromosome, sticky chromosome, multipolar anaphase, disorientation. Fragments that cannot be incorporated into the nucleus at the end of mitosis form small nucleus-like structures, micronuclei, by accumulation of nuclear envelope around them63,64. The high frequency of fragments and MNs in this study strengthens this claim. In total, 28.5 ± 2.23 micronuclei were detected in 1000 cells counted in Mo-treated root tips. MN is recognized as a biomarker of genotoxic stress and genetic instability. MN can originate not only from fragments but also from vagrant chromosomes and damage to the spindle structure. Therefore, multiple mechanisms through multiple pathways are involved in MN formation63,65.

Genotoxic effects observed in the cell also affect cell proliferation. In this study, it was determined that mitotic index decreased by 25.7% in the Mo-treated group compared to the control group. This decrease in cell proliferation may be associated with possible pauses in the cell cycle as a result of chromosomal abnormalities in the cell, spindle thread damage, oxidative stress or direct interactions of molybdenum with DNA19.C. officinalisextract co-administration resulted in a regression in genotoxic effects. The fragment with the highest chromosomal abnormality was reduced by 25.8% in the MoCos1 group and 45.2% in the MoCos2 group compared to the Mo-only group. Similar regressions were observed for all chromosomal abnormalities.C. officinalisextract treatment at two different doses together with Mo resulted in a 27.7% − 47% reduction in MN frequency. Along with these reductions, increases in cell proliferation were also detected. Mitotic index, which decreased with Mo application, increased with Mo +C. officinalisextract applications. MI increased by 6.7% in the MoCos1 group and by 12.2% in the MoCos2 group. This result indicates thatC. officinalisextract provides protection against Mo-induced genotoxic effects and the protection is closely related to the active ingredients in the extract, especially phenolic substances. Similarly, Leffa et al.66show thatCalendula officinalisextract repairs chemical-induced DNA damage, reduces the formation of micronuclei and contains protective substances that reduce damage to genetic material.

The roots are the primary route of entry for toxic substances that contaminate water or soil. As a result, any damage caused by heavy metals to a plant can be most easily and quickly recognized in the roots. The damage caused by Mo on root meristem, and the mitigative effect ofC. officinalisextract against these damages, are presented in Table4; Fig.3. As a result of the analyses, similar to the control group, no meristematic cell damage was determined in Cos1 and Cos2 groups in which 100 mg/L and 200 mg/LC. officinalisextract doses applied (Fig.3a,c,f,h). In accordance with the other findings of this investigation, these results show that the applied dosages ofC. officinalisdid not result in any toxicity inA. cepa. In contrast to the Cos1 and Cos2 groups, the Mo group treated with 4000 mg/L molybdenum showed major levels of epidermis cell damage (Fig.3b), cortex cell damage (Fig.3d), thickened cortex cell wall (Fig.3e), flattened cell nucleus (Fig.3g) and thickened conduction tissue (Fig.3i). Conversely, the severity of Mo-induced meristematic cell damage was reduced whenC. officinalisextract was applied in conjunction with Mo. The mitigating effect ofC. officinalisextract was found to be dose-dependent, being more pronounced in the MoCos 2 group. Although the deleterious effects of heavy metals on root meristem structure ofA. cepahave been reported previously67,68studies on Mo-induced damage to root meristem cells are extremely limited. In agreement with the results of the present study, Özkan et al.19reported that an excessive dose of Mo increased the incidence of epidermis cell damage, cortex cell wall thickening, cell cortex cell damage, nucleus flattening, and vascular tissue thickening inA. cepa. In the same study, it was proposed that Mo-induced damage may be caused by membrane degradation due to oxidative stress, increased intracellular pressure, and changes in DNA and nuclear proteins19. However, a counter-argument has been posited that the adaptation of plants to prevent hazardous substances from entering the conduction bundles, where they can travel to the upper parts of the plant, may lead to the formation of defense barriers such as thickened cortical cell walls and conduction tissue69. This is the first study to demonstrate the protective effect ofC. officinalisextract against the detrimental effects of Mo on the meristem ofA. ceparoot. However, it is documented that herbal extracts characterized by notable antioxidant and chelating capacity are able to effectively counteract the deleterious effects of heavy metal toxicity on root meristem tissue48,70. In cases of heavy metal-induced toxicity and poisoning, oxidative stress and the resulting genetic damage as well as metabolic disorders play an important role71. The abovementioned findings of the current study demonstrate thatC. officinalisextract exerts a substantial mitigating effect on the oxidative stress triggered by Mo. In conclusion, it can be suggested thatC. officinalisextract showed a protective effect against toxicity-induced damage in root meristem structure by reducing Mo-induced oxidative stress.

Mo caused toxicity in different parameters ofAllium ceparoot tip cells. A regression of these toxic effects was observed in the groups that were treated with both Mo andC. officinalisextract. The protective property was calculated based on the regression of abnormalities observed in the molybdenum-alone-treated group (Fig.4). The protection exhibited byC. officinalisextract increased in a dose-dependent manner, but this increase was not directly proportional. The decrease in root elongation, a critical parameter in physio-morphological development, was regressed as 6.75% in the MoCos1 group and 20.6% in the MoCos2 group. In the genotoxic parameters of fragment, bridge, and MN frequencies, 100 µg/mLC. officinalisextract application provided protection ranging from 25.8 to 34.9%, while 200 µg/mLC. officinalisextract showed protection ranging from 37.7 to 62.4%. Among all parameters, the highest protection was obtained against bridge. A decline in MDA levels, a hallmark of oxidative stress, was also observed, with enhancement ranging from 18.1 to 37.7% in theC. officinalisextract-treated groups.

The improvements observed in SOD and CAT levels as well as MDA levels indicate that the oxidative stress induced by Mo regressed. Antioxidant activity lies at the basis of the protective properties ofC. officinalisextract in all parameters. Phenolic compounds have an important role in the emergence of this activity. The protective role ofC. officinalisextract against the toxic effects induced by Mo is closely related to the active ingredients in its content, especially phenolic compounds with antioxidant role. To this end, the phenolic components ofC. officinaliswere subjected to an LC/MS-MS investigation, and the results are presented in Table5and chromatograms in Fig.5. Chlorogenic acid, which was detected at 645,937 µg/g, was determined as the major component and its percentage among all phenolics was calculated as 61.8%. This was followed by salicylic acid (99,724 µg/g), 4_OH benzoic acid (95,679 µg/g), caffeic acid (87,819 µg/g) and rutin (50,151 µg/g). Minor amounts of p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, protecateuic aldehyde, sesamol, vannilin and apigenin were detected. All these phenolic substances contribute to the biological activity ofC. officinalisextract. The major component chlorogenic acid provides protection by exhibiting antioxidant activity through many different mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms include direct scavenging of free radicals by polyhydroxyl groups in its structure, activation of antioxidant signaling pathway, up-regulation of related genes, and increasing endogenous antioxidant levels. Chlorogenic acid reduces free radicals by donating hydrogen atoms in its structure and thus prevents oxidation reactions72,73. Salicylic acid, the second major compound detected in the extract, has an important role in protection against toxicity. Salicylic acid has a strong antioxidant role and makes important contributions to the development of cell tolerance to oxidative stress. It also increases the production of antioxidant substances in cells74. Caffeic acid has an important role in the defense mechanism of plants against insects, fungi, bacteria, ultraviolet radiation and infections75,76. Rutin is a potent antioxidant and exhibits various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antiprotozoal properties77. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides, the most abundant of the flavonoid molecules, are widely available in plants and are excellent free radical scavenging antioxidants78,79. P-coumaric acid, which was detected in the LC-MS/MS analysis, is a strong antioxidant and exhibits scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Vanillin, exhibiting notable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, the antimutagenic potential of vanillin has been widely investigated in previous research22. As a result of a cumulative effect of all these phenolic substances,C. officinalisextract exhibited a dose-dependently increasing protection by reducing Mo toxicity.

The findings of this study highlight the protective potential ofCalendula officinalisflower extract against molybdenum-induced toxicity. Molybdenum exposure triggered a broad spectrum of toxic effects inAllium cepa, including physiological growth inhibition, genotoxic damage such as micronucleus formation, and chromosomal aberrations—largely attributed to oxidative stress. The elevation in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the activation of antioxidant enzymes serve as strong indicators of oxidative stress induced by molybdenum. Remarkably, treatment withC. officinalisextract mitigated these effects by reducing MDA levels and promoting cellular recovery, suggesting a significant role in counteracting oxidative damage. This protective effect is likely mediated by the high levels of phenolic compounds—particularly chlorogenic acid, rutin, and caffeic acid—identified through LC-MS/MS analysis, which are known for their potent antioxidant activities. Given the increasing environmental burden of heavy metal pollution and its detrimental impact on biological systems, identifying and characterizing plant-based extracts with antioxidant potential is of critical importance. These findings underscore the necessity for further research into natural compounds that can offer effective protection against metal-induced oxidative stress.
