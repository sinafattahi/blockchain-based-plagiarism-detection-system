Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a leading cause of secondary hypertension, but the lack of representative preclinical models hampers translational research and imaging evaluation. We aimed to establish a patient-derived organoids-based xenograft (PDOX) model of PA and to assess its imaging characteristics using [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT, with validation in clinical patients.

Adrenal tissues from patients with PA were used to generate adrenal organoids in vitro. After serial passaging, these organoids were implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice to establish PA PDOX models. The xenografted mice were subjected to [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT to evaluate tracer uptake and lesion detectability. In parallel, clinical PA patients underwent [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT to assess the imaging performance in a clinical setting.

The PDOX models successfully engrafted and proliferated in vivo, maintaining key pathological features of PA. [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT imaging in the PDOX models demonstrated high and specific tracer uptake in xenografted lesions, with strong concordance to histopathological findings. In clinical PA patients, [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT also showed excellent performance in localizing PA lesions and provided valuable diagnostic information.

We established a novel PDOX model of PA and demonstrated the effectiveness of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT in both preclinical and clinical applications. This approach provides a robust translational platform for mechanistic studies and for advancing precision imaging and therapy in PA.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for a significant proportion of cases with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1–3]. PA is the most common endocrine cause of hypertension, and compared with patients with essential hypertension, those with PA suffer more severe hypertensive target organ damage, such as to the heart and kidneys [4–7]. Therefore, early diagnosis, subtyping, and timely intervention for PA are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Despite advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis, the diagnosis and management of PA remain challenging due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation and the lack of robust, representative preclinical models. Current research efforts are hindered by the limited availability of reliable in vitro and in vivo systems that faithfully recapitulate the pathological and functional characteristics of PA, impeding the development of targeted therapies and novel diagnostic strategies [8–10].

Recent advances in organoid technology have enabled the generation of three-dimensional structures derived from patient tissues that closely mimic the architecture and function of native organs [11–13]. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as promising tools for modeling various diseases, including cancers and endocrine disorders, offering new opportunities for personalized medicine and translational research [14–16]. However, the application of PDOs in establishing xenograft models for PA and evaluating novel imaging tracers remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could provide a powerful platform for preclinical studies and facilitate the translation of innovative imaging agents into clinical practice.

The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is primarily localized on the cell membrane. Upon activation, it promotes cellular migration and activation, playing a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, including hematopoiesis, immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and cancer progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 is highly expressed on the cell membrane of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs), exhibiting a significant correlation with the expression levels of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). In contrast, its expression is markedly lower in non-functional adrenal adenomas. The CXCR4-specific ligand [68Ga]Pentixafor has been successfully applied in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging for the subtype classification of primary aldosteronism [17,18]. [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather demonstrates 1.4-fold higher affinity for CXCR4 compared to [68Ga]Pentixafor [19]. However, its application in the context of primary aldosteronism remains less explored. Preliminary evidence suggests that [¹⁸F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT shows a strong association with adrenal venous sampling (AVS) results, indicating its potential as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for APA identification in patients with PA [20]. In this study, we aimed to establish a patient-derived organoids-based xenograft (PDOX) model of PA and to assess the imaging performance of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT in both preclinical and clinical settings. By integrating PDOX models with advanced molecular imaging, we seek to provide a robust translational platform for mechanistic research and for advancing precision diagnosis and therapy in PA.

A total of 21 patients were recruited from Beijing Anzhen Hospital between June 2024 and December 2024, including 16 patients with PA and 5 patients with non-functional adenoma (NFA) as controls (Detailed clinical information is provided in Supplementary Table1). The diagnosis and subtyping of PA were performed according to established clinical guidelines, including biochemical screening, confirmatory testing, and adrenal venous sampling (AVS) where appropriate. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Anzhen Hospital (ID: 2025AZB5002 null). Adrenal tumor tissues or hyperplastic adrenal tissue samples were obtained during adrenalectomy and immediately processed for organoid culture.

Paraffin-embedded sections of patient adrenal tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against CYP11B2 (Cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 2; 1:500, Proteintech, Cat# 20968-1-AP) and CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor 4; 1:500, Abcam, Cat# ab124824). Two experienced pathologists independently assessed the staining results. For each specimen, five random fields were selected and evaluated using a standardized scoring method, which included both staining intensity (scored as 0: negative, 1: light yellow, 2: light brown, 3: dark brown) and the percentage of positive cells (scored as 0: 0%, 1: 1–25%, 2: 26–50%, 3: 51–75%, 4: 76–100%). The final score was calculated by multiplying the intensity and area scores. Based on previous literature and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to optimize discrimination between PA and NFA tissues, scores of 8 or higher were considered positive.

The human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI-H295R was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% ITS (Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium), LA (Linoleic Acid) 5.35ug/ml, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ incubator. Due to the lack of normal adrenal cell lines, we used patient-derived primary normal adrenal cells as controls.

Cells were suspended by Trypsin-EDTA solution and placed into an appropriate density and allowed to attach to (ex. 10,000 cells/chamber in 8-chamber slides). After 24 h of attachment, fixed the cells in 8-well chamber slide using tissue fixation reagent (PhenoVision Bio Co., Itd) for 2 h. After permeabilization reagent, the cells were washed with 1× in PBS and incubated with primary antibody CYP11B2 (1:100, Proteintech, Cat# 20968-1-AP), CXCR4 (1:200, Abcam, Cat# ab124824) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound primary antibodies were detected using PVB anti-Rb/Mm-HRP detection followed by PVB tyramide signal amplification fluorophore (PVB 480, PVB 690) for 10 min. The slides were counterstained with spectral 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (PhenoVision Bio Co., Itd) and cover-slipped. The slides were scanned using the PhenoImage HT system (Akoya Biosciences) at 400X magnification.

We used WB experiments to quantitatively analyze the differences in protein levels of CYP11B2 and CXCR4 between the NCI-H295R cell line and patient-derived normal adrenal primary cells. Protein levels in PA, non-functional adenoma (NFA) and normal adrenal (N) tissue samples were measured by WB. Total protein was extracted, quantified using a BCA kit (Solarbio), and denatured in loading buffer before separation on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred onto 0.22 μm PVDF membranes, which were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies against CYP11B2 (~ 48 kDa; 1:200, Proteintech, Cat# 20968-1-AP), CXCR4 (~ 45 kDa; 1:100, Abcam, Cat# ab124824), and GAPDH (~ 36 kDa; 1:5000, Proteintech, Cat# 10494-1-AP). After incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies, the protein bands were detected using the Odyssey infrared imaging system, and band intensities were quantified by densitometry.

The program can be referred to our previous research methodology [21]. Fresh adrenal tissue samples were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), minced into small fragments, and enzymatically digested using a collagenase-based protocol. The resulting cell suspension was filtered, centrifuged, and resuspended in a basement membrane matrix (Accuramatrix). For PDO culture, approximately 500 cell clusters were suspended in 25 µL of matrix gel and seeded as a droplet into the center of each well of a 24-well plate. Following polymerization of the gel at 37 °C for 15 min, each well was overlaid with 500–750 µL of complete PDO culture medium. The medium consisted of Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1× GlutaMAX, 1× HEPES, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 5.35 µg/mL Linoleic Acid, 1× B27 supplement, 1× N2 supplement, 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine, 10 mM Nicotinamide, 50 ng/mL EGF, 500 ng/mL R-spondin-1, 20 ng/mL FGF-10, 100 ng/mL Noggin, 500 nM A83-01, and 10 µM Y-27,632 dihydrochloride. Drops containing the cell-matrix mixture were plated in culture dishes and overlaid with organoid culture medium optimized for adrenal cells. PDOs were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO₂, with medium changes every 2–3 days. Organoid formation was monitored by light microscopy, and successful establishment was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CXCR4 and CYP11B2.

The concentration of aldosterone in adrenal organoid supernatant was determined using a commercial ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (NebuEasy ALD, Cat# NBE-236733). Briefly, culture supernatants were centrifuged to remove debris, aliquoted, and stored at − 20 °C. After thawing, samples and serially diluted standards were added to the ELISA plate, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated detection antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. After five washes, substrate solution was added and incubated in the dark for 15 min. The reaction was stopped, and absorbance was measured at 459 nm. Aldosterone concentrations were calculated using a standard curve. In the PDOX model, serum cortisol and aldosterone levels were measured in rats using the same methods.

For xenograft experiments, PDOs were harvested, mechanically dissociated, and resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of PBS and Accuramatrix. PDOs were transplanted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Experimental group:n= 6; Control group:n= 5) using three approaches: subcutaneous (n= 2), subhepatic (n= 2), and subrenal capsule (n= 2) implantation. Each injection requires approximately 1,000 PDOs or 1–3 × 10⁶ cells. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital and conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines.

The radiosynthesis of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather was carried out using a CFN-200 automated synthesizer (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Japan), following protocols from previous literature with minor adjustments [20]. In brief,18F-fluoride (16–37 GBq) was first trapped on a QMA cartridge (Waters, USA), then eluted into the reaction vessel with 0.6 mL saline and 0.5 mL acetonitrile. The mixture was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 9 min. Subsequently, 0.6 mL anhydrous acetonitrile was added, and the solution was heated at 95 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 min. After cooling to 40 °C, a precursor solution containing 200 µg NOTA-Pentixather, 400 µL acetonitrile, 10 µL AlCl3, and 325 µL sodium acetate buffer (pH 4) was introduced. The reaction proceeded at 105 °C for 12 min. The mixture was then cooled to 40 °C, diluted with 7 mL saline, and passed through a C18 cartridge (Waters, USA). After washing with 25 mL water, the product was eluted using 2 mL of 50% ethanol and further diluted with 10 mL saline before filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane.

The radiochemical purity (RCP) of the final [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather was assessed using HPLC (Zorbax SB-C18 column, 250 × 10 mm, 5 μm, Agilent, USA). The mobile phases were 0.1% triethylamine in water (A) and 0.1% triethylamine in acetonitrile (B), with a gradient of 75% A over 0–20 min and a 1 mL/min flow rate. Only batches with RCP above 95% were used for subsequent studies.

Mice (8 weeks after establishment of PDOX) were administered [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather (7.40–11.1 MBq in 0.1 mL) via tail vein injection. MicroPET/CT scans were performed at 1 and 2 h post-injection using an Inveon microPET/CT system (Siemens, Germany). During imaging, animals were anesthetized and placed prone for a 10-minute PET acquisition, followed by CT scanning (low magnification mode, 180 projections, 4 × 4 binning, 53.9 mm transaxial field of view, 134 mm axial length, 80 kV voltage, 500 µA current).

PET data were reconstructed using the OSEM3D/SP-MAP algorithm (OSEM3D: 2 iterations; MAP: 18 iterations; matrix size: 128 × 128; zoom: 1; target resolution: 1.5 mm). CT images were reconstructed with the Feldkamp algorithm (4 iterations). PET and CT images were co-registered automatically using software. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually delineated by blinded investigators based on CT anatomy, and mean standardized uptake values (SUVs) were automatically calculated for each ROI.

In the PDOX group, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) in the transplant area. In the control group, we defined ROIs of similar size in anatomically corresponding areas (i.e., the same location as the implant area in the model group). We then compared the mean standard uptake values (SUVs) between the two groups.

The PET/CT imaging study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Five PA patients confirmed by AVS were enrolled from our hospital (Detailed clinical information is provided in Supplementary Table2). All enrolled patients underwent [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT imaging according to the following protocols. All patients received an intravenous injection of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather at a dose of 3.7–5.2 MBq/kg via dorsal hand veins, followed by whole-body PET/CT imaging 50–60 min post-injection using a Biograph mCT scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Germany). Patients were positioned supine, and the imaging field extended from the skull base to the mid-thigh level. CT scanning was performed with parameters set at 120 kV tube voltage, 210 mAs effective tube current, and 5 mm slice thickness. PET acquisition covered 6–8 bed positions with a 2-minute acquisition time per bed position. The CT scan data were utilized for PET/CT image fusion and attenuation correction of the PET emission data. PET images were reconstructed using the TrueX + TOF (ultraHD-PET) algorithm with 2 iterations, 21 subsets, a 200 matrix, zoom factor of 1, and post-reconstruction Gaussian filtering (Full Width at Half Maximum = 2 mm).

PET/CT images were evaluated by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Adrenal nodule location was identified based on CT images. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of adrenal lesions was measured by delineating spherical regions of interest (ROIs) with a diameter of 1 cm. The lesion-to-liver ratio (LLR) on PET/CT was calculated by dividing the SUVmax of the lesion by the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of the normal liver parenchyma (spherical ROIs with a diameter of 2 cm).

Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed using [software, e.g., GraphPad Prism]. Differences between groups were assessed using Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 16 patients with biochemically and AVS-confirmed PA were recruited, along with 5 patients with non-functional adenoma (NFA) as controls. Adrenal tumor or hyperplastic tissue samples were successfully collected from all participants during adrenalectomy. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong CYP11B2 and CXCR4 expression in most PA specimens, with positive staining scores (≥ 8) observed in 14 out of 16 cases. In contrast, CYP11B2 and CXCR4 expression was negative in normal tissues (N) and NFA samples (Fig.1A). As a positive control, the NCI-H295R cell line was stained for the target proteins, showing strong positive expression for both CYP11B2 and CXCR4, which validates our antibody specificity and protocols (Fig.1B, C). WB quantitative analysis also confirmed the above results in the NCI-H295R cell line and normal adrenal cells (Supplementary Fig.1A). WB analysis further confirmed significantly higher protein levels of CYP11B2 and CXCR4 in PA tissues compared to adjacent normal adrenal tissue (N) and NFA (Fig.1D).

PDOs were successfully established from all 16 PA and 5 NFA tissue samples. The organoids exhibited typical glandular morphology and maintained stable growth in culture for at least 2–3 weeks (Fig.1E–H). After 14 days of culture, immunohistochemical staining of PDOs confirmed persistent CXCR4 (Fig.1I) and CYP11B2 (Fig.1J) expression, consistent with the primary tissues. ELISA analysis (Day 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16) demonstrated that PDOs secreted aldosterone into the culture supernatant at concentrations significantly above the detection threshold. While hormone secretion dynamics showed a peak around Day 7 in all organoid types, the aldosterone concentration secreted by PDOs derived from PA was significantly higher than that from normal adrenal tissue (N) and NFA-derived organoids (Fig.1K, Supplementary Fig.1B-E).

The construction process of the PDOX model is illustrated in Fig.2A. PDOs derived from PA patients with favorable growth and stable passage were selected for model establishment. PDOX models were generated in immunodeficient mice using three transplantation approaches: subcutaneous (n= 2), subhepatic (n= 2), and subrenal capsule (n= 2) implantation. All PDOX models were evaluated 8 weeks post-transplantation.

The structure of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather is shown in Fig.2B. [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather was synthesized with radiochemical purity consistently above 95%, as confirmed by HPLC analysis, and was stable for in vivo imaging (Fig.2C). MicroPET/CT imaging performed 8 weeks after transplantation demonstrated high [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather uptake in all PDOX models (Fig.2D-F). The SUV values for subrenal capsule group were the highest, at 2.2, 3.4 (1 h post-injection) and 1.6, 2.4 (2 h post-injection), respectively (Fig.2E). In contrast, the SUV values for subcutaneous group were 0.84, 0.56 (1 h post-injection) and 0.87, 0.38 (2 h post-injection), respectively (Fig.2F). The SUV values for subhepatic group were 0.88, 0.37 (1 h post-injection) and 0.40, 0.17 (2 h post-injection) (Fig.2D). The tracer specifically accumulated in xenografted tissues, with minimal background uptake in adjacent organs. Figure2G-I shows the PET/CT images of the blank control group. In the control group, we defined ROIs of similar size in anatomically corresponding areas (i.e., the same location as the implant area in the model group) (Supplementary Fig.1F-H). We then compared the mean SUVs between the two groups. Quantitative analysis revealed significantly higher SUVs in PDOX mice compared to controls (Supplementary Fig.1I,J).

After euthanasia, localized regions of PDO formation were observed at the transplantation sites (Fig.2J, K). Serum cortisol and aldosterone levels in the mice were measured using ELISA. Both cortisol and aldosterone levels were significantly elevated in PDOX mice (Experimental group) compared to controls (Control group) (p< 0.05), indicating functional hormone secretion by the xenografted organoids (Fig.2L, M).

Figure3A illustrates the workflow for patient enrollment and the [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT scanning protocol. All five AVS-confirmed PA patients underwent [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT scanning. The tracer demonstrated focal uptake in adrenal lesions corresponding to the surgically resected side in all cases, consistent with AVS and pathological findings. Representative images from two patients demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of this imaging modality. Figure3B displays the PET/CT scan of a 60-year-old male patient with PA and a one-year history of hypertension. The scan identified a distinct lesion in the right adrenal gland, prompting a right laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA). Subsequent histopathological analysis based on the histopathology of unilateral primary aldosteronism (the HISTALDO consensus), including HE (Fig.3C) and CYP11B2 (Fig.3D) staining, confirmed the pathological subtype as an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), which was highly concordant with the PET/CT findings. Similarly, Fig.3E presents the PET/CT images of a 55-year-old female PA patient who underwent a left LA. Her pathological diagnosis was also confirmed as APA, showing excellent agreement with the preoperative imaging results (Fig.3F, G). Follow-up of postoperative outcomes according to the Primary Aldosteronism Surgical Outcome (PASO) consensus is ongoing to evaluate the diagnostic performance of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for up to 65.6% of cases [22]. PA is characterized by autonomous aldosterone overproduction from the adrenal zona glomerulosa, leading to suppressed renin-angiotensin system activity [23,24]. Compared with patients with essential hypertension, those with PA have a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure [25–28]. Moreover, complications tend to occur at a younger age in PA, significantly impairing patient prognosis and quality of life [29]. Thus, early and accurate diagnosis of PA and the determination of the dominant side of aldosterone secretion are of critical clinical importance.

Currently, adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is considered the gold standard for lateralization of aldosterone hypersecretion [30,31]. Although AVS offers high sensitivity and specificity, its invasive nature, high cost, technical complexity, and dependence on operator expertise limit its widespread application [32–34]. As a result, many PA patients are unable to receive optimal surgical intervention, highlighting the urgent need for non-invasive, accurate, and accessible diagnostic alternatives.

CYP11B2 is the definitive enzyme for aldosterone synthesis, making it the functional marker for PA lesions. Indeed, its pivotal role is formally recognized in the recent international consensus on the histopathology of unilateral primary aldosteronism (the HISTALDO consensus), which establishes CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry as the essential method for the pathological classification of PA subtypes [35]. C-X-C Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) has emerged as a promising molecular target in PA. Previous studies have demonstrated high CXCR4 expression on the membrane of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) cells, in close correlation with CYP11B2, the key enzyme for aldosterone synthesis, while expression is low in normal adrenal tissue and non-functional adenomas [36,37]. The significance of CXCR4 as a target is further contextualized by recent multi-omics studies which have explored the complex molecular landscape of PA, reinforcing the rationale for developing targeted diagnostic tools [38,39]. These findings provide a rationale for CXCR4-targeted functional imaging to localize autonomous aldosterone-producing lesions. Indeed, [68Ga]-Pentixafor, a CXCR4-specific PET tracer, has shown high sensitivity for APA detection, with diagnostic concordance rates with AVS up to 90% in large cohorts [40]. Furthermore, higher uptake values on [68Ga]-Pentixafor PET/CT have been associated with better surgical outcomes and stronger CXCR4/CYP11B2 expression in resected tissue [41].

However, compared to ⁶⁸Ga (mean positron energy: 1.9 MeV; maximum positron range in tissue: about 8.1 mm), the radionuclide ¹⁸F exhibits a lower positron energy (mean: 0.64 MeV) and a shorter positron range in vivo (maximum: about 2.3 mm). Consequently, ¹⁸F provides PET images with superior spatial resolution. Furthermore, ¹⁸F possesses a longer physical half-life (109.8 min vs. 67.7 min), enabling centralized production and long-distance distribution from radiopharmacies. This logistical advantage significantly broadens its applicability. Therefore, CXCR-targeted probes labeled with ¹⁸F demonstrate considerable promise for clinical translation [19]. While preclinical studies have shown that [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather possesses comparable or even superior CXCR4 affinity to [68Ga]Pentixafor, clinical data in PA have been lacking.

Our study is the first to systematically evaluate [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT in the context of PA, using a translational approach that integrates patient-derived organoids (PDOs), PDO xenograft (PDOX) models, and clinical imaging. We demonstrated that PA-derived PDOs and PDOX models faithfully recapitulate the molecular and functional characteristics of primary tumors, including high CXCR4 and CYP11B2 expression, as well as autonomous aldosterone secretion. The successful establishment of PDOX models enabled in vivo assessment of tracer uptake and hormone secretion, providing a robust preclinical platform for mechanistic studies and imaging validation.

Our results showed that [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT achieved high radiochemical purity and stability, and specifically accumulated in PDOX-derived PA lesions with high target-to-background ratios. Quantitative SUV analysis confirmed significantly greater tracer uptake in PDOX mice compared to controls, consistent with the CXCR4 expression profile. Importantly, in our clinical cohort, [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT accurately identified the dominant adrenal lesion in all AVS-confirmed PA patients, with imaging findings concordant with surgical and pathological results. No significant uptake was observed in the contralateral gland or extra-adrenal tissues, supporting the specificity of this imaging modality.

Compared to previous studies [17,19,37] using [68Ga]-Pentixafor, our findings suggest that [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT offers similar diagnostic performance while overcoming logistical barriers, thus holding great promise for broader clinical implementation. The use of PDO and PDOX models further strengthens the translational relevance of our work, as these models enable individualized investigation of molecular markers, drug response, and imaging characteristics, paving the way for personalized management of PA.

Nevertheless, several limitations should be acknowledged. The sample size of both the preclinical and clinical arms was relatively small, and larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate our findings and assess diagnostic accuracy across diverse PA subtypes. The follow-up period was limited, and long-term outcomes, particularly in relation to surgical prognosis and recurrence, require further investigation. Additionally, our study did not formally assess the toxicology of the tracer, although it is based on a precursor with a known safety profile in other applications. Further limitations are inherent to the PDOX model itself, such as the absence of a native immune microenvironment and vasculature, and the potential for clonal selection or drift during in vitro culture, which may not fully recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. while CXCR4 expression was robust in our cohort, its heterogeneity and the potential for false positives in other adrenal pathologies warrant further study.

A critical future direction stemming from this work is the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse phenotypes of primary aldosteronism. The patient-derived tissues and the corresponding PDOX models we have successfully established represent an invaluable resource for this purpose. Therefore, our subsequent studies will focus on comprehensive multiomics analyses, including RNA-sequencing, to uncover the key molecular drivers of aldosterone hypersecretion and disease heterogeneity. This approach promises to provide a deeper mechanistic understanding and may reveal novel therapeutic targets.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the feasibility and translational value of [18F]AlF-NOTA-pentixather PET/CT for non-invasive, functional imaging of PA, supported by robust preclinical organoid-based models. This approach may serve as a practical and effective alternative to AVS for lateralization and management of PA, with the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, guide therapy, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.
