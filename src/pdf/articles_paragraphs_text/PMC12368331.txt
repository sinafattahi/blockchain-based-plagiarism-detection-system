Periodontitis and viral liver infections, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are chronic inflammatory conditions with a high prevalence worldwide. Recent evidence establishes a possible bidirectional relationship between the two, based on shared immunological, microbial, and inflammatory mechanisms. The objective of this study was to analyze and synthesize the scientific literature on the interactions between viral hepatitis and periodontal health. Through a structured search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, studies published in the last 20 years that explored the link between viral hepatitis and periodontitis were integrated. The findings from the reviewed studies show consistent, positive associations between HBV and HCV viruses and a higher prevalence and severity of periodontitis. Some studies show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and TNF-α) and immune dysfunction in participants with both diseases. Additionally, viral markers (such as HBsAg and HCV RNA) have been identified in gingival crevicular fluid, suggesting the presence of oral viral reservoirs. Ultimately, scientific evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between viral hepatitis and periodontitis, influenced by systemic inflammation, immunological alterations, and microbial dysbiosis. The collected data support the relevance of interdisciplinary management between medical and dental professionals in patients with viral liver conditions.

The association between periodontitis and systemic conditions has received increasing scientific attention in recent years. A recent bibliometric analysis highlights how studies have focused particularly on the shared immunoinflammatory mechanisms between periodontitis, peri-implant diseases, and systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease.4The results support the priority of addressing periodontal health not only in isolation, but as an integral component in understanding and managing chronic systemic conditions, including viral hepatitis.

Traditionally, both conditions have been addressed in isolation from clinical medicine and dentistry. However, recent research has begun to highlight a significant link between chronic viral liver infections and periodontal health problems. These associations have generated a new emerging concept: the oral-liver axis, emphasizing bidirectional communication between the liver and the oral cavity, mediated by systemic immunoinflammatory mechanisms, microbiota changes, and microbial translocation pathways, with clinical consequences that transcend both spheres.5,6Certain epidemiological and clinical studies have found a higher prevalence of periodontitis in participants infected with HBV or HCV, particularly in those with advanced liver disease. This link may be influenced by systemic immunosuppression induced by viral infection, a chronic proinflammatory state, and dysbiosis in the oral cavity, which contributes to a more vulnerable environment for the development of periodontal pathogens.5,6In this same context, periodontitis can serve as a focal point of chronic systemic inflammation and contribute to liver damage, particularly through the translocation of bacteria and microbial products into the portal bloodstream. Despite growing evidence, gaps in knowledge remain that require more robust clinical and experimental research to address. From this perspective, understanding the interrelationship between periodontal health and liver dysfunction will help clarify the underlying mechanisms and open new therapeutic perspectives based on the prevention and comprehensive treatment of both pathologies.

Both viral hepatitis and periodontitis are conditions that share standard pathophysiological mechanisms, including chronic inflammation, immunomodulation, and microbial dysbiosis. In this context, it is essential to understand the potential interactions between the two diseases. This review aims to analyze and describe the available scientific evidence on the bidirectional association between HBV and HCV infections and periodontal health, identify the shared pathophysiological mechanisms that facilitate understanding of this interrelationship, and highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis, therapeutic management, and follow-up of these patients.

Initially, the relationship between chronic hepatitis and periodontitis was debated because viruses such as HCV and HBV can be found in saliva. Oral fluids are efficiently used for mass screening for HBV and are recognized transmission routes for this virus.19Furthermore, the dysbiosis caused by periodontitis can impact the rest of the digestive system and, consequently, the liver. It is crucial to note that the microbiota includes bacteria, yeasts, and viruses, albeit to a lesser extent. In this context, if HCV and HBV can spread through saliva and reach the liver, there is a possibility that some bacteria causing periodontitis may also utilize this route.20It is essential to consider that the liver is one of the organs most impacted by these biological networks and pathogenic changes, as it maintains anatomical proximity and strong physiological interdependence with the intestine through metabolic exchange and the translocation of bacteria.21Another possible mechanism is systemic inflammation, which can trigger the release of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α by oral bacteria.

Additionally, intestinal dysbiosis is characterized by an increase in the intestinal lumen of ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde.22These mediators can weaken the gut’s tight connections, leading to an increased translocation of molecular patterns associated with microorganisms and gut metabolites, such as trimethylamine. These metabolites trigger inflammatory reactions in the gut and liver, resulting in progressive liver damage.

On the other hand,StreptococcusandVeillonella, bacteria characteristic of the oral cavity, have been observed in the feces of patients with liver cirrhosis compared to healthy individuals.20,23Fusobacterium necrophorumandPrevotella specieshave also been reported in liver abscesses.24–26Anti-HCV antibodies and viral RNA have been identified in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples obtained from patients with HCV infection.27Viral molecules can infiltrate saliva, transforming the GCF into a source of contamination in the saliva of infected HCV patients. Inflammation in the oral cavity, liver, and intestine can lead to systemic inflammation, which in turn can result in endotoxemia. This is due to an increase in the relative abundance of potentially harmful microorganisms in the intestine and oral cavity, a deficient mucosal and systemic immune response, and a reduction in the liver’s ability to manage these insults. Changes in bile acid composition, reduced stomach acidity, and potential neurohormonal modifications characteristic of cirrhosis also create this systemic pro-inflammatory environment23(Figure 1).

Oro-intestine-liver axis. People with periodontitis present microbial dysbiosis in different compartments of the oral cavity, especially in the periodontal pockets. This dysbiosis is also accompanied by dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota. This intestinal dysbiosis can generate mucosal permeability, allowing microbiota to travel from the intestine to the liver. Similarly, this microbiota transport may travel from the small intestine to the gallbladder and liver.

In addition to these mechanisms, it has been shown that periodontitis can promote a state of systemic oxidative stress, even in the absence of preexisting chronic conditions. Some studies have documented that patients with periodontitis exhibit increased levels of reactive oxygen species and decreased antioxidant activity, which contributes to local tissue destruction and a generalized inflammatory environment.28–30This redox alteration could amplify hepatocellular damage and positively impact the progression of liver disease.30Consequently, this mechanism represents a point of convergence linking both pathologies.

Certain studies have suggested that periodontitis, even in people without diagnosed systemic conditions, can induce a state of chronic inflammation, promoting immune dysfunction and increasing the predisposition to infections such as viral hepatitis. In this context, Matsuda et al. showed that patients without comorbidities diagnosed with periodontitis have elevated concentrations of systemic inflammatory markers, supporting the hypothesis that oral disease can have an effect beyond the local environment.31Additionally, periodontal management has been shown to not only improve oral health but also significantly reduce systemic inflammation, potentially impacting both the prevention and progression of infectious conditions such as hepatitis. These results underscore the need to consider periodontitis as a modifiable risk factor in comprehensive preventive strategies.

Regarding the cytokines detected in periodontitis, it is essential to note that they have also been observed in patients with hepatitis. IL-1α and IL-1β levels in GCF were higher in periodontitis cases of chronic HCV compared to those in healthy patients.36Similarly, an increase in C-reactive protein and pentraxins has been observed in patients with periodontitis and chronic hepatitis caused by the HCV.37The HBV has been detected in salivary samples of patients with HBV, in addition to finding blood traces in salivary samples linked to periodontal pathology.38Increases in IL-2, IL-10, and IFN-γ were observed in the saliva of patients with HBV and HCV, with higher levels noted in those with HBV.39Likewise, chronic HBV has been reported to be positively associated with more severe periodontitis. These results suggest that people with HBV infection should adopt appropriate periodontal care measures to prevent the onset and development of periodontitis. This study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009–2014).40Despite the immunoinflammatory processes associated with both pathologies, patients with periodontitis and HCV have been reported to exhibit a more deteriorated periodontal status and higher levels of NLRP3, caspase 1 (CASP-1), and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Periodontitis and chronic HCV could significantly influence the hyperexpression of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its components, potentially leading to an increase in the local inflammatory reaction and clinical repercussions for periodontal health.41The inflammasome is a multi-protein oligomeric complex.

Recently, the association between periodontitis and viral hepatitis has been supported by several epidemiological and clinical studies. However, the diversity of patient subgroups allows for a more nuanced view of the interaction between these conditions. Differences in liver disease stages, periodontitis severity, the presence of co-infections, and various sociodemographic factors provide opportunities to establish precise patterns of prevalence and correlation. Accordingly, an analysis of the most notable studies is presented, highlighting the importance of subgroup characteristics in the link between periodontal health and liver function (Table 1).

Additionally, a possible link has been proposed between chronic viral infections such as HCV, periodontitis, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. This association could be regulated by common mechanisms such as chronic systemic inflammation, oral dysbiosis, and the dissemination of periodontal microorganisms to other organs, including the central nervous system.49,50These results support the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that considers not only liver and oral health but also the monitoring of potential neurological disorders in this patient group.

In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that non-surgical periodontal management can have a broader impact beyond the oral environment. Isola et al. showed that subgingival mechanical decontamination in patients with periodontitis, with or without the addition of chlorhexidine, significantly reduces systemic levels of inflammatory markers, positively contributing to the control of systemic conditions54and strengthening the hypothesis that periodontal treatment modulates the immunoinflammatory response and could improve the clinical picture in patients with viral liver conditions.

Treatment with antivirals, such as interferon and ribavirin, can trigger side effects in the oral cavity.51Therefore, ongoing monitoring for potential complications such as xerostomia, ulcerations, lichenoid lesions, and decreased healing capacity in gingival tissue is suggested, which consequently compromises the response to periodontal treatments.51,52Dentists should be alert to these adverse effects and adjust therapeutic strategies according to patient tolerance; in some cases, it may be necessary to consult a hepatologist to consider adjustments to medication.53,55Ongoing coordination between hepatologists and dentists is essential to optimize the quality of life for patients with liver conditions. Due to the bidirectional link between periodontal health and liver dysfunction, comprehensive care management should include both monitoring of the systemic condition and the prevention and treatment of periodontal complications.

A growing recognition of the bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and viral hepatitis, especially HBV and HCV, raises the need for more in-depth and detailed research to clarify the underlying mechanisms and their clinical impact. Therefore, several lines of research are suggested that could be addressed in the years to come. The link between periodontitis and hepatitis remains unclear, likely due to shared immunological and microbiological factors. The chronic inflammatory process characterized by periodontitis may contribute to and favor the progression of liver damage; on the other hand, the immune modifications generated by hepatitis suggest a predisposition to a more severe periodontal condition. Some studies have shown that patients with HCV infection present more severe periodontitis compared to uninfected individuals. However, it is necessary to determine whether this association is causal or attributed to confounding factors, such as associated comorbidities or lifestyle; therefore, future longitudinal studies and/or clinical trials will provide more conclusive findings. Exploring the development of specific biomarkers will enable the optimal characterization of patients with both conditions, allowing for personalized prevention and treatment management. Some studies have demonstrated increased levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-18 and caspase-1) in patients with chronic hepatitis and periodontitis, suggesting their potential use as biomarkers of disease progression. Likewise, the presence of HCV viral RNA in the saliva and GCF of patients with hepatitis has been analyzed, supporting the need to determine its role in periodontal pathogenesis and its potential use in early diagnosis.

Future therapeutic strategies should consider analyzing the impact of periodontal management on the development and progression of liver disease. Certain studies propose periodontal therapy to modify the composition of the intestinal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis, which would have significant therapeutic implications. Likewise, given the availability of direct-acting antivirals for HCV and the progress in therapeutic regimens for HBV, it would be interesting to evaluate whether the resolution of liver infection improves periodontal health in patients. Consideration should be given to exploring combined interventions that integrate gut–liver axis modulation through probiotics or specific anti-inflammatory agents. Recent studies suggest an interrelationship between periodontitis and hepatitis; however, there are still gaps in the scientific evidence. Longitudinal research analyzing the bidirectional relationship, the impact of chronic inflammation, the role played by the oral microbiota and its translocation to the hepatic system, and studies on the effectiveness of new therapeutic strategies applied in the prevention and management of both conditions are essential.

The scientific evidence analyzed in this review supports a bidirectional association between viral hepatitis, particularly HBV and HCV, and periodontitis. This link is based on shared pathophysiological mechanisms, including chronic systemic inflammation, microbial dysbiosis, and immunological changes. Furthermore, the participation of viral markers in the oral ecosystem has been identified, supporting the possibility that the oral cavity functions as a viral reservoir and modulates the progression or transmission of the infection.

In light of this perspective, it is necessary to promote an interdisciplinary approach between dentistry and hepatology, emphasizing prevention, early diagnosis, and comprehensive management. Furthermore, future research should further elucidate the shared molecular mechanisms, identify diagnostic biomarkers, and analyze the impact of periodontal treatments on the progression of liver conditions. Understanding and managing the oral-hepatic axis presents a strategic opportunity to improve the quality of life for patients affected by these conditions and promote control of two of the world’s leading chronic diseases.
