Academic referrals represent a significant challenge in nursing and midwifery education as they indicate student performance and retention weaknesses. However, the factors contributing to academic referrals have been underexplored, hampering efforts to develop effective interventions to support at-risk students.

The study examined the demographic, academic, and institutional factors associated with academic referrals among nursing and midwifery students.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 402 nursing and midwifery students. The data were collected for demographic characteristics, academic level, marital status, age, institutional support, language barrier and assessment difficulties. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regression analyses were utilised to identify predictors of academic referrals.

Academic level and age were the significant predictors of referrals, with third-year students being 3.38 times more likely to be referred than second-year students (OR = 3.377,p< .001) and referred students were 0.6 years older than non-referred students (t = -2.157,p= .032). Females (60.6%) and married students (87.5%) recorded higher referral rates descriptively, though insignificant. Referred students reported greater language barriers (mean = 3.00 vs. mean = 2.69,p= .002), perceived the language used in exams as less clear (mean = 3.54 vs. mean = 3.79,p= .003), and reported lower institutional support (p= .040 and less helpful feedback (χ² = 11.097,p= .025). Referred students perceived written theory exams (30.6% vs. 18.7%) and multiple-choice assessments (6.8% vs. 6.0%) as more challenging than non-referred students (χ² = 15.130,p= .010).

The findings emphasise the need for targeted interventions to support at-risk students, particularly those in advanced academic levels and older age groups. Strengthening institutional support, addressing language barriers, and improving assessment practices are important to reducing referrals and enhancing student success.

Nursing and midwifery education is pivotal in building the competent and skilled healthcare workforce required to meet the demands of a growing population [1,2]. Globally, nursing and midwifery programmes require students to be competent in both academic and clinical competence to excel across theoretical knowledge and practical abilities [3–6]. However, mastering these two competencies is often difficult and results in academic referrals where students are referred for failing to achieve minimum standards in certain courses or designated assessments. In this study, academic referral is defined to include a formal recommendation for additional academic support initiated when a student fails to meet minimum performance thresholds, including coursework, examinations, and/or other programme-reuired assessments. Such referrals hinder academic progress, prolong study duration, and place financial and emotional strains on students and their families [4,5]. The consequences of academic referrals include delayed graduation, increased financial burden, and psychological stress that would further affect students’ academic performance. Academic referrals in nursing and midwifery programmes are offshoots of student-specific problems and have demographic, socioeconomic, personal, and institutional antecedents.

Socioeconomic and demographic factors have a significant impact on academic outcomes. Studies highlight gender disparities in test anxiety [7], educational success [8,9], and academic self-concepts [10,11]. Also, mature students often find it difficult to juggle their academic responsibilities with household and family responsibilities and hence have increased chances of referrals [12,13]. Financial instability may also be challenging for students from low-income families who have limited access to essential learning resources, which could exacerbate academic difficulties.

Personal attributes are pivotal in academic success or failure. While higher coherence levels enable students to manage challenges and effectively engage [14], self-efficacy – students’ belief in their ability to succeed [15], and teacher self-efficacy [16] are pivotal in determining student outcomes. Family circumstances such as the parents’ jobs, educational background, and domestic environment influence students’ academic performance [17]. Gregg-Jolly et al. [18] similarly highlight that social support from family, peers, and social networks is critical in mitigating the pressures students face in their educational journey.

Institutional factors including the calibre, attitude, and efficiency of instructors, determine student outcomes by impacting the quality of instructions, feedback, and total learning experiences [16,19,20]. Other institutional factors include a supportive classroom environment, active learning environments, and effective feedback that enhances engagement, motivation, and cognitive development [21–23]. Academic challenges including discrepancies between instructional methods and students’ learning styles result in decreased motivation and academic performance [24–26]. Also, language barriers significantly influence students’ academic outcomes. The medium of instruction influences comprehension and learning when students have difficulties understanding and using academic English [27,28]. This difficulty is pronounced when English is a second language as students usually think and process material in their native languages and mentally translate and correlate each word (Greenword, 2013). Deng et al. (2022) [29] found that academic and family stress causes depression which negatively affects their academic performance and learning outcomes.

Even though extant literature highlights various determinants of academic performance [30–33], limited research focuses on the predictors of academic referrals in nursing education, particularly within the Ghanaian context. Addressing this gap and developing targeted strategies aimed at addressing the unique challenge nursing and midwifery students face in resource-limited settings is crucial. The present study examined the demographic, academic, and institutional factors that predict referrals within health training institutions.

The study adopted a cross-sectional quantitative design to explore the predictors of academic referral among nursing and midwifery students during the 2024 academic year. This design has the strength of enabling the identification of associations between variables (demographic, academic, and institutional) at a single point in time and hence is suitable for understanding the relationships [34,35].

Study setting and participantsy setting and participantsThe study was conducted at the Nursing and Midwifery Training College, Tepa-Ashanti, Ghana. Second and third-year diploma (3-year programme) and second-year certificate (2-year programme) students comprised the study population. The criteria for selecting these cohorts involved: (1) having completed at least two semesters of academic assessments where referrals are consequential, and (2) being representative of the transition to advanced training phases in Ghana’s nursing and midwifery education system [36]. The eligibility involved all enrolled students in the target years. No exclusion criteria were applied.

The outcome variable entailed academic referral status (measured as binary: referred = 1, not referred = 0). Non-referred students were included to ensure comparative analysis and provide a baseline for identifying predictive factors. The following formed the predictor variables for academic referral: demographic data, prior preparation, confidence levels, attendance at preparatory courses, and institutional data.

A structured questionnaire administered online was used for data collection. The demographic profile section of the questionnaire consisted of age, gender, marital status, and parental educational and occupational background. The academic preparedness section involved questions assessing prior academic preparation, perceived levels of confidence, and attendance of preparatory courses. The section on institutional support included items measuring the frequency of seeking academic counselling, satisfaction with learning resources, and the quality of academic support services. The final section on academic challenges entailed questions on referral history, reasons for referrals, and stress levels related to academic workload. The questionnaire was developed for this and provided as a supplementary file (Predictors of Academic Referrals_Supplementary File1).

The convenience sampling approach may limit the generalizability of findings. This was mitigated by a 20% oversampling (n= 461) to capture diverse experiences. Also, single-item measures for some constructs such as confidence was admitted as a limitation.

The convenience sampling technique was employed to ensure the inclusion of students with different academic experiences and to allow comparisons. The sample size was estimated using the Cochran [37] formula for estimating proportions, yielding 384 respondents. To account for non-response, the sample was adjusted by 20%, resulting in a total of 461. After data collection and cleaning, 402 responses were deemed usable for the study.

To ensure psychometric robustness, the instrument was validated. Content validity was ensured using expert review by two health tutors and retained a content validity index (CVI) > 0.78. Also, pilot testing involving 20 students showed excellent intrnal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.81–0.85). These metrics satisfied standard psychometric thresholds [38–40].

The age of the participant was recorded first as a continuous variable (in whole years) and later separated into clinically meaningful ranges (18–20, 21–23, 24+) to examine how age trends varied in relation to referral patterns. All Likert-scale items (e.g., ratings of assessment alignment from 1 [Very Poorly] to 5 [Very Well], feedback quality scores) were analysed as ordinal variables. Continuous variables were subjected to tests for normality by using Shapiro-Wilk tests (all p values > 0.05); normally distributed variables are presented by means of ± standard deviation, whereas non-normal by median and interquartile range. In terms of categorical variables, referral status (dichotomous: 0 = no referral, 1 = ≥ 1 referral), academic level (second year versus third year), and program type (certificate versus diploma) were dummy-coded in regression analyses. Range and consistency checks were carried out for all quantitative variables during data cleaning, with the aim of flagging any implausible values or outliers.

Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means ± standard deviations) characterised demographic, academic, and institutional variables. Bivariate analyses employed Pearson’s chi-square tests (with continuity correction or Fisher’s exact test where appropriate) to examine associations between categorical predictors (e.g., gender, academic level) and referral status (dichotomized as referred/not referred), reporting effect sizes via phi (φ) or Cramer’s V. Continuous variables (e.g., age) were recoded into clinically meaningful ranges (18–20, 21–23, 24+) using SPSS recoding syntax. The multivariate logistic regressions identified significant predictors of referrals, entering all variables withp< .20 in bivariate analyses, adjusting for program type (certificate/diploma). Model fit was tested with Hosmer-Lemeshow, and multicollinearity was assessed using VIFs (all < 5). Assumptions for all tests were followed (e.g., expected cell frequencies greater than 5 for χ²; normality tested by Shapiro-Wilk for continuous variables). Statistical significance was based onp< .05 for two-tailed tests.

Ethical approval was sought from the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Humans of Tepa Nursing and Midwifery Training College (Ref: ECRIH/AP/008/24). All participants gave informed consent and were guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. Hence, no identifiers were collected from participants. Participation was voluntary, and respondents were allowed to withdraw at any point without any repercussions. To reiterate voluntary participation, external research assistants (who were not instructors) were engaged to facilitate data collection. Participants were explicitly given the option to withdraw from participation in the study without penalty.

The demographic characteristics of the 402 respondents are presented in Table1. As shown in Table1, a significant majority (257 representing 63.9%) of respondents were within the 21–23 year bracket, followed by the 24 years and above age category (98 representing 24.4) and the 18–20 years age group (47 representing 11.7%).

The majority of the nursing and midwifery students in the sample, were women (n= 340, 84.8%) and single (n= 377, 94.0%). Most students were in the second year of study (67.7%) and resided on campus (90.5%). The main supportive source was family support (93.0%), followed by personal savings (5.7%), scholarships (1.0%), and student loans (0.2%). A small percentage of students reported having a part-time job (11.9%).

A chi-square test of independence was conducted to examine the relationship between gender and academic referral status among nursing and midwifery students. The results shown in Table2show that 32 male students (52.5%) and 134 female students (39.4%) had not received an academic referral, while 29 male students (47.5%) and 206 female students (60.6%) had received at least one academic referral. The Pearson chi-square test shown in Table2indicates a non-significant association between gender and academic referral status (χ² = 3.629,p= .057). However, the effect size and direction suggest that female students were slightly more likely to be referred than male students. The continuity correction (χ² = 3.111,p= .078) and likelihood ratio (χ² = 3.579,p= .059) yielded similar results, further supporting the absence of a statistically significant association. Fisher’s exact test also showed a non-significant result (p= .067, two-sided).

A chi-square test of independence was conducted to examine the relationship between academic level (second year vs. third year) and academic referral status among nursing and midwifery students (see Table2). The results revealed that 137 s-year students (50.6%) and 29 third-year students (22.3%) had not received an academic referral, while 134 s-year students (49.4%) and 101 third-year students (77.7%) had received at least one academic referral. The Pearson chi-square test (see Table2) indicated a significant association between academic level and academic referral status (χ² = 28.893,p< .001). This suggests that third-year students were significantly more likely to be referred than second-year students. The continuity correction (χ² = 27.740,p< .001) and likelihood ratio (χ² = 30.318,p< .001) yielded similar results, further supporting the significant association. Fisher’s exact test also confirmed the significant result (p< .001, two-sided). These findings highlight the importance of academic level as a predictor of academic referrals, with third-year students being at a higher risk of referral compared to their second-year counterparts.

The association between marital status and academic referral status (shown in Table2) was examined using a chi-square test of independence. Among the participants, 4 cohabiting students (28.6%), 1 divorced student (50.0%), 1 married student (12.5%), and 160 single students (42.4%) reported no academic referrals. Conversely, 10 cohabiting students (71.4%), 1 divorced student (50.0%), 7 married students (87.5%), and 217 single students (57.6%) indicated having received at least one academic referral. The Pearson chi-square test (shown in Table2) yielded a non-significant result (χ² = 3.933,p= .269), suggesting no statistically significant relationship between marital status and referral status. The likelihood ratio test produced a similar outcome (χ² = 4.438,p= .218). However, it is important to note that 50% of the cells had expected frequencies below 5, which violates the assumptions of the chi-square test. This limitation necessitates caution in interpreting the findings. Despite the lack of statistical significance, descriptive trends suggest that married students had the highest proportion of referrals (87.5%), while single students had the lowest (57.6%). These patterns may warrant further exploration in future studies with larger and more balanced samples.

As shown in Table3, an independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean age of students who had received an academic referral with those who had not. The results revealed that students who had not received a referral were slightly younger (M= 22.32,SD= 3.19) compared to those who had received at least one referral (M= 22.93,SD= 2.46).

Levene’s test for equality of variances (see Table4) indicated that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was met,F= 0.323,p= .570. Therefore, the results for equal variances assumed were interpreted. The t-test revealed a significant difference in mean age between the two groups,t(399) = -2.157,p= .032. The mean difference was − 0.61 years, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from − 1.16 to -0.05. This suggests that students who were referred were, on average, approximately 0.6 years older than those who were not referred.

A binary logistic regression was conducted to examine the predictors of academic referral status among nursing and midwifery students. The model included gender, academic level, and age as independent variables. As shown in Table5, the overall model was statistically significant, χ² = 36.599,p< .001, indicating that the predictors, as a set, reliably distinguished between students who had and had not received an academic referral. The classification table revealed that the model correctly predicted 45.2% of students who had not received a referral and 76.6% of those who had received at least one referral. The overall classification accuracy was 63.6%, which is an improvement over the baseline accuracy of 58.6%.

It could be deduced from Table6that academic level significantly predicted academic referral status (Wald χ² = 24.588,p< .001. The odds ratio (OR = 3.377, 95% CI [2.13, 5.35]) indicated that students in higher academic levels were 3.38 times more likely to be referred than those in lower academic levels. Age was marginally significant (Wald χ² = 3.070,p= .080). The odds ratio (OR = 1.081, 95% CI [0.99, 1.18]) suggested that for each additional year of age, the odds of being referred increased by 8.1%. Gender was also marginally significant (Wald χ² = 3.059,p= .080). The odds ratio (OR = 1.673, 95% CI [0.94, 2.98]) indicated that female students had 1.67 times higher odds of being referred than male students.

Independent samples t-tests (see Table7) were conducted to compare mean scores on academic stress-related variables between students who had and had not received an academic referral. Referred students reported significantly greater difficulty balancing study and personal responsibilities than non-referred students (M= 3.03 vs.M= 3.20,t(399) = 2.139,p= .033). No significant differences were found for perceived academic workload stress (p= .933), confidence in managing workload (p= .078), academic pressure (p= .854), or feeling overwhelmed by assignments/exams (p= .528).

Independent samples t-tests (shown in Table8) were conducted to compare mean scores on language barrier-related variables between students who had and had not received an academic referral. Referred students reported significantly greater difficulty understanding course materials due to language barriers than non-referred students (M= 3.00 vs.M= 2.69,t(399) = -3.184,p= .002). They also perceived the language used in exams and assignments as less clear (M= 3.54 vs.M= 3.79,t(399) = 2.954,p= .003) and reported lower confidence in participating in class discussions (M= 3.51 vs.M= 3.68,t(399) = 1.986,p= .048). No significant difference was found for performing better if instruction was in the local language (p= .152).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed (see Table9) to investigate the underlying structure  of institutional factors as they related to academic referral status. The analysis demonstrated only a one-component solution and this component explained 55.47% of  the total variance. All 6 items showed significant loading on a singular component (factor loadings ranged from 0.546 for  peer learning opportunities to 0.826 for counselling services). Communalities, or the amount of variance in each item explained by the  component, ranged from 0.298 to 0.682.

Chi-square tests of independence were conducted (see Table10) to examine the relationship between assessment-related  variables and academic referral status. There was a strong association between the type of assessment that students reported being the most difficult and referral status (χ² = 15.130, p =. 010) (see Table10). Referred students reported that a higher proportion of written theory and multiple-choice  examinations were difficult. In comparison, a higher proportion of practical assessments were difficult for non-referred students and presentation assessments were more difficult for them. The results shown in Table10indicate that both referred and non-referred students perceived the assessments to be aligned at least fairly with the course material.

No significant association was found for how well assessments reflected course material, χ² = 2.708,p= .608 (see Table10). Additionally, a significant association was found between the perceived quality of assessment feedback and referral status, χ² = 11.097,p= .025 (see Table10). Referred students were likely to rate feedback as less helpful than non-referred students (see Table10).

The study assessed the association between demographic variables (gender, academic level, marital status, and  age) and academic referral status. The results showed that academic level strongly predicted academic referral (third-year students were more likely to be  referred than second-year students, χ² = 28.893, p <. 001). Considering the demands of Ghana’s nursing workforce [41], this underscores critical systemic gaps in students’ preparedness for advanced work. The logistic regression analysis also confirms academic level as a significant predictor of academic referral status, with third-year students being 3.38 times more likely to be referred than second-year students (OR = 3.377,p< .001). Even though extant research indicates escalating academic pressures in later training stages [1,2], our findings quantify the disproportionate risks in Ghana’s educational context, where institutional support systems such as tutoring and mental health resources [41,42] are lacking.

Age also emerged as a significant predictor, with referred students, on average, 0.6 years older than non-referred students (t = 2.157, p =. 032; OR = 1.081,p= .080). While significant and consistent with studies showing that older students might need to navigate additional obstacles, such as balancing their academic responsibilities with work or family responsibilities [12,13], age differences should not guide interventions without further evidence of causation. Also, gender and marital status did not significantly correlate with academic referral status. Descriptive trends by gender and marital status suggest that there may be a greater proportion of referrals among female students and married students. This is similar to previous studies, which report gender differences in academic outcomes [8,9] and the difficulties for married students in managing their academic work and family life [17]. Female students had higher odds of being referred compared to male students (OR = 1.673,p= .080). While these findings were not statistically significant, they merit further research to identify possible challenges specific to gender and marital status. This contrasts with assumptions that demographic factors drive referrals. The non-significance of demographic factors suggests that structural (curriculum design, for instance) rather than individual factors may be significant determinants of academic performance and referrals. While this challenges Ghanaian studies that emphasise demographic deficits [43], it aligns with critiques of “blame-the-student” [44] narratives in nursing education. Perhaps, it may be more appropriate for colleges to incorporate transitional support programmes for students transitioning to the final year to mitigate referral disparities.

The study also aimed to evaluate the role of academic confidence, skills, and preparation in academic referrals. Non-referred students demonstrated significantly higher levels of academic confidence and readiness (p =. 007) and were more effective at building academic skills and preparation (p =. 006) than referred students. These findings align with previous research that underscored the role of self-efficacy, study skills, and preparation in the academic success of students [14,15]. For example [14], concluded that elevated levels of academic confidence prepare students to meet academic difficulties more successfully. Similarly [15], emphasised a significant positive correlation between self-efficacy and academic performance. These results highlight the importance of providing interventions that increase students’ confidence and skills, such as preparatory courses, study skills workshops and peer mentoring programs.

The study further assessed the impact of institutional support on being an academic referrer. Results showed that students who were not referred reported significantly higher levels of institutional support than students who had been referred (p =. 040). This result is consistent with existing literature on how vital institutional support is to help students succeed [16,20]. Bolshakova et al. (2011) found that student outcomes were positively affected by supportive learning environments and easily accessible academic advisors. Similarly, Feldon et al. (2010) emphasised the essence of timely and constructive feedback in improving academic performance. These findings suggest a need for institutions to bolster support structures in these areas, such as academic advising, counselling services, and feedback loops, to better accommodate the challenges posed to at-risk learners.

Referred students had significantly more difficulty understanding course material due to language barriers (p =. 002) and perceived the language used in exams and assignments as less clear (p =. 003). Higher mean scores were also reported in their low confidence in joining class discussions (p =. 048). These results are consistent with previous research that has emphasised the detrimental effect of language barriers on academic performance, especially in scenarios where the language of instruction differs from the student’s first language [27,28]. This emphasises the importance of programs that provide language support, such as Structured English-for-Academic-Purposes (EAP) [45–47] workshops that focus on tailoring the language to nursing terminology rather than generic language training. Nursing training colleges may also incorporate culturally sensitive teaching methods, including code-switching where instructors include limited use of feasible local languages for clarification [48–50] and visual aids to bridge comprehension gaps without formal bilingual materials. More so, peer-assisted learning programmes where proficient students mentor their peers who struggle with language [51–53] may also be strengthened as a cost-effective approach to mitigate language barriers.

Chi-square tests showed a significant relationship between the types of assessments that students found most challenging and referral status (p =. 010). Students referred were significantly more likely to identify written theory papers and MCQ-based assessments as difficult to pass, while students who were not referred reported difficulty passing practical evaluations and presentations. This result implies that the modes of the evaluations may influence academic performance. The difference may imply that the test mode serves as a hidden gatekeeper in nursing education, filtering out disproportionate numbers of students with strengths in applied learning and weaknesses in the usual standardised test format. This raises a critical equity issue considering that nursing is a competency-based field. Furthermore, referred students rated feedback as less helpful (p =. 025), emphasising the need for timely and formative feedback to encourage student learning. These findings parallel earlier studies highlighting the importance of assessment design and feedback in academic performance [22,23]. The rating of feedback implies that generic feedback protocols may fail to meet the needs of struggling students. Beyond generic feedback, we propose a three-tiered approach that is culturally-adaptive for the Ghanaian nursing context. This “feedback triage” involves (a) structured rubrics for written exams, (b) peer feedback circles to supplement instructor evaluations, and (c) verbal debriefs to accompany practical assessments.

This study sought to identify key factors influencing academic referrals among nursing and midwifery students. Academic level and age are strong predictors; students in their third year or older were more likely to be referred. Even though gender and marital status did not show statistically significant associations, descriptive trends suggest higher referral rates for females and married students. The study also highlights the importance of academic confidence, institutional support, and language proficiency in un successful academic outcomes. Referred students faced greater challenges with language barriers, assessment clarity, and feedback quality than their non-referred colleagues. These findings underscore the importance of addressing academic and non-academic contributors in improving students’ success and reducing referrals in nursing and midwifery education.

The findings of this study suggest the following for policymakers and educators to support nursing and midwifery students and reduce academic referrals. First, institutions of higher learning should focus on early intervention for third-year students to address the unique academic pressures they face. Flexible learning options and time management support should be provided to enable older students to balance academic and personal responsibilities. To enhance academic confidence and skills, study skills workshops, peer mentoring, and preparatory courses should be prioritised to improve student readiness and self-efficacy. It is also important to strengthen institutional support systems, including accessible counselling services, timely feedback mechanisms, and clear communication of course materials to address the needs of at-risk students. Further, language support programmes, such as English-for-Academic-Purposes workshops, culturally sensitive teaching methods, and peer-assisted learning programmes should be introduced to help students overcome language barriers. To address students’ varying learning styles and improve the quality of feedback, assessment methods should be diversified to help reduce academic challenges.

We acknowledge the following limitations of the study. First, the cross-sectional design did not allow for causal relationships between the variables examined. Second, our sample was predominantly female and second-year students, potentially restricting the generalizability of the conclusions drawn to different demographic groups or academic levels. Third, self-reported data can be affected by response bias, which might introduce errors in the results. Fourth, small sample sizes in some categories, particularly divorced and married students, limited statistical power to detect significant associations for marital status. Further, we treated academic referrals as a binary outcome (yes/no) without distinguishing the nuances of referral. Our analysis did not distinguish between nursing and midwifery students. This potentially masks profession-specific referral patterns that may be the focus of future studies. Lastly, the study was conducted in a single institution. Hence, the results may not be extrapolated to other educational settings.

We suggest future research address the foregoing limitations and explore other dimensions of academic referrals. Longitudinal studies would be required to establish causal relationships between demographic, academic and  institutional factors and referral outcomes. A more  balanced sample about gender, education level, and marital status would also increase the generalizability of findings. Multi-institutional studies could provide broader insights into how different educational settings might affect referral rates. More so, qualitative research, such as focus groups or interviews to capture the lived experiences of students who are referred for academic support, could be explored. Finally, examining the effectiveness of specific interventions to enhance learning outcomes, such as language support  programs, study skills workshops, and feedback mechanisms, would also yield useful evidence to guide improvements in students’ learning outcomes. Finally, future research should also explore how external variables, such as socioeconomic status and work obligations, impact academic performance and chances of being referred.
