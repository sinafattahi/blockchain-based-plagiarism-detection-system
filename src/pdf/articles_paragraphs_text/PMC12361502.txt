“In our case, the PDF is represented asfX|Y(x) whereXrepresents the random variable of interest (e.g., length, width, height), andYrepresent the categorical variable defining the vehicle segments (e.g., A, B, C, D, …, N). For example,fX|Y=A(x) represents the PDF ofXwhenYis in segment A.

In our case, the PDF is represented aswhereXrepresents the random variable of interest (e.g., length, width, height), andYrepresent the categorical variable defining the vehicle segments (e.g., A, B, C, D, …, N). For example,represents the PDF ofXwhenYis in segment A.

The boundary is again determined by locating the zeros of the difference of the kde of groupsynandym, with the difference that in this case the kde are calculated for two features (fXi|Y=yn(x),fXj|Y=yn(x)) and are represented by surfaces in the 3d space (a). The zeros of the function, defined by Eq. (4), constitute a 2d domain of featuresXiandXj, which can be approximated by linear functions or piecewise linear functions (b).
