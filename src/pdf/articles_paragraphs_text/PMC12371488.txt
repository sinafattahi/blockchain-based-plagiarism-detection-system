N-acyl ethanolamines represent conserved lipophilic
signaling molecules that function as endogenous ligands at G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and nuclear
receptors. Using a combination of comparative ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HR-MSE) analysis and microreactions,
a diversity of glycosylatedN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
were characterized inCaenorhabditisnematodes. Representative
examples were enriched by RP-C18 chromatography and identified by
NMR spectroscopy. Comparative metabolomics and isotope incorporation
experiments revealed that the biosynthesis of the homologousN-acyl building blocks (approximately 50 compounds) depends
on the bacterial food source, chain elongation and desaturation of
food-derived fatty acids, or their de novo biosynthesis by the nematode,
whereas the biosynthesis of medium-chainN-acyl units
depends on the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle via the 3-ketoacyl-S-CoA thiolasedaf-22. Glycosylation of
these lipophilicN-acyl ethanolamines results in
amphiphilic modular metabolites (approximately 100 identified compounds)
that are released into the environment and exhibit potential signaling
functions. Exclusively male-produced β-sophorosylN-acyl-phosphoethanolamines like SNAP-13:1cyclo retain females of and , and its biosynthesis requires bacterial
cyclo fatty acids 17:1cyclo and 19:1cyclo, thereby translating growth
phase-dependent bacterial lipogeneses into a behavioral signal. Amphiphilic
2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylN-eicosapentaenoyl
phosphoethanolamine (GGp-NAE-20:5), a dominating component of the metabolome, represents a water-soluble
derivative ofN-eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (NAE
20:5), potentially enabling intra- and interspecies endocannabinoid
signaling.

(Gp-NAE,7) intermediates; (b) nematode-derived modular
metabolites carrying homologousN-acyl ethanolamines

The bacterivorous nematode serves as a model organism
to study lipogenesis and lipid metabolism,
and their effect on lifespan and development.,Long-chainN-acyl ethanolamines (1), including NAE-20:4 and NAE-20:5, have previously been identified
in−and shown to
modulate thermal avoidance, olfactory
sensitivity, and cholesterol homeostasis and coordinate nutrient status with metabolic
changes that ultimately determine lifespan.−Two functional
NAPE-PLD orthologues have been identified along with NAE sensing G protein-coupled receptors such as NPR-19
and NPR-32.

Biosynthesis of NAE-20:5
and NAE-20:4 (1) and related
compounds is reduced in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants such
asdaf-22(3-ketoacyl-S-CoA thiolase),
presumably due to depletion of ethanolamine pools upon accumulation
of copious amounts of ethanolamine conjugates of very long-chain ascarosides,
the precursors of a conserved class of nematode signaling molecules.,Other peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants such asacox-1(acyl-CoA oxidase) exhibit no effect on NAE-20:5 and NAE-20:4 biosynthesis but display a strongly reduced abundance oflyso-NAPEs (6) potentially involved in NAE
biosynthesis. While these results demonstrate
the implication of peroxisomal β-oxidation in ’ NAE biosynthesis, the relationship
between lipogenesis, β-oxidation, and NAE biogenesis has remained
largely enigmatic.

Here, we demonstrate thatN-acyl ethanolamine
metabolisms in variousCaenorhabditisspp., including
the hermaphroditic model organism as well as the gonochoristic and , involve multiple
homologous series of fatty acid building blocks that either originate
directly from the bacterial food source and the elongation of food-derived
precursors or from de novo lipogenesis. A diversity ofN-acyl units of medium chain length are derived from chain shortening
of long-chain precursors via thedaf-22-dependent
peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle. LipophilicN-acyl ethanolamines serve as building blocks for amphiphilic β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8,9) and 2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
(10) that are subsequently released into the environment,
indicating potential signaling functions (Figureb). For example, the male-specific β-sophorosylN-cis-5,6-methylenedodecanoyl phosphoethanolamine
(11), which encodes the availability and growth phase
of the bacterial food
source, retains females of and . Our results demonstrate
thatN-acyl ethanolamine metabolism is not only involved
in endogenous signaling but also participates in intraspecies and
potentially even interspecies interactions via amphiphilic signaling
molecules released into the environment.

Comparative ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography
electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HR-MSE) analysis of exometabolome extracts from sevenCaenorhabditisspecies of the Elegans group, N2, PB2801, AF16, JU1422, PB4641, JU1373, and JU1904 (Figure S1) highlighted a novel class of nematode-derived modular metabolites
(NDMMs) that carry homologousN-acyl ethanolamine
building blocks. Inspection of HR-MS/MS spectra (Figure S2) suggested modular β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine structures
that integrate building blocks from carbohydrate,N-acyl ethanolamine, and energy metabolism. Two dominating representatives
(11and12) were found to be particularly
abundant in the exometabolome of the tropical species (previously calledC. sp. 16) strain JU1904 from Central Bali, Indonesia, and were subsequently isolated from 2 L of the liquid culture
supernatant using a combination of reverse phase chromatography and
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography on RP-C18.
Partial structures were identified by analysis of1H NMR,dqf-COSY, and HSQC spectra (Table S1), which indicated the presence of two β-glucopyranosyl units
along with an ethanolamine moiety, whereas the variableN-acyl building blocks were identified as a cyclopropyl group containingcis-5,6-methylenedodecanoyl unit (13:1cyclo (Δ5,6)) or a monounsaturated (5Z)-dodecenoyl
unit (12:1 (Δ5)) for11and12, respectively (Figured). The absolute configuration of the (5R,6S)-cis-cyclopropyl moiety of11was subsequently assigned based on its biosynthetic origin from -derived (9R,10S)-cis-9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid (Figure S3) of known absolute configuration. The characteristic disaccharide building block
was identified as a β-sophorose (1,2-β-glucopyranosyl-glucopyranoside)
unit based on long-range HMBC correlations (Figure S4). The connectivity of the modular building blocks as deduced
from the HR-MS/MS fragmentation patterns (Figures S2 and S5) was finally confirmed by long-range H,H-COSY and
H,C-HMBC correlations to reveal β-SophorosylN-AcylPhosphoethanolamine (SNAP) structures that we like to
call SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1
(12). The energy-rich and rather labile β-sophorosyl-1-phosphate
linkage was unambiguously established based on the vicinal3J-(H,P)-coupling constant of 8.8 Hz observed for
an anomeric proton signal withddmultiplicity (Figure S6). The β-glycosyl-1-phosphate
linkage in SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) is prone to hydrolysis to furnish the correspondingN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (2) (Figure S7).

Having
identified the two dominating β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines from as SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12), we utilized their common characteristic ESI-(−)-HR-MS/MS
fragment ion signal atm/z78.9591 [PO3]−for
the phosphate unit to screen for additional minor derivatives (Figure S8). These analyses confirmed that SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) are representatives
of a diverse class of β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
that share a common fragment ion of low intensity atm/z421.0753 [C12H22O14P]−for the β-sophorose-1-phosphate unit
and carry homologuesN-acyl residues of medium chain
lengths ranging from 10 to 15 carbons (seeTable S3for 17 assigned structures). Comparative analysis of their
chromatographic retention times indicated two homologous series with
saturated straight chains or iso-branchedN-acyl
residues (Figure S9). Identification of
the straight chain series was confirmed by chemical correlation of
saturated SNAP-12:0 with SNAP-12:1 (12) using palladium-catalyzed
hydrogenation (Figure S10). The assignment
of iso-branchedN-iso-acyl chains was subsequently
confirmed by one and two-dimensional1H NMR spectroscopy
of SNAP-13:0iso (13) and SNAP-11:0iso (14) isolated from JU1904
and PB2801 (Figured andTable S1). Furthermore, using microreactions with palladium-catalyzed
hydrogenation, a series of (odd-numbered) inert cyclopropyl group
containing homologues were distinguished from the (even-numbered)
double bond containing derivatives that are readily hydrogenated (Figure S11).

In addition, HR-MS/MS screening
form/z78.9591 [PO3]−(Figure S8) revealed a
second series of closely related minor derivatives that are characterized
by a monosaccharide building block instead of the β-sophorose
unit (seeTable S4). Analysis of HR-MS/MS
(Figure S12) and one and two-dimensional1H NMR spectra (Figures S13 and 14) of isolated GNAP-13:1cyclo (15) (Figured) as a representative for
these β-GlucosylN-AcylPhosphoethanolamines
(GNAP,9) confirmed the presence of a β-glucose-1-phosphate
moiety (Table S1). Targeted screening of
MSEchromatograms for the β-glucose-1-phosphate fragment
ion atm/z259.0224 [C6H12O9P]−demonstrated that
the β-glucosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
(9) represent a diverse class of metabolites that carry
homologousN-acyl moieties ranging from 7 to 20 carbons,
including saturated straight and iso-branched building blocks, as
well as cyclopropyl group containing and mono and polyunsaturatedN-acyl units (seeTable S4for
46 assigned structures, some of which have been previously detected). Comparative UHPLC-ESI-HR-MSEanalysis
of exometabolome extracts of sevenCaenorhabditisspecies from the Elegans group revealed that modular β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8&9) are highly conserved. The gonochoristic species represented
by , , , and produce predominantly
β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8) with SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) as the dominating
component in all four species (Figuree) along with a diversity of species-specific minor
β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8&9). In contrast, all three androdieciousCaenorhabditisspecies described so far, , , and were found to
produce only traces of the β-sophorosylN-acyl
phosphoethanolamines (SNAP,8) but instead release the
corresponding β-glucosides (GNAP,9). The β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine profile of the model organism N2 is dominated by compounds containingN-cyclopropyl-acyl moieties like 11:1cyclo, 13:1cyclo, and
15:1cyclo moieties, as well as the polyunsaturatedN-eicosapentaenoyl moiety (20:5), along with minor amounts of straight
and iso-branched-chain derivatives (Figuref).

while Gp-NAEs (7) are enriched in the endolipidome, their

GGp-NAE-15:1cyclo (19) and GGp-NAE-18:5 (21) is almost abolished in thedaf-22metabolome,
whereas those of GGp-NAE-17:1cyclo and GGp-NAE 20:5 (20) is only slightly reduced, demonstrating the implication ofdaf-22-dependent peroxisomal β-oxidation; and (f)
composition of homologous β-glucosylN-acyl
phosphoethanolamines (GNAP,9) andN-acyl 2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylphosphoethanolamines (GGp-NAE,10) in the exometabolome.

Sex-specific exometabolome analysis of gonochoristic JU1904
demonstrated that the three representative β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines SNAP-13:1cyclo (11), SNAP-12:1 (12), and SNAP-13:0iso (13) are predominantly produced by males (Figurea). Male-specific production of SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11), SNAP-12:1 (12), and SNAP-13:0iso (13) was also demonstrated for gonochoristic PB2801, JU1422, and PB4641 (Figure S15). In addition, male specificity could
also be demonstrated for most of the minor β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8) carrying straight
chain, iso-branched, unsaturated, and cyclopropyl groups containingN-acyl residues (Figure S16). In contrast, the corresponding monosaccharides
such as GNAP-13:1cyclo (15) were detected in males and
females of the gonochoristicCaenorhabditisspecies
and even appeared to be somewhat enriched in females (Figure S17). These β-glucosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (9) are abundant in androdiecious , , and . Their production
in is largely unaffected
by thehim-5­(e1490)mutation (Figure S18) that is characterized by a high incidence of males,
approximately 33% versus 0.3% for the N2 wild type, which confirms that β-glucosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (9) such as GNAP-13:1cyclo
(15) are predominantly produced by hermaphrodites.

(a) Sex-specific analysis of JU1904 indicated that the dominating β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines SNAP-13:1cyclo (11), SNAP-12:1 (12), and SNAP-13:0iso (13) are exclusively produced by males; (b) holding assays demonstrate
that females of JU1904
are retained in scoring regions conditioned with male-produced SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) but not with SNAP-12:1 (12), whereas
(c) females of PB2801 are
retained by both SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) (Welch′sttest,ns= not significant, seeTables S9 and S10for data).

The biological activity of male-produced
SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) on adult behavior was evaluated using a
holding assay that quantifies
nematode retention in conditioned scoring regions in comparison to
the solvent control (Table S9). Whereas
males are not affected, females are retained by ecologically relevant
amounts of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) ranging from 10 fmol to
10 pmol (Figureb).
In contrast, SNAP-12:1 (12) did not elicit any significant
response in males or females at any of the concentrations tested,
which demonstrates that the presence of the cyclopropyl moiety is
essential for the behavioral activity of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) in females. Females
of are retained by 100 fmol of both SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) or SNAP-12:1 (12) (Figurec), although male production of SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) is considerably more pronounced than those of SNAP-12:1
(12) (Figure S15). males
did not respond to any of the compounds tested (Table S10).

To decipher the ecological
significance of female retention by male-produced SNAP-13:1cyclo (11), the biogenesis of the β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines was investigated. Bacterial food dependency
was evaluated by comparative UHPLC-HR-MS analysis of the conditioned
media supernatant collected from well-fed versus starved cultures, which demonstrates that SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11), SNAP-12:1 (12), and SNAP-13:0iso (13) accumulate under well-fed conditions, whereas their production
is largely abolished upon starvation (Figurea). Similar results were obtained for a diversity
of homologous β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
(8,9) in and (Figures S19 and S20). This pronounced food dependency resembles
those observed for the dominating 1- and 2-isomericlyso-phosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs,4) with homologous
long-chainO-acyl side chains such as 14:0, 16:0,
18:0, 16:1, 18:1, 17:1cyclo, and 19:1cyclo (Figure S21 and Table S5) that are derived from partial hydrolysis
of bacterial membrane forming phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs,3). In contrast, the biosynthesis of ascarosides, a class
of conserved nematode glycolipids with diverse signaling functions,,is largely maintained when shifting from well-fed to starved conditions
(Figure S22), suggesting that their fatty
acid-derived aglycones originate from stored lipid reservoirs (or
de novo lipogenesis), whereas the fatty acid moieties of the β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8,9) are more directly derived from the bacterial diet.

Food-dependent biosynthesis
of β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine
(SNAP) in JU1904. (a) Biosynthesis
of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) SNAP-12:1 (12), and SNAP-13:0iso (13) subsides upon starvation
(relative intensity, mean ± 1 SD,n= 4); (b)
Biosynthesis of SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) strongly depends
on the diet, whereas that of
SNAP-13:0iso (13) is independent of the bacterial food
source (relative intensity, mean ± 1 SD; Welch′sttest,n= 3).

Time-dependent quantitative analysis based on the comparison of
released versus retained metabolites, the exo- and endometabolome,
respectively, indicated that under well-fed conditions, approximately
5-20% of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) present in worm bodies is being released into the environment every
hour (Figure S23), which is comparable
to the release rates observed for most ascaroside signals (asc-C5-C9:10-40%/h)
but considerably lower than those observed for the dominating LPEs
(4) derived from direct hydrolysis of PEs (e.g., LPE-14:0, LPE-16:0, LPE-17:1cyclo,
LPE-19:1cyclo with 80-160%/h). Starved nematodes retain only limited
reservoirs of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11, 9% of well-fed), SNAP-12:1
(12, 26%), or SNAP-13:0iso (13, 16%) (Figure S24), suggesting that the β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines represent (slowly) released
environmental signals that potentially serve as a measure for food
availability.

Aiming to decipher the biosynthetic origin of the β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines, we utilized the mixed [U–12C]/[U–13C]-isotope labeling strategy,−in order to discriminate food-derived and de novo biosynthesized
metabolic building blocks. After feeding with a 1:1 mixture of natural abundance [U–12C]
and uniformly carbon-13 labeled [U–13C]-, the exometabolome extract was fractionated
by RP-C18 chromatography to enrich the target compounds. Analysis
of ESI-(−)-HR-MSEspectra revealed a bimodal distribution
of13C isotopomers for the molecular ion signal of SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11), whereas the corresponding 13:1cyclo (Δ5,6)N-acyl phosphoethanolamine (2) fragment ion from loss of the β-sophorose unit shows discrete
signals for [U–12C], [13C2], [13C13], and [U–13C15] isotopomers (Figuresa andS25), which demonstrates
that SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) is produced by the nematode
upon combining a [C13]-13:1cyclo fatty acid and a [C2]-ethanolamine building block derived from bacterial metabolism,
along with two glucose units derived from de novo gluconeogenesis.
A similar bimodal13C isotopomer distribution was observed
for SNAP-12:1 (12) along with discrete signals for [U–12C], [13C2], [13C12], and [U–13C14] isotopomers for the
monounsaturated 12:1 (Δ5)N-acyl
phosphoethanolamine fragment ion (2) (Figuresb andS25), indicating its origin from the bacterial diet. However,
minor signals for13C isotopomers with a bell shape distribution
also suggested some incorporation of de novo biosynthesized 16:1 (Δ9) or 18:1 (Δ11). The bacterial origin of both 12:1 (Δ5) and 13:1cyclo
(Δ5,6)N-acyl units and the ethanolamine
building block along with their assembly by the nematode could also
be confirmed for [C13,C2]-NAE-P-13:1cyclo and
[C12,C2]-NAEP-12:1, the correspondingN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (2) (Figure S26) derived from hydrolysis of SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) and SNAP-12:1 (12), respectively (Figure S7).

(12), and SNAP-13:0iso (13) upon mixed isotope
labeling by feeding JU1904
with a 1:1 mixture of [U–12C]- and [U–13C]-, along with natural
abundance spectra as control. (a, b) Biogenesis of SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) depends on the assembly
of bacteria-derivedN-acyl and ethanolamine units
along with a sophorose unit from gluconeogenesis. (c) In contrast,
SNAP-13:1iso (13) depends on de novo lipogenesis of theN-iso-acyl moiety, which incorporates a [13C5]-isovalerate building block upon feeding with 50%l-[U–13C6]-leucine enriched but is not labeled byl-[U–13C5]-valine.

In order to explore how the
lipid composition of the bacterial diet affects the biosynthesis of
β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines, was cultivated with
either the standard OP50 diet
or with , an alternative
food source that has been shown to affect nematode reproduction, fitness,
and lifespan. Characterization of the
fatty acid composition of the OP50 lipidome using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis by GC-EIMS
showed two cyclopropyl fatty acids, 17:1cyclo (Δ9,10) and 19:1cyclo (Δ11,12), along with monounsaturated
palmitoleic acid (16:1 (Δ9)) andcis-vaccenic acid (18:1 (Δ11)) (Figure S27a), which represent potential precursors for theN-acyl units of SNAP-13:1cyclo (Δ5,6) (11) and SNAP-12:1 (Δ5) (12),
respectively. In contrast, the lipidome of is characterized by the absence of cyclopropyl and monounsaturated
fatty acids and instead represents a rich source of iso- and anteiso-fatty acids such as 15:0iso, 17:0iso, 15:0anteiso, and
17:0anteiso (Figure S27b). Shifting ’s
diet from to resulted in specific and strong attenuation
of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) (Figureb), which
indicates that their production depends on the bacterial diet and
requires bacterial cyclopropyl and monounsaturated fatty acids, respectively.
Bacterial food-dependent biosynthesis was also observed for GNAP-13:1cyclo (15) (Figure S28), a dominating β-glycosylN-acyl
phosphoethanolamine in the model organism . In contrast, branched-chain β-sophorosylN-iso-acyl phosphoethanolamines such as SNAP-13:0iso (13) are not affected by shifting from to an iso-fatty acid rich diet (Figureb).
These results indicate that the bacterivorous nematode requires -derived cyclopropyl fatty acids (17:1cyclo (Δ9,10) and 19:1cyclo (Δ11,12)) and their monounsaturated
precursors, palmitoleic (16:1 (Δ9)) andcis-vaccenic acid (18:1 (Δ11)) for biosynthesis of
SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12),
respectively, which further implies chain shortening of these long-chain
fatty acids (potentially via β-oxidation) to produce the 13:1cyclo
(Δ5,6) and 12:1 (Δ5)N-acyl building blocks of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1
(12), respectively. Considering that represents an artificial food source for bacterivorousCaenorhabditisspp. and that bacterial fatty acid components
are required for the biosynthesis of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12), we screened the fatty acid composition
of a set of 12 bacterial strains isolated from the microbiome (the CeMBio collection) by GC-EIMS (Figure S29), which demonstrated that both cyclopropyl fatty acid and palmitoleic
acid are abundant lipid components inCaenorhabditis’natural environment.

In
contrast to the bacteria-derivedN-acyl building
blocks of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) (Figurea,b), mixed
isotope labeling of SNAP-13:0iso (13) in using a 1:1 mixture of natural abundance
[U–12C]- and carbon-13 labeled [U–13C]- (Figurec) furnished a bell-shaped distribution of13C isotopomers for theN-iso-tridecanoyl
phosphoethanolamine fragment ion, indicating a de novo origin for
the branched-chainN-iso-acyl moiety of SNAP-13:0iso
(13). Production of iso-branched SNAP-13:0iso (13) in is independent
of the iso-fatty acid content of the bacterial diet (Figureb), in agreement with a de
novo origin. Feeding with
an auxotrophicΔval,
Δleu, Δilemutant specifically
enriched with either 50%l-[U–13C6]-leucine or 50%l-[U–13C5]-valine
revealed that iso-branched SNAP-13:0iso (13) (Figuresc, andS30) and GNAP-11:0iso (16) (Figurea) are [13C5]-labeled upon incorporation ofl-[U–13C6]-leucine but not byl-[U–13C5]-valine. Incorporation ofl-[U–13C6]-leucine enriched also furnished [13C5]-labeled iso-fatty acids
[13C5]-15:0iso and [13C5]-17:0iso (Figure S31), thus suggesting
that theN-iso-acyl moiety of SNAP-13:0iso (13) and GNAP-11:0iso (16) might originate from
de novo lipogenesis of odd-numbered iso-fatty acids, which represent
essential building blocks for branched-chain d17:1iso sphingosine
and related sphingolipids characteristic for nematodes.−De novo lipogenesis of iso-fatty acids involves the chain elongation
of al-leucine-derived isovalerate unit,and depends on the iso-fatty acid elongaseelo-5that participates in the elongation of 13:0iso to 15:0iso.,,Implication ofelo-5in the biogenesis of the β-glucosylN-iso-acyl
phosphoethanolamine GNAP-11:0iso (16) was demonstrated
using theelo-5­(gk208)loss of function mutant that is known to arrest larval development
at the L1 stage unless supplemented with an exogenous source of iso-branched
fatty acids such as 15:0iso or 17:0iso. Comparative analysis ofelo-5­(gk208)cultures supplemented
with either synthetic 17:0iso or its stable isotope labeled [D6]-isotopomer,furnished exclusively natural
abundance GNAP-11:0iso (16) or isotope labeled [D6]-GNAP-11:0iso ([D6]-16), respectively
(Figureb), which
not only demonstrated that GNAP-11:0iso (16) biogenesis
in depends onelo-5but also revealed that it proceeds exclusively via chain shortening
of a long-chain iso-fatty acid intermediate such as 17:0iso and not
directly via de novo lipogenesis of the medium-chain 11:0iso fatty
acid building block (Figured).

(b) incorporation of natural abundance 17:0iso or [D6]-17:0iso

comparative UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MS analysis of wild-type (N2) and β-oxidation mutant
exometabolomes reveals that β-glycosylN-acyl
ethanolamine phosphate (GNAP) biosynthesis is independent of the mitochondrial
3-ketoacyl-S-CoA thiolasekat-1but
proceeds via the peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-S-CoA thiolasedaf-22(relative intensity, mean ± 1 SD,n= 3); and (d) biosynthetic pathway froml-leucine to GNAP-11:0iso
(16) viaelo-5-dependent de novo lipogenesis
of iso-fatty acids such as 17:0iso and subsequent chain shortening
via peroxisomal β-oxidation bydaf-22.

Considering that the biosynthesis of the variousN-acyl building blocks of β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines inCaenorhabditisspp.
appears to depend on chain shortening of long-chain fatty acids derived
from either the bacterial diet or de novo lipogenesis, we screened β-oxidation mutants carrying deletions
in the peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-S-CoA thiolasedaf-22−or the mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-S-CoA thiolasekat-1. Comparative exometabolome analysis of wild-type N2,daf-22­(ok693), andkat-1­(tm1037)demonstrates that the biosynthesis of β-glucosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines does not require mitochondrialkat-1but depends on the peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle
that involvesdaf-22(Figurec). Production of β-glycosylN-acyl phospho­ethanolamines in thedaf-22mutant is strongly attenuated for straight chain and iso-branched
derivatives like GNAP-11:0iso (16) and almost abolished
for the cyclopropyl group containing GNAP-13:1cyclo (15). These results demonstrate that both β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine (Figurec) and ascaroside biosynthesis depend ondaf-22(Figure S32) and utilize the same primary metabolic pathway, the peroxisomal
β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), to regulate the
chain lengths of lipid-derived homologous acyl building blocks. However,
while thedaf-22mutant accumulates homologous long-chain
ascarosides that represent the direct precursors for the short-chain
components characteristic for the wild type (Figure S32),,no accumulation of any long-chain
homologue was observed for the β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines, suggesting that the subsequent biosynthetic
steps that connect peroxisomal β-oxidation and β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine biosynthesis are selective for
specific medium-chain fatty acid (MCFAs) building blocks.

Having shown that the
biosynthesis of β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine
(8and9) with medium-lengthN-acyl building blocks depends on peroxisomal β-oxidation of
fatty acids, we aimed to characterize putative biosynthetic intermediates.
Targeted ESI-(+)-HR-MSEanalysis by screening for [C2H8NO]+atm/z62.061 (Figure S33) enabled
the detection of previously described long-chainN-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs,1),−as part of a homologous series carryingN-acyl
units ranging from 10 to 20 carbons (seeTable S6for 55 assigned structures) that are highly conserved inCaenorhabditisspp. NAE-15:1cyclo is dominating in fed with , while the other androdieciousCaenorhabditisspecies
produce predominantly NAE-20:5 () or NAE-18:1 () (Figure S34). Biosynthesis of the homologousN-acyl chains in NAEs (1) parallels those of
SNAPs (8) and GNAPs (9). De novo produced
branched-chainN-iso-acyl ethanolamines incorporate
a [13C5]-isovalerate unit upon feeding withl-[U–13C6]-leucine enriched (Table S6 and Figure S35). Production of long-chain polyunsaturatedN-acyl ethanolamines is partially downregulated indaf-22as previously reported,,whereas the biogenesis
of several chain-shortened homologues, including NAE-15:1cyclo, NAE-13:1cyclo,
NAE-15:0iso, NAE-13:0iso, and NAE-18:5, is almost abolished in thedaf-22mutant (Figure S36), demonstrating
their origin from chain shortening of long-chain precursors via the
peroxisomal β-oxidation cycle. Mixed isotope labeling by feeding with a 1:1 mixture of natural abundance
[U–12C]- and carbon-13 labeled [U–13C]- afforded a diversity of
[Cn,C2]-labeledN-acyl ethanolamines (n= carbon number ofN-acyl unit) such as [C16,C2]-NAE-16:0,
[C19,C2]-NAE-19:1cyclo, [C17,C2]-NAE-17:1cyclo, [C15,C2]-NAE-15:1cyclo,
and [C13,C2]-NAE-13:1cyclo, as well as chain
elongated homologues with polyunsaturatedN-octadecanoyl
orN-eicosanoyl moieties such as [C16,C2,C2]-NAE-18:X (X = 3-5), [C16,C2,C2,C2]-NAE-20:4 (anandamide) and [C16,C2,C2,C2]-NAE-20:5, along
with de novo biosynthesized iso-branched derivatives such as NAE-15:0iso
and NAE-17:0iso (Figure S37), which demonstrates
thatN-acyl ethanolamines are produced by the nematode
via assembly of an ethanolamine unit with a diversity of homologousN-acyl building blocks derived from either bacterial lipogenesis,
chain elongation of bacteria-derived palmitic acid (16:0), or de novo
lipogenesis. Furthermore, identification of chain-shortened homologues,
such as [C15,C2]-NAE-15:1cyclo and [C13,C2]-NAE-13:1cyclo (originating from -derived 17:1cyclo and 19:1cyclo) or [C16,C2,C2]-NAE-18:5 (originating from 20:5), and
theirdaf-22dependence, demonstrates thatN-acyl ethanolamine metabolism also incorporates building
blocks derived from peroxisomal β-oxidation of long-chain fatty
acid precursors.

Aiming to identify the biosynthetic
intermediates that linkdaf-22-dependent peroxisomal
β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids withN-acyl ethanolamine metabolism and β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine biosynthesis, the exo- and endometabolomes
ofCaenorhabditisspp. were analyzed for modular
metabolites that carry the characteristicN-acyl
ethanolamine building blocks. Targeted ESI-(+)-HR-MS/MS screening
revealed a limited collection of glycerylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (Gp-NAEs,7) with
11:1cyclo, 13:1cyclo, 15:1cyclo, 12:0, 14:0, 16:1, and 14:1N-acyl units (Table S7), which
are particularly enriched in the endolipidome (Figure S38). Isomeric Gp-NAEs (7) and LPEs (4) were distinguished based on their composition ofN- orO-acyl building blocks (Figure S38), MS/MS fragmentation patterns (Figure S39), and the distribution of13C isotopomers upon mixed isotope labeling by feeding with a 1:1 mixture
of [U–12C] and [U–13C]- (Figures S40 and S41). ESI-(+)-HR-MSEanalysis of bacterial food-derived [U–Cn]-LPEs (4) with homologous long-chainO-acyl side chains, such as 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 16:1, 18:1,
17:1cyclo, and 19:1cyclo, furnished signals for uniformly [U–12C] and [U–13C] labeled isotopomers (Figure S40 and Table S5), in agreement with their
origin from partial hydrolysis of bacterial phosphatidyl­ethanolamines
(6, PE). In contrast, ESI-(+)-HR-MSEof the
Gp-NAEs (7) such as Gp-NAE-15:1cyclo (17) (Figurea) furnished signals corresponding to [U–12C], [13C5], [13C15], and [U–13C20] isotopomers for the
molecular ion [C20H41NO7P]+, as well as signals for [U–12C], [13C2], [13C15], and [U–13C17] isotopomers of the [C15,C2]-labeledN-acyl ethanolamine fragment ion
[C17H32NO]+(Figureb andFigure S41). These results demonstrate that [C15,C5]-Gp-NAE-15:1cyclo
(17) is biosynthesized by the nematode through attachment
of the (chain-shortened) bacteria-derived [C15]-15:1cycloN-acyl unit to an uniformly labeled [C5]-glycerylphosphoethanolamine
building block (presumably viaN-acylation of PEs
(3) to furnish NAPEs (5)), which places
the biosynthesis of Gp-NAEs (7) upstream of NAEs (1) as well as SNAPs (8) and GNAPs (9). While these results demonstrate the integration of (chain-shortened)
bacteria-derivedN-acyl units into endometabolome
enriched Gp-NAEs (7), homologous series with medium-lengthN-acyl units ranging from 8 to 14 carbons have previously
been described in starved L1 larvae utilizing ethanol as sole carbon source, indicating that in the absence of bacterial lipids, the
Gp-NAEs (7) can also be produced by de novo lipogenesis.
Theirdaf-22dependence has previously been described, but their potential function as intermediates
in ’ NAE biosynthesis
has not yet been demonstrated.

Targeted ESI-(+)-HR-MS/MS screening for the correspondinglyso-NAPEs (6) in the lipidome revealed the presence of multiple homologous series (Figuresc andS42) that could be distinguished from the isomeric
phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs,3) based on their MS/MS
fragmentation patterns (Figure S43) and
composition of (N- or)O-acyl units.Lyso-NAPEs carrying 15:1cyclo as theN-acyl
unit (18) (Figurea) and branched-chain iso-fatty acids such as 15:0iso and
17:0iso asO-acyl unit are particularly abundant
in the lipidome (Figure S42), demonstrating thatlyso-NAPE-dependentN-acyl ethanolamine metabolism also
includes chain-shortened fatty acid building blocks.

Having identified
Gp-NAEs (7) like Gp-NAE-15:1cyclo (17) (Figurea) as potential intermediates
in NAE (1), SNAP (8), and GNAP (9) biosynthesis, we screened for additional modular metabolites carrying
these building blocks. ESI-(+)-HR-MS/MS analysis of the exometabolome
extract highlighted a series of structurally related modular 2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (GGp-NAEs,10)
carrying homologousN-acyl moieties ranging from
10 to 20 carbons (seeTable S8for 39 assigned
structures), some of which have previously been detected.,,Comparative LC-MS analysis indicated
that these GGp-NAEs (10) are abundant in hermaphroditic , , , as well as gonochoristic , , and . In contrast to
male-produced SNAP (8), the biosynthesis of GGp-NAEs
(10) in gonochoristicCaenorhabditisspecies is not sex-specific (Figure S44). The highly unsaturated GGp-NAE 20:5 (Δ5,8,11,14,17) (20) (Figurea), an amphiphilic derivative of the endocannabinoidN-eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (NAE 20:5), constitutes
the most abundant GGp-NAE (10) representative in (Figuref) and related nematodes. Dominating GGp-NAEs were
enriched from 4 L of a liquid
culture medium and the structures of GGp-NAE-15:1cyclo
(Δ7,8) (19), GGp-NAE-20:5 (Δ5,8,11,14,17) (20), and GGp-NAE-18:5 (Δ3,6,9,12,15) (21) were established by one and
two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (Figurea andTable S2). Comparative analysis of exo- and endometabolome extracts demonstrated
that release rates of the strongly retained Gp-NAEs (7) are dramatically increased upon conversion to the corresponding
2-O-β-glucosides (GGp-NAEs,10) (Figured), suggesting
that 2-O-glucosylation converts them into amphiphilic
environmental signals. In contrast to GGp-NAE-20:5 (20) and GGp-NAE-17:1cyclo, the relative amounts of GGp-NAE-18:5 (21) and GGp-NAE-15:1cyclo (19) are strongly reduced
in thedaf-22­(ok693)mutant metabolome (Figuree), which demonstrates
that the biosynthesis of these modular metabolites integratesN-acyl building blocks derived from the peroxisomal β-oxidation
of long-chain fatty acid precursors such as 20:5 or -derived 17:1cyclo, respectively. Comparative
analysis of GNAP (9) and GGp-NAE (10) profiles
in the exometabolome indicated
that relative abundancies of theirN-acyl building
blocks are similar but not identical (Figuref). The eicosapentaenoyl (20:5) unit constitutes
the dominatingN-acyl group for both9and10, suggesting a potential function in endocannabinoid
signaling. Cyclopropyl fatty acids represent another group of dominatingN-acyl residues, but their distribution differs between
GNAPs (9) and GGp-NAEs (10), with short
chains (11:1cyclo, 13:1cyclo, and 15:1cyclo) dominating for GNAPs
(9), and longer chains (15:1cyclo and 17:1cyclo) dominating
for GGp-NAEs (10). The same predominance for shorterN-acyl moieties for GNAPs (9) versus GGp-NAEs
(10) is also observed for saturated straight and branched-chain
components (Figuref), indicating that GNAPs (9) and GGp-NAEs (10) are derived from similar but not identicalN-aycl
ethanolamine pools or that their biosynthesis is carefully controlled.

In conclusion, using
a combination of comparative metabolomics and stable isotope labeling
experiments, the biosynthesis of β-glycosylatedN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (8,9,10) inCaenorhabditisspp. was elucidated
(Figure). Biosynthesis
of the two dominating β-sophorosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) depends
on bacterial lipogenesis and thereby encodes the growth phase of the
bacterial food source (Figurea). Male-specific biosynthesis of female attracting SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) requires bacteria-derived cyclopropyl fatty acids
(17:1cyclo or 19:1cyclo), which are exclusively produced upon stationary
phase-dependent expression of cyclopropyl fatty acid synthase (cfa) that converts
all monounsaturated 16:1 and 18:1 into 17:1cyclo and 19:1cyclo, respectively.
Because biosynthesis of SNAP-12:1 (12) requires the bacteria-derived
monounsaturated fatty acids 16:1 and 18:1, sex-specific SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11) and SNAP-12:1 (12) signaling in gonochoristicCaenorhabditis spp. encodes information about the availability
and growth phase of the bacterial food source(s) (Figurea). In contrast, the biosynthesis
of iso-branched SNAPs such as SNAP-13:0iso (13) involves
de novo lipogenesis of iso-fatty acids including chain elongation
of al-leucine-derived [C5]-isovalerate building block via elongaseelo-5, to furnish long-chain iso-fatty acid precursors (15:0iso and 17:0iso)
(Figureb).

(a) Biogenesis
of β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
inCaenorhabditisspp. involves the integration of
fatty acid building blocks from growth phase-dependent bacterial lipogenesis,
as well as (b)elo-5-dependent de novo lipogenesis,
along with lipolysis, peroxisomal β-oxidation viadaf-22and NAE metabolism; (c) biosynthetic pathway from exogenous or endogenous
lipids to β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
involves lipolysis and chain shortening of resulting long-chain fatty
acids (LCFAs) bydaf-22-dependent peroxisomal-β-oxidation
to furnish medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which are attached to
phosphatidylethanolamines (PE,3) byN-acyltransferases (NAT) to furnishN-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs,5). Hydrolysis
of NAPEs providesN-acyllyso-phosphatidylethanolamines
(lyso-NAPEs,6), glycerylphosphateN-acyl ethanolamines (Gp-NAEs,7), andN-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs,1), which serve
as precursors for the β-sophorosylN-acyl ethanolamine
phosphates (SNAP,8), β-glucosylN-acyl ethanolamine phosphates (GNAP,9), and 2-β-glucosyl
glycerylphosphateN-acyl ethanolamines (GGp-NAEs,10) that are subsequently released into the environment.

The various long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) building
blocks originating
from bacterial lipogenesis or de novo lipogenesis are released by
lipolysis (Figurec) and potentially enter thedaf-22-dependent peroxisomal
β-oxidation cycle. Resulting medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA)
and their LCFA precursors are subsequently utilized forN-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs,3) in
a tightly controlled manner to furnishN-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines
(NAPEs,5). NAPEs (5) with long and medium-chainN-acyl moieties are hydrolyzed, either directly or via the
correspondinglyso-NAPE (6) and Gp-NAE
(7) intermediates, to furnish lipophilic NAEs (1) that act as endogenous signaling molecules, and in addition, also serve as precursors for
amphiphilic β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
such as the exclusively male-produced SNAPs (8), as well
as GNAPs (9). Furthermore, 2-O-β-glucosylation
of endometabolome enriched Gp-NAEs (7) furnishes the
amphiphilic 2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylN-acyl
phosphoethanolamines (GGp-NAEs,10) (predominantly 20:5
and 15:1cyclo in ), which
are subsequently released into the environment to function as precursors
for the corresponding NAEs (1), thereby enabling intra-
and potentially even interspecies signaling.

N-Acyl ethanolamines such as the endocannabinoids
NAE-20:5 and NAE-20:4 are known as endogenous lipid signaling molecules
that regulate various aspects of biology, including reproductive development, TGF-β signaling,
cholesterol transport, axon regeneration, behavior, and nociception. Our chemical analysis revealed that the structural
diversity of homologousN-acyl ethanolamines with
55 assigned structures in and related nematodes is considerably larger than previously anticipated.
This structural diversity originates from the integration of diverse
fatty acid building blocks derived directly from bacterial lipogenesis,
from chain elongation and desaturation of bacteria-derived precursors
(mainly palmitic acid, 16:0), or fromelo-5-dependent
de novo lipogenesis of iso-fatty acids by the nematode. Structural
diversity is further increased by chain shortening of long-chain fatty
acids via thedaf-22-dependent peroxisomal β-oxidation
cycle, demonstrating that NAE signaling involves building blocks from
anabolic and catabolic pathways. Because biological activities of
endocannabinoid signals depend most strongly on the homologousN-acyl side chains, the structural diversity of NAE metabolites
might be paralleled by a yet undisclosed functional diversity.

Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the lipophilicN-acyl ethanolamines serve as building blocks for three
classes of amphiphilic nematode-derived modular metabolites (NDMMs),
including 17 members of β-sophorosylN-acyl
phosphoethanolamines (SNAPs,8), 46 members of β-glucosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (GNAPs,9) and
39 members of 2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylN-acyl
phosphoethanolamines (GGp-NAEs,10). While these compounds
are conserved inCaenorhabditis, their individual
compound profiles are highly species-specific.

Comparative analysis
of exo- and endometabolomes revealed that
the lipophilic NAE (1) and Gp-NAE (7) precursors
are retained in the endolipidome, whereas conversion into the amphiphilicO-glycosyl derivates, SNAPs (8), GNAPs (9), and GGp-NAEs (10) results in their subsequent
release into the exometabolome, thus suggesting potential signaling
functions. Behavioral assays revealed that ecologically relevant amounts
of the predominantly male-produced SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) retains females of gonocho­ristic . Females of are retained
by both SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and SNAP-12:1 (12), indicating species-specific communication. In addition, it is
conceivable that the various glycosylatedN-acyl
phosphoethanolamines, SNAP (8), GNAP (9),
and GGp-NAEs (10), elicit additional biological activities
on nematode development or behavior that have not yet been characterized.
Considering their accumulation in the exometabolome, facile hydrolysis,
and the fact that water-solubleN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
(2) have previously been described as prodrugs forN-acyl ethanolamine (1) based endocannabinoids, the glycosylatedN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
(8,9,10) might represent
a general mechanism for endogenousN-acyl ethanolamine
signaling to be shared with the environment, and thus potentially
be involved in the regulation of intra and interspecies interactions.
Additional bioassays to characterize the potential bioactivities of
the amphiphilic glycosylatedN-acyl phosphoethanolamines
(8,9, and10) and their role
as precursors for lipophilicN-acyl ethanolamines
will be required to evaluate their ecological significance.

The female retention by male-produced SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) in depends on the presence
of the cyclopropyl moiety derived exclusively from the bacterial food
source, which provides further evidence for the importance of bacterial
cyclopropyl fatty acids in the chemical signaling of bacterivorous
nematodes. We have previously shown that female production of the
highly species-specific male attracting sex-pheromone fasc-C4-cycloC11
(SMID: fasc#1) in depends on bacteria-derived 17:1cyclo and 19:1cyclo
produced by upon entering the
stationary growth phase. Its biosynthetic
intermediate, 11:1cyclo (SMID: becyp#1) has subsequently been identified
as an endogenous activator offat-7expression in . In contrast,
the monounsaturated palmitoleic acid (18:1 (Δ9)),
which serves as a precursor for 19:1cyclo in and is dominating its lipidome during the exponential growth phase,
enhances recovery of dauer
larva. Growth phase-dependent cyclopropanation
of unsaturated fatty acids is prominent among bacteria,and abundant within the microbiome, as shown by FAME analysis of the “CeMBio”
model microbiome, in which 10 out of
12 bacterial isolates were found to be rich in cyclopropyl fatty acids
(Figure S29). Retention of females by male-produced SNAP-13:1cyclo
(11), the production of which requires bacterial food-derived
17:1cyclo or 19:1cyclo, thus encodes not only bacterial food availability
but also bacterial growth phase-dependent fatty acid cyclopropanation
as a widespread indicator for the exhaustive conversion of environmental
nutrients into bacterial biomass, which is required to make these
resources accessible for bacterivorous nematodes. Taken together,
our results demonstrate how the metabolism, development, and behavior
of bacterivorous nematodes like theCaenorhabditisspp. are shaped by the lipid composition of its bacterial food source.

Characterization of dietary and lipogenesis pathways along with
complementary chain shortening via peroxisomal β-oxidation inN-acyl ethanolamine biosynthesis represents an important
step toward understanding the metabolic regulation of the lipid and
endocannabinoid network. Additional species-specific glycosylation
of endogenous NAEs and their subsequent release into the environment
facilitates intraspecies and potentially even interspecies interactions
via amphiphilic exocannabinoid signaling molecules.

OP50 and GB7044 were
precultured on solidified Lysogeny Broth agar (15.0 g/L agar with
10.0 g/L tryptone, 5.0 g/L yeast extract, 5.0 g/L NaCl) at 37 °C
for 12 h, and single colonies were used to inoculate 1.0 L of Lysogeny
Broth medium, which was incubated overnight (12–14 h) at 37
°C and 180 rpm. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation

KH2PO4, 247 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O), and stored at 7 °C until being used as food for nematode
cultures (maximum of 2 weeks).

Bacteria isolated from

Mixed stage
nematodes from four 10 cm NGM agar plates collected in S-medium were
used as inoculums for liquid cultures grown in 100 mL S-medium (5.85

culture in LB medium at 37 °C) was provided daily as food from
day 1 to 7, after which the cultures were starved for an additional
7 days. Nematodes were separated by centrifugation at 1000gfor 10 min, frozen at −20 °C, lyophilized,
powdered by crushing with solid NaCl, and extracted with 3 ×
5 mL methanol to furnish the endometabolome extract. The filtered
supernatant was frozen at −20 °C, lyophilized, and extracted
with 3 × 50 mL methanol for 12 h each to furnish the exometabolome
extract. The extracts were filtered, concentrated to dryness under
reduced pressure at 40 °C, and reconstituted in 1 mL of methanol.
Aliquots were diluted with methanol and analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-HR-MSE. All measurements were performed by using at least three
biological replicates.

in water as eluent (10 mL each, from 0% to 100% methanol using 10
increments of +10%). The resulting RP-C18 SPE fractions were concentrated
under reduced pressure using a Vacufuge Plus Concentrator (Eppendorf),
and aliquots were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-HR-MS.

The β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamine was enriched from 2 L of the liquid culture
supernatant of strain JU1904
grown as described before. The filtered supernatant was frozen at
−20 °C and lyophilized, and the residue was extracted
with 3 × 200 mL of methanol for 12 h each. The combined extract
was filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure at
40 °C. The resulting residue was reconstituted in 10 mL of methanol
and filtered to remove insoluble salt. The concentrated exometabolome
extract was reconstituted in 5 mL of water and fractionated by reverse
phase chromatography on 5 g of RP-C18 cartridges (Chromabond, Macherey-Nagel)
using a stepwise gradient of methanol in water as eluent (from 0 to
100% methanol using increments of +10% and fractions of 10 mL). The
resulting RP-C18 fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure
using a Vacufuge Plus Concentrator (Eppendorf), and aliquots were
analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MSEand1H NMR. SPE fractions enriched in target compounds (eluted with 70
and 80% methanol) were submitted to semipreparative HPLC using a 1525
EF pump (Waters) connected to a 2487 DAD UV detector (Waters) with
a detection wavelength of 305 nm and a FC203B fraction collector (Gilson).
Chromatographic separation was achieved using an Xterra MS C18 column
(150 mm, 19 mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size) (Waters).
Optimized HPLC conditions were developed on UHPLC and then transferred
to semipreparative scale. A water/acetonitrile solvent system was
used with 0.05% formic acid at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. The temperature
of the column was maintained at 45 °C. Fractions (8 mL) were
collected every minute. Aliquots of 10 μL were diluted and analyzed
by UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MSEwith isocratic elution.
HPLC fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure using a Centrivap
vacuum concentrator (Labconco). Fractions rich in target compounds
SNAP-13:1cyclo (11), SNAP-12:1 (12), SNAP-13:0iso
(13), SNAP-11:0iso (14), and GNAP-13:1cyclo
(15) were dissolved in CD3OD and analyzed
by NMR spectroscopy (Table S1).

The 2-(β-glucosyl)-glycerylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines were enriched from 4 L of the
liquid culture supernatant of strain N2 grown as described before. The filtered supernatant was
frozen at −20 °C and lyophilized, and the residue was
extracted with 3 × 200 mL methanol for 12 h each. The combined
extract was filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure
at 40 °C. The resulting residue was reconstituted in 10 mL methanol
and filtered to remove insoluble salt. The concentrated exometabolome
extract was reconstituted in 5 mL water and fractionated by reverse
phase chromatography on 5 g RP-C18 cartridges (Chromabond, Macherey-Nagel)
using a stepwise gradient of methanol in water as eluent (from 0%
to 100% methanol using increments of +10% and fractions of 10 mL).
The resulting RP-C18 fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure
using a Vacufuge Plus Concentrator (Eppendorf), and aliquots were
analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MSEand1H NMR. SPE fractions enriched in target compounds (eluted with 80%
methanol) were submitted to semipreparative HPLC using an LC-20AR
pump (Shimadzu, Japan) connected to an SPD-20A UV–vis detector
(Shimadzu) with detection at 305 nm and a FRC-40 fraction collector
(Shimadzu). Chromatographic separation was achieved using an Xterra
MS C18 column (150 mm, 19 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) (Waters).
Optimized HPLC conditions were developed on UHPLC and then transferred
to semipreparative scale. A water/acetonitrile solvent system was
used with 0.05% formic acid at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. The temperature
of the column was maintained at 45 °C. Fractions (8 mL) were
collected every minute. Aliquots of 10 μL were diluted and analyzed
by UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MSEwith isocratic elution.
HPLC fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure using a Centrivap
vacuum concentrator (Labconco). Fractions rich in target compounds
GGp-NAE-15:1cyclo (19), GGp-NAE-20:5 (20), and GGp-NAE-18:5 (21) were dissolved in CD3OD and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (Table S2).

Aliquots (10 μL) of semipreparative HPLC fractions enriched
in β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines (from
separation of the JU1904 exometabolome) were diluted with 1 mL ethanol
and treated with 10 mg palladium on carbon (10%, w/w), and hydrogen
gas was bubbled through the vigorously stirred mixture. After 1 h,
the mixtures were filtered over cotton and concentrated under reduced
pressure, and the residues were taken up in 100 μL of methanol
for comparative UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MSEanalysis using
the diluted untreated exometabolome fraction (10 μL in 100 μL
of methanol) as control.

For sex-specific exometabolome
analysis of JU1904, PB2801, JU1422, or PB4641, a total number of 100 male and 100 female adult nematodes
were collected from nonstarved cultures on NGM agar seeded with OP50 using a 0.25 mm platinum–iridium

and 180 rpm in 500 μL of S-medium supplemented with 100 μL
of an OP50 overnight culture
in LB medium. Cultures were filtered over cotton to remove the nematodes,
and the medium was frozen at −20 °C, lyophilized, and
extracted with 500 μL methanol. Filtered extracts were concentrated
under reduced pressure, and the residues were taken up in 100 μL
of methanol for UHPLC-ESI-(−)-HR-MSEanalysis.

were hatched on NGM agar
seeded with OP50 and supplemented
with 10 mM 17:0iso (1 mL of 2.7 mg/mL of fatty acid in EtOH per 9
mL of OP50 culture) synthesized
as previously described. Monoxenic conditions

was performed using a GC 7890B (Agilent) coupled with a Gerstel Multi-Purpose
Sampler (MPS) and connected to an MSD 5977A mass spectrometer (Agilent).
Chromatographic separations were achieved using an HP 5 ms Ultra Inert
column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness) with helium
as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A temperature program
starting at 50 °C for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient of
+10 °C/min to 320 and 320 °C for 10 min, was used. A total volume of 1 μL was injected spitless at
an injector temperature of 270 °C. 70 eV mass spectra were acquired
fromm/z35–650 amu. Instruments
were controlled by using Gerstel Maestro software (V1). Data were
processed using MassHunter software version B.07 (2014) from Agilent
Technologies.

Ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HR-MS/MS) analyses were performed using
an Acquity ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system
coupled to a Synapt G2 QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA)
controlled by MassLynx 4.1 software. Chromatographic separations were
achieved using a Waters Acquity HSS T3 UHPLC column (100 mm ×
2.1 mm, 1.8 μm particle diameter) with a flow rate of 500 μL/min using a binary solvent mixture composed
of eluent A (water containing 0.05% formic acid) and eluent B (98%
acetonitrile and 2% water containing 0.05% formic acid). A linear
gradient from 0 to 100% B in 10 min was applied, followed by a hold
at 100% for 5 min and re-equilibration at 0% B for another 5 min.
Analysis was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive
and negative ionization modes using a source temperature of 120 °C,
desolvation gas at 15 L/min and 450 °C, and capillary voltage
at 2.5 kV for ESI-(+) or 2.0 kV for ESI-(−). Mass spectra were
recorded fromm/z50 tom/z1200. Fragmentation data were collected
in data-independent (broad band collision induced dissociation) mode
using a collision energy of 8-55 V in positive mode and 10–60
V in negative mode. Data were analyzed with MassLynx software (Waters,
Milford, MA).

NMR spectra
were recorded at 400 MHz for1H and 100 MHz for13C using a Bruker AVANCE II 400 instrument equipped with a 5 mm BBFO+
probe or at 600 MHz for1H and 125 MHz for13C using a Bruker Ascend 600 instrument with a 5 mm BBI probe (NPAC,
UniNE). CD3OD (99.96% or 99.8% D) or CDCl3(99.8%
D) was used as the solvent. Residual solvent signals were used as
an internal reference with1H at 3.31 ppm and13C at 49.05 ppm for CD3OD or1H at 7.26 ppm
and13C at 77.16 ppm for CDCl3. Two-dimensional
high-resolution double quantum filtered (dqf)-COSY
spectra were recorded using thecosydfphpulse sequence
with phase cycling for coherence selection by acquiring 32 scans (NS
64 for GNAP) using 8192 data points along f2 and 256 increments along
f1 for a sweep width of 7.5 ppm. HSQC spectra were recorded using
thehsqcetgpsi2pulse sequence by acquiring 448 scans
using 1024 data points in f2 and 64 increments in f1. HMBC spectra
were recorded by using thehmbcgpndqfpulse sequence
by acquiring 432 scans using 2048 data points in f2 and 128 increments
in f1. Spectra were zero-filled to 8192 × 512 for COSY, 2048
× 128 for HSCQ, and 2048 × 128 for HMBC prior to Fourier
transformation and then phased manually and baseline corrected if
required. Post processing and data analysis were performed using the
TopSpin 4.1.3 (2021, Bruker Biospin), MestReNova 9.0.0 (2013, Mestrelab
Research), and MestReNova 14.1.2 (2020, Mestrelab Research) software.

Nematode preference for environments
conditioned with known amounts of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11)
or SNAP-12:1 (12) was measured by using a retention assay
with JU1904 and PB2801. On a 6 cm Petri dish filled with
6 mL peptone-free NGM agar, circular scoring regions with 9 mm diameter
were marked. Next, 1 μL of 10% aqueous methanol (as solvent
control) or solutions of SNAP-13:1cyclo (11) and of SNAP-12:1
(12) in biologically relevant concentrations ranging
from 10 nM–10 μM in 10% aqueous methanol were placed
in the center of the scoring areas and left to dry for 5 min. Young
adult nematodes from nonstarved and noncrowded 6 cm NGM agar plates
seeded with OP50 were separated
by sex and transferred to peptone-free NGM agar without food for approximately
1 h before being used for the experiment in order to minimize the
amount of concomitant bacteria. Individual worms were placed into
the center of the conditioned scoring region, and the time required
for the nematodes to leave the scoring region was recorded. Nematodes
were defined to have left the scoring area when no part of their body
was within the circular boundary. A total number of 20 worms per condition
were analyzed, and experiments were repeated at least twice on separate
days. A Welch’sttest was performed using
SPSS Statistics software version 26 (IBM) to evaluate the effect of
β-glycosylN-acyl phosphoethanolamines on mean
times nematode spent in scoring regions.
