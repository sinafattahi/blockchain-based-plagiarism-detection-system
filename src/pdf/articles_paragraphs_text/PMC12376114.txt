Multiligand monolayers
can self-organize into advantageous
interfacial
patterns that govern nanoparticle (NP) properties. Polyethylene glycol
(PEG) is widely incorporated into self-assembled monolayers to enhance
biocompatibility, particularly in drug delivery applications. Previous
studies demonstrate that monolayer phase separation can be controlled
by leveraging the energetic and entropic driving forces acting on
ligands in the design of amphiphilic surfaces. In this work, we extend
an integrated experimental and simulation framework to investigate
the self-assembly of dodecanethiol (DDT), a long hydrophobic alkanethiol,
with 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol, a short hydrophilic PEG-thiol, as a function
of their surface composition on ultrasmall gold NPs. The PEG-DDT Au
NPs were synthesized via ligand exchange. Integrated MALDI-MS experiments
and configurationally biased Monte Carlo simulations were used to
analyze and predict the local ordering of the surface ligands. The
MALDI-MS fragment distributions obtained from experiment and simulation
show quantitative agreement, and both indicate that the PEG-DDT ligands
undergo phase separation, resulting in NP monolayers with patchy to
Janus-like hydrophilic and hydrophobic ligand domains. Further, the
domain size was found to increase proportionally with the surface
fraction of each ligand, thereby demonstrating the ability to tune
patch sizes in amphiphilic monolayers by controlling the surface composition.

Monolayer-protected nanoparticles (NPs)
have remarkably versatile
and highly tunable properties, including protein adsorption modulation,
NP stability, and therapeutic activity.−These properties are largely governed by
the adsorbed self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which can be engineered
to incorporate multiple ligand-types, resulting in mixed monolayer
shells that alter functionality and enhance performance. Amphiphilic
monolayers, with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, can promote
highly specific interactions with blood serum, improve systemic (bio)­distribution,
and enhance the targeting of cells and tissues. To this end, strategic ligand selection enables the development
of NP-based drugs with tailorable surfaces.−Moreover, the adsorbed ligand mixtures are translationally
mobile on most nanocarrier interfaces. Consequently, the ligands can self-assemble into characteristic
monolayer patterns that could, in theory, be tuned to optimize targeting
and delivery. However, predicting and controlling monolayer pattern
formation – a missing piece – presents a significant
and open research challenge.

Current techniques to experimentally characterize surface
morphology
are limited. Scanning tunnel microscopy (STM) is capable of providing
high-resolution, angstrom-level images that can be used to discern
surface patterns in SAMs, however the technique is highly technical
and interpretation is difficult for STM images on highly curved, ultrasmall
NPs less than 10 nm in diameter, as noted by Lévy and Moriarty. Other techniques include transmission electron
microscopy (TEM),,small-angle neutron scattering
(SANS),−NMR, FTIR, and UV–vis, all of which can
be used to measure properties related to the NP cores and can provide
statistical information about the organization of their monolayers.,Unfortunately, these techniques are limited by the high cost of
materials, access to high-energy facilities, complex sample preparation,
and resolution issues. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) provides an alternative and more accessible
analysis technique that greatly simplifies sample preparation, while
reducing material costs and instrumentation needs.,,−We and others have shown that the laser ablation
of functionalized gold and silver NPs results in intact, metal–ligand
fragments with characteristic ratios that represent small, nanoscale
pieces of the NP-SAM interface.,,−Thus, while MALDI-MS provides a clear measure of
ligand clustering in the monolayer, an atomistic-scale picture of
the NP monolayer cannot be obtained from MALDI-MS alone. Recently,
some have leveraged reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) calculations to generate
monolayer morphologies that are consistent with the experimental data
from SANS and MALDI-MS spectra to facilitate their interpretation. However, the
structural information in RMC comes from simply rearranging 2D ligand
surface patterns on the NP surface to match experimental data, rather
than from models that include the actual physical forces acting upon
three-dimensional ligands. As a result, structural information about
the ligands themselves are not accessible with this approach, which
limits potential extensions of the RMC techniques to monolayer prediction
and design.

In our early work, we demonstrated
the power and ease of combining
MALDI-MS analysis with CBMC simulations that included realistic representations
of the physical driving forces in these NP-ligand systems. We found
that the resulting metal–ligand MALDI-MS fragment distributions
can be predicted by CBMC for a range of binary ligand mixtures and
surface fractions, enabling the visualization of the monolayers of
alkanethiols and mercaptoalcohols on silver NPs.,Validated
by a careful, quantitative, comparison to experimental MALDI-MS data,
this CBMC approach provides complementary atomic-scale details from
the equilibrated ligand structures, such as patch sizes and cocrystallization
patterns.

Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate­(III)
hydrate (99.99% trace metals purity), sodium borohydride (99.99% trace
metals purity), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, ≥ 98% purity), and trans-2-[3­(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]­malonitrile (DCTB,
≥ 99% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol
(≥98% purity) was purchased from Enamine. Ethanol (200 proof,
anhydrous) was sourced from Decon Laboratories. Ultrathin (<3 nm)
carbon film on 400 mesh copper holey carbon grids for TEM imaging
were purchased from Ted Pella. A Sorvall Biofuge Stratos Centrifuge
from Kendro Laboratories was used for cleaning the nanoparticles.

The mixed-ligand protected,
PEG-DDT Au NPs were synthesized via a scalable one-step reduction
method combined with a subsequent ligand-exchange
step. First, hydrogen tetrachloroaurate­(III)­hydrate (HAuCl4) underwent reduction by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of 1-dodecanethiol (DDT).
The concentrations ofHAuCl4,NaBH4, and DDT were 4.5 mM, and the reaction
proceeded at room temperature. The rapid reduction of Au3+to Au0nucleated Au NPs with a diameter of roughly 2
– 4 nm in roughly 100 ms. Subsequently,
DDT adsorbed onto the nuclei, halting NP growth, whereby the ligand acted as a capping agent, forming a
monolayer on the NP surface. The reaction proceeded for 1 h to ensure
monolayer formation and the synthesis of uniform, single monolayer,
DDT Au NPs. The resulting suspension was then subjected to a three-step
centrifugation washing process at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, with stepwise
resuspension of the DDT Au NPs in ethanol to remove excess ligands
and other impurities. A ligand exchange reaction was then performed
to synthesize the PEG-DDT Au NPs by introducing excess quantities
of the PEG ligand, 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol, to a suspension of DDT-Au
NPs. Prior to ligand exchange, the dry mass of DDT-capped NPs was
quantified by vacuum drying the pellet for 72 h followed by subsequent
weighing. The diameter of the synthesized NPs was measured via STEM,
and their volume and surface area were then calculated accordingly.eqwas used to determine
the volume of added PEG,VPEG, wheremdryis the dry mass of the vacuumed DDT Au NP

weights, the DDT molecular weight;VNPthe NP volume, andNAthe Avogadro’s
number.

The resultant volume of PEG
was added to the DDT-protected Au NP sample and stirred to facilitate
the ligand exchange reaction. This reaction proceeded for 72 h to
ensure the mixed monolayer reaches equilibrium.

The successful syntheses
of the single-monolayer DDT Au NPs and the mixed-ligand PEG-DDT Au
NPs were determined by the following methods. UV–vis spectroscopy
provided qualitative confirmation of a narrow Au core size and distribution
through detection of the Au surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Subsequently,
the analyses of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were used determine
the average Au core diameter and size distribution (dc± Δdc). MALDI-MS
was used to determine the experimental nearest-neighbor ligand distribution
of the PEG-DDT Au NPs for comparison to the theoretical CBMC simulations.

All UV–vis measurements
of the NP samples were taken on a Shimadzu UV-2450/2550 spectrophotometer.
The suspending NP solvent, ethanol, was used as a blanking agent.
The NP concentration for each sample was diluted to obtain absorbance
readings within the single particle scattering limit. The measured
resonant UV–vis energy spectrum – which in principle
varies with NP size, shape, and core material – provides information
regarding NP formation and ligand attachment. In particular, Au NPs
exhibit a SPR absorbance peak around λ = 510–580 nm,
with smaller Au NPs exhibiting an SPR near 510 nm. The presence of an alkanethiol monolayer has also been
shown to increase (i.e., redshift) the SPR of Au NPs. This range is used as a quality control check for successful
NP synthesis and sufficient cleaning of washed NP solutions. An SPR
near λ = 540 nm was found for the NP samples as shown inFigure S2in the Supporting Information.

The average NP size and distribution
were determined using TEM and STEM. TEM micrographs were captured
with a FEI Titan 80–300 TEM at an accelerating voltage of 300
kV. The same voltage was used during the collection of STEM micrographs
on Thermo Fisher Themis instrument. TEM grid sample preparation was
performed via the drop mounting method: a pipet was used to place
a drop of NP solution on the corner of the TEM grid, and a small piece
of paper underneath the grid was used to wick away extra solvent.
The grids were dried at 50 °C for 30 min prior to analysis. The
average NP core size and distribution (dc± Δdc) were determined through
image analysis with ImageJ software.

MALDI-MS measurements were performed
on a Shimadzu 8030 time-of-flight (TOF) instrument with a 337 nm nitrogen
laser operating at 200 Hz. Samples for measurement were prepared by
first dissolving 25 mg of the matrix-assist agent DCTB in 1 mL of
methanol, followed by the addition via pipet of 2 μL of a solution
containing 2 mg/mL PET-DDT NPs in ethanol. Subsequently, 1 μL
of each resultant matrix-sample solution was spotted in the sample
wells of a stainless steel, 48-well, Fleximass-SR48 MALDI-MS sample
plate. Immediately following sample deposition, the MALDI-MS plate
was placed under vacuum to remove solvent and facilitate crystallization
of the matrix-NP sample. Data collection per sample was optimized
at a laser power that varied between 25 and 35 (out of 100) within
the settings of the instrument. Its time-of-flight detector was operated
in linear, positive ion mode, with a pulsed extracted mass of 2465
Da and ion gate blanking of 700 Da. The instrument has an inherent
resolution of 5000 fwhm and was calibrated to accuracy within 500
mDa prior to each run.

Laser ablation disintegrates the PEG-DDT
Au NPs, resulting in characteristic, intact gold-ligand fragments
that report on monolayer self-assembly. Hence, the fragments provide
an opportunity to stochastically sample the binary mixed-ligand monolayer,
whereupon the further analysis of a MALDI-MS spectrum can yield the
nearest-neighbor ligand distribution. The process starts by detecting
the relative abundances of the characteristic gold–thiolate
complexes that contain the two ligand-types through their mass-to-charge
ratios. They confer the ability to identify the number of each ligand-type
on a metal fragment through knowledge of their respective molecular
weights. Functionalized Au NPs typically yield characteristic fragments
of the following generic formula: AunLn, wherenis an integer (typically
between 2 and 8), tracking the total number of ligands (L) on a fragment in tandem with the same number of Au atoms. The parameterLrepresents the combination of the two ligand-types A and
B on a fragment as follows: AunAiBn–i, where the integer indexi= 0···n.−
,,The most predominant species is typically the Au4L4fragment, which comprises a distinct family of five metal–ligand
fragments based on the following ways that A and B can combine on
an Au4fragment: A0B4, A1B3, A2B2, A3B1, and A4B0, wherein the subscripts represent
the number of A and B for a total ofn= 4 ligands
on a fragment. In this manuscript, ligand-types A and B are respectively,
DDT and PEG.

Harkness et al. demonstrated that normalization
of a MALDI-MS spectrum
results in a metal–ligand fragment distribution, corresponding
to the nearest-neighbor ligand distribution.,,The analysis of which yields the relative
(molar) surface fractions of the ligands within the mixed-monolayer
and establishes scoring functions that provide quantitative measures
of phase separation for comparison to theory. As such, the experimental
ligand distribution (θi,exp) is
obtained by calculating the area under each fragment-peak,Ci, through integration, normalized
by the total area under all peaks (eq). The surface fraction of ligand-type A,xA, is calculated by weighting each fragment-distribution
peak, θi,exp, by the corresponding
number of A ligands,Ai, on that fragment, normalized by the total number of ligands,n, on a fragment (eq). Accordingly, the surface fraction of ligand-type B,xB= 1 –xA, is obtained through a mole balance.

Eqs–, encapsulating
the experimental SSR and nearest-neighbor
ligand distribution from a MALDI-MS spectrum, provide quantitative
measures of monolayer phase separation for direct comparison to simulation,
as detailed below.

The
atomistic simulations were based on
a structurally accurate, 3D-model of PEG-DDT Au NPs. Its core size
was chosen based on the sizes of the experimental nanoparticles, as
obtained from STEM data (seeFigure). The adsorbed ligand densities were also chosen to
match previously observed experimental values for ligand monolayers
of PEG-related thiols and DDT. Configurationally biased Monte Carlo (CBMC),,,was then used to compute equilibrium monolayer morphologies, enabling
the prediction of the MALDI-MS ligand distributions as well as their
corresponding SSR values, as compared to a random distribution of
ligands.

(PEG) monolayer. (b) Histogram of the particle sizes derived from
STEM measurements. For a total of 100 counted particles, the median

The specific 3D Au-SAM NP model used in this study
was developed previously and has been used successfully to investigate
the dependence of ligand length, chemical mismatch, and surface composition
for a variety of alkanethiol and mercapto-alcohol SAMs on Ag NPs.,Here, we extend the simulations to model ultrasmall Au cores decorated
with a mixture of 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol, a thiol-PEG, and DDT, a
longer alkanethiol. The Au core was realistically modeled as a 20-facet
Mackay icosahedron with a mid-diameter
of 2.8 nm, matching the experimental size from TEM/STEM (seeFigure). The Au atoms within
the simulated core were arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice
with a lattice constant of 4.08 Å, which corresponds to the experimentally
measured Au lattice constant.,To reduce the computational
load, only the outer three layers of the Au core were included in
the simulations. The core was fixed and centered at the origin of
the simulation box.

The PEG and DDT ligands in the simulations
are represented by the
Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations united atom (OPLS-UA)
model,−wherein only the hydrogen atoms bonded to noncarbon
atoms are explicitly modeled. Thus, there are no hydrogen atoms included
in the simulations presented here. The united atom DDT ligand is represented
by 13 particles, one for each carbon in the chain plus the additional
sulfur anchor. The 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol ligand is represented by
6 particles, one for the sulfur, four for the carbons, and one for
the ether oxygen.

The binding between the ligands’ anchoring
sulfur atoms
and gold surface atoms were modeled via a Morse potential.,−Harmonic bonds, angles, and OPLS dihedrals were employed
to describe the intraligand interactions. Nonbonded, interligand interactions
were modeled with a 12–6 Lennard-Jones potential with a cutoff
of 10 Å and the Debye-screened Coulombic potential with a cutoff
of 12 Å. To approximate the experimental conditions of ethanol
– the suspending solvent for the experimental PEG-DDT Au NPs
– an inverse Debye length of 5 Å and a dielectric constant
of 24.35 were employed. We used LAMMPS to evaluate the energetics, while the MC transformations
were performed in Python with coordinate updates made to the LAMMPS
instance through the LAMMPS Python module, subject to the randomly
chosen move and acceptance.

Since the phase separation is sensitive
to the surface density
of the ligands (L) on the nanoparticle, we aimed
to perform the simulations at full monolayer coverage, which correspond
to the experimental conditions. To achieve
the correspondence, the weighted-average of the known alkyl packing
density on gold, 4.7 L/nm2, and an interpolated PEG surface density based on chain length, 6.29 L/nm2, was used to estimate
the ligand interfacial density (σ) within the monolayer as a
function of the PEG surface fraction (xPEG). For the simulations,xPEGwas varied
from 0.1 to 0.9. The σ andxPEGwere
used to determine the number of adsorbed PEG and DDT ligands, respectivelyLPEGandLDDT, employed
at eachxPEGin the simulations. The resulting
surface compositions are detailed inTablebelow.

A total of 18 trials,
initialized
from different morphologies, were performed for everyxPEG.

The CBMC
algorithm speeds up the sampling of ligand
conformations
by enabling the proposal of larger moves while avoiding physically
unrealistic chain collisions, thereby greatly increasing the acceptance
rates of trial moves. This increased sampling efficiency becomes more
important with the dense monolayers found in the experimental systems,
as close packing causes most of the configurational space to be highly
energetically unfavorable. Hence, CBMC simulations were used to predict
the equilibrium monolayer morphology of the simulated PEG-DDT Au NP
over the compositions listed inTable. Our CBMC move set consists of five different moves
chosen probabilistically: Translation, Rotation, Regrowth, Swap, and
Jump. Translation moves displace a randomly chosen ligand along the
surface up to a maximum of 4 Å. The Rotation move rotates a randomly
chosen ligand about a randomly chosen monomer in the chain up to a
maximum of 0.1745 radians. Both the Translation and Rotation moves
are accepted according to the standard Metropolis acceptance criterion and are each 10× more likely to be proposed
than the latter three moves. The configurationally biased Regrowth
move follows the chain regrowth algorithm presented by Siepmann and
Frenkel, whereby a ligand is regrown
in place using the Rosenbluth weight which gives higher preference
to more energetically favorable chain configurations. The regrowth
process involves reducing a randomly selected ligand down to the sulfur
and three monomer beads to maintain the initial dihedral angle. Subsequently,
the chain is regrown monomer by monomer with each regrown monomer
sampling five orientations around the preceding monomer in the chain.
The position relative to the preceding monomer in the chain is chosen
probabilistically based on the relative energetics of each sampled
orientation. The Regrowth move is then accepted or rejected according
to the ratio of the Rosenbluth weights (Wtrial/Winitial) which maintains detailed balance
enabling equilibrium calculations. The
Swap and Jump moves both involve a regrowth step and are therefore
also configurationally biased and accepted according to the same criterion.
The Swap move swaps the positions of two unlike ligands selected at
random and then both ligands undergo regrowth. The Jump move randomly
selects a ligand, which then randomly samples 20 available gap sites
on Au facets within 10 – 20 Å, followed by ligand regrowth
at the newly chosen surface site.

All simulations were run at
298.15 K. To determine whether the
simulations reached equilibrium, a total of 18 trials were conducted
for eachxPEGinTable. Based on the methodology used in our previous
publications,,the 18 trials for everyxPEGwere divided into three smaller subgroups
of six simulations, each initialized from unique configurations that
fall into the following three different monolayer categories: Random,
Striped, and Janus. Subsequently, we primarily used the following
two checks to conclude with a high degree of confidence that an equilibrium
state had been reached. First, the energy evolution of each trial
plateaued indicating that a stationary distribution had been achieved.
The trials were then allowed to sample for a sufficiently ample period
of additional MC moves postplateau. Second, the low variation of SSRsimvalues across the 18 trials for eachxPEGindicates a good convergence and equilibration from
the three different types of starting configurations (seeFigure). The final 10 configurations,
spaced by 10,000 MC proposals each, were considered in the analysis
of each trial. Further, because the SSR value depends onxPEG, we computed the SSR from 50 randomly designed, perfectly
Janus, unrelaxed configurations at each surface fraction to determine
the upper SSR bound at eachxPEG, which
is represented by the boundary of the shaded region inFigure.

SSR values for all three
initial configuration data sets (6 trials
initially Janus, Random, and Striped) for each surface fraction (xPEG). The markers report the average of 60 configurations
from the 6 trials in each subset all initialized in the corresponding
morphology and the error bars report the standard deviation of those
60 configurations’ approximated fragment distributions. The
boundary of the shaded region represents the average SSR value of
50 random, perfectly Janus, morphologies at each surface fraction
and thus represents the upper bound for eachxPEGcomposition. The dotted lines above and below the solid
line represent one standard deviation. SSR convergence is observed
across all PEG surface fractions examined which suggests that the
simulated morphologies have all equilibrated.

To build simulated MALDI-MS distributions from
the MC calculations,
we sample 4-ligand fragments from the surface of the equilibrated
model PEG-DDT Au NP, since the Au4L4fragments
are produced in highest concentration during laser ablation. First,
one ligand is randomly selected. Then the identities of its three
nearest-neighbors (within 6 Å) are obtained to construct a 4-ligand
fragment. Finally, this random sampling process is repeated 50,000
times for each of the equilibrated monolayer structures, thereby capturing
the statistics of local ligand arrangement in the model SAM. A histogram
is then constructed by sorting the collected fragments into the following
categories: PEG0DDT4, PEG1DDT3, PEG2DDT2, PEG3DDT1, and PEG4DDT0, where the subscripts denote
the number of PEG and DDT on a fragment (seeFigure).

MALDI-MS fragment distributions. (a) Representative raw MALDI-MS spectrum

Au4L4fragment peaks are represented by 4 beads,
one for each ligand, with gray beads representing DDT and red beads
representing PEG. (b) Illustration of method to extract expected MALDI-MS
distributions from the atomistic simulations. Here, an equilibrated
snapshot of the correspondingxPEG= 0.50
is shown. Ovito was used to visualize
the snapshots obtained from simulation. The carbon in the ligands
is shown in dark gray, sulfur in yellow, oxygen in red, and the Au
NP core is gold. To build up the expected distributions, the equilibrated
monolayer is randomly sampled 50,000× for simulated 4-ligand
fragment clusters (circled in red). Each cluster is then classified
by the number of DDT, resulting in a normalized fragment distribution
(d) which can be then directly compared to experiment (c). The distributions
of the experimental (c) and computational (d) results are subsequently
compared to the binomial distribution for the corresponding ligand
surface ratio. A quantitative comparison is then made by comparing
the experimental and simulation SSR values. Adapted from reference . Copyright 2018 American

We compare the heights of this histogram
(θi,exp) fori=
0,1,2,3,4, which represents
the number of DDT ligands in the fragment directly to the normalized
MALDI-MS spectrum peak heights (θi,exp) from the experiments (seeeq). The simulated and experimental ligand distributions, along
with the peaks of the corresponding random binomial distribution (θi,binom) ineq, were substituted intoeqto determine the resulting SSRsimand SSRexpfor quantitative comparison. The simulated
and experimental ligand distributions and their corresponding SSR
values, as compared to the binomial distribution, can be seen inFiguresand , respectively.

Comparisons of the normalized
MALDI-MS ligand distributions between
the closest experimental distribution (gray) to the average simulated
distribution (orange) for the PEG-DDT Au NPs. Nine surface fractions
were investigated, ranging fromxPEG=
0.10 – 0.90. The closest experimental distribution was chosen
for comparison unless multiple experimental distributions fell within
± 0.015xPEGin which case they were
averaged. The averaged distributions includedxPEGsim= 0.1, 0.2, and 0.8 with 3, 4, and 2 contributing
experimental fragment distributions, respectively. Each experimentally
averaged distribution is shown with standard deviation represented
in the error bars (black). For simulation, the bar heights report
the average of the final 10 configurations for each trial (180 total
fragment distributions) and the error bars represent the standard
deviation observed among the 180 configurations. The SSRexp‑simvalues for eachxPEG, which report on
the agreement between experiment and simulation, are listed in SITable S1.

Experimental
(navy stars) and simulation (orange circles)
SSR values
as a function of PEG surface fraction. While the experimental results
are spread continuously across the range ofxPEG(the experimental determination ofxPEGis described in the Methods section), the simulations were
conducted at discrete PEG surface fractions ranging from 0.1 to 0.9.
Eighteen trials were run for each surface fraction with a third initialized
in a Janus morphology, another third in a random morphology, and the
remaining third in a striped morphology (stripes were 5 Å wide).
The orange circle markers represent the simulation average SSR obtained
from the 18 trials for each surface fraction data set and the error
bars report the standard deviation. Representative snapshots, chosen
randomly, from simulation are shown above the corresponding PEG surface
fraction for added clarity. (See SIFigure S1for individual simulation results at eachxPEG.).

To determine the patch sizes of PEG
and DDT from the equilibrated
MC simulations, we implemented a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm
with a KDTree that facilitated the efficient look-up of the nearest
neighbors within a cutoff distance of 6 Å and ensured each ligand
was only considered once during the patch size analysis. This search
and sort method enabled the determination of the number of patches
present in a given mixed-ligand SAM configuration and the number of
ligands in each patch. Only the distance between the anchor sulfur
atoms of neighboring ligands and the final 10 configurations of each
trial were considered during the patch size analysis. The findings
are presented inFigure.

Number-weighted average
patch size for both DDT (navy) and PEG
(orange) patches as a function of the PEG surface fraction (indicated
by the vertical dashed line that the corresponding boxes are closest
to). The solid lines represent the total number of the corresponding
ligand type (DDT - navy; PEG - orange) included in the simulation
trials at eachxPEG. Patch sizes were
computed from the final 10 CBMC equilibrium monolayer configurations
of each of the 18 trials per surface fraction (180 configurations
were considered at eachxPEG). The number-weighted
average patch sizes of PEG and DDT are reported as box-plots with
the gray line within each box being the median, the bounds of each
box report the first and third quartile, and the whiskers indicate
the minimum and maximum patch size averages within 1.5x of the interquartile
range (IQR). Number-weighted patch sizes outside 1.5·IQR are
reported as outliers (open circles). The number-weighted average patch
sizes are also reported as the covered fraction of the NP surface
area inFigure S1of the Supporting Information.

We begin with a discussion of
the PEG-DDT Au NP system, focusing
on its components, synthesis, and characterization via STEM and MALDI-MS.
Then we discuss the computational 3D NP model and the process to compare
the simulated MALDI-MS ligand distributions and SSR values to the
experimental data. From both approaches of experiment and simulation,
we obtain distributions of 4-ligand fragment clusters and discuss
the information they provide regarding the degree of phase separation
in the NP monolayer. Finally, we make use of the simulated atomistic
structures to shed light on the morphology of the PEG-DDT monolayers
in greater detail.

As
detailed inMaterials and Methods, ultrasmall
gold nanoparticles were synthesized with mixed monolayers of dodecanethiol
(DDT) and 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol (PEG) ligands. We chose to pair DDT
with PEG as PEG is commonly used to modify (or PEGylate) the surfaces
of nanocarriers for drug delivery. Moreover, these two ligand types
present a good test system, as the interactions between the more polar
PEG ligand and the nonpolar DDT ligand are expected to drive microphase
separation in the NP monolayer, leading to patchy or Janus-like structures.

The ratio of PEG to DDT in the synthesis solution was varied to
control the ligand ratio on the NP surface.Figureshows representative shape (Figurea) and size distributions (Figureb) of the gold NPs synthesized
with the PEG-DDT mixed monolayers. The Au NP cores inFigurea are roughly spherical, ranging
from 1.0 to 4.5 nm in diameter with a median diameter and standard
deviation of 2.8 ± 0.3 nm, as viewed inFigureb.

The synthesized
NPs were analyzed via MALDI-MS to quantify the degree of phase separation
in the PEG-DDT monolayer as a function of the ratio of PEG and DDT
on the surface of each NP sample. At the same time, MALDI-MS was used
to confirm that the experimental PEG surface fraction varied across
the full range fromxPEG= 0.10 –
0.90. The analysis of the MALDI-MS spectra, as detailed in the methods
section, focused on the Au4L4fragment family
due to the greater abundance of these fragments (and highest signal-to-noise
ratio) relative to the other fragment families produced during laser
ablation. With two distinguishable ligand-types, the Au4L4fragment family exhibits five distinct MS peaks that
correspond to the following ligand combinations: 4 PEG/0 DDT, 3 PEG/1
DDT, 2 PEG/2 DDT, 1 PEG/3 DDT, and 0 PEG/4 DDT. The left ofFigure(i.e.,Figurea) displays an experimental MALDI-MS spectrum of these peaks for
a surface fraction of PEG (xPEG) equal
to 0.5. If the ligands are randomly mixed within the monolayer, the
Au4L4peaks will follow a binomial distribution.
Thus, deviation from a binomial distribution represents deviation
from a randomly mixed monolayer. InFigurec, both the binomial distribution (gray)
and the experimentally determined ligand distribution (navy) are shown.
We quantify the deviation from the binomial distribution by taking
the sum of the squared residuals (SSRexp) of each of the
experimental peaks from the expected binomial distribution at the
measured value ofxPEG, as represented
by the relation to the right ofFigurec. Thus, the SSR quantifies the nonrandom nature of
the NP monolayer. Generally, as the SSR value increases, the degree
of phase separation among the ligands composing the monolayer increases.

The data obtained from
the MALDI-MS experiments
are then compared
inFiguresand  to the predictions from
the CBMC simulations run at the nine values ofxPEGranging from 0.10 to 0.90. The process for developing the
3D model of the PEG-DDT Au NP and the algorithm to determine the expected
MALDI-MS spectrum (seeFigureb,d) are discussed in theMaterials and Methodssection. From the simulated and experimental MALDI distributions
inFigure, we calculated
both the SSRexpand SSRsimvalues, which are
plotted inFigure, to quantify the degree of phase separation
observed experimentally and via simulation.

To quantitatively interrelate
theory and experiment,
the experimentally
and computationally generated spectra are plotted inFigureacross the experimentally
determined and computationally input PEG surface fractions,xPEG. Moreover, the comparisons of SSRsimand SSRexpare shown inFigureas a function ofxPEG. The simulation MALDI-MS distribution and its standard
deviation error bars inFigureare composed of 18 simulations for everyxPEG. We compare each one to the experimental distribution
with the closest PEG surface fraction. When multiple experimental
MALDI-MS distributions were within 1.5% of a simulatedxPEG(3 forxPEG= 0.10, 4
forxPEG= 0.20, and 2 forxPEG= 0.80), the average experimental distribution was
calculated and standard deviations are shown with error bars.

The comparisons inFigureshow excellent matches between the experimental MALDI-MS
distributions (gray) and the expected MALDI-MS distributions produced
from the CBMC simulations (orange). ForxPEG= 0.40 – 0.60, larger peaks can be seen in the experimental
and simulated mass distributions for both the 0DDT/4PEGand4DDT/0PEG fragments while
the peaks for the mixed ligand fragments in between are lower, consistent
with a highly patchy or Janus-like monolayer. AtxPEGvalues below 0.4 and above 0.6, both mass distributions
skew toward the ligand at higher concentration.

As outlined
inFigure, the SSR
values inFigurewere
obtained by taking the sum of the squared residuals
between the binomial distribution for the givenxPEGvalue and its respective experimental and simulated
MALDI-MS distributions. The values of SSRexp(navy stars)
and SSRsim(orange circles) are then plotted againstxPEG. The SSR values from our simulations match
well to the experimental data. The spread in SSR values is in line
with our previous work on highly phase-separated dodecanethiol (DDT)/mercaptoethanol
(ME) monolayer-protected silver NPs, where we demonstrated that the
variance in SSRexpcould be increased
by the presence of smaller diameter NPs within the DDT-ME Ag NP size
distribution. Hence, the spread in SSRexpin this work is likely to stem from the fraction of PEG-DDT
Au NPs below the median core diameter of 2.8 nm, based onFigureb.

Additionally,
the SSR value is dependent onxPEG, which
must be considered to interpret the morphology from
this number. This dependence is shown with shading inFigure, where the SSR values of 50
random, perfectly Janus, unrelaxed configurations at eachxPEGwere calculated to obtain an upper bound
on this number acrossxPEG. The SSR values
become increasingly sensitive to minor variations in the monolayer
organization, even in perfectly Janus structures at values ofxPEGclose to 0.5 (see dotted lines inFigure). More significant
reductions in SSR values, as compared to the perfectly Janus upper
bound, are expected for patchy structures or Janus-like structures
with boundaries influenced by the underlying icosahedral NP structure.
For all surface fractions, however, we see that the rough metric of
an SSR value greater than 0.1 should indicate a large degree of phase
separation.,,We quantify the Janus-like character and the patch sizes below inFiguresand .

Ratio of the average
SSRsimand the average SSRJanusas a function
ofxPEG. This
metric reports on the degree of Janus character by comparing the observed
SSRsimvalues to that of a perfectly Janus counterpart,
SSRJanus. The standard deviation is propagated from the
quotient of the two averages and presented in the error bars, and
the solid line was added to aid viewing. Representative snapshots
were obtained from the equilibrated CBMC simulations and are included
above the plot in order of increasingxPEG.

While the
SSR values inFigureoffer a quantitative metric for assessing monolayer
phase separation, the metric lacks detailed structural information
about ligand arrangement. Further insights underlying ligand phase
separation can be drawn by analyzing the atomistic monolayer structures
obtained from our simulations.Figuredisplays the trend in Janus-like character, computed
as the quotient of the average SSRsimand average SSRJanus(refer back to orange dots inFigureand the upper bound of the shaded region
inFigure), alongside
representative monolayers from the CBMC simulations spanning the entire
range ofxPEG= 0.10 – 0.90. AsxPEGincreases, we find that the Janus character
of the morphologies increases approximately linearly, as highlighted
inFigureby the
solid line that was added to aid viewing. This trend is a direct reflection
of the right-skew present in the SSRsimdistribution shown
inFiguresand . At intermediatexPEGvalues (0.4 – 0.6), the DDT ligands cannot cluster onto a
single facet, and the high curvature of the NP seems to promote the
formation of multiple distinct DDT clusters (≈2 to 3). AsxPEGincreases, the number of facets the DDT
ligands cluster on is reduced, up untilxPEG= 0.9, where the DDT appears to localize entirely on one facet.

To gain additional quantitative insight about the monolayer morphology,
we quantified the patchiness of the NP monolayers by measuring the
ligand patch sizes for both DDT and PEG within each monolayer for
all of our simulated structures. To do this, we determined the number-weighted
average patch size, expressed as the number of ligands, for both ligand-types,
as a function of the PEG surface fraction. The number weighted average
patch size,S, was computed followingS=ΣiNiSiΣiNi, whereNiis the number of ligands found in patchi, andSiis
the size
of the patch also measured in the number of ligands such thatSi=Nias was done in our previous publications.,Patches were determined by identifying neighboring ligands of the
same ligand-type with sulfur anchor atoms positioned within the nearest
neighbor distance of 6 Å.

The results inFigurereveal a direct proportionality between
the patch sizes of the PEG and DDT domains and their ligand ratios,
agreeing with the trend in Janus-like character reported inFigure. The lines inFigurerepresent the total
number of DDT and PEG ligands at each surface fraction and thus the
largest possible patch size. InFigure, the simulation snapshot atxPEG= 0.10 shows PEG ligands grouped between clusters of DDT,
which crystallize on the flat facets of the gold NP. This morphology
appears more mixed than the morphology obtained at the other extreme,xPEG= 0.9, where the DDT all crystallize together,
typically onto one facet. This difference is also supported by the
SSRsimvalues of 0.063 and 0.083 atxPEG= 0.10 andxPEG= 0.90, respectively.
As a result, the median/maximum of the DDT cluster boxplot inFigureforxPEG= 0.90 corresponds directly to the total number of
DDT ligands (LDDT= 15) present in the
simulation trials. At intermediate PEG surface fractions (xPEG= 0.20 – 0.80), the respective patch
sizes of PEG and DDT inFigurechange in proportion to their ligand ratios, again with DDT
preferentially crystallizing on flat NP facets, as shown inFigure. Here, the rise
in SSRsimvalues at intermediatexPEGis primarily due to the increased interfacial area between
different ligand domains when they are both present in sizable quantities.
The increased interface for phase separated systems such as these
result in a more significant deviation from the corresponding binomial
and thus higher SSR values. In sum, the formation of highly patchy
to Janus-like PEG-DDT NP monolayers is supported by the visual representations
of the computational monolayer snapshots inFigureas well as the quantification of their patch
sizes inFigure.
The simulation results are confirmed by their excellent match to the
experimental MALDI-MS data inFiguresand .

Several physical forces are at play in the emergence
of the observed
patchy monolayers. First, the formation of patchy domains is driven
in part by the clustering of the hydrophobic DDT ligands, facilitated
by the crystallization of these longer alkanethiol chains. Prior molecular
dynamics simulations on both spherical and planar gold surfaces have
demonstrated crystallization behavior among alkanethiols with chain
lengths exceeding 8 methylene units with the alkyl chain packing driven
primarily by the surface dispersion interactions,,,,consistent
with the structures shown inFigure. Second, strong dipole–dipole interactions
between the hydrophilic PEG ligands, due to the polar interactions
between the partially negative ether oxygen and any neighboring partially
positive PEG −CH2units, contribute a significant
enthalpic driving force for PEG clustering within the nanoparticle
monolayer. Third, because there is also a carbon chain length difference
of ΔC≈ 7 between the two ligand types,
there is an entropic incentive to drive the monolayer toward random
or striped phases such that the conformational freedom and free volume
of the longer DDT ligands are maximized. The resulting morphologies,
as illustrated inFigure, reflect the complex interplay between entropic and enthalpic
effects, giving rise to a continuum of structures ranging from sharply
defined Janus configurations to more irregular patch-like domains.
Importantly, the degree of Janus character increases linearly withxPEG, suggesting a tunable pathway for modulating
domain morphology. This trend allows for greater control over the
Janus-like character of the monolayer through the manipulation ofxPEG, where Janus character increases asxPEGapproaches unity. The ability to reproducibly
tune Janus character via ligand composition offers a valuable design
principle for tailoring interfacial properties in nanoparticle-based
systems. These findings indicate that while entropy promotes mixing
of the two ligand types, the dominant enthalpic contributionsnamely
DDT crystallization and PEG dipole interactionsdrive the system
toward phase separation. In our simulations, the longer DDT ligands
crystallize on flat facets of the Au NP, whereas the short PEG ligands
cluster in the remaining space available on the Au NP surface prioritizing
facets and edges over surface area near vertices. This preferential
spatial organization enhances the Janus-like localization of the two
ligands asxPEGincreases and the size
of the DDT domain becomes increasingly small.

We extended the integrated framework introduced
in our previous
publications which combines MALDI-MS experiments with CBMC simulations
to investigate the self-assembly of hydrophobic dodecanethiol (DDT)
and hydrophilic 2-ethoxyethane-1-thiol (PEG) ligands in ultrasmall
Au NP monolayers. This framework has been shown to accurately quantify
and identify key trends in monolayer morphology that provide a foundation
for the theory-guided design of nanomaterials.,Direct
quantitative comparisons between the experimental and simulated MALDI-MS
spectra revealed good agreement throughout the entire range of PEG-DDT
surface ratios in the study. This agreement gives us additional confidence
in the computational results of the PEG-DDT monolayers, which show
patchy to Janus monolayer morphologies. The analysis of the simulated
monolayer structures yield proportional relationships between the
PEG-DDT surface ratios and their patch sizes. Hence, our finding demonstrates
the ability to tune patch sizes in amphiphilic monolayers by controlling
the surface ratio of the two ligand species. Our work represents a
critical step forward in the synthesis and design of NPs with adsorbed
amphiphilic monolayers possessing well-defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic
ligand domains. Such advances open the door to engineering PEGylated
NPs that could improve the performance of biocompatible sensors and
enable drug-delivery applications.
