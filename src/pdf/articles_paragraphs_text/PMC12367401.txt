Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a technically challenging procedure1. Inadequate visualization of submucosal tissue planes is one of the major technical challenges. Recently, traction devices to facilitate ESD procedures have attracted an increasing interest23. Nevertheless, many traction methods are constrained by a fixed traction direction and force. Herein, we report a novel traction method—cholangioscope (Fig. 1a) combined with biliary forceps (Fig. 1b), which can flexibly adjust the traction direction and force.

The traction device used in the ESD procedure:acholangioscope andbbiliary forceps.

A 69-year-old man presented with a 20 × 28-mm laterally spreading tumor in the rectum (Fig. 2a), and ESD was conducted (Video 1). Initially, a circumferential mucosal incision was made using a DualKnife (Anrei, Hangzhou, China) (Fig. 2b). The cholangioscope (Leinzett, Hangzhou, China) was subsequently used to intubate the rectum and reach the lesion site, after which biliary forceps (Leinzett, Hangzhou, China) were inserted into the cholangioscope through the biopsy channel. During dissection, the proximal edge of the mucosal flap was grasped by biliary forceps, and then, the cholangioscope was adjusted to apply traction to the dissection plane (Fig. 2c). The biliary forceps can regrasp the flap and change the traction direction and force by adjusting the cholangioscope to improve visualization of the submucosal plane and enhance exposure of the submucosal tissue (Fig. 2d). Finally, the submucosal dissection was safely completed without any adverse events. The defect after dissection (Fig. 2e) was closed by the use of through-the-scope clips. The total time of complete en bloc resection was 25 minutes. Histopathology revealed an adenoma with a negative margin (Fig. 2f). In conclusion, cholangioscope combined with biliary forceps can provide adequate visualization of the submucosa during dissection and is a safe and effective traction method for the ESD procedure.
