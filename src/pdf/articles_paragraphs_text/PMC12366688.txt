Stars are born in a variety of environments that determine how they gather gas to achieve their final masses. It is generally believed that disks are ubiquitous around protostars as a result of angular momentum conservation and are natural places to grow planets. As such, they are proposed to be the last link in the inflow chain from the molecular cloud to the star. However, disks are not the only form that inflows can take. Here, we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar. These flows are massive enough to feed the central unresolved region at a rate suf ficient to quench the feedback effects of the young massive star.

Infalling streamers may play a role as critical as disks in delivering gas to fuel the growth of young high-mass stars.

Stars form in the densest regions of turbulent and magnetically threaded molecular clouds, namely, cores. Typical cores have sizes of 2000 to 4000 astronomical units (au) (1–4) and consist of an envelope that feeds a central disk (5) formed as a result of the conservation of angular momentum. Close to the center, a stellar system eventually forms, fed by gas flowing through these structures. One important consequence of the interplay among the magnetic field, turbulence, and self-gravity is the development of anisotropic infall in the form of streams that can promote the transport of gas to the disk and subsequently to the star(s) (6,7). Infall streams (hereafter, streamers) have been observed across several star formation mass and spatial regimes (8–14), yet their role is still under debate (15,16). In addition to the anisotropic infall described above, other paths for the formation of streamers include cloudlet capture (17,18) and star-cloud interactions (19).

In the high-mass regime, the high luminosity hinders or even reverses spherically symmetric infall, and nonspherical accretion is needed to allow the star to grow by letting the stellar radiation and winds to escape through the polar directions (20–24). Here, we show the case of the Galactic high-mass core G336.018-00.827 [hereafter, G336 ALMA1; distance of 3.1 kpc; (25)] where nonspherical accretion seems to be attained predominantly from streamers without the presence of a large Keplerian disk as those detected in other regions [e.g., (26,27)]. Previous Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3-mm observations at∼0.05″ resolution revealed the presence of three continuum peaks, two of which are connected to streamers. These streamers bring gas from 2000-au scales down to a radius of 400 au, which corresponds to the radius at which the centrifugal and gravitational forces balance each other (hereafter, centrifugal radius), at a rate of roughly10−4solar mass (M⊙)year−1(28). A central mass of 10M⊙was determined in (28) from the modeling of the gas kinematics under an infalling and rotating envelope [IRE; (29)]. Those observations showed that streamers can account for a substantial part of the total infall rate from the large-scale envelope down to few 100-au scales.

To investigate the small-scale structure of this region and to search for the presence of an accretion disk, we conducted high-resolution [28 milliarcseconds (mas) or 86 au,Fig. 1A; see Materials and Methods] observations of the 1.3-mm continuum and several molecular lines. The system consists of a single central source (hereafter, ALMA1) of deconvolved size [full width at half maximum (FWHM)] 39 mas (121 au; see Materials and Methods), connected to the blueshifted streamer to the west. To the east, no clear connection to the redshifted streamer is observed in the continuum, only faint emission is revealed. Extended continuum emission is observed to the north of the source over the 10σdetection level (purple region inFig. 1A), which may be associated with free-free emission of a jet (see below). While we detect continuum emission from the three density peaks and the northern streamer previously seen at 50-mas resolution, we detect no conventional disk at the centrifugal radius from the central peak. Here, we define a conventional disk as an overdense structure of projected elliptical shape with a Keplerian velocity gradient due to rotation, such as those found toward low-mass sources from the eDsik collaboration (27) or toward high-mass sources like GGD 27-MM1 (12) and G11.92 (30). Although a velocity gradient does indicate rotation around the central source (see below), this gradient is found only in the gas associated with the streamers, and not in a flattened, symmetric disk structure. The unresolved central source could contain a disk or another overdense structure (e.g., a torus). Disk candidates with similar small sizes and extended spiral-like emission were identified in W51 [radii<500au with W51e8 smaller than 75 au; (31)], but no infall signatures were detected along the spiral structures. Other high-mass sources [e.g., AFGL 4176 mm1 (32) and Sgr C (33)] have also shown substructures similar to spiral arms within a disk (∼1000-au radius in the case of AFGL 4176 mm1 and Sgr C), and the continuum emission of the low-density disk can be identified. However, this is not the case in the continuum of G336 ALMA1.

(A) The green triangle corresponds to the central source, ALMA1. The contour levels are −3, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80×σrmswithσrms=28μJybeam−1. The blue- and redshifted streamer directions are shown by the curves for the corresponding color. The purple region shows extended emission from ALMA1 likely tracing a jet component. (B) The first moment velocity map with respect to the systemic velocity [−47.2kms−1; (59)] is accompanied by colored curves describing the trajectory and velocity distribution of the streamlines of a rotating and infalling envelope. The blue streamer is divided in two streamlines. The outer component presents a refinement of the streamline model presented in (28), while the inner component corresponds to a similar model but with a streamline origin at the centrifugal radius and close to the midplane (see Materials and Methods). The contours are the same as in (A). The pink ellipse correspond to a circle of radius 500 au, i.e., the centrifugal radius, projected in plane of the sky assuming an inclination angle of 65° with respect to the line of sight. Synthesized beam sizes for the continuum and first moment maps are shown in the bottom left corner. ICRS, International Celestial Reference System.

In addition to the continuum morphology, molecular line emission from hot methanol (CH3OHJKa,Kc=183,15−174,14A,vt=0,Eu/kB=447K;Fig. 1B) also shows a clear connection between the blueshifted streamer and the central young star ALMA1. Like the continuum emission, the methanol emission shows no evidence for a large disk (see also fig. S1). This emission reveals a change in the velocity gradient roughly at the position of the centrifugal radius [updated to 500 au from 400 au (28); see Materials and Methods], which could result from a change in the flow direction and/or in the velocity distribution (see alsoFig. 2). In the following analysis, we will refer to the blueshifted streamer sections within and outside a radius of 500 au from ALMA1 as the inner and outer blue streamers, respectively. The different components of the system are summarized in the sketch inFig. 3A. While methanol emission from the redshifted streamer may indicate a connection with ALMA1, we exclude it because of contamination from the outflow.

The green solid line corresponds to the line of sight Keplerian velocity at the same deprojected distance to the central source, ALMA1. Similarly, the dotted green line corresponds to a Keplerian rotation and infall velocity distribution, while the dashed line corresponds to the IRE velocity distribution (29). The inner and outer blue streamer models inFig. 1Bare shown in blue dot-dashed lines. The lower abscissa scale corresponds to the distance along the path used to calculate the PV diagram slice (shown inFig. 1) with the package pvextractor, while the upper one corresponds to the radial distance to ALMA1 assuming that the slice points are located in the midplane (see Materials and Methods). The midplane is assumed to be inclined 65° with respect to the line of sight. The vertical light blue line marks the position of the centrifugal radius,Rc= 500 au.

(A) Schematic representation of the observations with the different components labeled by the tag with the respective color. The green arrows point in the direction of the outflows, while the blue-to-red arrow indicated the rotation direction. The scale at the bottom indicates the radius of ALMA1, the centrifugal barrier radius and the centrifugal radius from left to right, respectively. (BandC) The two scenarios proposed to explain the origin of the shocks in the blue streamer. Green arrows represent the background infall from the less dense envelope.

To understand what is happening in the western (blueshifted) inner streamer, we model the infall from the centrifugal radius inward with the same rotating and infalling streamlines equations of (34) [see also (8) for their implementation]. The model describes relatively well the trajectory of the inner blue streamer (Fig. 1B), assuming that it is in the midplane defined by the rotation axis (Fig. 3A) with an initial radial velocity close to zero (0.1 km s−1; see Materials and Methods). However, the velocity profile does not match, as it underestimates the velocity along the line of sight. We compare the observed position-velocity (PV) diagram (Fig. 2) along the spine of the blueshifted streamer (shown in blue inFig. 1A) with the streamline models (inner and outer) and three other velocity distributions (see equations in Materials and Methods): Keplerian rotation, Keplerian rotation with free-fall infall, and the velocity distribution of an IRE (29). These distributions are evaluated at the same deprojected radial distance to ALMA1 assuming an inclination angle of 65° [(28); green lines inFig. 2]. We find that Keplerian rotation and IRE are the best-fitting models for the inner blue streamer velocity, with Keplerian rotation providing a better fit to the peaks at each offset value. A Keplerian velocity is expected after the formation of a disk, once the infalling gas has settled [e.g., (35)]. In the case of the IRE model, the radial distances between ALMA1 and the spine of the inner blue streamer, i.e., between the centrifugal radius and the centrifugal barrier (the radius at which the kinetic energy is converted into rotational energy, and equal to half the centrifugal radius), correspond to a transition zone where the relative contribution of infall decreases and rotation increases as the radius decreases. Thus, the observed velocities are likely dominated by a rotational component as expected for a disk-like structure. For the outer blue streamer, Keplerian rotation alone cannot explain the observed velocity distribution, which can only be explained by the contribution of the infall as shown by the other velocity distributions as well as by the streamer modeling (Figs. 1Band2).

Along the streamer, the position of the projected velocity change (Fig. 2) roughly coincides with the location of the western continuum peak (seeFig. 1and fig. S2). On that location, the emission could be enhanced by an increase in the column density, as implied not only by the methanol line emission but also by an increase in temperature due to shocks. To explore shocked gas, we inspect the SO3ΣJK=65−54emission in its ground (Eu/kB=35K) and vibrationally (Eu/kB=1634K) excited states (see Materials and Methods).Figure 4shows blue- and redshifted emission around the systemic velocity. We find that, in the ground state, SO traces mostly gas in the outflow; in particular, it traces the base of a parabolic bipolar outflow cavity (see also figs. S3 and S4). Additionally, extended blueshifted emission is observed to the north of ALMA1, this coincides with the continuum emission in that direction (marked in purple inFig. 1A). Hence, that continuum emission may be associated with a jet rather than another feature located in the midplane or envelope. Note that blue- and redshifted emission is detected towards both outflow directions, probably indicative of a rotating outflow. Based on the morphology of the inner blue streamer, the viewing angle is through the northern pole of the outflow system, contrary to what was assumed based on SiO outflow emission in (28).

(A) Shows the ground level (SOv= 0) emission while (B) shows the vibrationally excited one (SOv= 1). Blue and red contour levels are 3, 4, 5, …×σwith a σ = 4.8 mJybeam−1kms−1from the data with worst noise (SOv=1). The directions and approximate position of the northern and southern outflow cavities are traced by the blue and red dashed parabolas, respectively. The blue and orange arrows indicate the direction of shocked emission likely associated with a jet component. For a more detailed view of the jet/outflow components see fig. S3. The synthesized beams of the continuum (black) and SO contours (teal) are shown in the bottom left corner.

The vibrationally excited SO emission is more compact than its ground state (Fig. 4) and seems to be tracing outflow and shocks around the centrifugal radius components. Contrary to the ground state, emission is observed towards the western continuum peak. Along the envelope position angle (P.A.=−55∘; see Materials and Methods), the PV diagram (Fig. 5A) shows that the emission peaks at an offset of roughly 0.05″ (155 au), which, in turn, corresponds to roughly half the offset of the continuum peaks and around the centrifugal barrier. This is inside the position where the blue- and redshifted streamers join the midplane (centrifugal radius). This may be indicative of shocks as the gas from the streamer joins the midplane and, in turn, explains the accumulation of gas at those locations (resulting in higher column densities and temperatures). To explain the nature of the shocks, we propose two alternatives summarized inFig. 3 (B and C). Both imply that the shock is produced by the interaction between the streamer and the background infalling gas (from the less dense envelope component) as the streamer reaches the midplane. InFig. 3B, the shock modifies the gas velocity and flow direction, while, inFig. 3C, the gas crosses the midplane and continues in a spiral trajectory with the change in velocity explained solely by the projected trajectory along the line of sight.

(AandB) show the vibrationally excited level (SOv= 1) and ground level (SOv= 0) emission, respectively. The gray contour levels of SO emission are −10, −5, 3, 6, 12, and 24×σwith σ = 0.3 mJybeam−1. The blue contours correspond to the IRE model and are at levels 3, 6, 12, and24×σwith σ = 1.2 mJybeam−1to match the CH3OH data (see fig. S2). The horizontal green dashed line corresponds to the systemic velocity (−47.2kms−1), and the vertical dotted lines correspond to the offsets of the continuum peaks (−0.12″ for the redshifted streamer and 0.13″ for the blueshifted one).

In this section, we estimate the mass accretion rates and timescales for building up the observed mass of the central star and show that the flow is sufficient to overcome radiative feedback and allow the star to continue to grow. The case of G336 ALMA1 shows that streamers can play an important role in feeding high-mass protostars. The continuity of the flow inward from ∼2000 to 60 au (albeit with a change in velocity distribution) may indicate that the inner blue streamer is not a feature induced by the outer blue streamer in the gas already in the midplane or in a former disk, but rather a continuation of that flow. The already large mass attained by the young star [10M⊙; (28)] implies that radiation feedback may have already begun. To continue accreting gas, the density around the source has to be high enough to quench the feedback from the young star or the momentum carried by the streamers has to be high enough to overcome the feedback in the absence of a disk [e.g., (24)]. Considering that accretion is still taking place, as implied by the presence of jets/outflows, we estimate an upper limit for the accretion rate from the free-fall time and lower limit under viscous accretion. The time that it would take to accrete the mass in the potential 60-au disk around the young star (ALMA1) is in the range of∼25to104years (see Materials and Methods). Similarly, we estimate the amount of time that it would take the streamers to achieve the same central mass. For a free-falling flow, it would take the streamers∼150years to replenish the gas in ALMA1. This is one order of magnitude longer than the free-fall time of ALMA1 (∼25years). On the other hand, for a viscous flow, the replenishing time and accretion times are of the same order of magnitude (103to104years) for the same viscosity parameter value. Given that the infall is likely neither free-falling nor viscous, the real values should be in between our estimates. These results indicate that the gas around the star in ALMA1 could be depleted faster than the streamers can replenish it in the free-fall case scenario. To demonstrate that, even in this scenario, the streamers can overcome the stellar feedback, we calculate the magnitude of the forces exerted by the radiation field of the central young star and that of the blueshifted streamer inflow. We obtain that the blueshifted streamer can exert a force two orders of magnitude higher than that of the radiation field red (see Materials and Methods). Thus, the blueshifted streamer can likely overcome the radiation pressure (at a radius of 61 au) and eventually feed the young star. In addition, the redshifted streamer, although less massive, can still provide gas at a rate roughly half that of the blueshifted streamer.

We estimate masses between 0.3 and 0.6M⊙for each inner streamer (see Materials and Methods). These masses and the resulting infall rates (∼10−3M⊙year−1) are an order of magnitude or higher than those found in streamers feeding low-mass star [e.g., (36–38)]. G336 ALMA1 is located at the center of a massive clump of 350M⊙[(39); previously classified as a core]. While a small (Keplerian) disk similar to those inferred in W51 (31) and in G345 (40) can still be the last link to feed the star, its mass is comparable to or lower than that of the streamers. It is thus the large mass of the reservoir, at large scales, and the streamers, at small scales, that have allowed the formation and continuous feeding of the young high-mass star at the center of ALMA1.

G336.018-0.827 was observed with the 12-m ALMA as part of the Digging into High-mass Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) project on July 2019 (ID: 2017.1.00237.S) and as part of follow-up observations on July 2023 (ID: 2022.1.00700.S). Detailed description of the former dataset is described in (28), suffice to say that the observations were performed in configuration C-8 with 45 antennas. The most recent observations were performed with the C-9 array configuration with 49 antennas. The delivered calibrated data were combined with the DIHCA observations, and self-calibration was performed on the combined dataset. Only phase self-calibration with increasingly smaller solution intervals was used to produce the final calibrated data.

Both observations were made with a channel width of 488.281 kHz, which corresponds to a spectral resolution (two channels) of ∼1.5 km s−1, but their spectral coverage is slightly shifted. Hence, the spectral windows were trimmed down to the overlapping ranges and the channels aligned using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) (41) task CVEL. We then followed the procedure described in (42) [GoContinuum; (43)] to obtain line-free visibilities and continuum subtracted visibilities. The continuum was imaged using the TCLEAN task with the Hogbom deconvolver, automasking, and a Briggs weighting with robust parameter of 0.5. The continuum is cleaned down to a threshold of1.25σwith the noiseσdetermined by TCLEAN. The resulting continuum angular resolution is0.031×0.025″ (P.A. = 57.5°;96×78au) and noise level is 28 μJy beam−1.

To optimize the computing resources, we only imaged selected molecular lines with the automasking routine YCLEAN (44,45): CH3OHJKa,Kc=183,15−174,14A,vt=0(233.795666 GHz,Eu/kB=447K); SO3Σv=0JK=65−54(219.949442 GHz,Eu/kB=35K); and SO3Σv=1JK=65−54(218.3238577 GHz,Eu/kB=1634K). Given the larger spatial extent of some of these lines, we use the multiscale deconvolver with scales of 0, 5, 15, and 25 and Briggs weighting with robust parameter of 2 to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the lines. The median resolutions of the cubes are0.041×0.037″ (P.A. = 47°;127×115au) for CH3OH,0.045×0.041″ (P.A. = 32°;140×127au) for SOv= 0, and0.044×0.040″ (P.A. = 47°;136×124au) for SOv= 1. Their noise levels are between 1.1 and 1.3 mJy beam−1per channel.

To set the central source position, we first fit a Gaussian to the ALMA1 continuum emission within a region of radius of 50 mas with the CASA task IMFIT. The central source right ascension is16h35m09.2585s±0.0002sand its declination is−48∘46′77.661″±0.002″from the fit. The region has a deconvolved size (FWHM) of43.5±8.6mas×35.1±8.6mas(P.A. = 28°), resulting in a geometric mean size of39±6mas(121 au). The flux density of the Gaussian is 7.7 ± 1.1 mJy.

The higher angular resolution of the most recent observations allows us to refine the parameters of the models describing the rotation and infall along the streamers presented in (28) (outer component inFig. 3A). In particular, the observations allow us to pinpoint the position of the centrifugal radius and centrifugal barrier. We use the streamline model for an IRE described in (34) and implemented by (8) with the same parameters as (28) but varying the centrifugal radius, initial polar angle, and initial azimuthal angle for the outer blue streamer. Parameter ranges are summarized inTable 1. It is worth noting that all the angles are in the velocity_tools package standard, which can be differ with other implementations of the (34) equations. In this standard, the outflow position angle required to match the rotation direction is 210° and the inclination angle is 25° (defined as 0° for the edge-on configuration). Olguinet al. (28) found that centrifugal radii between 400 and 600 au can fit relatively well the rotation and infalling motions; hence, we vary the parameters within this range with 50-au steps. Together with the stellar mass, the radii values explored are constrained well enough that they can match the velocity distribution; hence, here, we determine the models that best match the shape of the streamer by visual inspection. While a centrifugal radius of 500 au fits the morphology of the streamer better (particularly the northernmost position of the80σcontour level inFig. 1B) than the previous value of 400 au, equally good matches can be obtained with a centrifugal radius between 450 and 550 au. Same as in (28), an initial polar angle of 80° reproduces the position of the streamers the best, while the best initial azimuthal angle is 55° with models with ±5° angles matching the spine (10σlevel and higher) relatively well. This result is plotted over the streamer in the first moment map inFig. 1B(outer streamline model) and the PV diagram inFig. 2. For the redshifted streamer, we did not perform any further optimization other than updating the centrifugal radius (seeFig. 1B).

The model parameters are centrifugal radius (rc), initial polar angle (θ0), initial azimuthal angle (ϕ0), and initial radial velocity (vr0). The values in brackets indicate the parameter steps in the same units.

Additionally, we use the IRE model in FERIA (29) to compare with the PV diagram in (28) with the updated centrifugal barrier (250 au). Figure S2 shows a good agreement between the model and observation. Note that, in (28), the blueshifted outflow defining the rotation axis in FERIA standard was assumed to point southward, resulting in an envelope P.A. of 125° based on the line roughly passing through the three continuum peaks. However, the blueshifted outflow and the geometry of the streamer indicate that the rotation axis points northward. We thus update the P.A. to −55° and adapt the rotation direction accordingly.

The streamline model of (34) describes the trajectory of a particle under a gravitational potential with an initial radial velocity to the center of the potential and angular momentum. To describe the motions of the blueshifted streamer, we assume an additional system inside the centrifugal radius (inner component inFig. 3A) where the trajectory is in the midplane orthogonal to the rotation axis, i.e., the trajectory of the large-scale streamer changes once it joins the midplane. Note that this is an approximation to match the end of the outer blue streamer with the inner streamer. In the inner system, the initial radius where the particle falls,r0, is given by the centrifugal radius, while the final radius (which would correspond to a second centrifugal radius),rf, is set to 200 au (the inner radius inFig. 2). We also tried a final radius of 60 au (the radius of the central continuum source), but we could not find a model that matches the inner streamer shape. Because the model (34) is undefined at a polar angle of 90°, we set the initial polar angle to 89° and tried values of 85° and 88° in case there were models that do not converge at 89°. We varied the initial azimuthal angle and initial radial velocity (Table 1). After a couple of iterations, the initial azimuthal angle range was limited to 140° to 155°. An angle of 145° matches the end position of the outer blue streamer the best (Fig. 1B). Models with initial velocity of 0 km s−1do not converge at 89°, but values closer to 0 kms−1reproduce the shape of the inner blue streamer the best; hence, we select a value of 0.1 kms−1. A similar fit can be obtained by a model with 0 kms−1but initial polar angle of 88°. The central mass,Mc, was set to 10M⊙(28).

withGbeing the gravitational constant. Thus, a larger angular velocity, like the one required to match the velocity distribution at the initial radius of the streamer inFigs. 1Band2, would not match the extent of the streamer under the assumptions above.

The flux densities,Sν, of ALMA1 is 7.7 mJy (from Gaussian fit, see above); the blueshifted inner streamer (measured roughly around the 20σcontinuum level within the 500 au radius) is 20.7 mJy; and the redshifted streamer is 11.1 mJy (measured roughly around the 10σcontinuum level; all measured in the primary beam corrected image). The region files used for the calculation of the inner streamer masses are publicly available online (see Data and materials availability). The region files used for the calculation of the inner streamer masses are publicly available online (see Data and materials availability) We use a single temperature of 100 K for the central source and streamers, which corresponds roughly to the dust brightness temperature. In the optically thick regime, the gas temperature would be equal to the brightness temperature. This temperature is slightly higher than the average temperature of the outer streamers found by (28) (93 K for the blue shifted streamer). Note that the gas in ALMA1 is likely hotter than the streamers, making its mass an upper limit under the optically thin approximation. The resulting masses are 0.24M⊙for the gas in ALMA1, 0.6M⊙for the inner blue streamer, and 0.3M⊙for the redshifted streamer.

The velocityvrcorresponds to the Keplerian velocity (Eq. 2). For marginally unstable protostellar disks during the main accretion phase and at high accretion rates,αranges between 0.1 and 1 (49,50). The molecular weight per gas particle is μ = 2.33 (51). For the central region, the free-fall time is∼25years, and the viscous time range is∼103to104years forr=Rcand α = 1 and 0.1, respectively. Similarly, the viscous accretion time is∼104to105years at the centrifugal radius (500 au).

wherelis the length of the inner streamer and assumed to be 500 au in this case. This gives infall rates of1.6×10−3M⊙year−1and0.9×10−3M⊙year−1for the inner blue- and redshifted streamers, respectively. These are roughly one order of magnitude higher than the infall rate from the outer streamers estimated by (28) using their free-fall time and other methods including the velocity distribution (∼10−4M⊙year−1). For the viscous accretion timescale, the infall rate ranges betweenMd/tacc∼10−6and10−5M⊙year−1for each streamer. Therefore, it would take the blueshifted streamer between∼150years (free-fall) and∼103to104years (viscous) to accumulate the same amount of gas in the putative disk in ALMA1. Note that the latter assumes that the streamers are in a disk, which is likely not the case. Similarly, it would take the redshifted streamer between∼280years to104to105years to replenish the gas mass in ALMA1, while, together, it would take∼102to104years to do the same.

To complement these calculations, we make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the forces exerted by radiation and the inflow. Following (53), the force exerted by the young star radiation field assuming spherical symmetry and absorption of all the stellar radiation by the dust is of the order ofL/cwithLthe luminosity andcthe speed of light, while the force from the inflow under spherical accretion is of the order ofM˙vinwithvinbeing the velocity of the flow. Assuming that the luminosity of the clumpL=2.5×104L⊙(25) is dominated by G336 ALMA1, the force exerted by the source radiation field is of the order of 1022N. On the other hand, the velocity of the flow at the impact position (radius of 61 au) is ~17 km s−1fromEq. 3; thus, the force exerted by the inflow resulting from the blueshifted streamer is of the order of 1024N.

Data and materials availability:All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials. This paper makes use of the following ALMA data: ADS/JAO.ALMA#2017.1.00237.S and ADS/JAO.ALMA#2022.1.00700.S ALMA is a partnership of ESO (representing its member states), NSF (USA), and NINS (Japan), together with NRC (Canada), MOST and ASIAA (Taiwan), and KASI (Republic of Korea), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. The Joint ALMA Observatory is operated by ESO, AUI/NRAO, and NAOJ. The original observational data are available through the ALMA archive located athttps://almascience.nao.ac.jp/aq/with the program codes listed above. The delivered data were reduced and further processed with CASA (41), with their calibration scripts available through the ALMA archive. The underlying maps and models needed to reproduce the figures and results and data cube cutouts are publicly available at Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/15354559), while the scripts and auxiliary files necessary to reproduce these data, results, and figures are publicly available at Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/15362023). The data necessary to produce fig. S2 is available in (28). Continuum and continuum-subtracted visibilities were produced with GoContinuum [v3.0.0; (43)]. The data cubes were produced using YCLEAN (44,45). Streamline models were calculated using the Python package velocity_tools (v1.1) available athttps://github.com/jpinedaf/velocity_tools, while IRE models were calculated using FERIA (29) available athttps://github.com/YokoOya/FERIA(https://doi.org/10.1088/1538-3873/ac8839). PV diagrams were calculated using pvextractor available athttps://pvextractor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html. This work made use of Astropy (www.astropy.org): a community-developed core Python package and an ecosystem of tools and resources for astronomy (54–56). The scientific color maps vik and lipari (57) are used in this study to prevent visual distortion of the data and exclusion of readers with color-vision deficiencies (58).
