Rapid urbanization in China profoundly impacts terrestrial carbon stocks, necessitating robust assessment and prediction frameworks. This study employed a coupled InVEST-PLUS model to analyse carbon stock dynamics and the economic value of carbon sinks in Jiangsu Province, a rapidly urbanizing region. We evaluated historical changes (2000–2020) and projected future impacts (2020–2040) under various land-use planning scenarios and climate emission pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5). Our findings reveal a significant historical carbon stock decrease of 14.34 Tg in Jiangsu Province between 2000 and 2020, with 86.11% of this reduction occurring from 2000 to 2010. The conversion of cropland to built-up land emerged as a critical driver of carbon loss and diminished carbon sink economic value. Projections indicate that Cropland Protection (CP) and Ecological Protection (EP) scenarios are crucial for mitigating these declines. Integrating climate change, we found carbon sink losses escalated stepwise with increasing emission intensity, with soil carbon losses consistently exceeding those from vegetation. Policy effectiveness varied, with the EP scenario performing optimally under low emission conditions. This study underscores the urgent need for strategic land-use planning to safeguard carbon stocks and economic stability, thereby contributing to carbon neutrality goals.

Propelled by the real estate market and land-based fiscal policies, China’s economic development has profoundly reshaped its national spatial configuration, consequently affecting the extent and ecological service functions of natural areas1,2. Over the more than two decades since the marketization of real estate, China has undergone a rapid urbanization phase, with the urbanization rate of the resident population increasing from 36.09% in 2001 to 63.89% in 2020, and land urbanization rate based on the proportion of land cover in built-up areas has grown from 0.25 to 0.63%. Natural ecosystems such as cropland, forests, and grasslands have been supplanted by built-up land, including residential, industrial, and transportation areas3. According to the National Land Use Status Survey Bulletin, in 2020, China’s cropland area was 1,278.67 billion square metres (m²), a reduction of 191,333.14 million m² compared to 1996; the forest area was 1,475.98 billion m², a decrease of 33,066.34 million m² since 1996; and the grassland area was 271,999.72 million m², a decline of 105,999.98 million m² from 1996. In the process of land use type change, urbanization not only leads to ecological and environmental problems such as increased exposed land surface area, decreased vegetation coverage, and increased soil erosion, but also reduces the area with ecological functions such as hydrological regulation, climate regulation, and biodiversity protection. This has caused severe damage to ecosystem services and their sustainability and recyclability4,5.

Changes in land use structure significantly impact CO2distribution and cycling, leading to increased atmospheric carbon emissions and decreased carbon sequestration in soils6–8. On one hand, land development results in the loss of carbon stocks by releasing carbon dioxide previously stored in vegetation and soil into the atmosphere, thereby elevating atmospheric CO₂concentrations9. On the other hand, land occupation further reduces the spatial extent of carbon sinks such as forests, weakening the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity. This shift leads to a greater proportion of carbon dioxide being retained in the atmosphere, thereby exacerbating climate warming and increasing the frequency of natural disasters10,11. In addition, the lag in the development of blue-green infrastructure and the increase in energy consumption during the urbanization process have led to a rise in carbon emissions, significantly exacerbating the urban heat island effect. With the proposal of the carbon neutrality target, the supply and value realization of ecological products from carbon sinks based on natural solutions have garnered significant attention12,13. Measures such as afforestation, returning cropland to forests, and grassland protection have become crucial strategies for achieving carbon neutrality, and natural solutions play an vital role in mitigating climate change, improving environmental quality, and maintaining ecological balances14,15. Moreover, nature-based carbon neutrality programs offer advantages of low cost and strong sustainability, effectively enhancing the ecological environment and providing crucial support for biodiversity conservation16. Therefore, assessing land carbon stock during the urbanization stage is essential for understanding the impact of urbanization on the carbon cycle and formulating scientific carbon reduction policies. Additionally, predicting changes in land use and carbon stock can guide the urbanization process towards a more sustainable and low-carbon direction. Emphasizing the role of carbon sinks based on natural scenarios in achieving carbon neutrality is imperative for attaining the goal of carbon neutrality.

Jiangsu Province is not only one of the most economically developed provinces in China but also one of the fastest urbanizing, with a population and land urbanization rate of 74.4% and 11.39% respectively in 2022. This rapid economic development has resulted in significant land use changes, with built-up land expanding by 46.6% from 2000 to 2020. These changes have profoundly impacted the urban ecological environment and carbon cycle17,18. Concurrently, Jiangsu boasts five national-level low-carbon pilot cities, dedicated to exploring the low-carbon economy in industrialization and urbanization. In response to the dual-carbon target, Jiangsu has implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions in recent years. Despite these efforts, the province continues to face significant challenges in energy conservation and carbon reduction, requiring transformation and upgrading. As a vital engine of national economic development, Jiangsu’s carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets are crucial for China’s overall achievement of carbon neutrality. Analyzing the changes in carbon stock during Jiangsu’s urbanization process is essential for developing scientifically sound carbon neutrality targets. This study focuses on Jiangsu Province as the study area, utilizing land use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020 to estimate changes in regional ecosystem carbon stocks and the economic value of carbon sinks over the past two decades. The carbon stock module of the InVEST model19is employed for these estimations. Furthermore, the paper predicts Jiangsu Province’s ecosystem service carbon stock function in 2040 using multi-scenario simulations of the PLUS model20. This research aims to provide a scientific basis for achieving the regional dual-carbon goal.

Jiangsu Province (116°21′−121°56′E, 30°45′−35°08′N) lies in the lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and borders the Yellow Sea to the east (Fig.1). Covering a total area of 107,200 square kilometres, the province is primarily composed of expansive alluvial plains in the lower Yangtze and Huai River basins, accounting for 69% of the total area. Most regions have an elevation of less than 20 m above sea level. Jiangsu is rich in water resources, with a dense water system and numerous lakes. The Yangtze River stretches 433 km from west to east across the province, while the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal runs 718 km from north to south. The coastline is 957 km long. Water surfaces account for 16.8% of the province’s area, with lakes making up 6%. Coastal mudflats cover 3,800 square kilometres, and wetlands span 28,200 square kilometres. Specifically, the average annual rainfall from 2000 to 2020 was 1105.50 mm, and the average annual sunshine duration ranges from 1,400 to 3,000 h. By the end of 2022, the built-up area in the province reached 4,916 square kilometres, the forested area totalled 15,600 square kilometres, with a forest coverage rate of 15.2%. Meanwhile, the regional GDP is 12.29 trillion yuan, the permanent population is 85.15 million, and the per capita GDP exceeds 20,000 US dollars, reaching the level of primary developed countries.

The module employs land use type as the assessment unit, utilising raster overlay to assess the carbon stock of terrestrial ecosystems. This is based on regional land use/cover information and carbon density data, with input data including land use status and carbon density. The land use type data presented in this paper originates from the Resource and Environment Science and Data Centre of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn), with a resolution of 30 m×30 m. This data product is a land use data product with relatively high classification accuracy in China at present. In this paper, the land were reclassified into six classes: cropland, forest, grassland, water, built-up land and unused land (sandy land, saline land, marshy land, bare land, etc.) by ArcGIS software processing.

The PLUS model (Patch-generating Land Use Simulation Model) is a model developed by China University of Geosciences to simulate future land use changes based on raster data and transformed probabilities, which is advantageous in explaining the mechanism of land use changes and simulating the complex evolutionary processes of multiple land classes more accurately26–28. The model mainly consists of two modules: a rule mining framework based on Land Expansion Analysis Strategy (LEAS) and a Cellular Automata Model (CARS) based on multi-class stochastic patch seeds29.

LEAS is trained and analysed by extracting samples of various types of land use that have been transformed into each other between the two periods of land use data. This is done in order to identify the pattern of change and characteristics of land use types. Subsequently, the Random Forest algorithm is utilised to calculate the expansion of diverse land use types and to identify the underlying driving force factors. Furthermore, the probability of the development of various land use types is determined based on the relationship between the changes in different land use types and the multiple driving force factors within the specified time period.

In Eq. (9),Xis a vector consisting of driving factors;Mis the number of decision trees;dtakes the value of 0 or 1, with 1 indicating that other land use types can be transformed into land use typek, and 0 indicating that other land types can not be transformed into land typek;is the land use prediction type calculated when the decision tree isn;is the exponential function of the decision tree;is the probability of growth of land use typekat space celli.

In this study, 14 land use change drivers (Table2), such as elevation, slope, average annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil type, soil erosion, distance to rivers, GDP, population density, distance to railways, distance to motorways, and distance to county government offices, are comprehensively selected to calculate the development probability of land use types in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020, and the development probability of land use types in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020 is obtained by MarkovChain calculation to get the land use demand of each type in 2040.

Based on the complex challenges of future land use in Jiangsu Province and the national and local development strategies, this study constructs four representative land use development scenarios: urban development (UD), natural evolution (NE), cropland protection (CP) and ecological protection (EP) scenarios. These scenarios not only take into account the development requirements of Jiangsu Province under the “dual-carbon” target and the inherent requirements of policy documents such as the “Jiangsu Provincial Land Space Planning (2021–2035)"and the “Jiangsu Provincial Land Space Ecological Protection and Restoration Planning (2021–2035)”, but also fully incorporate the typical patterns of land use transformation in China’s rapid urbanization process. It also fully integrates the typical patterns and driving factors of land use transformation in China’s rapid urbanization process.

UD scenario: It is assumed that the future urbanization process will still be driven by land expansion, which is consistent with the rapid urbanization and land finance dependence in Jiangsu Province in the past period. In this scenario, there is no restriction on the conversion of other land types into construction land in the setting of land type transfer matrix, the probability of converting agricultural land, forests, grasslands and waters to construction land all increases by 20%, simulating the strong demand for construction land expansion. At the same time, the probability of conversion of built-up land to any other land type except farmland decreases by 30%, reflecting the irreversible nature of built-up land once it has been created and the rigid demand for farmland for urban expansion. This scenario will serve as a counterexample to highlight the significant carbon loss and ecological costs of neglecting ecospatial planning.

NE scenario: It is assumed that the probability of future land use conversions will continue the natural evolutionary trend over the period 2000–2020. This scenario reflects market-driven and historically inertia-driven land expansion patterns in the absence of additional policy intervention.

CP scenario: Based on the natural evolution scenario, the national and provincial red line for cultivated land protection is strictly adhered to. To achieve this, we strictly restrict the transfer of cultivated land, and set the existing cultivated land as forbidden to be converted into other land types to simulate the effect of the strictest cropland protection policy. The conversion probability of other land use types is then aligned with the natural evolution trend. This scenario aims to assess the changes in carbon stocks and economic values under the premise of guaranteeing food security and cropland tenure.

(1) Reduce the probability of converting farmland, forests, grasslands and waters into construction land by 30%, 50%, 20% and 20%, respectively, in order to limit the erosion of ecological space by urban sprawl. These probabilities are set based on the analysis of the loss of major ecological land types in the historical period and the expectation of the current increase in the intensity of ecological protection policies, aiming to simulate the effective control of the intensity of the conversion of ecological land to construction land.

(2) The probability of conversion of forests to grasslands is reduced by 50%, aiming to maintain forest resources with high carbon sink capacity.

(3) The probability of water and grassland being converted to forest increases by 20%, reflecting the implementation of measures such as “returning farmland to forests and fields to lakes” in ecological restoration to enhance the function of carbon sinks.

(4) The 10% increase in the probability of conversion of construction land to forest simulates the improvement of ecological space within the city, such as urban greening, ecological restoration of abandoned land and the construction of ecological corridors.

(5) In the setting of land type transfer matrix, it is forbidden to transfer forest land to construction land, but other land types such as cultivated land and grassland can be accepted. Actively promote the increase of forest land area and ensure the area of ecological land such as grassland and water area.

The above scenario simulations allow us to clearly compare the potential contribution of different land use planning strategies to the carbon neutrality target of Jiangsu Province. the UD scenario predicts that failure to enhance ecological spatial planning will result in the most significant decline in carbon stocks and loss of economic value of carbon sinks, which is undoubtedly a huge obstacle to carbon neutrality. the NE scenario serves as a baseline to reveal the continued pressure on future carbon stocks under the current trend. In contrast, the CP scenario effectively slows down the decline of carbon stocks through strict protection of cropland, highlighting the potential of agricultural landscapes in carbon sequestration and their dual contribution to food security and carbon neutrality. The EP scenario, as a representative of active ecological spatial planning, not only can better control carbon loss, but also can provide stronger ecological support and larger carbon sink increment to achieve regional carbon neutrality through active ecological restoration and sink enhancement measures, and its protection of high carbon density ecological space, such as forests, is particularly prominent. This provides a key scientific basis for Jiangsu Province to balance development and ecological protection, and effectively promote the goal of carbon neutrality in the future.

To test the reliability of the model, this study utilizes land use data from 2000 to 2010 as the foundational dataset and employs the PLUS model to predict the land use distribution for the year 2020. The predicted land use distribution is then compared with the actual land use data from 2020. This comparison yields a Kappa coefficient exceeding 0.8, indicating a high level of consistency between the model’s simulated spatial distribution of land use and the actual land use in 2020. This high Kappa coefficient suggests that, at a 30-metre resolution, the PLUS model simulation can accurately reflect the land use changes in Jiangsu Province. Consequently, the model is deemed reliable for predicting land use types in 2040.

The Moran index is a statistical tool that can be employed to assess the spatial autocorrelation of variables and quantify the degree of aggregation or disaggregation among the attributes of spatial elements30,31. The value interval of the Moran index is [−1, 1]. When the index is positive, it indicates that there is a spatial positive correlation of the variable. The closer the index is to 1, the closer the relationship between the units. When the index is negative, it indicates a spatial negative correlation. As the Moran Index approaches − 1, the spatial negative correlation of the variable becomes increasingly pronounced. At the index value of 0, it is evident that there is no spatial autocorrelation of the distribution of attribute values within the spatial phenomenon, indicating that the variable does not exhibit spatial aggregation. Spatial autocorrelation analysis encompasses both global and local spatial autocorrelation.

By comparingwith the standardised statistic Z-test values, the spatial distribution of the study area can be divided into four quadrants: high-high (H-H) agglomeration, low-high (L-H) agglomeration, low-low (L-L) agglomeration, and high-low (H-L) agglomeration. The first quadrant is designated as the “H-H” type agglomeration area, which indicates that the region with high observed values is surrounded by high values, and there is a positive driving effect. The second quadrant is designated as the “L-H” type agglomeration area, which signifies that the level of the region is low but the level of neighbouring regions is high, i.e. low values are surrounded by high values. The third quadrant is “L-L” type agglomeration area, which means that the low observation value area is surrounded by low values, and there exists a negative driving effect; The fourth quadrant is an “H-L” type agglomeration area, which indicates that the area has a high level but neighbouring areas have a low level, i.e., the low level area is surrounded by high level areas.

By analyzing the current status of carbon stocks in different regions and their surrounding environments, a scientific basis can be provided for optimizing national spatial planning. Governments and planners can more accurately formulate interventions or allocate resources, helping to avoid a “one-size-fits-all” carbon sink management strategy and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of carbon sink work through refined management.

The structural change in land use types in Jiangsu Province between the years 2000 and 2020 is particularly noteworthy. According to Table3; Fig.2, built-up land saw a significant increase, rising from 14.32 to 20.98%, which corresponds to an expansion of 6,835.30, with the most drastic expansion in Southern Jiangsu. Water area increased steadily and recovered significantly in coastal areas, from 12.83 to 14.11%, with an increase of 1,333.80. At the same time, the area of cropland, forest and grassland decreased, of which the area of cropland decreased sharply by 7,353.23and forest and grassland areas decreased by 305.12and 497.29.

Land use area and single-movement attitudes in Jiangsu province, 2000–2020.

When examining the dynamic change of land use changes, unused land exhibited the largest dynamic change, followed by built-up land. Grassland suffered the largest reduction in area, with a dynamic change of −35.72%. The relative anomaly in the dynamic change of unused land is primarily attributed to the increase in coastal wetlands in Yancheng City. Additionally, seawater erosion and salinization of certain lands contributed to the rise in unused land. However, from 2010 to 2020, there was a dramatic decrease in the area of unused land in the coastal wetlands of Yancheng City, with unused land converting back to wetland. This period also saw enhanced protection measures for wetlands, and efforts to restore and utilize saline lands were intensified.

The changes in land use in Jiangsu Province reflect a significant emphasis on water protection and ecosystem restoration. Measures such as returning cropland to lakes have effectively promoted the restoration and improvement of local ecosystems. However, the expansion of built-up land has been considerable, accompanied by a noticeable reduction in grassland and forest areas. This trend underscores the impact of rapid economic development driven by urbanization, leading to significant alterations in the land use structure. The land use policy of Jiangsu Province appears to prioritize construction over protection. While the increased supply of built-up land has contributed significantly to regional economic development, it has come at the cost of ecological damage. The expansion of construction land around the Taihu Lake basin, together with the discharge of wastewater from urban and industrial construction, has not only led to a serious problem of eutrophication in the water body, but also shadowed the capacity of flood storage. This highlights the challenges and trade-offs involved in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability in the region.

Further from the interconversion of land use types (Table4; Fig.3), cropland, forestland, built-up land, water and grassland were transferred into 1,109.41, 94.417,993.49, 2,161.9and 260.6. Among these changes, 7,327.57of cropland is converted to built-up land, which is the main destination of cropland transfer, indicating that urbanisation construction occupies a large amount of cropland. In particular, the relatively low development cost of cropland, the dependence of land finance on built-up land, and the lax land use change management system exacerbate the occupation of cropland by urban construction. Furthermore, the area of arable land and built-up land transferred to water reached 997.93and 694.39, respectively. This indicates that the policy of returning cropland to the lake has been implemented, that attention has been paid to the protection of water resources in the context of the rapid development of the city, and that the protection of water has become an important element in the construction of an ecological civilisation. It also shows that the water source has become an important guarantee for the development of the city, and the gathering of the population has increased the water used for living, production and ecology. In addition, changes in the value structure of industries may have led to land-use conversion, with the phenomenon of digging ponds to raise fish on cropland being widespread due to the lower added value of agricultural cultivation and the lower labour requirements and greater returns of fishery farming.

Land transfer matrix for Jiangsu province, 2000–2020.

Transfer of land use types in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020.

This study employs the PLUS model to forecast the distribution of land use in 2040 under four development scenarios, with 2020 designated as the base period. (Table5; Fig.4).

Land use projections under four scenarios for Jiangsu Province in 2040.

Specifically, under the natural evolution scenario, land use continues the trend of change from 2000 to 2020, with a decreasing trend in cropland, forest and grassland, which decrease by 3,925.80, 42.75and 195.66respectively. Water, built-up land and unused land show an increasing trend, increasing by 138.69, 3,969.36and 56.16respectively. Among them, the most significant change is the conversion of cropland to built-up land, followed by the conversion of forest, water, etc. to built-up land and unused land. In the CP scenario, the expansion of built-up land is clearly controlled due to the restriction of conversion of arable land to other land, which is less than the NE scenario by 3,883.05, and forest is also reduced by 386.10compared to 2020. Cropland, In contrast, increases by 458.19which is mainly transferred from built-up land and forest. In the UD scenario, all types of land are converted to built-up land, and cropland, forest and grassland show a decreasing trend, decreasing respectively by 5,818.95, 271.71and 68.94. However, built-up land increases by 6,161.58. Under the EP scenario, due to the adoption of water conservation and the policy of returning cropland to forests and grasslands, the areas of forest land and watersheds increased by 107.55and 1,126.17respectively, while built-up land expanded slightly by 1,098.81.

In summary, the CP scenario has demonstrated superior performance in maintaining the area of cropland, effectively preserving agricultural lands. In contrast, the EP scenario has resulted in an increase in the area of forest and water, which possess higher ecological value. Consequently, the expansion of built-up land can be effectively controlled through the dual protection of cropland and ecology, thereby promoting the protection of the regional ecological environment. This dual approach ensures a balanced strategy that supports both agricultural sustainability and ecological preservation.

Combining the corrected carbon densities at 100 cm depth (aboveground carbon, belowground carbon, and soil carbon), and the reclassified land-use types (Cropland, Forest, Grassland, Water, Built-up land, Unused land), this paper used the Carbon module of the InVEST model to measure the total carbon stock of terrestrial ecosystems in Jiangsu Province (Table6). The carbon stock in Jiangsu Province shows a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2020, and the carbon stock in 2000, 2010 and 2020 is 915.86Tg, 903.51Tg and 901.52Tg, respectively. The total decrease of from 2000 to 2020 is 14.34Tg with an average annual decrease of 0.72Tg. In the 2000–2010 period, the carbon stock decreased the most, by 12.35Tg, accounting for 86.11% of the total reduction in carbon stocks, with an average annual reduction of 1.24Tg. During this period, the rapid expansion of built-up land in Jiangsu Province occupied part of the cropland and grassland. However the expansion of built-up land from 2010 to 2020 gradually slowed down, and the rate of carbon loss is eased accordingly. In terms of the specific composition of carbon loss, from 2000 to 2020, vegetation carbon (the sum of above-ground and below-ground biocarbon) decreased by 4.68Tg, while soil carbon decreased by 9.68Tg, and it can be found that the soil carbon pool is the main source of carbon loss, which accounted for 67.54% of the total loss of carbon and is much higher than the reduction of vegetation carbon.

Changes in carbon stocks by category in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2040.

This finding is consistent with the fact that the conversion of agricultural land to construction land is the main cause of carbon loss. As a large amount of organic carbon is stored in farmland soil, when farmland is converted to building land, the soil is hardened, vegetation is removed, and decomposition of soil organic matter is accelerated, resulting in a large amount of carbon being released to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. In contrast, the biomass carbon content of agricultural crops is relatively low, and therefore the proportion of carbon loss due to their removal is small.

The projected land use structure by the Plus model indicates that carbon stocks in 2040 will decline to varying degrees under all four development scenarios. Among them, the UD scenario exhibits the most pronounced decline in carbon stock, with a decrease of 14.65Tg. A considerable number of land use types are converted to built-up land, which leads to a significant decline in carbon stock. In contrast, the CP scenario has the least decline, with a decline of only 4.99Tg, but the forest area decreases under this scenario. The EP scenario exhibits a comparatively modest decline in carbon stocks, although still greater than that observed in the CP scenario, as there is still a lot of built-up land expansion under this scenario.

The distribution of carbon storage in the study area exhibits distinct spatial characteristics (Figs.5and6). Regions with higher carbon storage are primarily located in the southwestern part of Jiangsu Province. These areas are dominated by forest and grassland land use types, where forests and other green spaces are well protected, leading to high vegetation cover and the ability to accumulate more carbon. The highest carbon storage density in these regions reaches 11.51 t·ha−1Conversely, areas with lower carbon storage are mainly distributed in the main urban districts of various cities across Jiangsu Province. These areas are characterized by a higher degree of urbanization and are predominantly composed of construction land. Heavily influenced by human activities, their carbon storage remains at low levels.

Spatial Distribution of Carbon Stocks from 2000 to 2020.

Projected carbon stock distribution under four scenarios in 2040.

Regarding the relative changes in carbon storage across regions (Fig.7), the decrease in carbon storage is concentrated in Southern Jiangsu, mainly due to the rapid expansion of construction land encroaching on cultivated land. In Northern and Central Jiangsu, the reduction in carbon storage shows a more scattered distribution, with most of these reduced areas also stemming from urban expansion into surrounding areas. Further comparing the trends of carbon storage change across regions (Fig.8), the rate of carbon storage decline in Southern Jiangsu is significantly higher than that in Central and Northern Jiangsu. This is closely related to the rapid economic development and more extensive construction land expansion in Southern Jiangsu compared to its central and northern counterparts. Areas with increased carbon storage are primarily clustered in the eastern part of Yancheng City, forming continuous patches. This increase is mainly attributed to the expansion of water bodies, as this region belongs to the Yancheng coastal wetlands, indicating the notable effectiveness of local wetland protection efforts. At the same time, it is worth noting that while increases in watershed area, particularly the expansion of coastal wetlands, can help boost regional carbon stocks, we must be wary of potential carbon emissions associated with land drainage (land drainage) activities. Such emissions may offset (negate) or significantly diminish the carbon sink gains from wetland restoration to some extent, especially when wetlands are poorly managed or formed in an unnatural state.

Carbon stock changes and projections for Jiangsu Province.

Changes in carbon stocks in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020 by region.

Looking ahead to 2040, under four development scenarios, the spatial distribution pattern of carbon stocks remains similar to that observed between 2000 and 2020. Changes in carbon stocks are sporadically distributed over a wide area, with the exception of the west side of Jiangsu Province and the water areas. Under the EP scenario, high carbon density forests and grasslands will not be converted to built-up land. Similarly, under the CP scenario, cropland will be preserved and not converted to built-up land. These two scenarios are crucial for mitigating the decline of carbon stock in Jiangsu Province, highlighting the importance of strategic land use planning in preserving ecological balance.

The global spatial autocorrelation analyses of the spatial and temporal differences in carbon stocks under the four scenarios for Jiangsu Province in 2000, 2010, 2020, and 2040 were conducted using ArcGIS software. The Moran values ranged between 0.4 and 0.5, all of which were significantly correlated at the 0.01 level. These results indicate substantial spatial positive correlations, suggesting that the spatial distribution of carbon stocks within each region of Jiangsu Province is not random. Instead, it exhibits spatial clustering of similar values, as illustrated in Figs.9and10.

Local autocorrelation of carbon stocks from 2000 to 2020.

Local autocorrelation of carbon stocks under four scenarios in 2040.

Excluding the “insignificant” areas, the “high-high cluster” and “low-low cluster” areas are considerably larger than the “high-low cluster” and “low-high cluster” areas. These clusters account for the majority of the regional carbon stock distribution. The “high-high clusters” are primarily located in the southwestern and eastern coastal areas of Jiangsu Province, whereas the “low-low clusters” are intermittently distributed in the main urban areas.

Further analysis of the “high-high clusters” reveals a strong spatial correlation between aggregated carbon stocks and the presence of forests and grasslands. This is due to the high carbon density of these land classes. In the context of the urban development scenario, it is evident that the “high-high clusters” are densely distributed in the eastern part of Jiangsu Province. This is likely a result of the encroachment of built-up land into other land types, which has reduced the overall carbon density and diminished distinctions between other higher carbon density land types.

In terms of the composition of land conversions corresponding to changes in carbon stocks between 2000 and 2020 (Fig.11), the conversion of cropland to built-up land is the most important cause of carbon loss, decreasing by 12.6Tg, accounting for 87.5% of all carbon loss. Conversion of cropland to water and forest to cropland and built-up land are also important causes of carbon stock reduction, decreasing to 1.07Tg and 1.53Tg. This confirms the rapid economic development of Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020 and the effectiveness of ecological protection measures such as returning ploughland to lakes on the other hand.

Impact of land use change on carbon stocks from 2000 to 2020.

In terms of the specific composition of carbon loss, from 2000 to 2020, vegetation carbon (the sum of above-ground and below-ground biocarbon) decreased by 4.68Tg, while soil carbon decreased by 9.68Tg, and it can be found that the soil carbon pool is the main source of carbon loss, which accounted for 67.54% of the total loss of carbon and is much higher than the reduction of vegetation carbon. This finding is consistent with the view that the conversion of agricultural land to construction land is the main cause of carbon loss as mentioned in the paper. As a large amount of organic carbon is stored in farmland soil, when farmland is converted to building land, the soil is hardened, vegetation is removed, and decomposition of soil organic matter is accelerated, resulting in a large amount of carbon being released to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. In contrast, the biomass carbon content of agricultural crops is relatively low, and therefore the proportion of carbon loss due to their removal is small.

A further examination of the projections for the four development scenarios in 2040 (Fig.12), reveals that under the CP scenario, the conversion of cropland to built-up land is significantly reduced, with a carbon loss of 4.88Tg less than that under the NE scenario. Under the urban development scenario, built-up land encroaches heavily on cropland and forest, resulting in a combined loss of carbon stocks of 2.13Tg, which is the largest loss relative to the other scenarios. The EP scenario not only controls the carbon loss caused by the conversion of cropland to built-up land, which is 3.53Tg less than the NE scenario, but also further protects the forest and increase 107.5 km² sequestering 1.92Tg more carbon than the NE scenario. Therefore, the ecological conservation scenario can be more coordinated to protect the ecological security of the region and maintain the stability of carbon stocks.

Projected impacts of changes in land use on carbon stocks in 2040.

The economic value of carbon sinks will also fluctuate in tandem with the regional carbon stock as the land category is converted. This study employs the InVEST model to calculate the economic value of carbon sinks in Jiangsu Province, encompassing three principal elements32. The first is the social cost to be borne by each metric tonne of carbon released in the study area (), the second is the inter-annual rate of change of the carbon price in the study area (t), and the third is the market discount rate of the society for the current direct benefit (r). In this study, the InVEST model is employed to quantify the alterations in the economic value of carbon sinks caused by land category conversion for 2000–2020 and 2020–2040 under the four scenario projections. According to related studies, in this study, is determined as 100US$/t33, 449.4US$/t34, 814.74US$/t35, 1716US$/t36and 4182.22US$/t37when calculating the change in the economic value of carbon sinks in the period of 2000–2020, respectively, taking into account the variability of the price and the ease of comparison. In calculating the change in the economic value of carbon sinks from 2020 to 2040, is still determined to be the above prices, while the market discount rateris determined to be 10%38, the inter-annual ratetof change of the carbon price is assumed to be constant39taking into account the variability of the price and the ease of comparison.

According to estimates (Fig.13), between 2000 and 2020, the high value of carbon sequestration economic loss in Jiangsu Province was 63.82 billion dollars, the low value was 1.53 billion dollars, and the average value was 22.17 billion dollars. Spatially, southern Jiangsu accounted for 43% of the province’s total carbon sequestration economic losses, central Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu accounted for 21% and 36%, respectively. This corresponds to the rapid urbanization observed in southern Jiangsu over the past twenty years, where a large amount of cropland was converted to construction land.

Estimated loss of value of carbon sinks, 2000–2020(subregional).

A more detailed analysis based on the average loss shows that the carbon emission loss caused by the conversion of cropland to built-up land reached 10.3 million dollars, accounting for 11.90%. Additionally, the primary industry’s unit land GDP was 38.9 million dollars, making the carbon emission loss(49.3 million US$/km²) more than 50% of the secondary industry’s unit land GDP. Considering only carbon emissions caused by land conversion, the environmental cost of economic development is already substantial; factoring in industrial and construction sector emissions would raise these costs even further.

In order to more comprehensively consider the impacts of climate change when predicting the changes in the economic value of carbon sinks in 2040, this study further integrates climate change scenarios into the modeling setup. Specifically, this paper refers to the projected climate change data of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) for the Yangtze River Basin based on the IPCC Sixth International Coupled Model Intercomparison Program (CMIP6)40,41and obtains the simulation results of temperature and precipitation in the future (2040) under three typical carbon emission scenarios(Fig.14), namely, high-emission (SSP5-8.5), medium-emission (SSP2-4.5), and low-emission (SSP1-2.6). These climate data were used to correct the carbon intensity values of different land use types under the future scenarios, and thus to more accurately assess the changes in the economic value of carbon stocks under various land use scenarios.

Under the four ecological planning scenarios, changes in carbon sink economic value exhibited significant variations. In the CP scenario, the considerable reduction in the transfer area from farmland to built-up land led to a nearly 30% decrease in carbon sink economic value loss compared to the NE scenario. Conversely, the EP scenario, by safeguarding forest areas and promoting the conversion of farmland and water bodies to forest, resulted in an increase in carbon sink economic value. In contrast, the UD scenario experienced the most rapid decline in carbon sink economic value, incurring the highest total loss among the four development scenarios, with 86.79% of this loss stemming from the conversion between farmland and built-up land. Among combined scenarios, the low-emissions & UD scenario incurs the largest carbon sink economic loss, reaching 70.24 billion dollars; by contrast, the high-emissions & CP scenario results in the smallest loss, amounting to 0.21 billion dollars.

Considering the three emission scenarios, climate change further influenced the economic loss of carbon sinks. Taking the low emission scenario (SSP1-2.6) as an example, the carbon stock loss range under the NE scenario was from 1.10 billion to 46.12 billion dollars; this decreased to between 0.27 billion and 11.46 billion dollars for the CP scenario and from 0.58 billion to 24.25 billion dollars for the EP scenario. The UD scenario incurred the highest loss, reaching between 1.68 billion and 70.24 billion dollars. Low emission policies restrained fossil fuel consumption and the pace of urbanization, with land use primarily following natural evolution. Pressure for ecological land conversion to built-up land was minimized, and cultivated land protection and ecological protection policies proved significantly effective in carbon sink preservation. In the medium emission scenario (SSP2-4.5), economic growth was accompanied by a synchronous increase in energy consumption, leading to a tendency for land use to shift towards urban development. The probability of ecological land converting to built-up land increased, and carbon sink loss showed a linear increase with emission levels, necessitating strengthened ecological constraints to curb accelerated losses. In the high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), extreme climate events further exacerbated ecosystem vulnerability. Moreover, rapid land use expansion towards built-up areas and large-scale encroachment on ecological land resulted in an exponential increase in carbon sink loss. While the marginal benefits of policy intervention diminished, such interventions remained essential.

In all scenario combinations, the loss of soil carbon (Fig.15) significantly exceeded that of vegetation carbon (sum of above-ground and below-ground biomass). On one hand, higher emission scenarios led to a greater contribution of soil carbon to total losses. Notably, in the CP scenario under the high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), the proportion of soil carbon loss reached as high as 88.95%, reflecting a severe weakening of soil carbon sequestration capacity under extreme climatic conditions and land use pressure. This implies that even with the protection of cultivated land area, soil carbon remains at significant risk without effective management measures to counteract climate change. On the other hand, carbon stock losses exhibited notable differences between the UD and EP scenarios. In the UD scenario, the proportion of vegetation carbon loss was consistently higher, which is consistent with the direct removal of vegetation associated with urban expansion. However, soil carbon loss remained the predominant component, reaching 79.39% in the high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). Conversely, in the low emission sub-scenario (SSP1-2.6) of the EP scenario, the proportion of soil carbon loss was the lowest among all scenarios (45.60%), while vegetation carbon loss was the highest (54.40%), possibly reflecting vegetation structure adjustments inherent in ecological restoration processes. Nevertheless, in medium to high emission scenarios, the proportion of soil carbon loss in the EP scenario also increased rapidly, indicating the severe challenges posed by climate change to ecological protection efforts.

Percentage change of carbon stock in different scenarios in 2040.

Overall, carbon sink loss exhibited a stepped increase with rising SSP scenario emission intensity. Specifically, under the SSP5-8.5 extremely high emission scenario, the damage to carbon sinks from land use change approached an irreversible threshold, while the SSP1-2.6 low emission scenario offered the most favorable policy space for achieving carbon neutrality. Policy effectiveness varied across different emission scenarios. In the low emission scenario, the EP scenario more readily facilitated the overall optimization of ecosystems such as forests and water bodies. However, in the medium and high emission scenarios, the CP scenario demonstrated a more direct effect in controlling carbon sink loss by reducing the “non-agriculturalization” of cultivated land. Particularly in the high emission scenario, a dual-track strategy combining the rigid redline control of CP and the ecological restoration measures of EP is required to jointly curb carbon sink loss. From a long-term perspective, the synergy between low emission policies and strict land protection strategies (CP/EP) is key to reducing carbon sink losses. Conversely, under medium and extremely high emission pathways, the cost of carbon sink recovery increases exponentially with rising emissions, underscoring the urgency of early emission reduction and intensive land use to balance development and ecological preservation.

However, in the application of the InVEST model, the calculated changes in carbon sink economic value deviated from theoretical expectations. Under high carbon emission scenarios, the economic value loss of carbon sinks showed a minimization characteristic. Upon internal model logic validation, this anomaly was attributed to an endogenous defect, as the model currently does not support the direct measurement of carbon sink economic value loss through dynamic comparisons of carbon density across time. Further analysis revealed that the lowest carbon density (after calibration) occurred under high carbon emission scenarios, which aligns with the theoretical expectation of a negative correlation between carbon emissions and carbon density. Nevertheless, the minimal change in carbon stock in these scenarios led to an underestimation of carbon sink economic value loss. This contradiction exposes a mechanistic insufficiency in the model’s dynamic carbon stock accounting and economic value coupling calculation. Future research should aim to optimize this defect by refining the coupling algorithm for temporal carbon density changes and economic value discounting, thereby enhancing the model’s accuracy in simulating dynamic changes in carbon stocks and their economic value, providing more reliable technical support for carbon sink value assessment and low-carbon policy formulation.

The measurement of carbon stock is an essential indicator of the health of ecosystem services, which is of paramount importance to the sustainable development of a region. There are few studies on Jiangsu Province, some of which have examined past carbon stock changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomerations at a larger scale, and some of which have examined the carbon sinks of Nanjing, Jiangsu coastal ecosystems, and forests in Jiangsu Province. However, few have estimated the economic value of the sinks or forecast development scenarios for future years.

In terms of the temporal and spatial characteristics of carbon stocks, the results of existing studies are highly consistent with those of this study. For the Yangtze River Delta region, a number of studies show that its carbon stock is generally on a downward trend42further corroborating the challenges faced by ecosystem carbon sinks in the context of rapid development in the region. Specifically for Jiangsu Province, it was found that the carbon stock in coastal areas (e.g., Yancheng City) increased more significantly, while the carbon stock in Suzhou City decreased the most22. In addition, the analysis of carbon stock changes in the three coastal cities of Jiangsu Province shows that the increase was mainly concentrated in the period from 1975 to 2000, while the decline occurred from 2004 to 200743. At the city scale, the study of Nanjing, for example, also points out that its carbon stock has been decreasing44and predicts that a dual conservation scenario of ecology and arable land is the most favorable for urban development in the future24. Together, these studies reveal regional differences in carbon stock changes in Jiangsu Province, especially in the southern part of the country where carbon stocks are declining the fastest due to rapid urban expansion, while the coastal wetlands in Yancheng show a developmental trajectory from destruction to protection.

In comparison with the national average of carbon stock, Jiangsu Province accounts for about 1.07% of China’s total land area and 0.91% of China’s total terrestrial ecosystem carbon stock of 99.15Tg45in 2020.The average carbon density of Jiangsu Province corrected in this study is about 84.10 t·ha−1, which is very different from China’s average level of 107.10 t·ha−1. On the one hand, the overall forest area in Jiangsu Province is relatively limited, and the overall urbanization process is high, which leads to the overall low carbon density; on the other hand, the carbon density data in this study have been adjusted based on previous studies, and the non-field measurement is subject to a certain degree of bias. Furthermore, the carbon density of dead organisms is set to zero due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate data. These factors collectively contribute to the overall estimated carbon density being relatively low.

Further comparison with other regional studies shows that in recent years, regions have been paying more attention to ecological protection and construction, and projections for Hangzhou Bay and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region have found a rising trend in carbon stocks46,47. The findings of this study also support the reflection of the effect of ecological protection in Jiangsu Province in recent years, with a decrease in carbon stock over a 20-year period, occupying 86.11% from 2000 to 2010. However, in the prediction of future development, the changes in policy development were not controlled, and the results of the carbon stock development prediction indicate a downward trend.

This study quantifies changes in carbon stocks from land use, but does not include net greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural inputs, energy use, or other land management practices, nor does it consider the impact of economizing land use on carbon storage.

In addition, the assessment of the loss of carbon sinks does not take into account the degradation of ecosystem services, the increase in the frequency of climatic extremes, and the degradation of land and depletion of water resources, which underestimates the value of carbon stocks in the event of a decrease in carbon intensity under a high-emissions scenario.

Future research should aim to construct a more dynamic and multidimensional framework for assessing the economic loss of carbon sinks. First, a dynamic carbon price mechanism should be introduced so that carbon intensity can be automatically adjusted with cumulative emissions, marginal climate losses or policy intensity, avoiding systematic bias caused by a fixed carbon price. Second, a multi-objective loss function should be developed to incorporate ecosystem service degradation, extreme climate risks and social adaptation costs into the assessment system, breaking through the limitation of measuring carbon sink losses by a single economic value. Finally, the social cost of carbon rather than the market price of carbon should be more widely used to strengthen the internalized expression of long-term externalities and intergenerational impacts, so as to provide more forward-looking and systematic scientific support for policymaking.

Drawing upon the integrated PLUS and InVEST models, our simulation analysis of land use and carbon stocks in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020, with projections extending to 2040 under various scenarios, yields several key conclusions.

Historically, Jiangsu Province’s land use from 2000 to 2020 was characterized by a dominance of cropland and built-up land. During this period, built-up land and water areas expanded significantly by 6,835 km²and 1,333.8 km², respectively. Conversely, cropland, forest, and grassland areas experienced notable declines, decreasing by 7,353.23 km², 305.12 km², and 497.29 km², respectively. A primary trend observed was the conversion of cropland and grassland to built-up land and water, with new built-up areas predominantly located on urban peripheries, particularly in Southern Jiangsu. The ecosystem’s carbon stock in Jiangsu Province exhibited a declining trend from 2000 to 2020, with a total reduction of 14.34 Tg over the two decades. The most significant decrease, accounting for 86.11% of the total, occurred between 2000 and 2010, with a reduction of 12.35 Tg. The conversion of cropland to built-up land was identified as the primary contributor to this carbon loss.

Projections to 2040 indicate a continued decline in carbon stocks across all four development scenarios. The UD scenario shows the most substantial reduction of 14.65 Tg, primarily due to extensive land conversion to built-up areas. In contrast, the CP scenario demonstrates the smallest decline in carbon stocks, with a reduction of only 4.99 Tg, although forest area still decreases under this scenario.

The economic value of carbon sinks varied in tandem with carbon stock changes. Between 2000 and 2020, the conversion of 7,327.57 km² of cropland to built-up land resulted in a loss of 126 Tg of carbon stock, translating to an estimated economic value reduction ranging from US$5.66 billion to US$5.27 billion. This conversion represented the most significant regional carbon stock loss and the greatest damage to the economic value of carbon sinks. For 2040, projections show that the CP scenario would lead to an economic value reduction of carbon sinks totalling between US$0.93 billion and US$8.69 billion, representing only 28% of the value loss in the NE scenario. Under the EP scenario, the overall economic value loss of carbon sinks is estimated between US$1.33 billion and US$12.65 billion, with the forest’s carbon sink value being US$0.86 billion to US$8.03 billion higher than in the NE scenario.

The measurement and prediction of land carbon sinks in Jiangsu Province have revealed significant environmental costs associated with the province’s rapid economic development. This study underscores the importance of integrating nature-based solutions for carbon neutrality with the protection of ecological systems and agricultural land. In light of these findings, three key policy recommendations are proposed to guide future actions.

Firstly, it is imperative that Jiangsu Province optimises the proportion of various land types to promote ecological restoration and sustainability. Specifically, efforts should be directed towards restoring forested and grassland areas, which play a critical role in sequestering carbon. Additionally, stringent measures must be implemented to control the expansion of built-up land. This approach will not only enhance the province’s carbon sink capacity but also preserve biodiversity and maintain ecological balance.

Secondly, improving the efficiency of land use is essential for sustainable economic development. Jiangsu Province should aim to increase the GDP output per unit of built-up land. Under the principle of following the framework of total amount, strictly controlling the increment, activating the stock, optimising the structure and improving efficiency, it should vigorously promote the intensive and economical use of land by implementing the dual control of the total amount and intensity of construction land, ensuring that economic growth is both productive and environmentally sustainable. This can be achieved through innovative land management practices, technological advancements, and strategic urban planning. By maximizing the economic output of existing built-up areas, the pressure on natural and agricultural lands can be alleviated. For example, the renovation project of Huahong Industrial Park in Wuxi City has attracted upstream and downstream enterprises to move into multistorey factory buildings through “industrial chain land supply”, shared environmental protection and logistics facilities, reduced land costs, and realized three-dimensional value-added of the land and a significant increase in output value.

Thirdly, the economic potential of carbon sinks should be fully and sustainably realized. On the one hand, priority should be given to the development of economic projects related to carbon sinks, so as to transform the goals of carbon neutrality and peak carbon attainment into a new way of high-quality economic growth rather than a single economic consideration. In this process, a carbon sink compensation mechanism combining government guidance and market mechanisms should be established to stimulate the vitality of the market for carbon sink ecological products, and to promote carbon trading, eco-tourism and sustainable agricultural practices. On the other hand, satellite remote sensing, machine learning, blockchain and other technologies should be fully utilized to digitally empower the monitoring, accounting, trading and compensation of carbon sink ecological resources, so as to enhance the transparency and credibility of the carbon sinks market, and effectively guard against potential speculation or ‘greenwashing’ risks. By monetizing the benefits of carbon sinks under the ecological priority premise, Jiangsu Province can create economic incentives for conservation and sustainable land use practices.
