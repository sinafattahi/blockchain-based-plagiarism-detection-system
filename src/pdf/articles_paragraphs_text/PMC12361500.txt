Creating reliable molecular-scale electronic devices demands strong, stable connections between metal electrodes and organic molecules. A significant challenge is forming robust chemical bonds directly to gold electrodes, as gold is notoriously unreactive. Conventional methods for creating gold-carbon (Au‒C) bonds are therefore limited. Here we demonstrate an electrocatalytic solution: using an applied voltage, we inject a single electron from a gold electrode into specific organic salts (pyridinium ions). This electron transfer breaks the salt apart, generating highly reactive carbon-based radicals. These radicals spontaneously form strong, direct covalent bonds (Au‒C) with the gold surface. Using precise single-molecule measurements, we show this radical-mediated bonding creates exceptionally stable molecular junctions. Furthermore, these junctions exhibit excellent electrical conductivity across the molecule’s core structure. This high conductivity arises because the direct Au‒C bond allows efficient overlap of electron orbitals between the gold and the molecule. Our strategy provides a versatile and controlled way to build atomically precise, highly conductive interfaces between metals and organic components, advancing the design of functional molecular electronics through tailored covalent connections.

Creating robust molecular devices requires covalent electrode-molecule junctions. Here, the authors develop an electrocatalytic method using Katritzky salts to form stable Au–C bonds that exhibit high conductivity and improved robustness.

Modern microelectronics relies heavily on the properties of interfaces between two distinct components1,2, to determine the efficiency of electron transport3, as well as the overall reproducibility and device stability. For example, over the past few years, there has been increasing focus on the formation4–14of robust Au‒C covalent bonds across the interface of single-molecule devices. The chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability of Au‒C covalent bonds, along with their electronic properties, make them offer advantageous for achieving stronger coupling strength compared to other commonly used anchor groups such as amines15,16, thiols17, thiomethyls18, and pyridines19,20.

On account of the chemical inertness of Au electrodes, in-situ generation21of Au–C bonds relies on highly reactive reagents, enabling the targeted transfer of the carbon species onto the Au surface. A key aspect of this approach involves the careful installation, utilization, and eventual removal of protecting groups inπ-conjugated conducting molecules, to achieve the desired complexity with controllable reactivity. To date, many methods (Fig.1and Table1) have been developed to create an Au‒C and Si‒C bonded interface4–14,22,23. Firstly, terminal alkynes can form Au–C bonds either spontaneously8,24,25, or through tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF)-mediated deprotection of trimethylsilyl (TMS)-capped oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s9,10, with liberatedsp-hybridized carbons creating robust interfacial Au–C contacts. Secondly, structurally definedsp2-hybridized carbons enable direct Au–C bonding via nanogap-confined electrocatalysis, with representative methodologies including: (i) electroreduction of diazonium-terminated biphenylenes11,12, (ii) oxidative addition of aryl iodides to Au13, (iii) electric-field-catalyzed Au–C formation from organotin6or organoboron compounds7, and (iv) electric-field-catalyzed ring-opening of cycloparaphenylenes14.

Stable: molecules can form covalent bonds at both ends with Au electrodes. Median lethal dose (LD50): an indicator commonly used in toxicology to measure the toxicity of a substance. Environmentally friendly: the process replaces toxic substrates and enables reactions via green methods like electrocatalysis. Unstable substrate: The reactant has a short half-life and is prone to decomposition under ambient conditions. Limited substrate: the method is restricted to compounds with specific structures for constructing Au–C bonds, making it difficult to extend to diverse molecular systems.

While several other methods18,26have been reported for creating Au−molecule covalent bonding at the interfaces, achieving highly conductive Au–C interfaces remains fundamentally constrained by inherent orbital mismatching that directly limit electron delocalization efficiency. Venkataraman’s seminal studies4,5established that only thesp3-type Au–CH2–Ph linkage enables effectiveπ-system coupling at Au interfaces, enhancing conductance via frontier orbital hybridization. This mechanism aligns with prevalent synthetic strategies employing in-situ removal of tin-containing moieties, as demonstrated in prior interfacial engineering protocols (Fig.2a). However, a potential drawback of this approach is the toxicity27of organotin precursors. Besides, trace residual organotin reagent species (e.g., Bu3SnH or Bu6Sn2) readily adsorb onto Au electrodes, impeding interfacial contact withπ-conjugated wires and reducing junction formation yield significantly.

Electrocatalytic single-electron transfer (SET) activation of pyridinium scaffolds enables controlled radical generation through C–N bond homolysis28–30, establishing a synthetic platform for controlled carbon radical liberation (Fig.2band Supplementary Fig.1). The Katritzky salt—a redox-active pyridinium derivative30,31—mediates SET-driven fragmentation, producing synthetically useful radicals while regenerating pyridine byproducts. This mechanistic paradigm aligns with experimental advances in photoredox32,33and transition-metal catalysis34,35, where SET strategies unlock transformations inaccessible under mild conditions.

In this research, we employed this electrocatalytic methodology to establish covalent Au‒C connections in single-molecule devices (Fig.2c). Specifically, this methodology involves using scanning tunneling microscope-based break junction (STM-BJ), where electron36–39from the STM tip served as the reductant in SET approach to (i) initiating the homolytic fragmentation of Katritzky salts, then (ii) enabling the release of carbon radicals, and eventually (iii) leading to the in-situ formation of benzyl-type Au‒C covalent bond in single-molecule junctions. A series of Katritzky salts (Fig.2d–f) were selected as model compounds to demonstrate this strategy using STM-BJ measurements in combination with ensemble electrochemical experiments in solution. This radical-mediated bonding creates asp3-type Au–CH2–Ph linkage in single-molecule junctions with near-resonant conductance (≈ 1G0) across 8 Åπ-conjugated backbone. This investigation present herein introduces an electrocatalytic methodology for the formation ofsp3-type Au‒C covalent bonds in single-molecule devices with enhanced robustness and high conductance, establishing a foundation for the development of robust functional molecular devices in the near future.

To verify the feasibility of SET-induced homolysis at the single-molecule level, we conducted STM-BJ experiments on a series ofN-functionalized Katrizky salts, namely PyBz‒n(n= 1, 2, and 3), in MeCN solvent at a concentration of 0.1 mM. Upon SET from the tip to the compound (Fig.3a), PyBz‒nis expected to undergo fragmentation, resulting in the formation of two components, i.e., (i) a benzyl radical serving as the leaving group absorbed on Au surface, and (ii) a pyridine moiety, forming Au–S-Pyn-N–Au (n= 1, 2, and 3) junctions in-situ, featuring with a thiomethyl (‒SMe) anchor at one end and a pyridine anchor at the other end. Therefore, measuring the conductance of the newly formed pyridine junctions can offer essential evidence for the presence of SET-induced homolytic fragmentation of C‒N bonds in Katrizky salts.

The colour bar in the figure represents the number of counts per 1000 traces in the 2D matrix plot. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We created one-dimensional (1D) conductance histograms from breaking traces of PyBz‒3 collected at various bias voltages (Fig.3b). In the bias voltage range of 0.1–0.3 V, the 1D conductance histograms displayed negligible conductance features (Fig.3b, bottom), suggesting the lack of a stable molecular junction. A new conductance peak appeared gradually at around 10−4.0G0at a bias of 0.4 V, and its prominence increased as the bias voltage was raised up to 0.7 V (Fig.3b, middle, and Supplementary Fig.45). This phenomenon indicates the emergence of SET-induced formation of a new species, specifically Py‒3, within the nanogaps. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized Py‒n(n= 1, 2, and 3) ex situ and performed STM-BJ experiments at a bias voltage of 0.7 V. Figure3ccompares the typical single-molecule breaking traces for PyBz‒3 and Py‒3 at a bias voltage of 0.7 V. These two compounds have exhibited clear and similar conductance signatures, both positioned around 10−4.0G0.

Specifically, the two-dimensional (2D) conductance histogram of PyBz‒3 exhibited a conductance plateau with a length of 0.8 nm at a bias voltage of 0.7 V (Fig.3d), mirroring the conductance characteristic of Py‒3 prepared ex situ (Fig.3e). It is worth noting that, under the bias voltage of 0.1 V, the 2D conductance histogram of PyBz‒3 (Fig.3f) did not show a distinct conductance feature comparable to that of the 2D conductance histogram of Py‒3 (Fig.3g). All these results offer direct evidence of the SET-induced conversion from PyBz‒3 to Py‒3 at elevated bias voltages.

To assess the generality of the SET-induced conversion, we conducted bias-dependent STM-BJ experiments on PyBz‒1 and PyBz‒2 (Supplementary Figs.43and44). These experiments resulted in comparable bias-dependent outcomes, wherein an increase in bias voltage led to the gradual emergence of a conductance signal consistent with the conductance signature of Py‒n(n= 1, 2) prepared ex situ. We find that the conductance trends for both families are nearly linear against molecular length on the plot (Supplementary Fig.46), with a decay constant (β) of 3.30 nm−1for PyBz‒nunder a bias voltage of 0.7 V, which is similar to theβvalue (3.14 nm−1) of Py‒nat a bias voltage of 0.1 V. By combining the density functional theory (DFT) with the nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF), the transmission spectra of the Py‒nmolecular junctions were computed (Supplementary Fig.58a). The theoreticalβvalue was determined to be 3.30 nm−1(Supplementary Fig.58b), matching closely the experimental value. These findings provide supporting evidence supporting the occurrence of SET-induced homolytic fragmentation of Katritzky salts of PyBz‒n, leading to the formation of neutral Py‒nwires in-situ.

To achieve the Au‒C contact in single-molecule junctions, we synthesized PhTMP‒n(n= 1, 2, and 3) as the target compounds, incorporating 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (TMP) as the leaving group. In comparison to PyBz‒n, PhTMP‒nexhibits the following structural characteristics. Upon SET from the tip to the compound (Fig.4a), PhTMP‒nundergoes a fragmentation, resulting in the formation of two components, i.e., (i) a neutral TMP acting as the leaving group absorbed on Au surface, and (ii) a carbon radical intermediate, donated as Ph‒n•(n= 1, 2, and 3), featuring with a ‒SMe anchor at one end and a newly formed benzyl radical at the other end. Subsequently, the Ph‒n•radical interacts with the Au electrode to establish Au–S-Phn-C–Au junctions in-situ within the nanogap.

Inset shows the position of transmission eigenstate corresponding to Au–C gateway state at 0.32 eV.eUV–vis spectroelectrochemical analysis of PhTMP‒1 under progressively reducing potentials (0 to –1.0 V) revealed a characteristic absorption band at ≈300 nm, consistent with radical species (Ph‒1•) generation under cathodic conditions.fAbsorption changes at ≈300 nm were monitored under a constant reduction potential of −1.0 V with incremental time extensions up to 20 min.gElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Ph‒n•radicals were obtained after controlled potential electrolysis using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a radical trapping agent. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Control compounds PhSn-n(n= 1, 2, and 3) were prepared, each featuring a tributyltin group (Bu3Sn) at one terminus and a thiomethyl group (SMe) at the opposing end. PhSn-nwere known to form Au‒C bond with an initial homolytic dissociation of a C−Sn bond on the Au surface, followed by known radical processes4–6,40–44. The in-situ generated molecular junctions exhibit structural identity to those constructed from PhTMP–nthrough SET-mediated homolytic cleavage of C–N bonds. Figure4bdirectly compares the 1D conductance histograms of PhTMP–nmeasured at 0.6 V (top panel) with PhSn–ndatasets acquired at 0.1 V (bottom panel), demonstrating identical conductance peak positions (Supplementary Figs.47,48, and49). The decay constant (β= 4.8 nm−1) determined for PhTMP‒nat 0.5 V closely matched the value (β= 4.6 nm−1) for PhSn‒nat 0.1 V (Supplementary Fig.50).

A similar trend emerged in the 2D conductance distributions (Fig.4c). Using PhTMP‒3 and PhSn‒3 as model compounds, the 2D conductance histogram demonstrated clearly resolved conductance plateaus, i.e., PhTMP‒3 displayed a conductance plateau at ≈10−4.0G0with 0.9 nm length at 0.6 V (Fig.4c, top panel), while PhSn‒3 demonstrated identical conductance (≈ 10−4.1G0) and plateau length (0.9 nm) at 0.1 V (Fig.4c, bottom), after in-situ elimination of tributyltin groups. This robust correlation between the two molecular systems supports the reliable in-situ formation of Au–S-Phn-C–Au junctions with well-defined Au‒C interfacial bonding configurations.

The asymmetric Au–S-Phn-C–Au junctions with unilateral Au–C bonds did not achieve high-conductance transport. Theoretical simulations on the Au–S-Ph1-C–Au junction revealed no near-resonant transmission near the Au Fermi level5,45. Instead, transmission peaks emerge at 0.3–0.5 eV (Fig.4d), corresponding to the gateway state localized at the Au–C interface, as evidenced by isosurface analysis of the transmission eigenstate (Fig.4dinset). This state exhibits strong hybridization with the molecularπ-backbone and Au electrode orbitals. Projection eigenstate analysis also attributes the low conductance to weak interfacial coupling at the Au–S terminus. Moreover, identical transport behavior in Au–S-Ph2-C–Au and Au–S-Ph3-C–Au junctions (Supplementary Figs.59and61) confirm the dominant role of interfacial bonding in governing the electron transport behavior.

To confirm the involvement of carbon radicals in the junction formation process induced by SET, we first of all conducted (Supplementary Figs.54and55) cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis on the PhTMP‒nseries compounds. The experiments were performed in a 10 mM solution of KBF4in acetonitrile, with 0.5 mM of the target compound. The PhTMP‒1 displays a single irreversible reduction peak at ≈−1.10 V, indicating rapid SET reactions of the target compound at the working electrode. Similarly, PhTMP‒2 and PhTMP‒3 exhibit (Supplementary Fig.54) irreversible reduction peak at −1.21 and −1.38 V, respectively. Furthermore, UV–Vis spectroelectrochemical experiments were performed (Fig.4eand Supplementary Fig.56) using the solution obtained from the CV experiments at a specific reduction potential and reaction time. At low reduction potentials (≤ −0.6 V), PhTMP‒1 exhibits (Fig.4e) a dominant absorption at around 260 nm, with no peak detected above 280 nm. At a potential of −0.8 V, a new peak appears gradually at around 300 nm, reaching its maximum intensity at −1.0 V. As the constant potential of −1.0 V is applied over time, the absorption around 300 nm increases (Fig.4f) gradually. This observation indicates that PhTMP‒1 undergoes SET-induced homolysis, resulting in the generation of Ph‒1•benzyl radicals and electron delocalization. It is important to note that in electrochemistry-related analyses, the voltage is applied using Ag/AgCl as the reference. In STM-BJ measurements, a bias voltage is applied across the source and drain electrodes, which differs from the voltage used in electrochemical measurements.

To verify that the newly formed intermediates are radical species, we performed EPR spectroscopy on PhTMP‒n(n= 1, 2, and 3) following controlled potential electrolysis, using DMPO as a radical trapping agent. All three compounds have displayed (Fig.4gred curves) clear EPR signals with hyperfine splitting patterns that are consistent with the simulated result (Fig.4gblack curve). The spectroelectrochemical and EPR spectroscopic studies demonstrate that Ph‒n•radicals act as key intermediates in the SET-mediated homolysis of PhTMP‒n, leading to Au–C covalent bond formation in STM-BJ experiments. This phenomenon establishes that SET-generated carbon radicals in molecular junctions undergo interfacial reactions with Au electrodes to form defined covalent contacts.

To address the suppressed conductance caused by weak Au–S interfacial coupling, we designed and synthesized Ph(TMP)2‒n(n= 1, 2, and 3) bearing TMP leaving groups at both termini ofπ-conjugated backbones, aiming to construct Au–C-Phn-C–Au molecular junctions with dual benzyl-type Au–C covalent bonds. However, the large steric hindrance of TMP groups on both ends of Ph(TMP)2‒ncompromises electrode-molecule coupling during the tip-substrate opening process in STM-BJ experiments, significantly reducing SET efficiency and preventing effective in-situ formation of Au–C-Phn-C–Au junctions. In contrast to the junction opening process, tip-mediated mechanical force applied during the junction closing process drives the contacts between the tips and TMP groups, thereby enhancing SET efficiency while facilitating in-situ Au–C bonds formation at the interface.

We achieved direct characterization of interfacial chemical reactions during closing processes46. Fig.5b–ddisplays the 2D conductance-displacement histograms of the closing process for Au–C-Phn-C–Au junctions formed in-situ from Ph(TMP)2‒n(n= 1, 2, and 3) precursors. During junction closure, a 0.1 V bias suffices to create Au–C-Ph1-C–Au and Au–C-Ph2-C–Au junctions, whereas Au–C-Ph3-C–Au junction formation requires a higher voltage of 0.3 V. The relative displacement distributions for Au–C-Phn-C–Au series obtained from the closing process are demonstrated in Fig.5b–dinsets. Considering a jump-to-contact behavior of Au electrodes during the closing process with a 0.2 nm calibration distance applied46, the molecular lengths derived from Au–C-Phn-C–Au (n= 1, 2, and 3) are 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 nm, respectively. From the 1D conductance histogram (Fig.5e), it is evident that Au–C-Phn-C–Au junctions with Au–C covalent bonds at both ends show high-conductance values reaching 100, 10−1.0, and 10−1.7G0—with one, two, and three phenylene rings in the backbones, respectively.

To elucidate these experimental findings, we conducted DFT-based calculations47–49employing Au–C-Phn-C–Au molecular junctions with dual Au–C covalent anchoring interfaces (Supplementary Figs.60and62). Transmission spectra analysis reveals a transition from near-resonant transport for Au–C-Ph1-C–Au to non-resonant tunneling in longer molecules (Fig.5f), consistent with prior reports5,45. Theoretical analysis yields aβvalue of 3.88 nm−1, demonstrating agreement with both our experimental value (4.65 nm−1) and previously reported data (4.96 nm−1) for analogous systems (Fig.5g). The congruent exponential decay profiles across all three datasets provide robust theoretical validation of the experimental observations.

In this study, we utilized the technique of single-electron transfer-induced homolytic fragmentation of Katritzky salts to liberate benzyl-type carbon radicals and achieve the in-situ formation of Au‒C contacts in single-molecule junctions. Through UV–Vis spectroelectrochemical experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have identified the benzyl radical as a critical intermediate in the process of single-electron transfer. This radical-mediated bonding creates asp3-type Au–CH2–Ph linkage in single-molecule junctions with near-resonant conductance across 8 Åπ-conjugated backbones. These results highlight the efficacy of our electrocatalytic methodology for producing atomically defined metal-molecule interfaces toward the future development of molecular circuits with enhanced robustness and high conductance.

All reagents were used as received unless specified. Anhydrous acetonitrile (MeCN) for electrolysis and UV–Vis was purchased from Energy Chemical (anhydrous, 99.9%). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) employed silica gel 60 F254 (E. Merck), while column chromatography utilized a Biotage® Selekt system with RediSep Rf Gold® silica.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer (¹H: 600 MHz, ¹³C: 151 MHz), with chemical shifts referenced to residual solvent peaks (DMSO-d6:δH= 2.54 ppm,δC= 39.5 ppm; CDCl3:δH= 7.26 ppm,δC= 77.2 ppm). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a Bruker timstof pro mass spectrometer.

A mixture of 4-(methylthio)pyridine (5.0 mmol) and benzyl bromide (5.5 mmol) in acetone (20 mL) was stirred under N2at 90 °C for 12 h in a two-necked flask. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was filtered, washed with dichloromethane (3 × 10 mL), and dried under vacuum to afford PyBz–1 as a white solid in ≈96% yield.

A solution of (4-(methylthio)phenyl)methanamine (1.0 mmol) in anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (30 mL) was treated with 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium salt (1.1 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 8 h under N2, concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was further purified through flash chromatography on a silica gel column using MeOH/CH2Cl2(v/v= 1:10) as the eluent, yielding PyTMP–1 as a pale-yellow oil with a yield of ≈26%.

To a solution of 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (2.0 mmol) in anhydrous MeCN (20 mL) was added 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (20 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 12 h under N2. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removedin vacuo. The crude solid was filtered, washed with Et2O (3 × 15 mL), and dried under vacuum. This intermediate was dissolved in H2O (30 mL), treated with NH4PF6(4.4 mmol), and stirred vigorously for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with H2O (2 × 10 mL) and Et2O (10 mL), then dried to afford Ph(TMP)2–1 as a white solid with a yield of ≈82%.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at ambient temperature in N2-purged MeCN using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. Measurements used analyte solutions (0.5 mM in MeCN, 10 mM KBF4supporting electrolyte), a glassy carbon or Au working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference electrode. For UV–Vis spectroelectrochemistry, solutions from CV experiments at specific reduction potentials and times were analyzed. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) was conducted in a modified UV–Vis cuvette using a Pt mesh working electrode, Pt wire counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference. UV–Vis spectra (Shimadzu UV-2600) were recorded in-situ after 1 min electrolysis.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements at X-band (9.8 GHz) were performed using a Bruker A300, equipped with an ER4102ST resonator. EPR Samples were prepared by controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) experiments at a reduction potential of −1.0 V for 30 min, using DMPO (0.4 M in MeCN, 0.1 mL DMPO to 0.4 mL sample) as the spin-trapping reagent. The resulting adducts were transferred to 1 mm outer diameter capillary tubes for measurement under conditions of 1 G magnetic field modulation amplitude and 20.17 mW microwave power.

Single-molecule conductance was measured using a customized X-TECH STM-BJ system. Au substrates were prepared by evaporating chromium Cr/Au layers with controlled thickness of 5/100 nm on a silicon substrate with 300-nm-thick SiO2layer (Suzhou Research Material Microtechnology Co., Ltd.). Au tips were electrochemically etched from Au wire (99.998%, 0.25 mm diameter, Beijing Jiaming Platinum Nonferrous Metals Co., Ltd.). Target compound solutions—PyBz–n, PhTMP–n, Ph(TMP)2–n(0.1 mM in H2O), and PhSn–n(0.1 mM in TCB)—were dispensed (20 µL) onto Au substrates using a pipette before measurements. Conductance traces were collected at room temperature (20 °C) without selection.

During the STM-BJ measurement, the positioning and movement of the Au tip are controlled by a stepper motor (Harmonic Drive, LA-30B-10-F) and piezo stack (Thorlabs, PC4FL). The approximate position of the Au tip is controlled using a motor, allowing it to approach the substrate with an accuracy of less than 1 μm. Subsequently, the accurate movement of the tip is controlled by a piezo operating at a speed of 20 nm s−1. With a maximum driving voltage of ±10 V, the piezo stack can control the displacement of the tip precisely with a variation range of ±15 %.

To ensure proper feedback control for conductance measurements, upper and lower limits of the current are defined, which is essential for maintaining the current within the desired range. As the tip moves upward, an Au–Au atomic contact is established between the tip and the substrate. Then the tip is further pulled, leading to the rupture of the contact. This action brings the target compounds in the nanogap into contact with the tip and the substrate, forming a single-molecule junction in which the conductance of the molecule is measured. Further pulling of the tip breaks the connection between the molecule and electrodes, causing the current to drop below the limit (1 pA) and become undetectable by the current amplifier. Throughout the entire process of contact rupture and reconnection, the bias is adjusted from 0.1 to 0.7 V. Real-time conductance is recorded using a customizedI‒Vconverter capable of sampling the conductance at a rate of 20 kHz.

In order to determine the most probable conductance and stretching distance during the measurements of single-molecule conductance, thousands of individual breaking traces were collected. A statistical approach without any data selection was employed for analysis. In order to construct one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) conductance-displacement histograms, all individual traces were collected with a bin size of 1100 for log(G/G0) ranging from −10 to +1, and a bin size of 1000 for Δzranging from −0.5 to 3 nm. The peak shift was determined using Gaussian fitting, which represents the most probable molecular conductance. The 2D conductance-displacement histograms were generated by aligning with a relative zero point (Δz= 0) at 0.5G0. The relative stretching distance (Δz) was determined from the position where the conductance is 0.5G0to the molecular conductance region just before the end of the molecular plateau. The peak in the histogram signifies the most probable length of the plateau. In order to calculate the absolute displacement (z*), which correlates with the most probable length of the molecular junction, the relative displacements were adjusted by adding the snap-back distance (Δzcorr) to the relative displacement (Δz), specifically,z* = Δz+ Δzcorr. Based on previous findings, Δzcorrwas experimentally determined to be 0.5 ± 0.1 nm.

Firstly, the structural optimization of Py‒nwas carried out using B3LYP-D3/6-311 G(d,p) basis set in the Gaussian 16 package. The structural optimization of Au-Ph‒nincluding Au–C covalent bonds were carried out using MO6L/Def2SVP basis set in the Gaussian 16 package.

Secondly, the optimized molecular structures were then bridged between two Au electrodes to construct the single-molecule devices. In order to build devices containing the Au–molecule–Au sandwich model, the surface of the Au electrodes was shaped into a pyramidal configuration. The top Au atom was coordinated by the terminal S atom of the molecule, while the bottom Au atom was coordinated by N atom (Supplementary Fig.57) or covalently bonded with C atom (Supplementary Figs.59and60).

Thirdly, we conducted geometric optimization for the devices by allowing relaxation in distances between all atoms within the bridge molecules as well as those between top and bottom Au electrodes. To expedite calculations, the scattering and extension area of the electrodes are maintained rigid, with the emphasis placed on optimizing the adsorption configuration between the electrodes and the anchoring groups. The geometry optimization and transmission spectra calculation of the devices were implemented in Quantum ATK Q-2022.03 software. We adopted the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional, Fritz-Haber-Institute (FHI) pseudopotential combined with single zeta polarized group for Au atoms, and FHI pseudopotential combined with double zeta polarized group for other atoms.
