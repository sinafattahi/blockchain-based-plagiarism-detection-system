Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remain a significant global public health concern. This study aims to comprehensively explore the perspectives of both potential users of preventive health services and family physicians, with the goal of identifying key factors that influence the utilization of these services.

This qualitative study involved in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 29 participants selected through criterion sampling. Criterion sampling is a purposive sampling method in which participants are selected based on predefined criteria relevant to the research question. Data was analyzed thematically. After familiarization with the transcribed data, initial codes were generated independently by two researchers. These codes were reviewed collaboratively and grouped into broader themes that reflected patterns across the data set. Ethical approval and institutional permissions were obtained for the study.

Of the 29 participants, five were family physicians (FPs), and 24 were community members aged 28–63, residing in a district of Istanbul. Barriers to accessing preventive health services among community members included insufficient information, misconceptions, and the dynamics of patient-physician relationships. Most community members had limited awareness of preventive services within the healthcare system, often associating ‘routine health check-up examinations’ with paid services in private healthcare institutions. Some participants with a family history of cancer or heart disease reported seeking follow-up care in private hospitals and expressed that healthcare staff were reluctant to perform check-ups without an existing disease. FPs varied in their approach; while some integrated preventive care into routine visits, others were demotivated by systemic challenges such as workload, weak referrals, and lack of feedback. Feelings of inadequacy and frustration were also noted among FPs. Preventive services were often limited to patients who proactively sought care, and FPs expressed concern about unnecessary patient visits stemming from low health literacy.

This study highlights context-specific factors that influence the use of preventive health services, as reported by both community members and family physicians in a district of Istanbul. Based on participants lived experiences, the findings suggest that increasing public awareness of available preventive services, improving communication between patients and providers, and strengthening institutional support mechanisms could facilitate greater engagement with preventive care.

Preventive health services play a vital role in reducing the burden of Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) improving quality of life and promoting overall well-being. By addressing risk factors and detecting diseases early, these services play a central role in protecting health before illness develops. Given the growing global burden of NCDs, as reflected in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the importance of preventive strategies has become increasingly evident [1].

The World Health Organization (WHO), along with numerous countries, including Türkiye, has sought to enhance public health literacy and promote healthy lifestyle practices through the implementation of community interventions aimed at reducing risk factors for NCD [1–4]. The coordinated collaboration between individuals, family physicians, and other healthcare institutions plays a key role in the success of these intervention programs [2]. In Türkiye, there are also preventive health services aimed at preventing NCDs [1,5]. Preventive health services targeting the most common diseases, such as diabetes (DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), hypertension (HT), and cancer, are provided in primary healthcare institutions, with efforts aimed at promoting health [2,5–7]. Despite being provided free of charge in primary care, the incidence of NCDs continues to rise [2,6,8,9]. In Türkiye, the prevalence of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus has increased over the years [10]. The preventive health services are most effective when accessed regularly and proactively. Despite their proven benefits and availability, the utilization of preventive health services remains suboptimal in many settings. This paradox highlights the importance of understanding not just the availability of services but also the factors that influence whether individuals access them. The existing literature highlights various barriers and facilitators influencing access to and utilization of preventive health services in Türkiye [2,3]. However, many studies rely on quantitative data, which may not fully capture the complex, lived experiences of both healthcare providers and individuals who could benefit from these services. A qualitative approach allows for a deeper exploration of personal attitudes, perceptions, and contextual factors that shape preventive healthcare utilization [11]. A qualitative approach is warranted to elucidate the complex, context-specific determinants influencing the uptake and delivery of preventive health services, which are often insufficiently captured by quantitative methodologies.

This study aims to explore the perspectives of individuals who are potential users of preventive health services, as well as family physicians who deliver them. By conducting in-depth interviews, the study seeks to identify the facilitators and barriers that affect the utilization of these services, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of how to improve preventive health service engagement.

The study is of a qualitative nature and employs a phenomenological approach. Phenomenology aims to explore how individuals perceive, interpret, and emotionally experience a particular phenomenon or concept, focusing on their personal perspectives and the meaning they assign to that experience [12]. Utilizing a phenomenological approach, the study aims to identify the challenges that may be encountered regarding preventive health practices based on the experiences of individuals and family physicians [13].

This study aimed to examine the views of both potential users of preventive health services and family physicians in order to identify the facilitators and barriers influencing service utilization. To achieve this, interviews were conducted with family physicians to understand the views of healthcare providers and with individuals from the community to reflect the perspectives of service recipients. The inclusion criteria for the study consisted of individuals from the community aged between 18 and 65 years who were not healthcare professionals and resided in the selected district in İstanbul, Türkiye. The inclusion criteria for healthcare providers were family physicians working at a public university located in the same district as the community members. Participants in this study were selected using purposive sampling. Individuals aged 18 to 65, residing in a district of Istanbul and not employed as healthcare professionals, were invited to participate. In the purposive sampling method, participants are identified based on their compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study [14]. In determining individuals’ access to preventive health services, the specified preventive health services (such as cancer screening services, consultation with a dietitian, and access to psychiatric support) have been taken into account. A pilot study involving four participants was conducted prior to the main data collection in order to identify potential methodological shortcomings and refine the explanatory and probing questions to enhance the effectiveness of the data collection process. During the pilot interviews, it became apparent that the term ‘preventive health services’ elicited no recognition among potential recipients of such services. Consequently, the question was revised, and the perception of preventive health services was assessed indirectly. Pilot study data were excluded from the final analysis. At the beginning of the interview, the participants were informed about the subject and purpose of the study. In addition to that, their verbal consent for the study and recordings was obtained. The interviews were recorded both as audio and by observer notes.

Among the participants in the study, six individuals had never sought preventive health services. However, they were included in the research as individuals with the potential to seek healthcare services in order to identify the reasons for their underutilization of these services. The participants represent the perspectives of individuals with experience in utilizing preventive health services, those who have not accessed primary healthcare services within the past year, and those who have utilized such services in the preceding year.

In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with family physicians, including two faculty members and three resident physicians from a university hospital operating in the same district as individuals with the potential to seek healthcare services. Participants were selected using the purposive sampling method. The family physicians who participated in the study were providing healthcare services at the family medicine outpatient clinic of the university hospital and at primary healthcare centers established for educational purposes. Most of the family physicians participating in the study had experience working in the field (as general practitioners or specialized family physicians). The selected healthcare providers were examined to explore the educational perspective on healthcare services and the viewpoints of family physicians regarding an integrated systems approach in the planning and implementation of primary healthcare services.

Data collection was conducted between December 2022 and June 2023. In-depth interviews were carried out with participants both face-to-face and online. The interviews were conducted by a female researcher (S.P.) who had prior training and experience in qualitative research.

Before the data collection process, the researcher responsible for conducting the in-depth face-to-face interviews reached out to the participants via phone. During this communication, the researcher provided both verbal and written explanations of the information outlined in the informed consent form. Following this, the participants were invited to take part in the study. The interview locations were determined by the participants to ensure their comfort, taking place in settings such as public health meeting rooms, or home environments, at times specified by the participants. In locations, only the participant and the researcher were present. Three of the interviews were conducted via video call in online conditions due to the participants’ unavailability for face-to-face meetings. Among the women invited through purposive sampling, only one declined to participate in the study because her husband did not consent to her participation. No participants withdrew from the study. The interviews with the participants were conducted in a single session, and there were no repeat interviews.

Before starting the interviews, the participants were reminded of the purpose and topic of the research. The interviews began with a semi-structured questionnaire, and an individual survey was administered at the end of the conversation.

A total of 24 individuals selected from the community and 5 healthcare providers participated in the study. No additional interviews were conducted due to data saturation, as similar responses began to emerge during the discussions. Data saturation begins in data collection when new information no longer brings fresh insights to the research questions [15]. The average duration of the interviews was 50 min.

Qualitative data analysis was conducted between June and August 2023 using the Atlas.ti 23 software. Data were analyzed by using a “thematic analysis” approach proposed by Braun and Clarke [16].

In this analysis, we used the six steps, which involves familiarization with the data, generating initial codes, identifying and reviewing themes, defining and naming them, and producing the final report [16]. To facilitate interpretation during the analysis, figures illustrating the relationships between each theme and sub-theme as well as the connections between themes, were created using Atlas.ti 23 program. Two overarching themes were identified (Barriers Faced by Community Members, and Preventive healthcare from the physician’s perspective) through the thematic analysis, each comprising three sub-themes. These thematic structures were derived inductively from the data and reflect patterns that emerged across participants’ narratives. The Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines were adhered to throughout the research process [17].

Ethical considerationsThe study was conducted under the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical approval was obtained from the local ethics committee on 04.11.2022 with protocol code 09.2022.1507, along with institutional permission from the university. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants and audio-recorded prior to the interviews. Written consent was not deemed necessary due to the minimal risk nature of the study, the absence of any clinical intervention, and the preference for a less formal and more comfortable setting to encourage openness during in-depth interviews. This approach was approved by the ethics committee and aligns with accepted ethical standards for qualitative research. Participants were assured of confidentiality and anonymity of their information. In this way, they were able to respond freely. Participants were informed before the interview that they could not use their own names and could use a nickname if they wished. Participants’ personal data was protected in voice recordings and analyses. Personal information or voice recordings of the participants were not shared with third parties or institutions.

A total of 29 participants (21 women, 8 men) were included in the study, with a mean age of 45 ± 10.6 SD years (ranging from 28 to 63). Of these, five were physicians, while the remainder comprised individuals with the potential to seek healthcare services.

It was determined that six participants had not previously received preventive healthcare services related to the prevention of NCDs in primary healthcare institutions. This was assessed through questions regarding their use of primary care services within the past year, as well as their responses to specific items on preventive care utilization (e.g., having undergone cancer screening, or receiving services from a dietitian or mental health professional), However, as they had the potential to seek healthcare services, they were generally categorized as ‘individuals with the potential to seek healthcare services”. To ensure diversity in the sample, participants were purposefully selected based on whether they had utilized preventive services, received care from family physicians, or had not accessed such services at all. Therefore, although all individuals technically have the potential to seek healthcare, in this study, the term “individuals with the potential to seek healthcare services” refers specifically to those who met the inclusion criteria based on their varying degrees of engagement with primary care preventive services.

The individual characteristics of participants with the potential to seek healthcare services are presented in Table1. The average number of annual visits to healthcare institutions reported by these participants was 3.1. Only one participant reported not having health insurance, while four participants had both public and private health insurance. All participants indicated that they had lived in Istanbul for the longest duration of their lives.

The individual characteristics of the family physicians are presented in Table2.

In the final analysis, two themes and six sub-themes were identified (Table3). In the study, two main themes were identified: Barriers faced by community members and preventive healthcare from the physician’s perspective, along with six sub-themes (Fig.1) (Fig.2) (Table3).

“…I believe that specialists have more extensive experience compared to family physicians…”(P9, 32y, F).

“Well,for example,I would do whatever the doctor recommended (for my children)… because they know better than we do — they’re educated.”(P5, 52 y, F).

“There are many physicians occupied with other issues… Some family physicians work under very poor conditions — in basement-level clinics,dark rooms,even in buildings that are not earthquake-resistant.”(FP-3,54 y, F).

“I can’t even finish seeing my regular patients here — the ones coming in for reports,upper respiratory infections,acute gastroenteritis,or just routine blood pressure checks… I can’t get through them all.”(FP-1, 32y, M).

“Since we are the clinic that people need to visit when they start working,we have the opportunity to practice preventive medicine with young adults as well.”(FP 5, 37 y, F).

The participants thought that they could not access preventive health services without any justification (Fig.3).

“…If I’m not in pain,why would I see a doctor? Won’t they ask,‘What brings you here if nothing’s wrong?’ or think I’m joking? I mean,you’re a doctor… If I come to you and you ask,‘Do you have any pain?’ and I say,‘No,’ what am I supposed to say next? This question seems a bit strange to me…”(P20, 49 y, M).

Individuals mostly believed that they were at risk of illness if there was a history of chronic disease in the family, and they would request medical examination.

“…I don’t like going to the doctor very often,but since there’s this issue of cancer in the family,I get my tests done yearly. About 7 months ago,I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy,and I also had an ultrasound,mammogram,and breast ultrasound. So,I go for check-ups occasionally…” (P15,63 y,F).

Overall, there was a strong belief in the importance of health check-ups for managing diseases. Individuals with cancer diagnoses in their immediate surroundings especially highlighted the significance of early detection in preventing illnesses.

“…to prevent it from turning into more serious illnesses,it’s also important to know what it is. For example,if a cyst is found and it’s growing,the treatment options may vary. Taking preventive measures before it’s too late can lead to different approaches… However,if something is noticed after it has grown,it may require surgery. But early diagnosis leads to early treatment,which is also significant…”(P1, 46 y, F).

According to most participants, preventive health services were considered to be the‘check-up services’provided by private hospitals, and access to these services was associated with a good socioeconomic status. There was also a common perception that the technical capabilities of primary healthcare institutions were insufficient for providing preventive health services.

“…even if it’s not every year,I think if we have semi-check-ups or a full check-up at a fully equipped hospital when the doctor recommends it,our bodies will give us the signals. I know that they don’t provide such services at primary healthcare centers. I wouldn’t even bother to ask! I know they don’t do it because,for example,they check some blood values,but they don’t check for thyroid levels…”(P3, 29 y, F).

“…this check-up isn’t something that everyone can afford,especially for those with low incomes! Some individuals struggle just to buy bread for their families. There are even people who can’t find the money for bus fare to see a doctor,much less go for a check-up!…”(P20, 49 y, M).

The avoidance of diagnosis and stigmatization were among the factors affecting access to preventive health services.

“…If I give a blood sample,will they check my sugar levels or look for other diseases? Later,I thought,never mind; it’s better not to know. I remind myself to stay positive and avoid hearing anything that might disturb me…”(P5, 52 y, F).

“…I said,Come on,we lived in poverty; seeing a dietitian is for rich people…”(P20, 49 y, M).

According to individuals, family physicians should closely monitor and get to know their patients on a regular basis. Additionally, it was stated that the communication between patients and doctors is important for accessing healthcare services and ensuring treatment adherence.

“…Actually,there is a need for more family physicians… Health should be monitored from an early age. If they can’t establish communication with their patients,they won’t be able to provide proper follow-up. They may glance at a computer screen,but decisions made on a computer in the U.S. don’t necessarily apply here. Communication is fundamental; keep that in mind! We all tend to rush to conclusions…”(P2, 40 y, M).

“…I need to have some level of trust in the doctor; if I don’t,I won’t take the medication they prescribe or go to a place I’m uncertain about. Even if I do go,I probably won’t follow their recommendations. That’s how I feel…”(P15, 63 y, F).

The lack of trust among some participants had led them to seek alternative medicine.

“…I view the whole medication situation as a business; no one really gets completely healed… It’s just about making money! I had no idea I could manage my diabetes,so I opted for cupping therapy and even had treatment for my eyes. For the first time in my life,I was able to sleep well…”(P23, 31 y, M).

Most family physicians indicated that there are several barriers preventing the optimal implementation of preventive health practices at family health centers (Fig.4).

“…If the system,for instance,mandates that a doctor must see 70 patients to receive payment,the doctor will prioritize meeting that quota,potentially at the expense of institutional service quality. However,if compensation is assured regardless of patient volume,the doctor is more likely to focus on delivering higher-quality care…”(FP-2, 29 y, M).

“…I observe a substantial difference between my experience as a general practitioner in family medicine and my current role. At that time,due to feeling some educational gaps,I found myself needing to refer patients more frequently. However,my reliance on referrals has now significantly diminished…”(FP-4, 28 y, F).

Additionally, the perception among physicians that they are not trusted has also negatively impacted the effective delivery of services.

“… there is a general lack of awareness regarding the full range of capabilities that family physicians possess,and many family physicians themselves are not fully cognizant of their own potential. Even those who are aware often do not feel adequately skilled or motivated to utilize their competencies effectively. The rising trend of chronic diseases is significant,but physicians’ lack of confidence in their abilities also leads to an underutilization of available resources,as far as I have observed. I believe this is largely a matter of education and awareness…”(FP-3, 54 y, F).

“… if the patient realizes that you are making an effort for their well-being and trusts you,they will return for follow-up appointments. It’s somewhat dependent on the communication between you and the patient…”(FP-4, 28 y, F).

According to family physicians, patients emphasized the importance of a holistic approach, perceiving each patient visit as an opportunity for preventive health interventions.

“…For example,today a patient presented for consultation,accompanied by her child. Upon her arrival,I inquired about cervical cancer screening,as she is 36 years old. Following this,I referred her to the nurse for preventive measures and also directed her to the nursing staff for cancer screening procedures…”(FP-1, 32 y, M).

“…We do not consider patients merely in relation to diabetes; instead,we adopt a comprehensive approach. Each individual is evaluated holistically,and we view every periodic visit as an opportunity for assessment and intervention. This perspective guides our approach to patient care…”(FP-3, 54 y, F).

One of the family physicians underscored the significance of patient collaboration and inter-institutional coordination in the effective implementation of preventive health services.

“… patients are mostly followed up at state hospitals,where there is frequent turnover of physicians,and there is no consistent system for regular patient monitoring. In our training at the Family Health Center,we benefit from the psychologist and dietitian with whom we work,and we refer patients to them. However,there may not be any feedback from them to us if there are no personal relationships!.”(FP-3, 54y, F).

It was also stated that the absence of a referral system poses challenges in the coordination of patient care.

“… the issue is the lack of an official referral system! There is no network in which various specialties refer to one another,such as one region consulting another region…”(FP-5, 37 y, F).

According to one of the family physicians, there is a need for collaboration with non-health sectors in the context of preventive health perception.

“… chronic diseases cannot be addressed solely at the primary care level. Various stakeholders,including workplaces,urban environments,and municipalities,play a role in this context. In fact,a broad range of entities,such as the media and health policies,are involved.…”(FP-3, 54 y, M).

This study identified critical barriers to the utilization of preventive health services (PHS) from the perspectives of both community members and family physicians. Findings revealed that among community members, limited public awareness, misconceptions about preventive care, and ineffective communication with providers hinder engagement with services. Preventive care was often equated with costly check-ups at private institutions, and many individuals viewed family physicians primarily as providers of curative care. Conversely, family physicians reported systemic barriers such as excessive workload, lack of referral coordination, and insufficient feedback mechanisms, contributing to reduced motivation to deliver preventive services.

One of the most prominent barriers among community members was a lack of knowledge about the scope and purpose of preventive health services. Participants generally sought medical care only in the presence of symptoms or chronic disease risk factors, such as a family history of cancer, parallel to the findings from prior research [18,19]. This indicates a low perceived need for preventive interventions in the absence of illness. Although Türkiye offers free screening programs at primary care facilities, many participants preferred private healthcare providers, primarily associating preventive services with laboratory tests and imaging, and were unaware of counseling or lifestyle advice as part of prevention. These perceptions align with earlier studies indicating that health counseling is not widely recognized as a service offered by family physicians [2,6].

Socioeconomic factors also played a role in shaping preventive service utilization. Consistent with other studies, individuals with higher education and income levels were more likely to engage with preventive services [20–22]. Misconceptions about access and cost further contributed to the underuse of free public services, suggesting a need for broader awareness campaigns that emphasize universal access to PHS.

Family physicians, despite institutional challenges, reported seizing each patient visit as an opportunity to provide preventive care, often through personal initiative. This aligns with prior findings on the significance of opportunistic screening [23]. In our study, some participants reported being screened during unrelated visits, demonstrating the potential of integrating preventive practices into routine encounters. Evidence from India also supports this approach, showing that screening for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) can be successfully embedded in routine care without disrupting other services [24]. Similarly, opportunistic screening was found to be effective in detecting undiagnosed hypertension in hospital settings [25].

The perception among individuals in our study that consultation with a physician occurs solely in the presence of health complaints can be explained with their understanding of disease risk. Consistent with findings in the literature, this phenomenon may impose constraints on their demand for preventive health services [18,26,27]. A study conducted in Australia found that a family history of illness was a factor that increased individuals’ awareness of preventive health services [18,19]. In our study, nearly all individuals with a family history of chronic disease had sought health screenings at private healthcare facilities.

The fragmented structure of healthcare delivery, where patients are seen by different physicians across institutions, limits the potential of quaternary prevention. Family physicians emphasized that continuity of care is often compromised, leading to redundant diagnostic testing and delays in treatment. Studies suggest that organizing care around a single physician can improve coordination and reduce unnecessary interventions [28,29]. WHO’s framework of people-centered, continuous, and coordinated care further supports the need for integrated primary healthcare systems [30].

A key theme emerging from this study was the importance of effective communication and trust in the patient-physician relationship. Participants who engaged in preventive services often cited encouragement from their family physicians. Poor communication and a lack of personalized interaction led others to seek care from private providers. Horn et al. noted that patients value familiarity and recognition in family medicine, which fosters greater trust and service use [31].

Education and training of family physicians also emerged as a facilitator. Resident physicians in this study expressed increased confidence in providing PHS when supported by adequate training. This finding aligns with prior research identifying inadequate training as a significant barrier [32,33]. Encouragingly, educational interventions appear to empower physicians to take a more holistic approach to patient care.

Adopting patient-centered strategies such as motivational interviewing (MI) could further enhance preventive service uptake. In Switzerland, family doctors employ MI to foster patient engagement, reflecting WHO recommendations for collaborative care planning [30,34,35]. Empowering patients with knowledge and self-management skills is essential not only for prevention but also for reducing over-medicalization and enhancing quaternary prevention.

A key strength of this study is its qualitative design, which provides an in-depth understanding of both patient and provider perspectives on PHS. The study addresses a gap in the literature by exploring this topic within the Turkish healthcare context. The findings offer a foundation for future quantitative studies and may inform national strategies to improve preventive care.

However, limitations include the study’s restricted sample, comprising individuals from a single urban district in Istanbul and family physicians based at a university hospital. Their views may not reflect those of the broader population or primary care physicians in different settings.

This study highlights context-specific factors that influence the use of preventive health services, as reported by both community members and family physicians in a district of Istanbul. Based on participants lived experiences, the findings suggest that increasing public awareness of available preventive services, improving communication between patients and providers, and strengthening institutional support mechanisms could facilitate greater engagement with preventive care.
