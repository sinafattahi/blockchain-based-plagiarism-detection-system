Diabetes screening is one of the simpler methods for preventing and lowering the disease’s morbidity and mortality. Screening for gestational diabetes is a crucial component of obstetric care, as it negatively affects the life of both the mother and the fetus. There is a high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and tobacco use in Lesotho. This highlights the significance of bolstering prevention and treatment initiatives in the country. Therefore, this study is intended to assess diabetes screening and its associated factors among women aged 15–49 years using the 2023-24 Lesotho demographic and health survey dataset.

A cross-sectional study was employed using data from the most recent national representative dataset. A total sample of 3,297 women aged between 15 and 49 years was included in the study. Data extracted from the Lesotho Demographic and Health Survey 2023-24 data sets were cleaned, recoded, and analyzed using STATA/SE version 14.0 statistical software. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with the outcome variable. Finally, variables with ap-value less than 0.05 were declared statistically significant.

In the current study, 29.18% (95% CI: 27.65%-30.75%) of women aged 15–49 years in Lesotho were screened for diabetes mellitus. Of these, 1.40% of them had high blood sugar or diabetes, and 54.35% of women were diagnosed in the last twelve months. Age of respondents [AOR = 3.53; 95% CI (2.80, 4.46)], maternal occupation [AOR = 1.38; 95% CI (1.15, 1.65)], wealth status [AOR = 1.43; 95% CI (1.07, 1.91)], and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months [AOR = 1.31; 95% CI (1.09, 1.57)] were statistically significantly associated with diabetes screening.

Less than one in three women aged 15 to 49 years were screened for diabetes in Lesotho. Advanced age, working women, wealthier households, and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were associated with higher odds of diabetes screening. Therefore, women’s empowerment, regular visits to healthcare facilities, and awareness creation for young women are recommended to improve diabetes screening practices among women.

Non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, have a negative impact on quality of life and the economies of low- and middle-income countries, increase functional limitations and disability, and cause early mortality [1]. In almost every country, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has increased dramatically over the last few decades, and it may be regarded as an expanding epidemic [2]. In developing nations, there is a high prevalence of DM in both young and old people [3].

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by chronically elevated blood sugar levels and, to varied degrees, altered lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism [4]. It is a chronic, irreversible illness that can lower life expectancy and negatively affect quality of life. Microvascular damage and macrovascular disorders are examples of complications [5]. Results from 2024 indicated that 589 million adults, or 11.10% of the world’s population, had diabetes; by 2050, that number is expected to rise to 12.95%, or 853 million [6].

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is hyperglycemia first recognized during pregnancy, is related to perinatal morbidity, an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the mother in later life, and childhood obesity in the offspring [7–9]. The prevalence of GDM in low-, middle-, and high-income countries was 12.7%, 9.2%, and 14.2%, respectively [10]. Numerous negative pregnancy outcomes, including pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, birth trauma, perinatal death, and newborn cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic issues, have been linked to GDM [11]. In addition, the mother has a long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the child has a risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, and impaired glucose tolerance. Both the mother’s and the child’s health benefit from early detection and effective treatment [12].

There is strong evidence that diabetes microvascular complications can be decreased with early therapy [13]. Early disease management has greatly reduced mortality, particularly in the case of vascular disease. There is growing evidence of the benefits of diabetes screening. It is regarded as one of the simpler methods for preventing and lowering the disease’s morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular events are the cause of excess mortality associated with type 2 diabetes, and early screening may enable early intervention [14]. Because gestational diabetes negatively affects the life of both the mother and the fetus, screening for it is a crucial component of obstetric care [15].

A population-based survey conducted from 2021 to 2022 in northern Lesotho showed that the prevalence of diabetes was 5.3%, and it was more frequent in women than men (6.6% and 2.8%) [16]. The country has a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and tobacco use, with women more likely to have two or more of these conditions [16]. This highlights the significance of bolstering prevention and treatment initiatives in the nation [17]. Health services in Lesotho have traditionally focused on reducing maternal and newborn mortality as well as infectious disease [18].

Prior research in the country examined diabetes treatment and control in public institutions, self-management techniques, adherence to lifestyle changes, diabetes complications screening, and diabetes patients’ understanding of the condition and its treatments. However, the diabetes screening status of childbearing women and demographic and social factors associated with it have not been examined in Lesotho. Therefore, this study is intended to assess diabetes screening status and its associated factors among women aged 15–49 years in Lesotho using the 2023-24 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset to fill that gap in the literature and give an insight to focus on the prevention and early detection of diabetes as its prevalence is going to rise in developing countries like Lesotho.

A cross-sectional study was employed using data from the most recent national representative, LDHS 2023–2024. The 2023-24 Lesotho Demographic and Health Survey (2023-24 LDHS) was implemented by the Lesotho Ministry of Health (MoH). This is the 4th DHS conducted in Lesotho since 2004. Data collection took place from 27 November 2023 to 29 February 2024. Data were obtained from the DHS website (https://dhsprogram.com) after submitting a request justifying the purpose of the study. The individual record (IR) file of the LDHS dataset, which contains data related to pregnancy, postnatal care, immunization, maternal and child health, and nutrition of mothers, was used.

The current study used a total sample of 3,297 women aged between 15 and 49 years. The sampling frame used for the 2023–24 LDHS is based on the 2016 Population and Housing Census (2016 PHC), provided by the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics (BoS). The frame file is a complete list of all census enumeration areas (EAs) within Lesotho. An EA is a geographic area, usually a city block in an urban area or a village in a rural area, consisting of approximately 100 households. In rural areas, it may consist of one or more villages. Each EA serves as a counting unit for the population census and has a satellite map delineating its boundaries, with identification information and a measure of size, which is the number of residential households enumerated in the 2016 PHC. Lesotho is administratively divided into 10 districts; each district is subdivided into constituencies, and each constituency into community councils. The 2023–24 LDHS sample of households was stratified and selected independently in two stages. Each district was stratified into urban, peri-urban, and rural areas; this yielded 29 sampling strata because there are no peri-urban areas in Butha-Buthe. In the first sampling stage, 400 EAs were selected with probability proportional to EA size and with independent selection in each sampling stratum. A household listing operation was carried out in all of the selected sample EAs, and the resulting lists of households served as the sampling frame for the selection of households in the next stage. In the second stage of selection, a fixed number of 25 households per cluster (EA) were selected with an equal probability systematic selection from the newly created household listing. All women aged 15–49 who were usual members of the selected households or who spent the night before the survey in the selected households were eligible for the Woman’s Questionnaire. Additional information related to the population, study area, data collection, sampling procedure, and questionnaires used in the survey can be obtained from the 2023–24 LDHS final report [19].

Both individual and community-level variables were considered in this study. Individual-level variables: age of respondents (15–24, 25–34, 35–49 years), educational status (no education, primary, secondary/higher), current marital status (unmarried, married), working status (not working, working), wealth index (poor, middle, rich), media exposure (no, yes), health insurance (no, yes), currently pregnant (no, yes), number of antenatal care (ANC) visits (no visit, < 4 visits, 4 + visits), visited healthcare facility last 12 months (no, yes), and distance to a health facility (big problem, not a big problem). Community-level variables: place of residence (urban, rural), community-level education (low, high), community media exposure (low, high), and community poverty (low, high).

Media exposure was established by combining three factors: reading newspapers, watching television, and listening to the radio. A woman was deemed to have been exposed to media if she had at least one kind of exposure.

Wealth status was categorized as poor (poorest and poorer), middle, and rich (richer and richest).

Media exposure at the community level was measured using the percentage of women who had at least been exposed to one of the three media: television, radio, or newspapers. It was coded as “0” for low community-level media exposure (communities where less than 50% of women had at least one media exposure) and “1” for high community-level media exposure (communities where more than 50% of women had at least one media exposure).

The level of poverty in the community was calculated based on the percentage of women in the lowest and poorest quintiles, as obtained from the wealth index data. The poverty levels were classified as “0” for low (those where less than 50% of women belonged to the lowest and worst wealth quintiles) and “1” for high (those where more than 50% of women belonged to the poorest and poorer wealth quintiles) communities.

Women’s education at the community level was also measured using the percentage of women with at least a primary education. It was coded as “0” for low community-level women’s education (communities where less than 50% of women had completed primary school) and “1” for high community-level women’s education (communities where more than 50% of women completed primary education at the cluster level).

Data extracted from the 2023–24 LDHS data sets were cleaned, recoded, and analyzed using STATA/SE version 14.0 statistical software. The categorization of continuous variables and further recategorization of categorical variables were done accordingly. Descriptive statistics like frequencies, percentages, mean, and standard deviation were used to present both the individual and community-level variables in tables and figures. The assumptions of independent observations and equal variance across clusters were broken to employ the traditional logistic regression model due to the hierarchical structure of the DHS data. This is an indication that using a sophisticated model to take into account between-cluster factors is necessary. As a result, multilevel logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with DM screening. Multilevel logistic regression follows four models: the null model (outcome variable only), model I (only individual-level variables), model II (only community-level variables), and model III (both individual and community-level variables). The model without independent variables (the null model) was used to check the variability of DM screening across the cluster. The association of individual-level variables with the outcome variable (Model I) and the association of community-level variables with the outcome variable (Model II) were assessed. In the final model (Model III), the association of both individual and community-level variables was fitted simultaneously with the outcome variable.

The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and proportional change in deviance (PCV) were checked to quantify the magnitude of the clustering effect and the degree to which community-level factors explain the unexplained variance of the null model. A model with the lowest deviance was selected as the best-fitted model. Finally, variables with ap-value less than 0.05 and an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were declared to be statistically significant variables associated with DM screening. Variance inflation factor (VIF) presence was used to check multicollinearity between covariates. The VIF falls within acceptable limits of 1–10, indicating the absence of significant collinearity across independent variables.

Measures of variation or random effects of the outcome variable were estimated using the median odds ratio (MOR), ICC, and PCV. The variation between clusters was measured by the ICC and PCV. Taking clusters as a random variable, the ICC reveals the variation of DM screening between clusters is computed as ICC = VC/(VC + 3.29) × 100%. The MOR is the median value of the odds ratio between the area of the highest risk and the area of the lowest risk for DM screening when two clusters are randomly selected, using clusters as a random variable; MOR = 𝑒0.95√VC. In addition, the PCV demonstrates the variation in the prevalence of DM screening explained by factors and computed as PCV = (Vnull-VC)/Vnull×100%, where Vnull = variance of the null model and VC = cluster-level variance [21]. The association between the likelihood of DM screening and individual and community-level independent variables was estimated by the fixed effects.

A total of 3,297 women aged between 15 and 49 years participated in the current study. The mean age of women was 29.56 ± 0.13 years, and 39.79% of them fall in the age range of 15–24 years. More than two-thirds (69.40%) of women completed secondary/higher education, and 50.14% of them were unmarried. More than half (59.02%) of women had no occupation, and 70.67% of them had media exposure. The majority (96.82%) of women were not covered by health insurance, and 43.62% of them had poor wealth status. Only 2.73% of women were currently pregnant, and 92.69% of them had four or more ANC visits during their recent pregnancy. Nearly one-third (34.12%) of women did not visit a healthcare facility in the last 12 months, and 69.58% of them reported distance to a health facility was not a big problem. The majority (87.50%) of women were from communities with high levels of education, and 63.27% of them reside in rural areas. More than half (59.87%) and 51.47% of women were from communities with high levels of media exposure and poverty, respectively (Table1).

In the present study, 29.18% (95% CI: 27.65%−30.75%) of women aged 15–49 years in Lesotho were screened for DM. This study also revealed that 1.40% of women had high blood sugar or diabetes, and 54.35% of them were diagnosed in the last twelve months. More than half (58.70%) of women received medication to control their blood sugar, and 54.35% of them took their medication to control their blood sugar (Fig.1). The proportion of women who screened for diabetes mellitus was high in Qacha’s Nek district (37.15%) and low in Thaba-Tseka district (16.46%) (Fig.2).

A null model was used to determine whether the data supported the decision to assess randomness at the community level. Findings from the null model showed that there were significant differences in diabetes screening between communities, with a variance of 0.28 and ap-value of < 0.001. The variance within clusters contributed 7.85% of the variation in diabetes screening, while the variance across clusters was responsible for 92.15% of the variation. In the null model, the odds of diabetes screening differed between higher- and lower-risk clusters by a factor of 1.65 times. The intra-class correlation value for Model I indicated that 6.88% of the variation in diabetes screening accounts for the disparities between communities. Then, with the null model, community-level variables were used to generate Model II. According to the ICC value from Model II, cluster variations were the basis for 6.23% of the differences in diabetes screening. In the final model (model III), which attributed 6.59% of the variation in the likelihood of diabetes screening to both individual and community-level variables, the likelihood of diabetes screening varied by 1.58 times across low and high diabetes screening (Table2).

In the final fitted model (model III) of multivariable multilevel logistic regression, age of respondents, maternal occupation, wealth status, and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were significantly associated with diabetes screening among women aged 15–49 years in Lesotho. Accordingly, the odds of diabetes screening were 2.01 and 3.53 times higher among women aged 25–34 years and 35–49 years than those aged 15–24 years, respectively [AOR = 2.01; 95% CI (1.60, 2.54)] and [AOR = 3.53; 95% CI (2.80, 4.46)]. Working women were 1.38 times more likely to be screened for diabetes mellitus compared with their counterparts [AOR = 1.38; 95% CI (1.15, 1.65)]. The odds of diabetes screening were 1.43 times higher among rich women than those with poor wealth status [AOR = 1.43; 95% CI (1.07, 1.91)]. Women who visited a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were 1.31 times more likely to be screened for diabetes mellitus compared with those who didn’t [AOR = 1.31; 95% CI (1.09, 1.57)] (Table3).

Early diabetes detection lowers costs and enables care to stop or postpone the onset of the condition and its associated complications [22]. It is recommended that women who are overweight or obese and planning pregnancy and/or have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes are advised to have screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes [12]. In addition to preventing poor maternal and perinatal outcomes, screening for, diagnosing, and successfully treating GDM also helps to prevent future diabetes in both the mother and the child [23]. The present study was conducted to assess diabetes screening status and its associated factors among women aged 15 to 49 years in Lesotho using the DHS dataset. Accordingly, 29.2% (95% CI: 27.7%−30.8%) of women were screened for diabetes mellitus. This finding is lower than studies conducted in Australia (32.3%) [24] and the United States (33.4%) [25]. Nonetheless, it is higher than studies conducted in the United States (10–13.4%) [26] and in Brazil (20.1%) [27]. This difference might be explained by differences in study period, study area, study design, sample size, and study participants. The study conducted in Brazil used women with a diagnosis of GDM to determine the prevalence of screening for DM six weeks postpartum, while the current study used all women aged 15 to 49 years. Likewise, the study conducted in the United States [25] used adults with overweight or obesity that may increase the uptake of diabetes screening as they are at higher risk of acquiring DM.

Factors like age of respondents, maternal occupation, wealth status, and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were significantly associated with diabetes screening. The odds of diabetes screening were higher among women aged ≥ 25 years than those aged 15–24 years. This finding is consistent with studies conducted in Singapore [28], the United States [29], and Italy [30]. This might be attributed to younger participants believing they were exempt from needing to have regular diabetes screenings since chronic illnesses only affected the elderly [28]. Uptake might be hampered by all of these misconceptions and ignorance about the preventative benefits of screening for DM. A lack of clarity regarding the goal of diabetes screening might also be the reason for the lower odds of diabetes screening among young women. Expanding diabetes screening to younger women through integrated reproductive health services, youth-focused education, accessible outreach, and revised policy guidelines can close the current age gap and enhance early detection efforts.

Working women were more likely to be screened for diabetes mellitus compared with their counterparts. This finding is in agreement with a study conducted in Italy [30]. The higher odds of screening may be caused by the fact that working women may have easier access to health tests and information about health issues, including chronic diseases, from their employers. Greater diabetes screening among working women highlights the need for inclusive strategies that reach unemployed women through community outreach, subsidized services, and integrated care beyond workplace settings. Similarly, the odds of diabetes screening were higher among rich women than those with poor wealth status. This finding is in line with a study conducted in Singapore [28]. This could be as a result of low-income women prioritizing other obligations above routine diabetes screening. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is a problem if the health screening reveals any chronic illnesses, in addition to the cost of screening. Therefore, providing a free health screening, paying for the full cost with insurance, and reducing the insurance premium for those who attend would encourage women to get regular diabetes screenings.

Finally, women who visited a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were more likely to be screened for diabetes mellitus compared with those who didn’t. This could be because part of comprehensive antenatal care includes monitoring for hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Healthcare providers may also encourage screening and teach women about diabetes prevention strategies during their healthcare facility visits. Screening for diabetes may also be undertaken before or after treatment for other illnesses. This association suggests that improving diabetes screening requires expanding access to routine healthcare for women with limited facility visits through mobile clinics, outreach programs, and integrating screening into non-urgent care services to ensure broader and equitable coverage.

This study has the strength of using a multilevel model to estimate both individual and community-level variables and resolve the problem of the hierarchical nature of the DHS data. The study also used the most recent (2023-24 LDHS) data that help the concerned authorities to set suitable strategies towards screening and early detection of diabetes. Finally, this study addresses an unstudied topic in Lesotho using nationally representative data. This study also has some limitations. First, some important variables were not incorporated due to the secondary nature of the data. Secondly, estimating the proportion of diabetes screening by using participants who responded ‘yes’ to screening in the data set used without considering the range of screening methods (fasting blood glucose, OGTT, HbA1c, glucometer use, or self-reported screening without confirmatory testing) may not be representative. In addition, there might be an introduction of recall and social desirability bias. Lastly, the cause-and-effect relationship between variables could not be established due to the cross-sectional nature of the study.

Less than one in three women aged 15 to 49 years were screened for diabetes in Lesotho. Advanced age, working women, wealthier households, and visiting a healthcare facility in the last 12 months were associated with higher odds of diabetes screening. Therefore, women’s empowerment, regular visits to healthcare facilities, and awareness creation for young women are recommended to improve diabetes screening practices among women in Lesotho.

We are grateful to the DHS program for letting us use the relevant LDHS data in this study.
