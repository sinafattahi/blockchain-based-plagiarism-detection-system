Paediatric forearm fractures are among the most common childhood injuries, with diaphyseal fractures often requiring surgical management due to their instability and poorer remodelling potential. Traditional methods, such as elastic stable intramedullary nailing, are effective but require secondary procedures for implant removal, increasing healthcare burdens. Bioabsorbable intramedullary nails offer an alternative, eliminating the need for implant removal. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of bioabsorbable intramedullary nails compared to conventional methods.

Five studies, including 255 paediatric patients with 399 forearm fractures, were included. Of these, 159 were treated with bioabsorbable intramedullary nails. Meta-analyses assessed outcomes, including fracture healing time, complications, functional results and reoperation rates.

Bioabsorbable intramedullary nails demonstrated fracture healing times comparable to elastic stable intramedullary nailing (10.67 weeks; 95% CI: 8.92–11.42) with no significant differences. Complication rates were similar, with nine re-fractures in the bioabsorbable intramedullary nail group and 10 in the elastic stable intramedullary nailing group. Secondary displacement occurred in 3.1% of bioabsorbable intramedullary nail patients versus 4.7% for elastic stable intramedullary nailing. Functional outcomes showed improved pronation (78.5° versus 72.7°,p= 0.030) and elbow flexion (153.8° versus 144.8°,p= 0.001) for bioabsorbable intramedullary nails. Pain scores were comparable, with fewer bioabsorbable intramedullary nail patients reporting postoperative pain.

Bioabsorbable intramedullary nails are a safe and effective alternative to elastic stable intramedullary nailing, offering equivalent clinical outcomes while eliminating the need for implant removal. Larger, long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bioabsorbable intramedullary nails in paediatric fracture management.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate current literature regarding the use of BIN in the surgical management of paediatric forearm fractures, compared with current methods.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews10and PRISMA-P statement.11The protocol was registered with PROSPERO on 03 July 2023 (CRD4202341673).

A comprehensive search of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Google Scholar, was conducted on 09 December 2024. The search was extended to include trial registers, grey literature sources and other relevant databases. All studies published before December 2024, with no restrictions, were included in the screening process.

Two authors (FE and GA-D) separately screened all search results, blinded to each other, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by a third author (MP) independently. The full screening process is outlined in the PRISMA flow diagram.

This review included studies with paediatric patients aged 18 or younger with radiologically confirmed forearm fractures (radius, ulna or both). Only human studies were included.

The accepted intervention was fixation with any bioresorbable implant, including bioresorbable intramedullary nails, with or without open reduction and postoperative plaster immobilisation.

Observational and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review; however, review articles, case reports, technical reports and letters to editors were excluded. Original articles were included if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal or available in a database, and the full text was available, whereas published abstracts were excluded. Any control intervention was accepted for RCTs.

This review analysed postoperative and follow-up outcome measures to assess the effectiveness and safety of the treatment approach. The primary outcome was fracture healing time, as it directly reflects treatment success. Secondary outcomes included radiological outcomes, functional outcomes, complication rates, adverse effects, operative time, fracture displacement rate and length of hospital stay. These secondary measures provided further insight into the overall safety, efficiency and success of the treatment method. The average selling price of the BIN implant was obtained directly via personal communication with a company representative.

Heterogeneity was assessed using theI2statistic, which describes the proportion of variation in effect sizes that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance; a low value indicates little variation between the results of the studies.

Funnel plots were generated to assess the likelihood of publication bias. During the search and screening process, authors aimed to identify any study protocols for which no results were published, which could indicate potential publication bias. A brief search of clinicaltrials.gov was conducted to identify any registered trials that had not been completed.

A total of 255 paediatric patients with 399 forearm fractures were included in analyses, 159 of whom were treated using bioresorbable PLGA intramedullary nails. Control interventions included ESIN (n= 32), K-wires buried under the skin (n= 40) or non-buried K-wires (n= 24). Participants’ ages ranged from 4 to 15 years, and the mean age of participants across all included studies was 9.10 (SD 2.42). Where this was reported, most participants were male. Two of the included studies were controlled trials comparing BIN with ESIN in diaphyseal forearm fractures,15,16two were retrospective multicentre observational trials18,19and one of which compared BIN with K-wires19; the final included study was observational comparing healing outcomes for BIN using magnetic resonance imaging.17Table 1shows the characteristics of included studies.

The bioresorbable intramedullary nail used in all studies was the ActivaNail IM™ produced by Bioretec Ltd (Tampere, Finland): this implant is made of a PLGA polymer and has an osteoconductive β-tricalcium phosphate marker in the tip.20In the UK, the average selling price for these implants for 2025 is £375/implant (provided by company representative on 07 May 2025). The control groups in the RCTs used ESIN, with Synthes TEN™ implants by DePuy Synthes (West Chester, PA, USA).15These were removed 4–6 months postoperatively. Another study used one or two K-wires as a control intervention, which were either buried under the skin or left outside the skin; the specific K-wires used were not specified.19All patients’ operated limbs, regardless of implant used, were immobilised with a cast postoperatively.

Two controlled studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool13and found to have high risk of bias in only two domains, both of which related to blinding, which would be impractical due to the nature of the intervention. Three observational studies were assessed using the ROBINS Tool,14and found to have a moderate risk of bias overall.

The overall mean healing time for both BINs and traditional elastic nails (TENs) was 10.67 weeks (95% CI: 8.92–11.42) as reported in three studies,15–17with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2= 0%), as shown inFigure 2. Individual study results also indicated comparable radiological healing times for BINs and ESIN, with confidence intervals largely overlapping andpvalues suggesting no statistically significant group differences (Qb(1) = 0.00,p= 0.97).

Of the 159 patients treated with BINs, nine experienced re-fractures. Four were due to implant failure, presenting as sudden pain without new trauma despite initially good functional and radiological results, all managed with plate and screw fixation. The remaining five resulted from new trauma after confirmed radiological healing, with one managed conservatively by cast immobilisation and the others with plate and screw fixation.

A meta-analysis comparing BINs and TENs showed no significant difference in complication rates, with a combined odds ratio of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.65–1.42) and minimal heterogeneity (I2= 3.52%) from the included studies.15,16,19Individual study odds ratios for BINs ranged from 0.39 to 0.85, while for TENs, they ranged from 0.65 to 1.42, as shown inFigure 3.

Fracture displacement rates were comparable between BINs and TENs, with an overall risk ratio of 1.08 (95% CI: 0.27–4.38) and no significant heterogeneity (I2= 0.0%), indicating consistent findings across studies,15,16as shown inFigure 4.

Re-operation rates were also similar, with BINs at 2.00% (95% CI: 1.12–3.21) and TENs at 3.00% (95% CI: 1.21–6.01). Both devices demonstrated low complication and re-operation rates, supporting BINs as a safe alternative that may eliminate the need for secondary implant removal.

A pooled meta-analysis of included studies15,16,19showed slightly better forearm rotation with BINs (162.08°, 95% CI: 157.69°–166.31°) compared to TENs (158.19°, 95% CI: 153.20°–163.19°), as shown inFigure 5(a), though the overlapping confidence intervals suggest no significant difference. For forearm flexion, BINs had a mean of 152.43° (95% CI: 142.88°–161.98°) compared to 149.23° (95% CI: 142.96°–155.51°) for TENs, as shown inFigure 5(b), with minimal heterogeneity (I2= 0%), indicating comparable outcomes.

This systematic review included data from 255 paediatric patients with forearm fractures requiring surgical management, 159 of whom were treated using BIN. Overall, the results showed that BIN is a viable alternative in the management of these common injuries, offering comparable outcomes in terms of fracture healing, functional outcomes, complications and re-operation rates. The key advantage of BIN is that, by biodegrading over time, it obviates the need for secondary implant removal surgery, thus making it a potentially preferable option.

Functional outcomes were similar for BIN, ESIN and K-wires, including range of movement in elbow flexion, forearm rotation and wrist flexion, on the injured wide alone and compared with the uninjured side. There was no significant difference in postoperative pain levels, with no BIN patients reporting pain at follow-up.

All fractures treated with BINs demonstrated complete radiographic healing. Korhonen et al. reported full callus formation across all cortices in BIN patients and all but one patient in the ESIN group at 2 years, with no statistically significant difference between groups.15No residual dislocation was observed. Perhomaa et al. similarly found no significant differences in bone alignment or length between fractured and non-fractured bones in either group at 4 years.17The radiolucent tip of the BIN remained visible on radiographs but did not result in complications.

Paediatric forearm fractures are a common injury, with diaphyseal forearm fractures accounting for almost 55% of fractures requiring surgery in children.4Surgical management not only exposes a child to perioperative risks and complications but also places a burden on the healthcare system. Previous analyses of the cost-effectiveness of ESIN have shown metalwork removal to cost close to the same as the primary procedure; $632.76 for initial surgical management, $462.84 for metalwork removal.7Negating the need for removal of metalwork could potentially make BIN a more financially viable option. Further long-term studies are therefore warranted to explore this and assess the cost-effectiveness of BIN in clinical practice.

This study is limited by a small body of evidence with variability in study designs, sample sizes and outcome measures. Future research should focus on long-term, large-scale RCTs to better evaluate the use of BINs against current fixation methods. Additionally, the included studies excluded key subgroups, such as patients with open fractures, multi-fragmentary fractures, significant soft tissue injuries, pathological fractures, metabolic bone diseases, systemic illnesses or fractures older than 7 days. Consequently, the findings of this review are not generalisable to these populations or injuries outside the specific demographics studied.

This study has shown that BINs are a viable alternative to ESIN for managing paediatric forearm fractures. BINs offer comparable outcomes in fracture healing, complication rates and re-operations, with the added benefit of biodegradability, removing the need for secondary implant removal. Functional outcomes, including ROM and pain, were similar or slightly better with BINs. While both groups experienced complications such as re-fractures and secondary displacement, all cases achieved complete radiographic healing. Further large-scale trials are needed to confirm these findings, assess cost-effectiveness and refine treatment protocols.
