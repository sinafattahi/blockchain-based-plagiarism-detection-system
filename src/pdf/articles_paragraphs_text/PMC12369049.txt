Loiasis affects millions in Central Africa and, though historically considered benign, emerging data suggest possible renal involvement. This study investigated the association betweenLoamicrofilaremia and renal function.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Republic of Congo in May–June 2022. Renal function was assessed via estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using Chronic Kidney Disease—Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) equations, and proteinuria and/or haematuria (renal abnormalities, RAb). Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between microfilarial density (MFD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), using EKFC with Dubois correction. Population attributable fractions were estimated from a logistic model includingLoamicrofilaremia as a binary variable (presentversusabsent).

Among 986 participants, CKD prevalence ranged from 13.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.4–15.7%, CKD-EPI] to 17.6% (95%CI15.3–20.1%, EKFC) for KDIGO stages 1–5, and from 3.0% (95%CI2.1–4.3%, CKD-EPI) to 7.6% (95%CI6.1–9.4%, EKFC) for stages 3–5.LoaMFD was associated with higher odds of CKD, particularly in individuals with RAb. Compared to amicrofilaremic participants, those withLoaMFD ≥ 20 000 mf/ml had significantly increased risk: adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for CKD severity categories (≤ 2nd, 2nd–10th, 10th–50th, > 50th eGFR percentile) with RAb were 8.67 (95%CI2.62–28.64,P= 0.021), 14.26 (95%CI3.41–59.68,P< 0.001), 5.50 (95%CI0.55–61.78,P= 0.145), and 26.21 (95%CI1.64–417.84,P= 0.021). Population attributable fractions of CKD stages 1–5 toLoamicrofilaremia was 14.7% (95%CI4.3–24.0) and 30.1% (95%CI16.2–42.8) for CKD stages 1–5 with RAb.

This study provides the first epidemiological evidence linking loiasis to renal impairment, likely via glomerular damage. Given loiasis high endemicity in Central Africa, it may contribute to the burden of unexplained nephropathies. Longitudinal studies and renal biopsies are warranted to clarify underlying mechanisms.

Loiasis is a parasitic disease caused byLoa loa, a filarial worm transmitted from human to human by deerflies. About 15 million people are infected in Central Africa [1]. Adult parasites, which can live up to 20 years, release millions of larvae (microfilariae, mf) into the bloodstream, and the relatively stable microfilarial densities (MFD) over time can exceed 100,000 mf/ml in some individuals.

Loiasis is usually associated with marked eosinophilia, which may contribute to systemic complications, including coagulation and cardiac disorders [2,3]. It is traditionally considered relatively benign, presenting with pruritus, subconjunctival migration of the adult worms, or transient angioedema (“Calabar swellings”), but recent results challenge this view. Retrospective cohort studies in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo have shown significantly reduced life expectancy in individuals with highLoaMFD, with mortality risk correlating withLoaMFD levels [4,5].

Emerging data highlight the broader disease burden of loiasis, now implicated in cardiovascular and renal complications [6–8]. These findings may explain the excess mortality in heavily infected individuals and stress the need for further research on loiasis-associated morbidity, particularly renal involvement. Renal complications in loiasis have been reported for decades, mainly through case studies, ranging from isolated proteinuria to severe nephrotic syndrome and renal failure [9–17]. Renal biopsies in eight cases revealed membranous glomerulopathy, focal interstitial inflammation, or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [11–13,15,16,18,19]. In some cases, renal function normalized after antifilarial treatment.

More recently, a strong association betweenLoaMFD and proteinuria severity was demonstrated, with a clear gradient effect asLoaMFD increased [7]. This was the first study, involving 990 individuals in the Republic of Congo, to confirm such a relationship, reinforcing decades of prior anecdotal observations. Building on these findings, we now assess the impact ofLoaMFD on CKD in this population.

This cross-sectional study, nested within a cohort study, was conducted in May–June 2022 and included 990 participants aged 18 to 88 years living in 21 villages near Sibiti, Republic of Congo. Participants had been previously screened forLoamicrofilaremia [20]. For the current study, individuals with blood microfilariae detected in 2021 were matched for sex and age (± 5 years) with two amicrofilaremic individuals from the same village. Detailed description of the study population has been published previously [8,21].

The sample size for the underlying cohort study (n= 990) was calculated to provide 80% statistical power to detect an increased risk of malaria (1.4-fold) and pneumonia (2.4-fold) among microfilaremic compared to amicrofilaremic individuals, based on the hypothesis that loiasis may impair splenic function and thereby increase susceptibility to infections. However, due to the lack of prior data, the sample size was not calculated to evaluate differences in renal outcomes.

Participation in the study required informed consent from all individuals. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Congolese Foundation for Medical Research (036/CIE/FCRM/2022) and by the National administrative authorities of Congo (376/MSP/CAB/UCPP-21).

Data on age, sex, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and body mass index—BMI), and tobacco use were collected from each participant. Blood pressure was measured supine after 10 min rest. High blood pressure (HBP) was classified into three stages (see Table1) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was defined asSystolic BP + 2×Diastolic BP3.

Fifty µl of capillary blood were collected by finger-prick between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. (to take into account the day and night fluctuation ofLoaMFD) to prepare thick blood smears (TBS) which were then Giemsa-stained, and examined at 100 × magnification by experienced technicians to countLoaandMansonella perstansmf. Each TBS was read twice; the arithmetic mean was recorded. Prior exposure toOnchocerca volvuluswas assessed using the antibody detecting Onchocerciasis rapid test targeting Ov16 antigen (Drugs & Diagnostics for Tropical Diseases, San Diego, USA). Two skin snips were taken from seropositive individuals using a 2 mm Holth punch, incubated in saline at room temperature for 24 h and examined microscopically to count the emerged mf.O. volvulusMFD was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the two counts, expressed per snip.

Schistosoma haematobiuminfection was investigated in participants with haematuria detected by urine dipstick. Positive cases underwent urine filtration, Lugol staining, and microscopic examination for eggs. Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) were identified via microscopic examination of morning stool samples, transported within 6 h and processed immediately or after overnight storage at 6 °C. Stool smears were prepared using the Kato-Katz method and examined at 40 × magnification. For asymptomaticPlasmodiuminfection, thin blood films from venous blood (heparinized tube) were stained with RAL 555 (RAL Diagnostics, Martillac, France) and examined microscopically. An indirect ELISA was used to quantify the Immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies levels againstP. falciparumantigens [22].

Creatinine levels were measured for each patient in whole blood with a point-of-care device (iSTAT-1; Abbott Point of Care, Princeton, NJ, USA). For logistic reasons, glycated haemoglobin (Hb1Ac) and fasting serum total cholesterol level, triglycerides, HDL, and LDL were only measured in a random subset of patients, using a point-of-care device (Afinion 2, Abbott Rapid Diagnostics, Bièvres, France). Eosinophilia and lymphocyte counts were conducted using the HemoCue WBC DIFF system (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden).

Arterial stiffness was assessed through finger-toe pulse wave velocity (PWV) using the pOpmètre device (Axelife SAS, Paris, France), which records pulse waves via two infrared photodiode sensors at the finger and toe. This method is a validated, non-invasive alternative to carotid-femoral PWV, which requires skilled staff and femoral artery access [23].

The US examination of the kidneys was performed by experienced physicians (VD, LR) using a CX-50 device (Philips Medical Systems, Suresnes, France). Measurements included height, width, length. A second reading of the digital images (DICOM files) was performed to confirm and characterize kidney parenchymal or structure abnormalities (pyelocaliceal dilatation, cystic, or other description).

Each participant provided a morning midstream urine sample, following instructions from a trained nurse. Urinalysis was performed immediately using dipsticks (Reactif 10SL Urinalysis Strips, 41101-M, Nal von Minden, Moers, Germany) to detect proteinuria and haematuria. A single physician interpreted the results and did a second confirmatory dipstick if the initial result was positive. No discrepancies were observed. Haematuria was assessed as negative, traces, + , +  + , or +  +  + . Positive cases (≥ 1 +) underwent urine filtration and microscopic examination forS. haematobiumeggs. Proteinuria was classified as negative, traces (< 0.3 g/l), level–1 (0.3–1 g/l), level–2 (1–3 g/l), or level–3 (> 3 g/l). Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR, mg/mmol) was measured for proteinuria ≥ level–1 using the Afinion 2 device.

Given limited data on creatinine distribution and CKD in our population, we applied two formulas. First, the 2009 CKD-EPI equation without ethnicity factor, as current recommendation [24,25]. Second, the EKFC equation, a newer formula more robust across all ages [26,27]. Only one published Q-value (median normal creatininemia) exists for Central Africa [28], based on 494 urban individuals [25]. Therefore, we estimated our own Q-values by calculating median creatinine levels in individuals without HBP or renal abnormalities (proteinuria or haematuria). CKD-EPI and EKFC eGFRs were expressed in ml/min per 1.73 m2, and classified per KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines) categories [29]. Renal abnormalities (RAb) were defined as ACR > 3 mg/mmol or ≥ 1 + haematuria, excluding ultrasound-confirmed causes (9 cases of pyelocaliceal dilatation suggestive of lithiasis were excluded, as the associated haematuria was most likely of urological rather than nephrological origin and thus not indicative of intrinsic renal disease).

Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD); non-normal variables were reported as median (interquartile range). Explanatory variables included: age (continuous), sex (male/female), tobacco use (yes/no), MAP (continuous), PWV (≥ 12 vs. < 12 m/sec), lymphopenia (< 1200/µl), hypereosinophilia (> 1500/µl),Ascaris lumbricoidesand/orTrichuris trichiura(present/absent),LoaMFD (0, 1–7999, 8000–19 999, ≥ 20 000 mf/ml), anti-Plasmodium falciparumIgG (quartiles), andPlasmodiumsmears (negative/positive). BMI was not included since anthropometric parameters are integrated into eGFR estimations. Lipid profiles and diabetes were not included due to substantial missing data (see Results). The PWV cutoff (12 m/sec) reflects its established association with organ damage [30]. HIV status was unknown, but lymphopenia < 1200/µl was used as a proxy.

In our study, 25% weighed < 50 kg (10% < 45 kg, range: 30–120 kg), 25% had a height < 157 cm (10% < 152 cm, range: 141–190 cm), and 25% had a BMI < 18.9 kg/m2(10% < 17.8, range: 13.2–47.7). Given this heterogeneity, we chose to apply Dubois body surface area (BSA) correction to both CKD-EPI and EKFC equations to better assess associations. eGFR was calculated with CKD-EPI and then de-indexed using individual BSA via the Dubois formula: BSA = 0.007184 × Weight(kg)0.425× Height(cm)0.725, resulting in CKD-Dubois and EKFC-Dubois values (ml/min).

First, a saturated linear regression model on eGFR was performed. Because KDIGO-CKD staging could not be used directly in the regression analysis—due to the necessity of adjusting for BSA and the small number of participants in advanced CKD stages, which limited statistical power—we defined three alternative severity thresholds based on the distribution of eGFR values in our study population to investigate a potential gradient effect of CKD severity. These were the median (Cutoff-1), the 10th percentile (Cutoff-2) – corresponding to the global prevalence of CKD –, and the 2nd percentile (Cutoff-3) –reflecting the prevalence of advanced CKD. Thresholds were calculated separately for each equation. Given that the presence of RAb is an essential component of CKD staging, it was incorporated in the categorization and thus the categories were: “ ≥ Cutoff-1 & no RAb”, “ ≥ Cutoff-1 & RAb”, “Cutoff-1 – Cutoff-2 & no RAb”, “Cutoff-1 – Cutoff-2 & RAb”, “Cutoff-2 – Cutoff-3 & no RAb”, “Cutoff-2 – Cutoff-3 & RAb”, “ < Cutoff-3 & no RAb”, “ < Cutoff-3 & RAb”.

Due to the ordered nature of outcome variables, ordinal logistic models were initially considered. However, they were rejected after a Brant test indicated a proportional odds violation. Instead, multinomial logistic regression was used. A manual stepwise backward selection (P< 0.100) was applied to the saturated model via the likelihood ratio test. To prevent convergence failure,LoaMFD was re-categorized into three groups (0, 1–19 999, ≥ 20 000 mf/ml). Finally, potential interactions betweenLoaMFD, age, sex, and eosinophilia were assessed using the likelihood ratio test. After finalizing the model, we extracted risk probabilities. We then estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) from a logistic model including the final significant variables identified (age, sex, andLoamicrofilaremia as a binary variable) using the KDIGO CKD classification with the EKFC formula.

All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 18 (StataCorps LP, College Station, Texas, USA).

Among 990 participants, 986 (618 men, 368 women) underwent creatinine testing (Table1).Loamicrofilaremia was found in 353/986 (35.8%), with a median MFD of 2440 mf/ml. No infection with hookworm,S. mansoniorS. haematobiumwas found (94 individuals with haematuria: 11 traces/ + ; 83 +  + / +  + +).M. perstansmf were found in 6/981 (0.6%; MFD range: 20–660 mf/ml). Ov16 RDT was positive in 22 (2.2%), but noO. volvulusmf was detected. HbA1c was measured in 238 participants; one had > 6.5%. Lipid profiles (n= 233) showed total cholesterol > 2 g/l in 231 (99.1%), LDL > 1.6 g/l in 150 (64.4%), HDL < 0.4 g/l in 1 (0.4%), and triglycerides > 1.5 g/l in 33 (13.0%).

For the right kidney, mean (± standard deviation; range) dimensions were 9.36 cm (± 1.09; 2.72–14.60) in length, 3.39 cm (± 0.61; 1.74–9.78) in width, and 3.85 cm (± 0.56; 2.49–7.06) in thickness. For the left kidney, mean dimensions were 9.55 cm (± 1.13; 3.46–14.00), 3.45 cm (± 0.60; 1.30–5.45), and 3.95 cm (± 0.69; 2.09–11.04), respectively. Mean volumes were 65.49 cm3(right) and 69.76 cm3(± 24.06) (left). Nine individuals had a single kidney. A total of 109 kidney lesions were observed, predominantly cystic (none polycystic kidney disease), with 9 cases of pyelocaliceal dilatation.

Table2summarizes the classification definitions. CKD prevalence was estimated at 13.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.4–15.7%] with CKD-EPI and 17.6% (95%CI15.3–20.1%) with EKFC. Although there may be no direct correspondence, using KDIGO thresholds, prevalence reached 16.6% (95%CI14.4–19.1%) and 22.8% (95%CI20.3–25.6%) for CKD-Dubois and EKFC-Dubois, respectively. CKD stage ≥ 3 prevalence was 3.0% (95%CI2.1–4.3%) with CKD-EPI and 7.6% (95%CI6.1–9.4%) with EKFC. Stage 4 included only 2 (CKD-EPI) and 3 (EKFC) individuals; no participants were classified as stage 5.

Age was consistently associated with lower eGFR, regardless of RAb. For instance, in the EKFC-Dubois model, the coefficient for age was -0.85 (95%CI− 0.92, − 0.78;P< 0.001) in participants without RAb and -0.93 (95%CI− 1.16, − 0.70;P< 0.001) in those with RAb. Male sex was associated with higher eGFR only in participants without RAb (β= 8.54, 95%CI6.60, 10.48;P< 0.001), but not in those with RAb (β= 5.08, 95%CI− 1.58, 11.74;P= 0.133). Smoking was linked to lower eGFR, notably in those without RAb (β= − 2.16, 95%CI− 4.51, 0.18;P= 0.071 with EKFC-Dubois;β= − 3.41, 95%CI− 5.85, − 0.97;P= 0.006 with CKD-EPI-Dubois), but no significant association was found in those with RAb. PWV ≥ 12 m/sec was associated with lower eGFR in all subgroups. For instance, with EKFC-Dubois, in participants with RAb,βwas − 10.68 (95%CI− 20.50, − 0.87;P= 0.033), and in participants without RAb,βwas − 4.84 (95%CI− 8.20, − 1.47; P = 0.005). Lastly, loiasis showed a significant positive association: eGFR increased withLoaMFD, either as a categorical variable (Table3) or as a continuous variable (Supplementary Table 1), but only in participants with Rab. For example, individuals with 8000–19 999 mf/ml had an increase in eGFR compared to amicrofilaremic individuals:β= 14.13 (95%CI4.06, 24.20;P= 0.006 (EKFC-Dubois); those with ≥ 20 000 mf/ml also had higher eGFR, although not statistically significant (β= 9.01, 95%CI− 1.29, 19.31;P= 0.086).

Cutoff-1, cutoff-2 and cutoff-3 to categorize CKD severity corresponded to eGFRs of 90, 65, and 47 ml/min for the model using CKD-Dubois and 84, 56, and 41 ml/min for EKFC-Dubois. The repartition of the population in chronic kidney disease categories according to the study cutoffs using CKD-EPI- and EKFC-based estimated glomerular filtration rates is presented in Supplementary Table 2. The full models, including all tested variables, are presented in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. In both models, only age, sex, smoking, and PWV were significantly associated with CKD severity (Table4).

Age showed no association in early CKD but was progressively linked to increasing severity. For example, in the CKD-EPI Dubois model, the aRRR per year increase in age was 1.19 (95%CI1.14–1.24,P< 0.001) for the category eGFR 65–90 ml/min with RAb, and 1.28 (95%CI1.20–1.37,P< 0.001) for eGFR < 47 ml/min without RAb. Male sex was protective (e.g. aRRR = 0.09, 95%CI0.04–0.21,P< 0.001 for eGFR 65–90 with RAb, and 0.14, 95%CI0.04–0.45,P= 0.001 for eGFR < 47 without RAb). Smoking tended to increase risk, especially in stages without RAb (aRRR = 1.49, 95%CI0.92–2.40,P= 0.101; aRRR = 4.33, 95%CI1.77–10.56,P= 0.001, and aRRR = 7.89, 95%CI1.69–36.89,P= 0.009; for eGFR EKFC Dubois of [56–84, 41–56], and < 41 ml/min without RAb, respectively). High PWV affected all stages, with particularly elevated values in advanced stages with RAb (for instance, aRRR = 11.38, 95%CI1.85–152.70,P= 0.046, for eGFR < 41 ml/min with RAb according to EKFC Dubois). HigherLoaMFD was significantly associated with CKD compared to amicrofilaremic individuals, showing a dose–response relationship regardless of CKD category, especially in those with RAb. Compared to amicrofilaremic individuals, those withLoaMFD between 1 and 20 000 mf/ml had aRRR of 2.14 (95%CI1.12–4.08,P= 0.021) for the eGFR ≥ 84 ml/min category (EKFC Dubois) with RAb, 2.68 (95%CI1.25–5.72,P= 0.011) for 56–84 ml/min, 1.60 (95%CI0.49–5.17,P= 0.436) for 41–56 ml/min, and 1.10 (95%CI0.10–12.73,P= 0.939) for < 41 ml/min. Similarly, individuals with > 20 000 mf/ml had aRRR of 8.67 (95%CI2.62–28.64,P= 0.021) for eGFR ≥ 84 ml/min, 14.26 (95%CI3.41–59.68,P< 0.001) for 56–84 ml/min, 5.50 (95%CI0.55–61.78,P= 0.145) for 41–56 ml/min, and 26.21 (95%CI1.64–417.84,P= 0.021) for < 41 ml/min. However, no clear linear trend was seen regarding CKD severity; all groups with RAb exhibited consistent risks acrossLoaMFD levels.

Table5shows predicted CKD risk byLoaMFD (EKFC-Dubois formula). No significant interactions were found betweenLoaMFD and sex or hypereosinophilia (P= 0.191, and 0.352, respectively), but a significant interaction was observed with age (P< 0.001), especially in individuals with RAb. For clarity, this interaction is illustrated graphically (Supplementary Fig. 1). In participants < 50 years, higherLoaMFD quadrupled the probability of classifying as normal with RAb. In those ≥ 50 years,LoaMFD increased risk of more advanced CKD stages with RAb.

The PAF of CKD to female sex was the highest, estimated at 22.3% (95%CI10.2–32.7%) for CKD ≥ 1, and 23.2% (95%CI7.9–35.9%) for CKD ≥ 1 with RAb. This was followed by the PAF ofLoamicrofilaremia, estimated at 14.7% (95%CI4.3–24.0%) of CKD cases, and up to 30.1% (95%CI16.2–42.8%) with RAb. Arterial stiffness accounted for 4.4% (95%CI0.0–10.1%) and 3.7% (95%CI0.0–10.2%), respectively, while tobacco use explained 3.5% (95%CI0.0–8.9%) and 2.8% (95%CI0.0–10.4%) (Supplementary Table 5).

To clarify the lack of association with MAP, post-hoc analysis showed a significant interaction with age (P= 0.001): MAP affected individuals < 50 years but not older participants.

This study is the first to highlight a relationship betweenLoamicrofilaremia and CKD severity. We demonstrate for the first time a dose–response relationship betweenLoaMFD and CKD, though without a clear gradient with CKD severity. Interestingly, eGFR increases with parasitic density. This finding should be interpreted in light of the observation that, among individuals ≤ 50 years, higherLoaMFD raises the probability of early CKD stages, whereas among those > 50, higherLoaMFD increased probability of being in more advanced stages. This supports the hypothesis that chronic microfilaremia exposure may be required to develop renal impairment, possibly preceded by glomerular hyperfiltration, similar to diabetes. The association’s specificity to CKD categories with renal abnormalities suggests preferential glomerular involvement.

Our results align with existing literature. As widely described, age is a key determinant of CKD. Women were more at risk, independently of other factors, consistent with elsewhere [31]. Tobacco use was strongly associated with CKD, independently of MAP and PWV. The absence of association with MAP may seem surprising, but disappeared after age adjustment, likely due to an age-MAP interaction. This suggests that in younger individuals (< 50 years), blood pressure influences CKD risk, whereas age dominates in older participants.

Arterial stiffness, well established as a CKD factor [32], showed a stronger association in categories with renal abnormalities, consistent with its mechanism: increased pulsatile pressure damaging renal microcirculation, leading to hyperfiltration and proteinuria. Although the effect of arterial stiffness was largely independent of blood pressure, inclusion of the latter in the model led to ~ 20% reduction in arterial stiffness coefficients, suggesting partial mediation via hypertension-related nephroangiosclerosis.

We observed no impact of arterial stiffness or MAP on theLoa-CKD association, arguing against a primarily circulatory mechanism. However, we cannot fully exclude it, as previous studies linkedLoaMFD to arterial stiffness [8]. Available case reports suggest glomerular involvement to be the predominant form of kidney damage, in the form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis linked to complement activation, membranous nephropathy with IgG, complement, and/or immune complex deposition [33–36], or even renal amyloidosis [37,38] due to chronic low-grade inflammation. Tubulointerstitial involvement appears less likely but has been reported [19], particularly post-antifilarial treatment [39]. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely exclude a secondary inflammatory effect related to vascular stiffness that could contribute to kidney damage. Only kidney biopsy could definitively characterize the type and mechanism of renal involvement.

We also provide figures of CKD prevalence in the general population of the Republic of Congo, estimated between 13.4% (95%CI11.4–15.7%, CKD-EPI) and 17.6% (95%CI15.3–20.1%, EKFC) for stages 1–5, and between 3.0% (95%CI2.1–4.3%, CKD-EPI) and 7.6% (95%CI6.1–9.4%, EKFC) for stages 3–5. Currently, CKD prevalence is estimated at 13.4% (95%CI11.7–15.1) for CKD ≥ 1 and 10.6% (95%CI9.2–12.2) for CKD stages ≥ 3, with estimates for Africa at 8.7% (95%CI1.3–16.0) for CKD ≥ 1 and 7.6% (95%CI6.1–9.1) for CKD stages ≥ 3 [40]. A second meta-analysis focusing on African studies reported an overall CKD prevalence of 10.1% (95%CI9.8–10.5) [41]. Central African countries seem to have higher CKD prevalence, as in South Kivu (12.2%, 95%CI10.2–14.2) [42], or rural Cameroon (3–14.1%) [43]; our estimates fall within the upper range of these figures. We also show that 14.7% (95%CI4.3–24.0%) of CKD cases could have been avoided if no individuals had been microfilaremic. Together, our results suggest that loiasis may partly explain CKD cases of unknown cause, for instance in Cameroon, where the aetiology of CKD has been reported to be unknown in 13.5–17.0% of cases [43].

Our study has several limitations. First, CKD diagnosis relied on a single creatinine measurement, which does not strictly meet the criteria for CKD classification. HIV status was unavailable; however, no lymphopenia were observed in CKD stage ≥ 3, limiting likely HIV impact. Data on tenofovir exposure, which could contribute to tubulopathies, were also lacking. Given population heterogeneity and frequent short stature, true CKD prevalence likely falls within a range around our estimates, hence our application of Dubois corrections. Cystatin C measurement would have improved classification. Lastly, our study confirms the absence of association between STH, and malaria on kidney function in this population.

We demonstrate for the first time the detrimental impact of loiasis on kidney function, likely mediated by glomerular involvement after chronic exposure. Given its high prevalence in Central Africa, loiasis may contribute significantly to unexplained nephropathies at the population level.
