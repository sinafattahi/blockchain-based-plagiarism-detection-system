Grounded in the conservation of the resource theory, this study aims to investigate the impact of organizational cronyism on the psychological withdrawal behavior of employees with the mediating role of organizational disidentification and moderating role of employability. Data were collected in two-time waves from 267 IT employees. The study’s findings revealed organizational cronyism increases psychological withdrawal behavior through organizational disidentification. Moreover, employability reduces the negative impact of organizational cronyism on organizational disidentification. This study contributes to the literature on organizational cronyism by highlighting the mediating role of organizational disidentification and the moderating role of employability. The study concludes by highlighting the conclusion, managerial and theoretical implications along with limitations and future research directions.

Organizational cronyism poses ongoing challenges to different workplaces, mainly affecting developing nations, by providing undeserved benefits to people who lack professional qualifications through personal connections rather than professional qualifications [1,2]. A recent employee survey in India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asian countries shows that 60% of workers identify favoritism and informal connections as important influencing factors for their career progression [3,4]. Moreover, a survey by Transparency International (2020) showed that Pakistani civil servants believed personal contacts played a bigger role in promotion decisions than actual performance. The IT sector, with its fast-paced nature of innovation, short deadlines, and immense employee turnover, faces significant challenges from cronyism, leading to damaged team relationships and diminished employee spirit while blocking potential talent [5,6]. Employee reactions to perceiving unfair rewards and opportunities distribution result in work disengagement through psychological withdrawal that manifests as decreased effort as well as employee silence and emotional detachment [2,7]. Psychological withdrawal behavior represents a subtle but significant sign of organizational dysfunction that produces poor performance, along with high turnover rates, in addition to a toxic work environment [8]. The understanding of psychological withdrawal stemming from organizational cronyism requires attention due to its subtle yet destructive properties.

The organization’s unfairness in decision-making, performance appraisal, and reward allocation hurts employees’ performance, quality of work, and psychological well-being, because such conditions continuously drain employees’ essential resources [9,11]. One type of such environment is organizational cronyism which is known as “misuse of power for rewarding friends and relatives based on some personal relations rather than actual performance criteria [12]. It can be demonstrated in different ways, for instance organization leaders may protect, reward, promote, and assign important tasks to certain employees based on personal relations such as friends and relatives to maintain a harmonious relationship [1,13]. Such practices in organizations have detrimental effects on those who are deprived of such types of benefits [14]. Organizational cronyism is a prevalent phenomenon in organizations, but there are limited empirical studies on this concept [15].

We relied on the conservation of resource theory [16] to explain how and when organizational cronyism translates into psychological withdrawal behavior. This study tried to answer the how question by explaining when certain employees are favored and enjoy expectational benefits by the organizations, the others feel destitute and unfairness in the organizations. In line with COR theory [16], employees have limited resources; thus, their essential resources are exhausted when they encounter favoritism and unequal treatment at the workplace [7]. Due to unfairness and unequal treatment by the organization, the employees do not feel part of the organization and start to avoid participation in organizational matters [17]. Thus, leading towards organizational disidentification defined as “the extent to which employees psychologically detach themselves from the organization” [18]. Additionally, when employees experience that some employees are rewarded based on relationships or friendship and others are ignored they begin to avoid participating in organizational matters [19]. This disidentification may lead to psychological withdrawal behavior [1].

We propose resource-draining organizational cronyism arouses a sense of organizational disidentification which provokes employee psychological withdrawal behavior and employability acts as a buffer such that the translation of organizational cronyism into organizational disidentification is low when employees have limited job-switching options in the market.

Previous research has shown that organizational cronyism leads to undesirable outcomes such as deviant workplace behavior, employee negligence, and lower employee performance [2,10,20], but it has not explored the exact relationship between cronyism and employee psychological withdrawal behavior. Additionally, the impact of organizational disidentification on the connection between cronyism and psychological withdrawal behavior has not been sufficiently studied. While employability has been analyzed in various organizational settings, its moderating effects on the cronyism-disidentification-psychological withdrawal link remain underexplored [21].

Based on the above discussion, it has been concluded that organizational cronyism continues to grow, but multiple imperative research gaps still exist within existing academic literature. First, there is a limited understanding of the psychological mechanisms linking organizational cronyism to employee withdrawal behaviors. Numerous studies reveal the adverse effects of cronyism, but they have not extensively examined how emotional and cognitive processes lead employees to psychological withdrawal through disidentification [1,2]. Second, Studies have not investigated the boundary factors sufficiently to determine when cronyism effects become stronger or weaker. Perceived employability among employees represents an individual-level resource that requires more theoretical attention when studying outcomes of organizational cronyism [12,22]. Third, by offering empirical investigation from a non-Western, collectivist, and high power distance culture where social ties, loyalty, and hierarchical norms impact workplace dynamics, this study fills the Western-centric gap in cronyism research [23,24]. According to research, cronyism is frequently perceived in these cultures as a useful tactic for advancing one’s career rather than as immoral behavior [25]. Furthermore, employees in collectivist societies are more psychologically impacted by perceived exclusion from in-groups [22]. Additionally, employees in collectivist societies are more psychologically impacted by perceived exclusion from in-groups [26]. These institutional and cultural traits intensify the detrimental effects of cronyism, setting the study’s results apart from those in Western settings and adding new perspectives to the body of research worldwide.

The study attempts to address these research gaps through investigations of employee withdrawal behavior mechanisms, together with boundary conditions that influence these effects, and collecting empirical evidence from non-Western developing countries. Addressing these research gaps will create an extensive understanding of how cronyism influences employee behaviors globally.

This study presents three main contributions to understanding organizational behavior. First, this study expands the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory [11] through evidence which shows that organizational cronyism drains employee psychological resources because of disidentification which occurs when workers distance themselves emotionally from their organization due to organizational cronyism. Second, perceived employability functions as a significant boundary condition protecting workers from cronyism-related negative effects by offering a protective mechanism within negative workplace settings. Third, The Western predominance in cronyism research is addressed in this study by analyzing it in a non-Western, collectivist culture with a high power distance, where cronyism is viewed as a socially acceptable norm associated with hierarchy and loyalty [23]. In these cultures, cronyism causes psychological withdrawal and disidentification because of perceived in-group favoritism, in contrast to Western environments where it is seen negatively [27]. This study adds new perspectives to the available literature on organizational cronyism by demonstrating how cultural norms impact employee conduct.

To address the above-stated gaps, this research utilizes the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory [11] to develop and test a model that investigates the processes through which organizational cronyism can lead to psychological withdrawal. According to COR theory [11], employees aim to safeguard their essential resources, particularly fairness and support; thus, psychological withdrawal behavior may occur when these valuable resources are threatened due to cronyism [1]. The proposed framework demonstrates how disidentification acts as a critical psychological process that enables cronyism to exhaust employee emotional and cognitive abilities, resulting in psychological withdrawal behaviors. The study examines perceived employability as a significant boundary condition that protects against this negative relationship. Employees with good employment replacement options tend to experience less psychological impact from organizational cronyism, thus reducing their likelihood to withdraw [11]. This study bridges theory and practice by testing the proposed model using non-Western IT sector employees which results in deeper cultural evidence about how organizational cronyism affects workplace behavior.

Along with the theoretical contribution we have also discussed the practical implication of the study for instance, the research demonstrates how organizational cronyism creates negative effects on employee well-being and social status. Managers must develop an environment of trust together with fairness which results in equal rewards and punishments to stop employee disengagement. Before making hiring decisions HR managers need to stay alert for signs of favoritism because equal opportunities require their attention. Leadership training helps employees understand cronyism impacts and develops inclusive approaches to decision-making. Monitoring cronyism activities within the organization is an HR responsibility while establishing support programs through mentorship and counseling for employees who face its negative effects. The analysis investigates both organizational disidentification and employability factors enable employees to withstand cronyism conditions despite restricted employment opportunities.

Organizational cronyism is defined as favoring certain individuals in the workplace, typically based on personal relationships rather than merit [26]. This bias often manifests in various forms, such as preferential promotions, salary increases, or project assignments [12]. Employees who are the subject of such favoritism may feel overlooked or unappreciated, especially when the influence of personal connections overshadows their hard work and talents [28]. The perception of injustice caused by organizational cronyism leads to decreased organizational commitment [29], lower job satisfaction, and reduced performance [1,13].

When cronyism prevails within an organization, the psychological withdrawal behavior of employees often follows. Psychological withdrawal refers to the process in which employees disengage from their work mentally, emotionally, and physically [31]. This includes behaviors like emotional detachment, absenteeism, disengagement from team activities, and reduced effort toward work responsibilities [30].

In the lens of COR theory [32], employees view their work as a resource that requires protection. When cronyism is perceived, it can represent a threat to this valuable resource, particularly an employee’s sense of fairness and career progression [33]. The emotional cost of being overlooked in favor of someone less qualified or deserving can cause stress, which leads employees to conserve their remaining resources by withdrawing mentally and emotionally from their jobs [34]. The IT industry places a heavy emphasis on skill development alongside performance that makes cronyism particularly damaging to employee motivation. A skilled worker who continuously works hard on their project feels defeated when they observe a less qualified coworker receiving recognition or promotion due to superior connections with management. When employees discover that a less competent person received recognition or promotion due to their relationship with management, they develop motivation loss and detachment with the organization [21,35]. The employee may begin to feel their efforts are useless, thus initiating psychological withdrawal behavior such as reduced participation and absenteeism [1,34–36].

Employees subjected to cronyism may not only become disengaged from their work, but they might also lose trust in the organization’s values, further escalating their psychological withdrawal [37]. The sense of injustice caused by cronyism can erode their organizational commitment and result in reduced productivity or even burnout over time [33,38]. This hypothesis proposes that employees who perceive cronyism in the workplace are more likely to disengage emotionally and mentally from their work, as they feel their efforts are undervalued or ignored in favor of those with personal connections.

Organizational cronyism is positively related to psychological withdrawal behavior among employees.

Organizational dis-identification is a phenomenon that occurs when employees distance themselves emotionally and cognitively from the organization due to negative experiences, such as unfair treatment, or when they feel their values no longer align with those of the organization [38,39]. Disidentification is a significant coping mechanism that employees may employ when they feel disillusioned or betrayed by their organization [17]. In the framework of COR theory [16], organizational cronyism threatens employees’ resources which include fairness, trust, and career opportunities. Employees who face the stress of cronyism might experience a loss of their emotional and psychological resources for instance trust in the leader, psychological well-being, motivation, and specifically, their sense of trust and attachment to the organization [18,40]. Employees who want to manage their stress and safeguard their remaining resources typically choose disidentification by mentally and emotionally distancing themselves from their organization. When they perceive that their contributions are disregarded due to favoritism, they may begin to mentally disengage from the organization as a means of preserving their emotional well-being [40,41].

The process of organizational dis-identification acts as a mediator between the experience of cronyism and the manifestation of psychological withdrawal. As employees begin to feel alienated due to unfair practices like cronyism, their emotional attachment to the organization weakens [20]. Once employees mentally detach from their organization, they become less motivated to align their goals with those of the company, resulting in psychological withdrawal behaviors [12]. They may stop participating in team discussions, become less invested in their work, or even reduce their efforts in collaborative projects [17]. For instance, in the IT sector, a software engineer who consistently experiences cronyism where promotions and special projects are given to colleagues with personal ties to the management may gradually lose their sense of belonging and commitment to the organization. They may begin to feel like an outsider, unable to contribute meaningfully to the organization’s mission or objectives. This feeling of alienation leads them to disengage from their work, manifesting as psychological withdrawal mentally [32].

The concept of disidentification has been linked to negative outcomes, such as job dissatisfaction, turnover intentions, and emotional exhaustion [41,42]. As employees mentally detach themselves from an organization, they experience a decline in their emotional attachment and an increase in withdrawal behaviors [17,43]. The research indicates that disidentification functions as a key factor that links organizational cronyism to psychological withdrawal behaviors because employees choose to disengage from their work to protect their emotional and psychological resources, thus avoiding further resource reduction [16]. This hypothesis suggests that the experience of organizational cronyism can lead to dis-identification, which in turn promotes psychological withdrawal behavior. As employees feel less connected to the organization due to cronyism, their level of engagement and emotional investment decreases, leading to disengagement and reduced involvement in their work.

Organizational dis-identification mediates the relationship between organizational cronyism and psychological withdrawal behavior.

Employability refers to the ability of an employee to maintain and improve their career prospects through the acquisition of relevant skills, knowledge, and competencies [43,44]. Employability is often considered a crucial resource that allows employees to manage their career development effectively and seek out new opportunities when necessary [45]. The moderating role of employability becomes apparent when employees experience organizational stressors such as cronyism. In the context of COR theory [16], employability can be viewed as a valuable resource that helps employees buffer the emotional and psychological impact of negative workplace experiences [46]. Employees with high employability believe they can secure new employment, whether inside or outside the organization [46]. This sense of confidence and mobility makes them less vulnerable to the negative effects of cronyism. They may see cronyism as an unfair practice but might not feel as threatened or demotivated, knowing that they have the skills and marketability to transition to a different role or company.

On the other hand, employees with low employability may feel trapped in their current situation, especially if they perceive few job opportunities outside the organization. This lack of perceived mobility can heighten feelings of frustration and helplessness, making these employees more likely to experience psychological withdrawal behavior [47]. They may feel that they have no choice but to accept the unfair situation, leading to disengagement, reduced motivation, and emotional detachment from their work [1]. In the IT industry, for instance, a skilled software developer who feels undervalued because of cronyism but believes in their high employability might not feel as demotivated. Their confidence in their abilities and career prospects might reduce the negative impact of cronyism on their work performance. In contrast, an employee who feels their skills are outdated or that they have limited career prospects might experience heightened withdrawal behaviors as they feel stuck in a toxic work environment.

Research has shown that high employability can mitigate the effects of workplace stressors, including job dissatisfaction and burnout [45]. Employees with greater career mobility are less likely to become disengaged when faced with organizational problems because they have a greater sense of control over their career trajectory. This hypothesis posits that employability acts as a protective factor. Employees who perceive high employability are less likely to disengage emotionally from their work when faced with cronyism, as they feel confident in their ability to secure alternative job opportunities. Conversely, employees with lower employability are more likely to exhibit withdrawal behavior due to a perceived lack of career alternatives.

Employees aim to acquire and defend valuable resources through the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory while safeguarding their self-esteem and work identity [16]. The psychological resources that work to maintain self-esteem and work identity will be reduced when employees experience organizational cronyism because exclusion and unfairness develop a state of disidentification [34]. The relationship between cronyism and disidentification becomes weaker when employability acts as an intervening resource. Highly employable workers recognize alternative positions in the market which protects their psychological resources and alleviates disidentification effects [45]. The phenomenon of low employability creates resource scarcity for workers who become more vulnerable in situations of cronyism thus leading to increased disidentification. Employability functions as a moderator between cronyism and disidentification because it determines the strength of resource conservation. (See Fig.1).

Employability moderates the relationship between organizational cronyism and psychological withdrawal behavior, such that employees with higher employability exhibit lower levels of psychological withdrawal behavior.

Data have been collected from the IT sector. Considering the importance and frequency of social media usage, the current study exploits social media platforms as a main source of data collection. The following social platforms were utilized e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. The IT industry was picked because of its competitive, hierarchical systems, which make cronyism more likely to influence employee behavior, including psychological withdrawal behavior. Because job advancement in IT companies most of the time depends on unofficial networks, this industry is a perfect place to study the relationship between employability and organizational cronyism. Because it offers a pertinent setting where these dynamics are especially noticeable, this context directly supports the goals of the study.We utilized social media to contact participants because it allowed us to include diverse participants from different geographic areas who work in the IT industry. The research included participants who worked in the IT field at present to establish correct and applicable responses. The online data collection method helped to minimize costs and increased participant response rates in both waves. After getting approval from the admins of different IT groups on social media platforms the link of the questionnaire was shared with the potential participants.

Formal informed consent was also included in the questionnaire. Data were collected in two time waves using a survey-based and quantitative research design. Organizational cronyism, employability, and organizational disidentification were measured at time lag 1, and psychological withdrawal behavior was measured at time lag 2. During the first wave researchers assigned a distinct identification number to every participant. During the second wave we retrieved second-round participants through their email addresses and social media profiles that they had previously provided in the initial wave. To ensure confidentiality and anonymity of participants, we employed two different matching methods to verify participants between the first and second waves. These methods were specifically designed to maintain data integrity while protecting participants’ privacy.

In every round, we ensured the participants that their personal and confidential information would not be shared with anyone else except the research team. Additionally, the individual- level response will not be present anywhere, only an aggregate response will be shown in the research report. It was also elaborated to the participants that there are not any right and wrong answers all the participants may have different answers of the same question. All the participants are fully free to quit the survey at any time without any penalty. This study employed a two-wave data collection method to minimize common method bias while establishing time-based relationships among variables, which strengthened the analysis of cause-and-effect relationships. This approach increases the validity and reliability of the results.

The sample size was determined by multiplying the number of items by 10 to find a suitable sample size [48]. This approach ensures a sufficient sample size to fulfill statistical power and minimize overfitting risk as per standard methodological practice.

A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed in the first round, and 374 were returned. In the second round, 309 were received. After discarding incomplete surveys, we used 267 complete and properly filled responses for statistical analysis. We discarded the responses having missing data for instance, incomplete questionnaires, participants who started the responses but did not complete it due to some reason such as connectivity etc. we also discarded those questionnaires which were not filled by the participants in the second wave. During the screening of data, we discarded those responses having a high inconsistency pattern. By applying these exclusion criterias, we ensured the robustness of the data.

The demographics showed 26.6% of respondents belong to software development, 44.9% were IT consultants, and 28.5% were network engineers. Additionally, 11.2% of participants have 5–10 years of experience, 4.1% have 11–15 years of experience, 53.2% have 16–20 years of experience, and 31.5% have 21 and above experience. Furthermore, 2.6%, 36.3%, 32.2%, 28.8% belong to the age category of 20–25, 26–30, 31–35, and above 36 years respectively. Related to the gender category 76% were male and 24% were females.

We used a five-point Likert scale to measure all variables ranging 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree.

We measured organizational cronyism with 7 items scale developed by Arasli and Tumer [22]. Sample items include “Employees in this organization always feel that they need a relative in a high level position” (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).

We measured employability with 4 items scale developed Lam et al. [43]. Sample items include “I can easily find another job elsewhere instead of my present job” (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).

We measured organizational disidentification with 6 items scale developed by Kreiner and Ashforth [50]. The sample items include “I am embarrassed to be part of this organization” (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92).

We measured psychological withdrawal behavior with 6 items scale developed by Lehman and Simpson [31] sample items include “Spent too much time fantasizing or daydreaming instead of working”. (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93).

Before hypothesis testing, we confirmed the measurement model through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA not only confirmed the distinctiveness of all the variables but it also confirmed that the model is free from common method bias. Table1shows all the indicators meet the threshold criteria IFI = 0.958, TLI = 0.952, CFI = 0.958 and RMSEA = 0.054 [51,52].

Table2shows the descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, average variance extracted (AVE), and square root of (AVE). Convergent validity and discriminant validity have been used to determine the construct validity of the model [49]. All the values of AVE were above the threshold criteria, which is 0.5 thus proved the convergent validity [49,53]. An additional criteria proposed by Fornell & Larcker (1981) has been used to determine the discriminant validity of the model. This criteria demands the square root of all the variables should be greater than their correlations, which is also established in this model (showed on a diagonal in Table2) [54]. Additionally, the alpha reliabilities of organizational cronyism, organizational disidentification, employability, and psychological withdrawal behavior are 0.89, 0.92, 0.98.0.93 which are also meeting the cut off criteria which 0.6 (Hair et al., 2014).

The correlation results showed organization cronyism is positively and significantly related with organizational disidentification (r= 0.23,P <0.05), negatively and significantly related to employability (r= -0.24,P <0.05), positively and significantly related to psychological withdrawal behavior (r= 0.319,P <0.05). Organizational disidentification is negatively and significantly related with employability (r= − 0.296,P <0.01), and positively and significantly related to psychological withdrawal behavior (r= 0.156,P <0.01). Employability is negatively and significantly related with psychological withdrawal behavior (r= -0.149,P <0.05).

For hypothesis analysis, we used PROCESS macro developed by [55] hayes Particularly we relied on PROCESS model 8 to test the full moderated mediated model which is accurately suitable for our model. The statistical results of mediation analysis have been showed in Table3. Hypothesis1stated organizational cronyism is positively impacted on employee psychological withdrawal behavior. The statistical results proved hypothesis1(β = 0.306,p <0.01), therefore, hypothesis1is accepted.

Hypothesis stated organizational disidentification mediates the relationship between organizational cronyism and employee psychological withdrawal behavior. The indirect effect between organizational cronyism and employee psychological withdrawal behavior through organizational disidentification has been proved as proved by the 95% bootstrapped confidence interval which did not contain zero (0.0036, 0.0535). Thus, the indirect effect has been proved and hypothesis2is accepted (see Table3).

stated employability moderates the relationship between organizational cronyism and organizational disidentification. The statistical results also proved the moderation effect of employability between organizational cronyism and organizational disidentification (-0.1306, p  < 0.005). The statistical results indicated there will be a weaker effect of organization cronyism on organizational disidentification in presence of high employability. Hence, hypothesis3is also accepted. The statistical results have been presented in Table4.

This study contributes to the present literature by highlighting the threat that organizational cronyism heightens into psychological withdrawal behavior. These two factors represent significant but under studied topics of job performance and organizational politics respectively. In line with the available literature, organizational cronyism results in organizational deviant behavior [21], lower employee performance [13], and organizational disloyalty. We examined the unnoticed outcome of organizational cronyism and the antecedent of psychological withdrawal behavior: organizational disidentification. Relying on COR theory [16], we launch the critical role of employee disidentification and establish a buffering role of employability in this scenario.

As an initial theoretical insight, this study explores that perception of organizational cronyism in decision-making and reward allocation leads victims towards lower performance, delay in fulfilling their tasks, and discontinuation from the organization. In line with the COR theory [16], when organizational leaders show injustice in decision-making and reward allocations, organizational disidentification acts as a coping mechanism that helps employees to mitigate the negative effect of organizational cronyism. As a consequence, employees put less effort into fulfilling their tasks and going the extra mile. Thus, increases the risk of psychological withdrawal behavior [45].

The next key insight involves how the negative effect of organizational cronyism on organizational disidentification can be controlled. As predicted, organizational disidentification is less influential when fewer employment opportunities exist as confirmed by recent research [10]. Particularly in developing countries employees have limited career advancement opportunities and the employees have to continue their jobs even in adverse consequences [10]. Additionally, when employees have fewer job options they may feel helpless and petrified, therefore, they cannot afford to indulge in organizational disidentification. Thus, in this scenario, employees may be less motivated to leave the organization or search for more jobs even when they experience injustice in the organization [20]. Employees prefer to tolerate organizational cronyism due to limited job options. Therefore, low employability can inhibit the effect of organizational cronyism on employees’ disidentification with the organization, employees feel trapped in their current jobs and do not show overt disidentification with the organization but as a coping strategy they psychologically confine themselves from the organization. The study results show that in the presence of low employability employees passively respond to organizational cronyism instead of an active response such as disidentification.

This study adds to understanding the effect of organizational cronyism on individual behavior. It also deepens the theoretical insights into how the practices of organizational cronyism can result in psychological withdrawal behavior. The results expand the current literature about organizational cronyism’s effects on psychological withdrawal because previous research inadequately explored this relationship [56].

By exploring organizational disidentification as a mediator in the connection between organizational cronyism and psychological withdrawal behavior, this study advances COR theory [32]and helps readers understand how employees psychologically detach themselves from the organization when they experience organizational cronyism. The study extends COR theory by demonstrating organizational disidentification as the main mechanism through which cronyism affects employee psychological withdrawal behavior thus filling a significant gap in the current theoretical framework [57].

The buffering role of employability add a new and exciting layer to the existing studies of motivation, performance and retention [44]. The research provides essential insight into how individual employability acts to lessen the effect of organizational cronyism which remains inadequately explored in academic literature [44].

The role of employability clarifies when employees do not have multiple alternative job options they have to survive and attached to the organization in any circumstances. Research shows that the availability of other employment opportunities influences employee reactions to organizational cronyism because limited career opportunities lead employees to accept cronyism without resistance thus has important implications for employee behavior patterns and retention strategies.

because employees in challenging environments may tolerate cronyism instead of leaving work, which matters significantly for organizational behavior theories and staff retention strategies.

This study provides meaningful implications for managers to practice. Organizational cronyism hurts employee’s well-being and social status. Due to its undesirable consequences for the victim and in the long run for the organizations [12], the managers need to take proactive measures to halt such practices in several ways in the organization.

First, managers need to establish transparent systems for making decisions and setting criteria for promotion through structured evaluations in order to reduce negative outcomes from cronyism. Management decisions require multi-level reviews to minimize bias through contributions from several supervisory groups and committees. For example, the managers should adopt multiple transparent performance measurement techniques through 360-degree feedback, which allows managers to establish open reward and punishment methods that replace current vague relationship-dependent practices. Second, it’s the responsibility of the employees they should raise their voice instead of silence against organizational cronyism. The managers should cultivate a culture of trust and fairness by allocating an equitable rewards and punishment system to avoid disengagement and disidentification of employees [28]. For instance, managers must develop a secure reporting channel that gives employees a way to report cases of favoritism or unfair treatment through anonymous systems including online platforms or independent services. Third, organizations that provide career development opportunities to workers reduce the negative psychological impact of perceived injustice through improved employee perceived employability. Organizations need to offer support systems, including counseling services and anonymous feedback tools, to assist employees dealing with organizational injustice. By taking these steps, employers cultivate workplace equity and minimize personnel detachment caused by cronyism. Fourth, organizations should implement training sessions on fair leadership and accountability to minimize the occurrence of informal favoritism. Leadership and managers’ training programs could help in promoting the awareness of justice in the organization and highlighting the adverse effects of organizational cronyism. When managers are well educated regarding the harmful impact of organizational cronyism they will try to build an atmosphere of transparent decision-making, trust, and inclusion, which could reduce the occurrence of organizational cronyism.

Despite of several contributions, this study also has some limitations which open new opportunities for future studies. First, data have been collected from the IT professional by using a robust technique but there are chances that most of the employees who experience cronyism might not have social media accounts thus the true representation of employees remains questionable. Secondly, the findings of this study cannot be generalized to the other sectors with lower mobility and less dynamic job markets. This study took place within a cultural environment marked by collectivism and high power distance and relational norms, so these factors substantially influence employee reactions to cronyism. Non-Western developing countries accept hierarchical favoritism alongside close interpersonal relationships as inherent elements in their workplace interactions. The employees tend to accept cronyism because they see it as a practical approach instead of an ethical problem. The formation of social networks results in diminished emotional attachments when employee experience the exclusion experienced by others in these networks. People in different cultures demonstrate different responses than Western individualistic societies which highly value merit-based recognition. The research identifies important patterns about how cronyism affects psychological well-being within high-context cultures, yet researchers must avoid applying these findings to broader cultural contexts. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct additional research to examine the impact of organizational cronyism in different cultural settings and in diverse sectors.

This study is primarily based on the participants who were active on social media, which may not fully represent the larger population in terms of demographic diversity e.g., age, gender, education and geographic location etc. The data collection methods were limited to IT industry employees thus the study results might vary among different occupational sectors. The working conditions between employees in IT differ substantially from those in healthcare as well as finance and education sectors. Research exploring these variations should include different industry sectors as future work. We use employability as a buffering factor between organizational cronyism and organizational disidentification. There may be other potential factors which could be used to lower the negative relationship between organizational cronyism and organizational disidentification such as organizational justice and employee resilience. Third, this study lacked additional control variables including work experience and position because researchers wanted to maintain a clear analysis. Future studies need to study these elements to advance the available literature. Additionally, the study presents an unbalanced gender sample distribution with a majority of male participants. Future studies should include equal male and female participants to validate results across both genders.

The research investigates how organizational cronyism affects employee psychological withdrawal by utilizing organizational disidentification as a mediator factor and employability as a moderator. We utilized the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory to explain how workplace favoritism leads to increased frequency of employee psychological withdrawal behaviors. Organizational disidentification arises from the cronyism phenomenon which creates workplace alienation and increased withdrawal behaviors. The research demonstrates that employee perceptions of employability reduce their disidentification with the organization regardless of cronyism circumstances. The study indicates cronyism leads to negative consequences for employee engagement because it produces feelings of unfairness which creates detachment between employees and their workplace. Employees with better employability skills become more resilient to negative impacts from cronyism since they maintain better control over their options outside the organization. Organizations that implement cronyism prevention strategies together with career development initiatives will help reduce negative impacts on employee psychological well-being. The research sheds light on workplace cronyism behavior patterns while providing organizations with useful methods for creating positive work environments. Research should extend beyond this study to identify new elements that may affect how cronyism influences employee behaviors.
