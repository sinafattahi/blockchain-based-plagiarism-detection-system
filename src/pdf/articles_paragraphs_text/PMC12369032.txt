Quality of work life (QWL) describes how well members of an organization can meet their personal needs through their work experiences. For healthcare organizations, maintaining a high QWL is essential to attract, retain, and motivate qualified and dedicated employees, which in turn enhances task performance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess QWL and its associated factors among nurses in Ethiopia.

The databases PubMed, Hinari, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar were searched for original studies published up to August 2024. Cross-sectional studies assessing the QWL among nurses in Ethiopia and published in peer-reviewed journals in English were included. Two independent reviewers completed the study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used for quality assessment. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled mean and prevalence of QWL and associated factors, with heterogeneity assessed using I² test statistics.

Out of 161 studies screened, six studies with a total of 1,958 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Quality of work life score and the prevalence of good QWL were low among nurses working in Ethiopia. The meta-regression analysis yielded inconclusive results regarding factors associated with poor QWL, primarily due to the limited number of studies included.

QWL among Ethiopian nurses is considerably low. Enhancing their salaries and educational status, along with ensuring a secure working environment, could improve their professional quality of life and, consequently, overall health delivery.

Nursing is an incredibly demanding profession, playing a crucial role in healthcare delivery. Nurses, who form the most diverse and abundant workforce in the healthcare system, are responsible for making quick decisions regarding patient care and well-being. Enhancing the Quality of Work Life (QWL) for staff nurses is essential for improving patient care quality [1,2].

Quality of Work Life refers to the extent to which nurses can meet their personal needs while achieving organizational goals [3]. This balance enhances their productivity, reduces turnover rates, and mitigates psycho-social impacts. Improving QWL is linked to better healthcare service quality and cost efficiency, as well as reductions in mortality, morbidity, and overall quality of care. However, various studies indicate that a significant proportion of nurses experience a poor quality of work life [4,5].

The QWL for health professionals varies significantly based on factors such as country or region, urban or rural settings, private or government facility and specific challenges within each healthcare system. Common factors impacting QWL across the continent include inadequate budgetary allocations to health, poor leadership and management, high workloads, lack of training and support, adverse working conditions, community-related issues, and the impact of postings on nurses’ private lives [6–9]. Poor working conditions and a perceived lack of recognition are major demotivating factors, contributing to decreased QWL among health professionals [7,8].

A cross-sectional study of 2,391 nurses in 85 Iranian public hospitals found low quality of work life, with 69.3% expressing dissatisfaction. Major influencing factors included lack of organizational support in solving staff problems, inadequate and unfair payment, job insecurity, poor management support, high job stress, unfair promotion policies, and insufficient involvement in decision-making [10]. Another study from Oman found that nurses exhibited moderate levels of QWL, with a mean total score of 179.99 ± 24.17. Significant predictors of QWL included job designation (P= 0.041) and nationality (P< 0.001) [11].

A study assessing the levels of professional quality of life and job satisfaction among nurses at tertiary hospitals in central Ethiopia found that most participants reported medium levels of compassion satisfaction, with many experiencing moderate to high levels of compassion fatigue. The study identified predictors of QWL such as marital status, education, and experience [12]. Another study assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and associated factors among healthcare providers at comprehensive specialized hospitals in Ethiopia revealed that over half of the participants experienced a poor quality of life [13].

We observed that various studies with diverse findings have been conducted in various regions of Ethiopia with the aim of evaluating the QWL among nurses, but there is still no comprehensive and pooled estimate of QWL and associated factors amongst nurses in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. First, it aims to synthesis evidence on the overall QWL status and associated factors among nurses working in Ethiopia. Second, it aimed to impact policy makers and higher officials to focus on better and more conducive employment conditions for nurses to enhance the healthcare delivery of the country.

This study was conducted based The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline [14]. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, Registration ID: CRD42022384033).

This systematic review and meta-analysis conducted was conducted by reviewing previously published articles. PubMed, Hinari, African Journals Online databases and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to August 2024. For Google Scholar, we employed both backward citation searching (reviewing the reference lists of included articles) and forward citation searching (reviewing studies that cited the included articles) to ensure the maximum possible inclusion of relevant studies. The search was conducted by two independent review authors at the end of August 2024. The search strategy incorporated three principal (CoCoPop) frameworks: condition (Quality of work life and associated factors), context (Ethiopia), and population (nurse). Keywords such as “quality of work life,” “score of quality of work life,” “nurse,” “Ethiopia” and related MeSH keywords and entry words along with their combinations were used with AND/OR operators. Additionally the reference of final included articles were manually searched for potential studies (Table1). For studies with incomplete data, corresponding authors were contacted but did not respond, leading to their exclusion from the analysis.

The inclusion criteria for this review were: studies published in peer-reviewed journals, studies focusing on Quality of Work Life (QWL) and its associated factors, studies involving nursing populations, those reporting relevant quantitative outcomes, employing a cross-sectional design, and conducted in Ethiopia. These criteria ensured the inclusion of research with methodological rigor and relevance to the review objectives. Focusing on the nursing population and QWL allowed us to align with the scope of the study, while limiting to quantitative, cross-sectional studies enabled the synthesis of measurable and comparable data across studies. The predominance of cross-sectional designs in the existing literature also supports this choice, as it captures associations between variables at a specific point in time. We restricted our review to Ethiopian studies to provide context-specific insights applicable to local policy and practice.

Exclusion criteria included studies lacking relevant outcomes, those with poor methodological quality or insufficient data, qualitative studies and non-primary researches such as, short communications, conference abstracts, and review articles. Although no language restrictions were applied during the database search, only English-language studies were retrieved, as English is the primary language of scientific publication in Ethiopia. Study screening and selection were conducted independently by two authors, with final inclusion determined through discussion.

To assess the methodological quality and potential biases in study design, execution, and analysis, we used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies [15]. Two authors independently evaluated the studies, with any disagreements resolved through consensus. As shown in Table2, all studies received a score of moderate (5) or above and were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis.

To reduce bias and error in data curation, two authors independently extracted data from the articles using a standardized data collection form, including name of author, year of study, place of study, sample size, QWL score and its components, number of participants, name of the tool used, and statistical outcomes.

Given that the QWL score was quantitative, the mean and standard deviation were extracted from each study. For studies reporting QWL as a percentage, the mean and standard deviation were derived using binomial distribution. In studies reporting scores in three categories (such as low, average, and high), we combined the “average” and “high” categories to represent good quality of work life [16]. The I² statistic was employed to assess the heterogeneity among the included studies. A random effects model was utilized to synthesize the study results. Due to the limited number of studies, no meaningful subgroup analysis was performed. Publication bias was assessed using the DOI plot and LFK index [17,18]. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA), with a significance level set atP< 0.05.

A total of 161 records were identified from the four databases. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 14 full-text studies were eligible for detailed assessment. Of these, 6 studies [6,12,15,19–21] were included in the final review (Fig.1). Nine studies were excluded, with the following reasons: no relevant outcome (5 studies), non-health professionals (2 studies), mini review (1 study), and thesis (1 study).

All the studies were cross-sectional in design. Out of the six studies [6,12,15,19–21], which included a total of 1,958 participants, five focused solely on nurses [12,15,19–21], while one included both nurses and other health professionals [6]. Three studies used the Brooks QWL scale [15,19,20], two used the Professional Quality of Life scale (PROQOL) [12,21], and one utilized an adapted tool from previous studies [6]. The summarized data of the key characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table2. The included studies had different approaches to classifying QWL scores. Two studies categorized the QWL scale into low, average/moderate, and high, while the other two studies used a dichotomous classification of good and poor. For our analysis, we considered average/moderate and high scores as indicative of good QWL, and low scores as indicative of poor QWL.

Publication bias was evaluated using the DOI plot, which visualizes asymmetry, and the LFK index, which detects and quantifies asymmetry in study effects [17,18]. As illustrated in Fig.2, the LFK index for QWL was 2.96, and the Egger’s test P value was 0.52. The LFK index (2.96) exceeds the threshold of − 1, 1 indicating the presence of publication bias.

Five studies were used to compute the pooled QWL mean score among nurses. Accordingly, the pooled mean was found to be 102.40 (95%, CI: 25.72, 179.08) with a remarkable heterogeneity among the included studies (I2= 98%,P< 0.001) as illustrated in Fig.3.

Five studies reported on the status of QWL, with good QWL ranging from 41 to 66%. The pooled prevalence of good QWL in Ethiopia was 57% (95%, CI: 0.47, 0.67) with a remarkable heterogeneity among the included studies (I2= 94.9%,P< 0.001) (Fig.4).

In this review and meta-analysis, the significant factors affecting QWL among Ethiopian nurses are summarized in Table3. Salary [15,20], educational status [19,20], and working environment [19,20] were identified as key factors by two studies. Other important factors, such as dependent family [15], public image [19], nursing position [19], availability of a safe place to rest [19], type of health institution [6], family size [6], and availability of personal protective equipment [6], were reported by only one study each. Pooling was not possible due to the limited number of studies reporting these factors, and our findings therefore rely on individual study results. Additionally, the pooled estimates did not yield statistically significant associations.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize and provide evidence about the QWL among nurses in Ethiopia. The results indicated that the mean score of QWL among Ethiopian nurses is 102.40 (95%, CI: 25.72, 179.08), with a pooled prevalence of good QWL around 57% (95%, CI: 0.47, 0.67). The studies varied in the tools used to measure QWL, with some employing the Brooks QWL scale, the PROQOL, and an adapted tool from previous studies. Despite differences in the measurement tools and categorization methods, we were able to compute the pooled mean QWL score and prevalence, which provide meaningful insights into the status of QWL among nurses in Ethiopia. While numerous studies have explored job satisfaction, burnout, and quality of life among health professionals, this study is the first systematic review to examine the pooled quality of work life status among nurses in Ethiopia. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified only 6 eligible publications on the quality of work life among nurses. In contrast, a systematic review and meta-analysis on health professionals’ job satisfaction and associated factors in Ethiopia identified 35 studies [22]. This suggests that the quality of work life among Ethiopian nurses has not been thoroughly investigated.

A systematic review on the quality of nursing work life and interventions for improvement across eight countries found that the majority had a moderate QWL level of 52.4% [23]. Additionally, a national review on QWL among Iranian employees reported a level of 56.90% [10]. Recognizing and understanding the quality of QWL and job satisfaction of nurses is crucial for employers. By fostering environments that enhance the well-being and satisfaction of their nursing staff, employers can contribute to a more positive and productive workplace.

The decline in nurses’ QWL can be traced to several factors. A systematic review on factors affecting QWL highlights three main factors: personal (socio-demographic), occupational, and psychological. Recognizing these factors is essential for devising effective solutions to enhance work life quality and address the issues that diminish it [24]. Although the aggregated data did not yield statistically significant evidence of an association, income, educational attainment, and department of employment emerged as primary determinants influencing quality of QWL among nursing professionals in Ethiopia. These factors have consistently been associated with nurses’ QWL and job satisfaction across multiple studies [22,25,26]. In addition to these core factors, other variables such as dependent family, public image of the nursing profession, nursing position, availability of a safe place to rest, type of health institution, family size, and availability of personal protective equipment were identified, though by only one study each. The variability in these findings suggests that these factors may not be universally applicable or might be context-specific. Future studies should examine these variables more thoroughly to determine their impact on QWL in different healthcare settings and regions.

The number of databases searched and included studies was limited and lacked representativeness. Furthermore, there was variation in the outcome measurement tools used, and high statistical heterogeneity was observed across the studies. As a result, no meaningful subgroup analysis was performed. Additionally, it is important to note that the studies included in this review were cross-sectional in design, which limits the ability to infer causal relationships. Longitudinal studies would be valuable to better understand how changes in QWL over time influence nurse retention and patient outcomes.

This systematic review offers valuable insights for improving nursing care, patient outcomes, and policy development, while supporting evidence-based practices aimed at enhancing the quality of work life for nurses in Ethiopia. It provides healthcare institutions with a foundation for creating and implementing strategies to improve the work-life quality of nurses. Additionally, the findings contribute to the global understanding of professional quality of life and its influencing factors. The review also identifies key areas for further research, particularly the need for qualitative studies to explore these factors in greater depth. Policymakers can use the results to guide the design of nursing programs across the country.

This comprehensive review reviled evidence on the overall QWL status and associated factors among nurses in Ethiopia. The findings sought to influence policymakers and officials to improve employment conditions for nurses to enhance healthcare delivery. The QWL among nurses in Ethiopia has not been extensively studied, but existing evidence suggests that their work life quality is low and significantly impacted by various factors. Hospital management, Ministry of health and The Ethiopian Nursing Association should focus on these factors to improve nurses’ welfare and create a more pleasant work environment. Future research should focus on exploring the contextual factors that contribute to the heterogeneity observed in this review and on conducting longitudinal studies to assess causal relationships.
