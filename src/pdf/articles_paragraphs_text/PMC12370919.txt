The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) obscures key components of fertility dynamics, leading to a calculated 49% information loss and a substantive 0·385 reduction in Adjusted R² compared to its decomposed components: the Total Maternal Rate (TMR) and Children per Mother (CPM), formalized in this study, where TFR = TMR × CPM. Further, TMR and CPM were found to be statistically independent, which is demonstrated to lead to ambiguity in the TFR, findings that carry important implications for demographic analysis and policy evaluation. Aggregated birth data from 158 million mothers in Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States were analyzed from national statistical databases1–4, with validation and extension using data from an additional 156 million women across 29 further higher-income economies via the Human Fertility Database5. TMR and CPM are presented as societal, period-based measures, alongside the Total Childlessness Rate (TCR), also introduced in this study, and together comprise the proposed Microdemographic Framework (MDF) to complement retrospective cohort-based approaches. Grounded in established demographic theory, the framework consolidates and clarifies underutilized indicators to enhance interpretability and analytical resolution. Performance was evaluated using entropy analysis, explanatory power modeling, and wavelet coherence testing—methods rarely applied in fertility research. The results reveal distinct and previously underrecognized patterns: CPM has remained remarkably stable in recent decades, while TMR exhibits sharp, shock-like declines—dynamics obscured by aggregate TFR. Reporting TMR, CPM, and TCR alongside TFR may enable more timely and targeted demographic decision-making, particularly in low-fertility contexts.

Across the globe, nations face an unprecedented, sustained decline in birth rates, posing complex socioeconomic challenges expected to persist for decades6. Traditionally, demographers have relied on established approaches such as the Total Fertility Rate (TFR)—a timely period metric that averages births over the entire female population of reproductive age—and retrospective studies that analyze women’s fertility toward the end of their reproductive life. However, despite their complementary strengths, these approaches leave a notable gap for researchers and policymakers seeking timely, granular insights into contemporary trends in societal childlessness and family size, particularly as potential drivers of low fertility.

TFR emerged as a cornerstone of demographic analysis in the mid-20th century, shaped by scholars like Notestein and Coale at a time of growing policy focus on fertility7, with substantial contributions from the United Nations. Initially, it closely mirrored average family size due to low lifetime childlessness rates worldwide8. However, scholars have increasingly highlighted its fundamental limitations in current demographic contexts. Sobotka and Lutz argued that TFR is mainly useful for answering the question, “Did the TFR increase?”—and little else—warning that reliance on it alone can mislead policymakers9. To address these shortcomings, they advocated for the adoption of Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo-adjusted TFR10, Schoen’s hybrid Average Cohort Fertility (ACF) measure11, and parity-adjusted rates. More recent refinements include Tan’s approach of isolating marital TFR to derive insights in countries where childbearing within marriage remains dominant12. Ultimately, however, all TFR-based methods remain constrained by reducing complex fertility behaviors to a single index value and thus fail to capture real-time trends in societal, period-based childlessness and family size.

Given these limitations, demographers often turn to cohort-based analyses for deeper insights into fertility patterns. However, these too have notable constraints, as they require waiting until most women have completed their childbearing, plus time-consuming steps for data collection, peer review, and publication13. As a result, women aged around 30 today—typically at their peak fertility—won’t be fully represented in cohort studies for another decade or more14. This delay is evident in works like Hwang’s 2023 study of South Korean women born in the 1960–1980 s15, Brini’s 2020 European analysis of women born between 1966 and 197516, and Fahey’s 2017 historical U.S. study of mothers born from the 1880s to the 1970s17.

Further recent cohort studies by Geruso and Spears18and Zeman et al.19reinforce the value of disaggregating fertility behaviors, using metrics such as conditional fertility and Parity Progression Ratios to highlight declining fertility among mothers. However, like prior cohort studies, their analyses were focused primarily on women born in the 1970s or earlier—limiting the relevance of their findings for understanding present-day fertility dynamics. In addition, cohort-based approaches are inherently slow to capture abrupt changes, often obscuring short-term inflection points—such as sudden socio-economic shocks—that affect multiple cohorts simultaneously but are visible only through time-sensitive period-based data.

Practical concerns about fertility measurement limitations are well-documented in the literature. Fahey notes that cohort approaches can obscure sibship trends and distort perceptions of family size. Gietel-Basten et al. warn that overreliance on TFR can mask broader socio-economic drivers, leading to underinformed policies20. Cheng et al. similarly emphasize that TFR may overlook lagged socio-economic effects21, while Geruso and Spears highlight its inherent ambiguity and risk of misattributing causal factors18.

To bridge the gap between TFR’s timely but aggregated nature and the detailed yet delayed retrospective cohort studies, this research introduces the Microdemographic Framework (MDF)—a novel approach that decomposes TFR and provides timely and granular period-based fertility measures to complement existing methods. These indicators can be derived and reported at scale using widely available aggregated birth records in many countries which publish birth order data.

The global low birthrate crisis, with its mounting socioeconomic implications, requires analytical tools that go beyond the limitations of macro-level metrics like the TFR. This study introduces the Microdemographic Framework (MDF), which disaggregates the TFR into three interrelated, period-based indicators: the Total Maternal Rate (TMR), Total Childlessness Rate (TCR), and Children per Mother (CPM), all derived from aggregate birth-order data. This decomposition exposes fertility dynamics—such as transitions into motherhood and variations in family size—that are typically concealed within a single summary measure.

Although the term microdemography is traditionally associated with individual- or household-level studies using microdata22,23, this paper proposes an expanded but complementary usage. Here, microdemography encompasses all sub-macro approaches—including microdata analyses, regional fertility studies, and the MDF—that reflect disaggregated fertility dynamics. This does not replace conventional meanings but extends the term to describe how aggregate indicators like TMR and CPM can mirror collective outcomes of individual life histories, even without microdata. As with microeconomics, which unified diverse methods to analyze behavior below the macro level24, this framing supports a more integrated and interpretable understanding of fertility change.

Total Maternal Rate (TMR): A societal measure of the proportion of women who would become mothers over their reproductive lifetime, assuming current age-specific fertility rates persist. While numerically equivalent to the TFR1 (Total Fertility Rate for first-order births), the term TMR is introduced to enhance clarity and accessibility for non-experts. It reframes the indicator as a share-based metric—emphasizing the proportion of women entering motherhood—rather than TFR1’s “children per woman” framing, which can be counterintuitive in the context of first births.

Total Childlessness Rate (TCR): A societal measure indicating the proportion of women who would remain childless over their reproductive lifetime, assuming current age-specific fertility rates persist. As the complement of TMR (i.e., TCR = 1 – TMR), this metric is mathematically simple yet conceptually significant. By formalizing TCR, the study provides a standardized indicator of period-based societal childlessness, enabling meaningful cross-national comparisons and clearer public communication. The term societal childlessness encompasses voluntary, medically and biologically involuntary, as well as circumstantial forms of childlessness. As explored later in this study, analyzing time-series patterns of TCR through statistical modeling can help disentangle certain underlying drivers and inform more targeted policy responses.

Children per Mother (CPM): A societal measure representing the average number of children born to women who become mothers, based on current age-specific fertility rates. This period-based metric captures trends in family size independently of childlessness. While previous studies have examined fertility conditional on motherhood as a cohort measure, this study formalizes the term Children per Mother (CPM) to clarify its period-based nature, enable standardized cross-national comparisons, and improve accessibility for both researchers and policymakers.

While aspects of these societal measures have appeared in prior demographic research, they have not been formally defined, routinely reported, or analytically integrated into a unified framework as period-based indicators, based on a review of prior work. This study therefore introduces the Microdemographic Framework (MDF) as a novel construct that integrates TMR, TCR, and CPM and demonstrates their exact mathematical relationship to the TFR, where TFR = TMR × CPM.

Unlike TFR, which conflates societal childlessness and family size into a single value, this decomposition enables researchers and policymakers to distinguish between these two fundamental dimensions of fertility. However, the utility of the MDF depends on how these components behave: if they consistently move in tandem, disaggregation may offer limited additional insight; but if they regularly diverge and behave independently, they may reveal critical underlying dynamics obscured by TFR alone. This study thus investigates whether TMR, TCR, and CPM provide greater analytical and policy value than TFR by capturing statistically independent fertility patterns in low-fertility contexts.

This question gains immediate relevance when examining Fig.1, which presents fertility trends in the United States from 1990 to 2022. Period-based motherhood rates (TMR) remained stable for nearly two decades before declining sharply around 2008, while family size among mothers (CPM) increased over the same period. These opposing trends exemplify the kind of independent divergence the MDF is designed to detect. This study sets out to empirically evaluate whether such patterns are exceptional or consistently observable across diverse national contexts.

The following Analytical Framework outlines the data sources and statistical rationale used to assess the independence of TMR and CPM, and to quantify their potential informational value relative to TFR. It serves as a conceptual and methodological bridge to the Methods section, which provides implementation details, formulas, and computational procedures.

The analytical strategy for this research proceeded in two stages. The first phase involved baseline tests to assess whether TMR and CPM capture distinct fertility dynamics by evaluating their statistical independence. Aggregating independent variables can obscure meaningful variation and lead to information loss—an important concern in demographic analyses that rely solely on TFR.

Cointegration testingevaluates longrun equilibrium relationships, comparable to checking whether two independent clocks stay synchronized over years despite small daily fluctuations.

Breakpoint analysisdetects statistically significant shifts in fertility trends—like a river changing course or speed—signaling turning points driven by external forces.Breakpoint Cooccurrence analysisthen checks whether such shifts happen in multiple indicators around the same time, indicating coordinated demographic responses.

Wavelet coherence detection, the most sophisticated method, examines how indicators move together across time and frequency—including time lags—much like tracing harmonies in a musical duet that diverge but retain an underlying structure.

As a second phase of the research—to validate the findings across broader contexts and to quantify the information loss inherent in the TFR—the analysis was extended to 29 additional economies, encompassing a further 156 million mothers, with data sourced from the Human Fertility Database (HFD)5. For validation, Mutual Information (MI) tests, drawn from information theory, were used to reassess the statistical independence between TMR and CPM. In addition, Shannon Entropy metrics quantified the relative information gain or loss, while Monte Carlo simulations evaluated the explanatory power gained by tracking these measures separately.

Together, these methods assessed the structural and temporal independence of TMR and CPM, quantifying the extent to which they reveal fertility dynamics not captured by the aggregate TFR. The metric calculations are detailed in the Methods section, with key terms defined in the Glossary provided in the Supplementary Information. Supplementary Tables S1.1 and S1.2 offer comparative summaries of the newly introduced and traditional measures. Full technical documentation is available in Supplementary Sections S2 and S3.

The Results section that follows presents the empirical findings from these analyses, including cross-national comparisons and measures of information gain. While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the MDF measures for statistical independence and their added informational value relative to TFR, the Discussion section extends these findings to practical policy contexts, illustrated through country-specific examples.

The section summarizes advanced statistical analyses evaluating the independence of TMR and CPM, their informational advantage over TFR, and relative explanatory power. The results are presented in two stages. First, the baseline statistical independence analysis focuses on Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—countries with extensive historical birth order data suitable for time-series analysis—using aggregated birth records from national statistical agencies1–4. These baseline findings are then validated and extended using data from 29 additional economies sourced from the Human Fertility Database5(see Supplementary Table S2.2 for complete list of nations). While modeling fertility dynamics is inherently complex, the consistency of the results across a diverse set of countries with high-quality birth order data underscores the robustness of the conclusions. Detailed results are provided in Supplementary Information S4–S10.

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was used to assess TMR, CPM, and TFR across the baseline analysis countries and confirmed all series were non-stationary, with means and variances shifting at identifiable breakpoints25. To mitigate the risk of spurious Pearson correlation results, the Johansen cointegration test—resilient to such breakpoints—was applied to detect long-term equilibrium relationships26. However, while the results suggested diverging patterns across nations, they remained inconclusive due to insufficient post-breakpoint data, which is necessary for the Johansen test to reliably detect long-term relationships (see Supplementary Information S4). Given these limitations, alternative approaches were required to determine statistical independence. A breakpoint co-occurrence analysis was conducted to compare structural shifts in TMR and CPM over time, followed by wavelet analysis with simulations to evaluate their degree of synchrony across different time scales and data lags.

Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) testing, which detects shifts in mean and variance27, identified prominent fault lines in each time series. Figure2visualizes these breakpoints for TMR and CPM in the US, while Supplementary Information 5 provides visualizations for all four nations. Colored horizontal lines indicate stability periods, with line breaks occurring where shifts in mean and variance were detected. Notable periods of stability are labeled using Latin and Greek letters as well as Roman numerals. These charts reveal distinct shocks, particularly in the incidence of motherhood—and hence societal childlessness—with abrupt falls in TMR during the early to mid-1970s across Italy, Japan, and the UK. In contrast, CPM has remained relatively stable in these countries for several decades, with only Italy showing a sustained, though slight, decline in family size (see TMR and CPM trends in Supplementary Figs. S5.1–S5.3).

Breakpoints in TMR and CPM for the United States, with TFR as a reference.

TMR in the US follows a similar pattern, with an initial decline in 1971, though less pronounced as illustrated in Fig.2. A second sharp drop in 2008 brought US TMR levels in line with other nations. However, since 1980, CPM in the US has been generally rising, indicating a shift toward larger families—a trend not observed elsewhere.

Across all nations, TFR blends the distinct trajectories of TMR and CPM into a single averaged trend that obscures underlying fertility shifts. Additionally, certain TFR breakpoints do not align with those in TMR or CPM, suggesting they may be spurious artifacts rather than genuine demographic changes.

To determine whether the identified TMR and CPM shifts occur independently, or are systematically linked, breakpoint co-occurrence testing was conducted. Fisher’s Exact Test—well suited for smaller sample sizes28—assessed whether breakpoints in both series occurred more frequently than expected by chance, which would indicate a non-random relationship.

For exact year matches, Fisher’s Exact Test yielded ap-value of 0·548 (N= 59), while for co-occurrences within one year, ap-value of 0·144 (N= 59). Both results fail to reject the null hypothesis, providing no statistical evidence of an association between TMR and CPM. These findings suggest that TMR and CPM are shaped by independent factors rather than a shared underlying mechanism. A full breakdown of breakpoint co-occurrence likelihood is available in Supplementary Information S6.

Building on the breakpoint co-occurrence findings for the baseline nations, wavelet coherence analysis was conducted to test for dynamic relationships between TMR and CPM over time29. This method examines how closely two data series are synchronized while accounting for potential lags or leads. Results are visualized in coherence plot Fig.3(with additional detail in Supplementary Figs. S7.1–S7.4), where bluer areas (coherence < 0·3) indicate weak coherence, and redder areas (coherence > 0·5) suggest stronger alignment.

A Monte Carlo phase-randomized surrogate test revealed that no country showed statistically significant coherence30. The United States exhibited the highest observed synchrony (coherence = 0·563), but with ap-value of 0·248, the result remains statistically insignificant—likely reflecting random variation rather than a structured relationship. Similar results were found for Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom, each showing predominantly weak and inconsistent relationships over time (p= 0·597, 0·994, and 0·525, respectively).

Collectively, breakpoint co-occurrence and wavelet analysis provide evidence TMR and CPM are statistically independent measures, reinforcing the need to analyze and report them separately.

With TMR and CPM shown to be statistically independent, relying solely on their aggregate—TFR—risks losing critical information about fertility trends. To quantify this information loss, Shannon entropy provides a rigorous and well-established framework31. Testing was expanded to include 29 additional economies from the Human Fertility Database5, representing a total of 314 million mothers—including data from Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea and Sweden—resulting in a combined sample of 1,470 country-years (see Supplementary Information S2 for a list of countries and year ranges).

Initial Mutual Information (MI) analysis confirmed that TMR and CPM exhibit weak dependence as measured in bits of information (MI ≈ 0·185 bits, ~ 5·68% of CPM’s entropy,N= 1,470,p< 0·001), satisfying the requirement for this form of entropy-based analysis. Entropy was estimated using established histogram-based techniques with bootstrapped confidence intervals. Information retention and loss were evaluated using Pippenger’s Theorem—an established framework in information theory for quantifying entropy in composite systems32.

Empirical results indicate that aggregating TMR and CPM into TFR incurs a 3·279-bit entropy loss, reducing their combined entropy by 48·9% (95% CI: 48·86%–50·68%). In other words, TFR retains only 51·1% of the information originally present in TMR and CPM, with the remainder lost due to aggregation effects. Supplementary Fig. S9.1 visualizes this loss, which exceeds the 1·4-bit benchmark predicted by Pippenger’s Theorem. This benchmark represents the theoretical minimum for information loss, and the extent of the excess underscores the importance of reporting TMR and CPM separately to preserve fertility insights.

To quantify the practical impact of TFR’s information loss, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted across four model types and ten transformations per country. In total, 726,000 simulations were run using log-normal parameters from 1,470 country-years of data across 33 economies (see Supplementary Section S2). Model convergence occurred after approximately 200 iterations (Supplementary Fig. S10.1). Figure4shows consistent gains in explanatory power for untransformed and transformed models using TMR and CPM. Additional transformation results are shown in Supplementary Figs. S10.4–S10.5.

Gain in Explanatory Power for TMR for Untransformed Data, and Linear, Quadratic and Cubic Data Transformations.

The mean gain in Adjusted R²33was a notable + 0·385 (SD: 0·201, 95% CI: 0·3844–0·3854,N= 726,000), outperforming TFR-only models substantially—Wilcoxon signed-rank test,p< 0·001. The distribution of these gains across simulations, showing their variability, is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S10.2. This finding has tangible implications for reassessing prior fertility research and informing future studies.

Among the approaches tested, the additive model with threshold data transformation showed the greatest improvement (Δ Adjusted R²: 0·690, SD: 0·074), followed by the cubic model with quadratic data transformation (Δ Adjusted R²: 0·649, SD: 0·073). The weakest improvement was observed in the log-log model with exponential data transformations, which yielded a modest Adjusted R² gain of 0·104. It also exhibited the lowest proportion of positive simulations (84·68%). The gains across individual economies are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. S10.6, reflecting the broad applicability of the MDF approach.

As a final modeling approach, a Monte Carlo simulation with one million trials was conducted using realistic bounds for TMR (0·6–0·9) and CPM (1·9–2·6). In each trial, two independent TMR–CPM pairs were randomly generated, and their TFRs (TMR × CPM) were compared. Using an absolute difference of less than 0·1 as the match criterion, 21·8% of trials produced nearly identical TFRs despite differing component values. A stricter second test, based on standard demographic rounding to one decimal place, showed that 11·0% of pairings resulted in identical reported TFRs. These results highlight the ambiguity of TFR as a composite measure and underscore the value of reporting its components separately.

To complement the simulations, the boxplots in Fig.5illustrate the permutation space of observed TMR and CPM values across 1,470 country-years, as listed in Supplementary Section S2. The plots demonstrate that a single TFR value can correspond to a wide distribution of observed TMR and CPM pairings across country-years: for example, each unique TFR value—when rounded to one decimal place, as is standard in demographic reporting—corresponded to an average of 13 distinct TMR–CPM combinations. These empirical distributions align with the simulation findings and highlight the inherent ambiguity of TFR, underscoring its limitations as a comparative measure across populations or time periods.

Distributions of (a) TMR and (b) CPM values for individual TFR values.

Numerous nations are contending with persistently low birthrates, and consequently, there is a pressing need for timely and insightful fertility indicators to inform policy decision-making. Conventional measures, such as the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), offer a rapid overview of fertility trends but obscure key distinctions—particularly between societal childlessness and family size among mothers. Conversely, retrospective cohort studies provide rich detail but suffer from long time lags, often reducing their relevance for real-time decision-making. While each approach has value, neither fully meets the needs of policymakers seeking indicators that are both current and granular.

To address this gap, this study introduces the Microdemographic Framework (MDF), which decomposes the TFR into two conceptually distinct, period-based components: the Total Maternal Rate (TMR), reflecting the likelihood of becoming a mother, and Children per Mother (CPM), capturing the average family size among mothers, where TFR = TMR × CPM. This decomposition is understood to be novel, as prior efforts—such as those by Geruso and Spears18and Zeman et al.19—have focused on cohort-based conditional fertility metrics rather than on timely, period-based aggregates. To evaluate the MDF’s analytical utility, aggregate data representing 314 million mothers across 33 higher-income economies and 1,470 country-years were analyzed to assess statistical independence between TMR and CPM.

Initial results from the four baseline nations showed no consistent temporal alignment between the two indicators, as determined by breakpoint co-occurrence and wavelet coherence testing. This structural independence was further validated across all 33 economies using Mutual Information analysis. Collectively, these findings challenge the assumption that the TFR reliably summarizes the distinct underlying dynamics of fertility behavior. Information-theoretic analysis confirmed that TFR retains only 51·1% of the combined entropy of TMR and CPM—corresponding to a 48·9% loss. Notably, the informational contribution is nearly balanced: 52·8% from TMR and 47·2% from CPM. Moreover, TMR alone contains more information (3·64 bits, units of information) than TFR (3·43 bits), further underscoring the value of disaggregation.

To assess the implications for demographic modeling, simulation-based comparisons across 726,000 trials and four statistical forms showed that models incorporating TMR and CPM consistently outperformed those using TFR alone. The mean gain in explanatory power was a substantial + 0·385 in Adjusted R², with robust improvements across multiple data transformations. This consistency underscores that the analytical value of the Microdemographic Framework (MDF) is not dependent on model specification.

To illustrate the interpretive limitations of TFR, each individual value in the country datasets—for example, TFR = 1·5—was associated, on average, with approximately 13 distinct combinations of TMR and CPM. This makes TFR an ambiguous metric for comparing fertility dynamics across time or between regions. In the United States, for instance, the TFR in 2016 was identical to that of 1980 (1·82). Yet the incidence of motherhood between these periods, as measured by TMR, declined from 76·1% to 69·4%, offset by a corresponding rise in CPM—a divergence fully masked by TFR.

Turning to further country-level trends, a potentially persistent related pattern was observed in France between 2013 and 2023, based on birth order records sourced from Eurostat34. During this period, CPM remained virtually stable, fluctuating between 2·3 and 2·4 children, while TMR declined sharply from 85·0% to 72·8%. Policymakers and researchers relying solely on TFR would see only a generalized fertility decline—without visibility into the underlying rise in societal childlessness, a trend that cohort studies may not detect for decades due to their retrospective nature.

While the recent increase in societal childlessness in France could reflect a tempo effect due to postponed parenthood, evidence from the baseline countries may indicate otherwise. Sudden declines in TMR are apparent across all four baseline nations, as visualized in prior public works35. For example, TMR fell sharply in Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom around 1974, as illustrated in Fig.6, while in the United States, abrupt drops in TMR occurred in 1971 and again in 2008 (see Fig.2). Notably, many of these inflection points coincide with major global disruptions, including the 1973–1974 Global Oil Crisis and the 2007–2008 Global Mortgage Crisis36,37.

Declines in Motherhood (TMR) during the Early 1970s.

Like France in recent years, these shock-like shifts in motherhood across the baseline countries contrast with the relative stability of CPM—as illustrated by the boxplots in Fig.7, which show tight clustering and limited variability across many years of data. For longitudinal context, multi-year trend plots by country are provided in Supplementary Information S5. While this pattern aligns with cohort-based findings such as those by Geruso and Spears18, who report that conditional fertility among mothers born in the 1970s declines only modestly compared to those born in the 1950s, the Microdemographic Framework (MDF) supplements these insights with finer temporal resolution, enabling the detection of abrupt demographic shifts as they occur—particularly during economic crises.

Children per Mother (CPM) by Country from 1970 to 2020 (Italy to 2014).

Previous literature—such as Sobotka et al.36and Goldstein et al.37—has linked economic crises to declines in the TFR, however such associations often lack the granularity needed to support stronger causal inference. In contrast, the MDF enables greater specificity, as demonstrated in Supplementary Information S11 through a prefecture-level analysis of Japan’s Total Childlessness Rate (TCR), based on birth records manually transcribed from archival government PDFs. This analysis reveals a rise in TCR beginning in 1974 in every prefecture—spanning all 47 metropolitan, rural, and subtropical island regions of Japan. A binomial test confirmed that the probability of all 47 prefectures simultaneously showing drops in TMR between 1974 and 1975 was statistically significant (p< 0·0001). This result is as improbable as tossing a coin 47 times and getting heads each time, and therefore strongly suggests a widespread behavioral shock.

With TCR isolating trends specifically among non-parents, monthly birth totals were examined to more precisely identify the onset of change. This analysis revealed a cluster of breakpoints beginning in October 1974, peaking in November, and continuing into early 1975, as illustrated in Fig.8. Accounting for average conception and gestation timelines of approximately 12 months, this shift aligns closely with the surge in media coverage following the onset of the Oil Shock in Japan on October 19, 1973.

Monthly incidence of statistically significant breakpoints in total live births—sudden shifts in means and variances—across 47 Japanese prefectures (1970–1975).

While Sobotka et al. and Goldstein et al. interpreted such fertility impacts as tempo effects, the persistence of the trend in TCR data to the present suggests a more enduring, structural shift in fertility behavior. Although this study does not claim a definitive causal relationship between economic shocks and fertility outcomes, the findings nonetheless offer compelling evidence of a strong association.

TCR encompasses voluntary, medically and biologically involuntary, as well as circumstantial childlessness; however, the presence of rapid shifts during periods of economic uncertainty suggests that the latter—a category referred to in public work as Unplanned Childlessness35—may be a notable contributor. This interpretation is supported by Beaujouan et al.38, who found that childlessness in 20th-century Europe was largely driven by broader structural or circumstantial causes.

Another key observation across the baseline countries is that CPM broadly aligns with women’s stated ideal family sizes, as reported in various studies39–41. This convergence suggests that the often-cited Fertility Gap42stems less from mothers having fewer children than desired, and more from a growing share of women who hope to become parents but ultimately remain childless. This observation aligns with Testa’s cohort-based analysis of European women born in the 1960s43, which shows that period-based measures like CPM can, in certain contexts, anticipate future fertility outcomes, further reinforcing the MDF’s capacity to offer greater analytical precision than aggregate TFR metrics. For example, the sharp decline in TMR in the United States since 2008 (see Fig.1) may be an early signal of rising lifetime childlessness, including among those who had intended to become parents.

The persistent shortcomings of the TFR as an analytical and comparative tool—rather than merely a national snapshot—underscore the need for standardized, granular fertility metrics. A clear illustration appears in the 2024 United Nations World Fertility Report44, which mentions childlessness only twice across its 62 pages. The report acknowledges that many people have “fewer children than desired and remain childless more often than intended,” and concedes that “methodological challenges” inhibit detailed measurement.

Similarly, the 2024 United Nations Population Fund’s report, “The real fertility crisis: The pursuit of reproductive agency in a changing world”45, which confirms the presence of a widening fertility gap in many countries, further illustrates this point. It identifies barriers to fertility aspirations across 14 countries through resource-intensive surveys, yet lacks formal, standardized measures for societal childlessness or average family size among mothers—tools that could enhance its utility. These recent UN reports underscore that the limitations of current demographic tools are not confined to national studies—they extend to global reporting efforts, a gap this study and its indicators seek to address.

Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that no single period metric—such as the TFR—can be relied upon to fully capture the evolving complexity of fertility dynamics, underscoring the extent to which past research and policymaking may have over-relied on this measure. While the TFR remains valuable, the inherent lag in cohort-based studies reinforces the need to report its disaggregated components—TMR, CPM, and TCR—for a more nuanced view of contemporary reproductive behavior. Table1presents this approach using recent real-world data for 10 nations, while an extended version covering 34 economies with additional interpretive indicators is available in Supplementary Information S12 (Table S12.1).

Recent micro- and macro-level period-based demographic indicators for selected economies.

As with any framework, the MDF is not without analytical and reporting challenges. In addition to tempo effects arising from societal shifts in the timing of parenthood, limitations stem from the availability and timeliness of birth order data. Such data are missing entirely in some high-resource countries and significantly delayed in others. In lower-resource settings—where comprehensive birth registration systems are often incomplete—birth order data are typically unavailable. This limitation may be partially addressed through large-scale demographic surveys conducted in many of these countries, such as India’s National Family Health Survey (NFHS)46and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program47, which spans approximately 90 low-income nations and can include birth order information. Further, synthetic rates may be developed—potentially using methodologies analogous to Synthetic Parity Progression Ratios48,49.

Beyond data access, interpretive limitations remain—particularly in disaggregating voluntary, involuntary, and circumstantial drivers of childlessness using aggregated data alone. Additionally, historical comparability may be constrained by shifts in classification systems or reporting standards over time. Further, the adoption of new terminologies—such as the MDF’s component abbreviations and emerging concepts like Unplanned Childlessness—may require time and consensus across academic, institutional, and policy domains. Despite these challenges, with appropriate methodological adaptations, the MDF can capture nuanced fertility patterns even in data-scarce or temporally inconsistent environments.

In data-rich national contexts, the Microdemographic Framework already offers a powerful lens for understanding fertility trends and meeting the growing demand for granular demographic insights—as demonstrated in this study by the cases of the United States, France, and Japan. Further methodological development—particularly from scholars in statistical demography, information science, and related fields—is encouraged to enhance measurement precision and improve the predictive capacity of long-term demographic and economic models. Ultimately, disaggregating TFR into its components increases informational value without adding methodological complexity. This approach avoids the conceptual paradox of measuring an ‘average’ woman who is simultaneously a mother and childless, transforming fertility analysis from a summary statistic into a diagnostic tool capable of supporting rapid, evidence-based policy responses.

Just as microeconomics emerged during the Great Depression to unify fragmented economic analysis24, today’s demographic uncertainty calls for an equivalent response. As fertility rises to the forefront of economic and social planning, microdemography—with tools such as the MDF—may not only complement existing approaches but also deliver the clarity and responsiveness needed to confront one of the defining demographic challenges of the 21st century.

This section presents the methods used to define and calculate the microdemographic measures central to this study—Total Maternal Rate (TMR), Total Childlessness Rate (TCR), and Children per Mother (CPM). It also details the statistical techniques used to assess their behavior over time, their relationship to TFR, and their potential explanatory value. These include tests of stationarity and independence (cointegration, breakpoint analysis, and wavelet coherence), entropy-based analysis of information loss, comparative modeling of explanatory power, and empirical mapping of TFR permutations. Together, these methods assess whether TMR and CPM provide additional insights beyond TFR that can improve interpretability and policy relevance.

Note that TMR—like TFR1—can exceed 1·0 for brief periods, implying that over 100% of women would become mothers, and similarly TCR can become negative. This is not considered an error in the method but an artifact of a change in the timing of first births within the population, known as a tempo effect10. For example, if a policy encourages women to have their first child earlier, the period TMR may temporarily rise above 1·0. By definition, levels above 1·0 cannot be sustained, and this is likely to be followed by a notable drop in TMR in subsequent years, given that women cannot have more than one first birth. In such cases, researchers may consider applying tempo adjustments to correct for these timing distortions, such as the Bongaarts–Feeney method10.

Although birth-order data have been available in many national statistical systems for decades, their formal use in fertility decomposition has been limited by a combination of institutional, methodological, and data-related constraints. The early dominance of the Total Fertility Rate (TFR)—valued for its simplicity and comparability across contexts—created institutional inertia that discouraged the development of alternative period-based measures. In addition, inconsistent data collection and reporting practices for birth order across countries hindered the standardization of decomposition methods. Methodologically, a prevailing focus on cohort-based fertility studies further delayed innovation in real-time fertility metrics.

Only recently have improvements in data harmonization, digitization of administrative records, and computational tools made it feasible to conduct large-scale, period-based fertility decompositions. These advances form the basis for the Microdemographic Framework (MDF) developed in this study, which aims to provide timely and demographically disaggregated fertility indicators for policy and analytical use.

The following details the formulas to derive the three MDF measures introduced or formalized in this study, along with related notes.

TMR represents the proportion of women who would become mothers under current age-specific fertility rates. It is numerically equivalent to the First-Order Total Fertility Rate (TFR1) but is reframed to emphasize interpretability—expressed as the likelihood of motherhood rather than the number of first births per woman. The renaming follows a tradition of improving public understanding through intuitive terminology, akin to the adoption of Body Mass Index (BMI) in place of the Quetelet Index50.

TMR is formally defined as a societal, period-based demographic measure concentrating solely on first births. It calculates the proportion of women who would transition to motherhood over their reproductive lifetime (ages limited to 15–49 for the purpose of consistency in this study), assuming current age-specific first-birth rates remain constant. This is akin to the TFR but restricted to the parity 0 to parity 1 transition9,51. This metric reflects the prospective likelihood of a woman entering motherhood under prevailing fertility conditions, drawing on established techniques for analyzing birth order and period fertility.

This approach aligns with the period-based methodology of TFR, adapted to focus solely on first births.

TCR is defined as the complement of TMR, and reflects the proportion of women who would remain childless under current fertility conditions. This period-based approach to measuring societal childlessness is less commonly used in demography than cohort-based alternatives and is not widely represented in the literature. It has not been formalized as an official indicator until now, with this study introducing the term Total Childlessness Rate (TCR) to emphasize its potential importance.

This period measure estimates the probability of childlessness based on contemporary fertility patterns.

TCR encompasses biological and medical childlessness, voluntary childlessness, as well as circumstantial (unplanned) childlessness, such as lacking a partner42.

CPM measures the average number of children born to mothers (i.e., women who have had at least one child) over their lifetimes, assuming current fertility patterns persist. While this concept has occasionally appeared in fertility research, family size is typically analyzed as a cohort measure conditional on motherhood. By contrast, the societal period measure Children per Mother (CPM) has not previously been formalized as a standalone indicator. Like TCR, this study introduces the term to underscore its potential utility for both researchers and policymakers.

CPM is formally defined as the ratio of TFR to TMR, reflecting period-based fertility patterns among mothers. This approach contrasts with methods that estimate average family size using weighted birth order distributions, which are not directly compatible with the present framework, where CPM functions as one of the two multiplicative components of TFR, wherebyTFR = TMR × CPM.

The required datasets to perform the calculations were downloaded and processed using Python code, which included standardizing data structures across national data formats. After establishing a robust dataset, diagnostic tests were conducted to ensure appropriate statistical techniques were applied and to verify the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

Birth order and population exposure data were obtained from the sources listed in Table S2.1 for the four nations included in the baseline analysis. The data were then processed using Python and the Pandas library. Standardization steps included aligning column names and data structures across datasets.

Periodic quality assurance checks were integral to the process. For example, TFR values were independently derived and cross-checked against published values in the HFD5to ensure consistency.

Initial tests for stationarity—evaluating whether the mean and variance remain constant over time—are a critical prerequisite before assessing statistical relationships between time series. These tests were conducted using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (type = ‘none’)25, which confirmed that both the TMR and CPM series were non-stationary, exhibiting breakpoints where the mean and/or variance shifted abruptly. This non-stationarity introduces the risk of spurious correlations when applying standard Pearson correlation tests, which were avoided.

Cointegration Testing: Examines whether TMR and CPM exhibit a long-term equilibrium relationship using Johansen’s method26, applied to raw data without interpolation. This builds on the cointegration framework by Engle and Granger52and is implemented via the urca R package, with lags selected via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for stable estimates.

Breakpoint Analysis: Identifies major structural shifts in TMR and CPM over time using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm27, implemented via the changepoint R package with a Modified Bayesian Information Criterion (MBIC) penalty of approximately 10·0 for a dataset spanning 55 years, ensuring robust detection of changepoints.

Wavelet Coherence Analysis: Assesses the evolving relationship between TMR and CPM across multiple time scales using Morlet wavelets29,53, implemented via the biwavelet package in R. A Monte Carlo approach with 10,000 phase-randomized surrogates enables comparative testing for statistical significance30. This method evaluates whether the co-movement between motherhood rates and family sizes is consistent over time and at different temporal frequencies.

To quantify information loss from aggregating TMR and CPM into TFR, an entropy-based analysis was conducted using Shannon Entropy—a foundational principle of information theory that measures uncertainty in a probability distribution31. A histogram-based entropy approximation for continuous variables was applied to empirical TMR, CPM, and TFR data across 33 economies, representing 1,470 country-years (see Supplementary Section S2)54. Scott’s Rule was used to determine optimal bin widths55.

Mutual Information (MI) was then used to evaluate potential dependence between TMR and CPM, with entropy estimates adjusted accordingly. A 20-bin discretization approach, combined with percentile clipping (5th–95th percentile) and permutation-based bias correction, minimized quantization loss. To estimate confidence intervals for entropy loss, 10,000 bootstrap iterations were performed56.

Finally, Pippenger’s Theorem—a principle in information theory—was adapted to benchmark expected information retention and loss32. This framework assessed whether TMR and CPM offer a more information-rich alternative to conventional period fertility measures.

The study compared the explanatory power of statistical models incorporating TMR and CPM with those using TFR alone. To simulate long-term trends, a synthetic 1,000-year log-normal dataset was generated for each of the 33 economies using empirical means and variances. This analysis involved 500 simulations per country across four generic regression models: additive, quadratic, cubic, and log-log. Each model was then evaluated using ten common statistical transformations, providing a baseline comparison of explanatory power under stationary conditions and in the absence of structural breakpoints.

As a final test of the interpretability of real-world TFR values, TFR was mapped to its corresponding TMR and CPM pairs—empirical permutations drawn from observed data rather than modeled values—to assess the range of component combinations that yield identical TFR values when rounded to one decimal place, as is common in TFR reporting. The results were visualized using boxplots to highlight any variability and distribution of these components, and potentially illustrate the limits of TFR in capturing distinct fertility patterns.

Overall, the use of large-scale fertility datasets from 33 diverse, higher-income economies, the introduction of newly formalized microdemographic indicators, and the application of advanced statistical and information-theoretic methods constitute a robust and scalable approach for evaluating both the structure and explanatory power of TFR and its components.
