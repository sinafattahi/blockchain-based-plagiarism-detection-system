Urban flooding frequently causes significant damage to infrastructure and facilities, leading to critical supply shortages in affected regions. Ensuring rapid and efficient distribution of relief supplies remains a key challenge during disaster response operations. This study proposes a two-stage optimization framework for emergency logistics. First, a supply distribution model is developed by integrating resource scarcity indices and disaster severity indices, optimized through a simulated annealing algorithm. Second, a vehicle routing model accounting for rainfall and dynamic vehicle speeds is established, solved using a hybrid Genetic Simulated Annealing algorithm to enhance computational efficiency. Ultimately, through simulation with randomly generated calculation examples, it was found that for the supply distribution model, the allocation model that takes into account both the resource scarcity index and the disaster index is more suitable for scenarios with an uneven distribution of disaster severity. The results of the model that takes into account the resource scarcity index, disaster index and waiting time index shows an improvement of 4% over the model that doesn’t consider the resource scarcity index. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology not only adapts to varying disaster spatial patterns but also balances efficiency and equity under supply constraints, offering a scalable tool for designing resilient urban flood response systems.

In recent years, with the development of urbanization, the phenomenon of urban flooding has gradually increased1. According to Em-Dat, 164 floods occurred globally in 2023, affecting about 32.4 million people, resulting in 7,763 deaths and totaling $20.4 billion in damages2. The consequences of urban flooding disasters are manifold. In the aftermath of such disasters, the lack of clean water, food, shelter, and adequate medical care has a significant impact on affected populations3. Furthermore, the disruption of road networks can exacerbate the challenges faced in the wake of a disaster4. In light of the complex nature, uncertain outcomes, and extensive potential for damage associated with such disasters, it is imperative to exercise prudent stewardship of limited resources and to enhance the emergency management department’s capacity to respond to crises in a timely and risk-mitigating manner5. It is thus crucial to examine the urban flood emergency logistics vehicles routing optimization, taking into account road accessibility, with the aim of guaranteeing the satisfaction of those involved in the disaster site.

This study employs a modeling and simulation methodology based on the concept of urban flooding emergency logistics processes, with the objective of enhancing the satisfaction of residents in affected areas and promoting innovation in modern urban flood emergency response.

The urban flooding emergency logistics processes can be described as follows: the emergency department proceeds to distribute the relief supplies from the Tier 1 distribution center to each secondary service center. Thereafter, the relief supplies from the Tier 2 service centers are distributed to each covered affected sites.

Figure1shows an example of a vehicle route in the context of disasters, where one vehicle transports supplies from a Tier 1 distribution center to two Tier 2 service centers, and then two vehicles transport supplies from two Tier 2 service centers to five different affected locations transport. Once the vehicle has serviced all affected locations, it will return to the Tier 2 service center from which it departed.

An example of a vehicle routing in the context of disasters.

The structure of this article is as follows: In Sect. 2 surveys the existing literature on urban flood risk and the recent advancements in addressing the vehicle routing problem within the context of disasters. Section 3 presents the construction of the corresponding mathematical model. Section 4 details the design of an improved GA-SA algorithm. Section 5 demonstrates the simulation results of the applied models and algorithms. Finally, Sect. 6 provides a summary of the entire study.

Urban flooding emergency logistics research has made notable progress in recent years, though challenges remain in addressing dynamic environmental changes and human-centered outcomes. Existing studies have primarily focused on quantifying transportation disruptions and optimizing logistical models, yet critical gaps persist in integrating real-time environmental dynamics and multi-dimensional human impacts.

In the realm of transportation disruption analysis, Mitsakis et al.6analyzed transportation metrics to quantify the impact of heavy rainfall on vehicular traffic, while Su et al.7developed an integrated simulation model for early warning of storm-induced traffic congestion. Pregnolato et al.8established a curve-fitted relationship between water depth and vehicle speed, and Suwanno et al.1evaluated evacuation times under different flood scenarios to identify alternative routes. Borowska-Stefańska et al.9further revealed that flooding-induced road closures, speed reductions, and detours significantly increase travel time, with spatial accessibility declines unaffected by inundation locations. These studies lay a foundation for understanding traffic dynamics but often rely on static or historical data, lacking real-time adaptability to evolving flood conditions—such as the exacerbated nighttime flooding severity noted by Shao et al.10, which remains underexplored in predictive models.

In the field of emergency logistics modelling, Holguín-Veras et al.11pioneered the introduction of Deprivation Costs (DC) to quantify human suffering from service inaccessibility, inspiring subsequent studies such as Shi et al.12who developed a system dynamics model incorporating DC to analyse supply chain policies. Chen et al.13and Liu et al.14concentrated on the issue of medical supply routing in circumstances where demand was limited. In contrast, Khalili-Fard et al.15and Ghasemi et al.16advanced multi-stage, multi-objective models for logistics in the pre- and post-disaster context. As Zokaee et al.17and Yang et al.18have previously indicated, stakeholder satisfaction and time-sensitive allocation are of paramount importance. However, these models frequently fail to consider the dynamic interplay between flood progression and human behaviour. For instance, Valero et al.19discovered that vehicle mobility varies with flood debris dynamics, and Zang et al.20revealed that residential/commercial areas face disproportionate accessibility losses. Furthermore, human-centric factors such as evacuation psychology and equity in relief distribution have received insufficient attention, despite the focus of Okonta and Olaomi21on disaster response costs and the rescue route model developed by Zhu et al.22for minimising DC.

The focus and limitations of extant literatures are shown in Table1. The majority of models fail to consider the dynamic coupling of rainfall intensity, road degradation, and logistics delays. The concept of victim satisfaction is reduced to logistical metrics, with non-linear interactions between resource scarcity, disaster severity, and psychological distress being ignored. The allocation of supplies and the optimisation of routes are regarded as discrete stages, thereby impeding the development of comprehensive solutions when confronted with limitations in resources.

This study addresses the shortcomings of extant research and proposes the following innovations: The system incorporates dynamic vehicle speed models that are responsive to rainfall. A non-linear satisfaction function is proposed, incorporating elements of resource scarcity, disaster intensity, and waiting time. In the context of a two-stage optimization process, couples supply allocation is achieved through the implementation of adaptive routing. The proposed framework integrates environmental dynamics with human-centric metrics, thereby providing a scalable tool for resilient urban flood response.

This article assumes that after a disaster, the decision-making department should respond quickly and decisively, downplay the control of logistics costs, and strive to increase the satisfaction of residents in the affected areas while reducing the sense of panic among the general public. Therefore, when distributing relief supplies after a disaster, considerations of minimizing costs or maximizing the effect-to-cost ratio should be ignored and instead the goal should be maximizing the rescue effect or maximizing overall satisfaction on the ground demand.

The problem examined can be described as follows: After a disaster, the initial distribution of relief supplies is carried out according to the needs of the affected locations and the extent of the disaster. The emergency department then distributes supplies from the Tier 1 distribution center to each secondary service center. The relief supplies will then be distributed from the Tier 2 service centers to all affected locations. Each service fleet first transports the relief supplies from the Tier 1 distribution center to the Tier 2 service centers, and then the Tier 2 service center carriers transport the relief supplies to the respective affected locations.

It is imperative that the vehicles return to the point of departure after completing all deliveries.

The specific details regarding the model variable can be found in the Table2.

The presence of water on the road surface, caused by rainfall, can result in vehicles skidding, particularly when travelling at high speeds. This can lead to a certain extent to a reduction in the speed at which vehicles are travelling, which also can affect the overall safety of the journey23,24.

Given that the research background of this article is a flood disaster, the amount of rainfall is more than very heavy rainfall (very heavy rainfall are generally regarded as 140 mm/12 h). Consequently, the model has been amended to unify the units, thenis defined as Eq.1,is defined as Eq.2, andin accordance with as Eq.3.

In the event of flooding, urban infrastructure and facilities are often compromised, leaving residents of affected areas in need of essential supplies and housing, include access to drinking water and food, as rainfall increases the damage to urban infrastructure and facilities increases and the supplies shortage increases21.

In light of the relatively minor loss of supplies and facilities that occurs when the rainfall level is below heavy rainfall (heavy rainfall are generally regarded as 30 mm/12 h), this phenomenon is ignored in order to simplify the calculation of the model. Conversely, when the rainfall level is more than very heavy rainfall, the potential for transportation losses is significant, necessitating the inclusion of some redundancy of supplies. Thus the relationship between t, andis defined as Eq.4.

The calculation ofwill vary depending on the nature of the hazard. For instance, in the case of seismic events,is determined by the magnitude of the event and the distance from the epicenter.

The panic index of the residents by those affected by a disaster is directly proportional to the severity of the disaster, the extent of supply shortages, and the duration of the wait for assistance. In situations where the disaster is more severe, there is a greater degree of relief supplies shortage, and rescue is delayed for a longer period of time, the psychological distress experienced by victims increases exponentially.

The deprivation cost on the affected groups is rising exponentially25. The level of satisfaction among residents of the disaster site is inversely correlated with the panic index among those same residents. In other words, as a result of the more widespread distribution of supplies, a reduction in rainfall, and a decrease in waiting times, the decline in the panic index is accompanied by an increase in satisfaction among residents of the disaster site, thereforesatisfies Eq.11.

This distribution model only considers the resource shortage index.

According to Eq.11, whenis smaller,is larger. So the distribution model I aims atminimization as Eq.12.

Finally, based on the assumption, the distribution of resources should be lower than the maximum supply shortage ratio, and each transport vehicle must not be overloaded. Thus, the constraint functions are defined as Eqs.13–14.

This distribution model considers the resource shortage index and damage index.

According to Eq.11, whenandis smaller,is larger. So the distribution model I aims atminimization as Eq.15.

Takingas the model optimization objective, the objective function is Eq.16.

Then build the constraint functions as defined in Eqs.17–22.

where Eqs.17–19indicate that each demand point is served by only one carrier. Equation20indicates that the quantity of demanded supplies at the demand point is not greater than the maximum load capacity of the vehicle. Equation21indicates that the vehicle has to return to the departure point after departing from the service point. And Eq.22indicates that the vehicle is not allowed to travel from the service point to another service point.

Finally, define the decision variable functions are Eqs.23–24.

The vehicle routing problem with multiple vehicles in multiple car parks belongs to NP-hard problem26. The emergency route optimization model constructed in this article is a nonlinear planning model. As the quantity of data increases, the computational volume grows exponentially, and exhaustive enumeration is no longer a viable method for finding an exact solution. Therefore, heuristic intelligent optimization algorithms must be employed to address the problem. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that the majority of scholars employ genetic algorithm (GA) to address such problems. However, GA is prone to yielding local optimal solutions and are not well-suited for addressing large-scale computational problems. Accordingly, this article employs a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SA) for resource allocation and a Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm (GA-SA) for route optimization model resolution27. This approach mitigates the proclivity of the algorithm to converge prematurely on a local optimal solution. The GA-SA process is shown in Table3.

The mutation operator was performed using an inverted mutation, in which two positions in the chromosome were randomly selected, the interval of elements to be changed in order was determined, and the order of elements within the mutated interval was arranged in reverse order. As in Fig.3, the first step selects the blue interval [2,7,3,4] as the mutation interval and the second step arranges the elements within the blue interval in reverse order.

Crossover operations use the sequential crossover, randomly selects two positions in the chromosome, determines the interval of elements to be crossed, swaps the selected intervals in the two existing solutions, removes the elements in the original solution that are duplicates of the swapped intervals, and places the swapped ones Intervals outside of the exchanged intervals in the order. As shown in Fig.4, the first step selects the blue interval [2,7,3] and [1,4,6] as the mutation interval, in the second step, the elements in the blue intervals of the two solutions are swapped and marked away the duplicate elements in gray and places the elements of the swapped intervals in the free position in the order.

The GA-SA algorithm is tested for large-scale computations using Solomons’ C101 dataset. Compared with the GA, the solution time of GA-SA increases by 29 s and the distance of the calculated results decreases by 145.08. It can be seen from Fig.5that the convergence speed of GA-SA algorithm is close to that of GA, but the quality of the solution is higher, so GA-SA algorithm is better than GA in solving large sets - scaled data sets.

GA have been demonstrated to encounter challenges in addressing complex constraints, and a solitary genetic algorithm encoding is inadequate in providing a comprehensive representation of the constraints inherent in an optimization problem. Consequently, the computational time required to consider these constraints invariably increases. The simulated annealing component of GA-SA has been demonstrated to effectively address these constraints by employing state transfer probabilities and acceptance criteria that are suitably designed. This enhanced functionality facilitates the optimization of operational efficiency, thereby enhancing the algorithm’s ability to address a comprehensive array of practical constraints. Consequently, this enhanced functionality results in the generation of an emergency logistics program for urban flooding that exhibits a greater degree of alignment with the actual circumstances of the situation.

In the example, there are 1 Tier 1 distribution center, 10 Tier 2 service centers, and 20 affected sites in the affected area, and the location coordinates of each point are mapped on the plane coordinates of 120 km × 120 km, and the actual distance between each node is expressed by the Euclidean distance on the plane coordinates, in which the point 0 is the Tier 1 distribution service center, the points I-X are the Tier 2 service centers, the points 11–29 are the ripple effect affected sites, and the point 30 is the disaster center point. points, and point 30 is the center of the disaster.

The total amount of supplies stored in the Tier 1 distribution center is 300 tons, and the number of carriers can be distributed to all Tier 2 service centers at the same time; the number of vehicles is 10; the theoretical speed of the vehicles is 80 km/h; the transport capacity of the vehicles is 60 tons; and the service time for each point of demand is 0.5 h. Specific data are shown in Tables4and5.

According to the coordinates of the location of each point, the rainfall of each point is calculated according to Eq.1, and according to the results, it shows that the rainfall of the secondary service center points of V, VI, VII, VIII, and X is more than 140 mm/12 h, and they have been subjected to extraordinarily heavy rainfall, and it is considered that their supplies and facilities have been damaged, so it is not possible to activate these five Tier 2 service centers. Meanwhile, the rainfall of affected sites 11, 12, and 13 is less than 30 mm/12 h, and it is considered that they are basically not affected by the disaster, so the distribution of these three affected sites is not considered in the first distribution after the disaster. The specific arithmetic results are shown in Table6.

1“ - ” denotes that supplies are not required for Tier 1 distribution center and inactive Tier 2 service centers.

Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, the remaining affected sites are clustered with the open Tier 2 service centers, and the clustering results are obtained as follows: there are no service points in the Tier 2 service center I; the set of assigned affected sites of the Tier 2 service center II is (14, 16, 21, 22); the set of assigned affected sites of the Tier 2 service center III is (15, 17, 18, 20); the Tier 2 service center IV is assigned a collection of affected sites as (24, 25, 26, 27, 30); and the Tier 2 service center IX is assigned a collection of affected sites as (19, 23, 28, 29). According to Eqs.4–5, the supplies demand of each demand point is calculated, and the supplies demand of the Tier 2 service centers is calculated based on the clustering results. Due to the limited material reserve of the Tier 1 distribution center, which is only 300 t, the total supplies demand of all affected sites is 427.1 t, which can not be distributed to meet the supplies of all affected sites at one time, and the total amount of distributed supplies is 70.24% of the total amount of required supplies. Therefore, it is necessary to distribute the supplies to the affected sites, and the distribution is based on the Distribution Model I and Distribution Model II.

In this study, the allocation of supplies at each demand point is done by SA with the parameters of temperature = 1000; alpha = 0.99; the minimum resource satisfaction rate is 30%; the number of iterations is 300; and the number of times the program is run is 10 times by using Python 3.6 software. According to the Distribution Model I, the result is:, the total amount of distributed supplies is 300 t. According to the Distribution Model II, the result is:, the total amount of distributed supplies is 300 t. The specific distribution results are shown in Table7.

1“ - ” denotes that supplies are not required for Tier 1 distribution center and inactive Tier 2 service centers.

After the distribution, the problem is solved using the GA-SA with the following parameters: number of populations = 30; mutation probability = 50%; crossover probability = 30%; inversion probability = 20%; annealing temperature = 1000; annealing coefficient = 0.99; iteration number 300 times; number of program runs 10 times.

According to the results of distribution model I, the solution is obtained as:; the optimal routes are [0, 2, 16, 21, 22, 14, 2], [0, 3, 20, 15, 17, 18, 3], [0, 4, 24, 30, 4, 25, 26, 4], [0, 9, 23, 28, 9, 29, 19, 9, 27, 9]; the generated optimal route diagram is shown in Fig.6.

According to the results of distribution model II, the solution is obtained as:; the optimal routes are [0, 2, 21, 22, 14, 16, 2], [0, 3, 20, 17, 15, 18, 3], [0, 4, 25, 4, 30, 26, 4, 24, 4], [0, 9, 27, 23, 9, 29, 28, 9, 19, 9]; the generated optimal route diagram is shown in Fig.7.

Observing the allocation results of allocation model I, it is found that the resource scarcity index of the affected sites with small resource demand is relatively lower, and it is more inclined to prioritize the affected sites with lower demand; while observing the allocation results of allocation model II, it is found that the resource scarcity index of the affected sites with larger rainfall is relatively lower, and it is more inclined to prioritize the affected sites with larger rainfall.

Distributional model I is more appropriate in the scenario of a more balanced disaster, in which the distributional model maximizes the marginal utility of the supplies.

Distribution model II is more suitable for unevenly affected areas, in which the distribution model gives higher priority to the more affected areas.

Observing the distribution results of the two distribution models, there is a situation that individual affected sites with low resource scarcity are not prioritized in distribution model I; distribution model II does not appear to make the resource scarcity index of the disaster-affected centers the lowest among all affected sites, and individual affected sites with large rainfall are not prioritized. It indicates that the algorithms for running the two distribution models are not properly selected, the local optimal solution appears, the global optimal solution is not obtained, and there is still room for further optimization of the algorithms in the distribution stage.

Using the distribution results of distribution model II, the optimal route is derived from the route optimization model that considers only the damage index and the waiting time index: [0, II, 16, 14, 22, 21, II], [0, III, 20, 18, 15, III, 17, III], [0, IV, 30, IV, 25, 24, IV, 26, IV], [0, IX, 27, 29, 23, IX, 28, 19, IX], the solution is obtained as:.

The optimal route is derived from the route optimization model that considers only the total distribution time: [0, II, 16, 21, 22, 14, II], [0, III, 20, 17, 15, III, 18, III], [0, IV, 25, IV, 30, 24, IV, 26, IV], [0, IX, 23, 27, 29, IX, 28, 19, IX], the solution is obtained as:.

The results of route optimization models are presented in Table8.

Looking at the results of the three route optimization models, when considering only the damage index and the waiting time index, priority is given to delivering affected sites with higher rainfall and closer to the primary service centers; when considering only the total delivery time, the route with higher actual speed is preferred and the total distance is minimized.

And through Table9, it can be found that the difference between the results of the three models is not very obvious. Original route optimization model shows an improvement in satisfaction over the route optimization model that only considers the damage index and the waiting time index; while the model that only requires only the shortest total time of delivery shows a small improvement over the results obtained from the route optimization model that only considers the damage index and the waiting time index.

Comparative analysis results of vehicle routing optimization models.

The original route optimization model is more applicable to the situation where the demand supplies cannot be fully satisfied; while the route optimization model that only considers the disaster index and waiting time index is more applicable to the situation where the demand supplies can be fully satisfied; for the route optimization model that only requires the shortest total time of distribution, this means that the total distance covered by the vehicle is also reduced, which is more appropriate in scenarios where damage is light and the difference in the level of damage in the affected area is small, thus reducing the emissions and economic cost of the rescue and ensuring its effectiveness.

The following discussion will explore the change in the average satisfaction of residents in the affected area whenin the distribution strategy is increased from 30 km/h to 120 km/h (each increase of 10 km/h). Assuming that the residents receive timely and effective information and can accurately ascertainin the distribution strategy, the average satisfaction of the residents is. Conversely, if the residents are not provided with sufficient information and instead believeis fixed at 80 km/h, the average satisfaction level is. The results are shown in Table10; Fig.8.

By analyzing the results of the tests, the following results were obtained.

The inverse relationship betweenandis attributable to the discrepancy betweenanddue to precipitation. In circumstances of open and transparent information, victims will adapt their psychological expectations according towith flexibility. Furthermore, an increase inwill not result in a significant reduction in waiting time, and the decrease in waiting time will be less than the increase in victims’ psychological expectations, leading to the conclusion that asincreases,decreases.

The positive relationship betweenandsuggests that whenis lower than the victims’ expectation, the psychological gap increases anddecreases. Whenis higher than the victim’s expectation, the psychological expectation is exceeded andincreases.

After a flood disaster, it is essential that emergency distribution takes place taking into account the current relief situation. The first step is to determine whether available supplies can meet the needs of all affected locations. Once this is determined, the distribution plan must be adjusted to ensure an even distribution of aid throughout the affected area.

If the severity of the disaster is evenly distributed, distribution model I can be used. Conversely, if the severity of the disaster is unevenly distributed, distribution model II can be used.

In the event that the amount of existing supplies is sufficient to cover the needs of all affected locations, the route optimization model can be used taking into account only the disaster index and the waiting time index. Conversely, if the amount of existing supplies is insufficient to meet the needs of all affected locations, the route optimization model can be used taking into account the resource scarcity index, the disaster index and the waiting time index. In cases where the situation cannot be captured, the route optimization model can be used with the aim of achieving the shortest overall distribution time. In the event that a determination is not possible, the route optimization model can be used, which only requires the shortest total distribution time.

Compared to other related studies, the approach stands out for considering the effects of precipitation on vehicle speed when deriving distribution routes. Many existing studies overlook this factor, but have found that taking this factor into account makes the routes more practical. During real floods, rainfall can significantly slow down vehicles, affecting travel times. Incorporating these variables into the model can generate more accurate distribution routes, reducing delays and ensuring timely delivery of relief supplies.

This article has several limitations. The distribution of precipitation in real situations may differ from the assumptions made in this article. The influence of topography on vehicle movement is not taken into account in the path optimization model. The influence of precipitation on vehicle speed depends on factors such as water depth, road floats, etc.

In the next phase of research, the disaster scenarios should be expanded so that the research model can be adapted to multiple types of disaster relief and the applicability of the model is improved. In addition, road network data should also be used for research closer to reality.
