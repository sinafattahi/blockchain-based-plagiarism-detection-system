Coinfections can alter the adaptive immune responses to bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and hinder accurate diagnosis; however, their effect on host immunity toMycobacterium bovisand disease progression is not well understood. In this study, we assessed the impact of natural coinfection with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) on immune responses toM. bovis. Among 108 cattle examined, those coinfected with BLV showed a significantly higher intragranulomatous mycobacterial burden and more severe pathological lesions compared to animals infected withM. bovisalone. Additionally, coinfected animals demonstrated a granulomatous response characterized by reduced lymphocyte populations, increased neutrophil infiltration, and diminished granuloma encapsulation, suggesting a compromised antimycobacterial immune response. Supporting this hypothesis, BLV-infected cattle exposed to mycobacterial antigens displayed impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity (type IV hypersensitivity) to a purified protein derivative ofM. bovisas well as reduced antibody response. These findings indicate that BLV coinfection influences the immunopathogenesis of bTB, exacerbates disease progression in cattle naturally infected withM. bovis, and may reduce the predictive reliability of diagnostic methods used in bTB control programs.

Mycobacterium bovis, an intracellular acid-fast bacillus, is the primary causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a zoonotic disease with significant global economic impacts1. Despite eradication programs based on diagnostic testing and culling, bTB persists, infecting an estimated 50 million cattle worldwide and causing annual economic losses of approximately US $3 billion2. The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test (SICTT), which assesses delayed-type hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin, remains the primary diagnostic method3. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based tests to detect antibodies againstM. bovisproteins (MPB70, MPB83, ESAT-6, and CFP-10) have been used as a diagnostic strategy in some countries4,5. However, their sensitivity and specificity are influenced by disease progression and immunomodulation owing to coinfections6. For instance,Fasciola hepaticacoinfection in bTB-positive cattle reduces reactivity in the tuberculin test7.

We previously characterized the granulomatous response in bovines during naturalM. bovisinfection8. Specifically, we examined tissue immune responses in 228 dairy cattle infected solely withM. bovis. However, in subsequent cohorts of asymptomatic animals, we identified a subgroup of cattle naturally coinfected with bothM. bovisand bovine leukemia virus (BLV).

BLV is a deltaretrovirus genetically related to human T-cell leukemia virus types 1 and 29,10. It causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a highly contagious disease affecting cattle populations worldwide, and leading to productivity losses and trade restrictions11. EBL prevalence in South America ranges between 23 and 84%, and in Brazil, the estimates vary between 17 and 60%12. While most BLV-infected cattle (50–70%) remain asymptomatic, 30–50% develop persistent lymphocytosis, and 1–5% progress to B-cell lymphosarcoma9,13. BLV disrupts immune homeostasis by infecting B and T lymphocytes and inhibiting apoptosis through upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 214. While the immunomodulatory effects of BLV are well documented15–17, its impact on the pathogenesis of bTB remains poorly characterized.

In this study, cattle naturally coinfected with BLV andM. boviswere examined to characterize the immune responses associated with the progression of bTB. Additionally, an experimental bovine model was used to evaluate the impact of natural BLV infection on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses.

To characterize the immune response to mycobacteria in cattle naturally coinfected with BLV andM. bovis, we analyzed the associations between mycobacterial burden, intragranuloma organization, severity of pathological lesions, and humoral response againstM. bovis.M. bovis-infected cattle that tested positive forN. caninum,Leptospirasp., IBR, and BVD were excluded from the study (Fig.1a). Figure1b shows that cattle coinfected with BLV exhibited significantly higher mycobacterial loads within granulomatous lesions compared with those infected solely withM. bovis(BLV/bTB vs. bTB;p< 0.001). When assessing disease severity based on the anatomical dissemination of bTB lesions, we observed a relatively high frequency of severe bTB cases, defined as stages IV and V, in BLV/bTB cattle. These animals presented lesions in organs and tissues of the abdominal and/or thoracic cavity, with or without associated lymph node involvement (p< 0.001; Fig.1c). Further analysis using a semiquantitative scoring system for bTB lung lesions18demonstrated that BLV coinfected cattle (BLV/bTB) exhibited significantly high pathology severity scores (p< 0.001; Fig.1d). Additionally, analysis of the immune response in bTB-infected cattle showed that animals coinfected with BLV exhibited significantly reduced levels of anti-M. bovisantibodies compared to those in animals infected with bTB alone (p< 0.001; Fig.1e). Consistent with this finding, BLV-infected PPDb-negative animals displayed significantly reduced levels of anti-BVD and anti-N. caninumantibodies in ELISA assay compared to those in the control (BLV-negative) cattle (p< 0.001; Fig.1f). Collectively, these results suggest that cattle naturally infected with BLV exhibit impaired adaptive immune responses toMycobacterium bovisas well as to other pathogens, including BVD andNeospora caninum.

Bovine leukosis virus (BLV) infection exacerbatesMycobacterium bovis-mediated pathology severity and impairs humoral responses.

Optical density (OD) readings were obtained at a wavelength of 450 nm. Groups analyzed were: BLV-positive (BLV+) and BVD-positive (BVD) (n= 203); BLV-negative (BLV−) and BVD-positive (BVD) (n= 288); BLV-positive (BLV+) andN. caninum-positive (N. caninum)(n= 264); BLV-negative (BLV−) andN. caninum-positive (N. caninum) (n= 221).

To explore the immune factors linked to the heightened severity of bTB in BLV/M. boviscoinfected cattle and their potential immunopathological correlates, we performed an in-depth analysis of the cellular composition within tuberculous granulomas in coinfected animals. In bTB coinfected animals, tuberculous granulomas exhibited thin or absent encapsulation, with extensive areas of caseous necrosis and mineralization. The granulomatous cellular response was primarily composed of epithelioid macrophages, scattered multinucleated Langhans giant cells, and lymphocyte clusters and included a moderate number of neutrophils (Fig.2a1–4). In contrast, as reported previously8, cattle infected solely withM. bovisdeveloped densely fibrous encapsulated granulomas, with extensive multicentric areas of caseous necrosis and central dystrophic mineralization (Fig.2a5–8). Their granulomatous cellular response consisted of dense lymphocyte clusters and epithelioid macrophages, increased multinucleated Langhans giant cells, and few or absent neutrophils, which surrounded the necrotic areas (Fig.2a5–8). Quantitative analysis of the granulomatous response revealed that coinfected animals (BLV/bTB) had significantly lower counts of lymphocytes (p< 0.001) and higher numbers of epithelioid macrophages (p< 0.001) and neutrophils (p< 0.001) than those of bTB-infected animals (Fig.2b). Additionally, histological analysis of granulomatous responses in the lungs and lymph nodes showed that coinfected cattle exhibited reduced primary granuloma encapsulation (p< 0.001; Fig.2c). These results suggest that BLV infection impairsM. bovis-induced granuloma structure.

The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to the skin test, the primary diagnostic tool for detecting bTB, was assessed in naturally BLV-infected cattle. A group of 17M. bovis-negative cattle was primed withM. bovisandM. aviumPPD for 56 days. Following this, 12 animals were exposed to mycobacterial antigens and 5 were treated with PBS for 72 ± 6 h, and skin reactions were measured (Fig.3a). Hematological analysis of the BLV-infected group confirmed the presence of persistent lymphocytosis (Fig.3b). BLV-infected animals displayed reduced skin fold thickness compared with BLV-negative cattle in response to both bovine (p< 0.01) and avian (p< 0.01) PPD tuberculin (Fig.3c). Further histopathological analysis of the cellular profile of the DTH reaction revealed a mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in BLV-infected cattle, characterized by clustered lymphocytes and scattered macrophages (Fig.3d 1–4). In contrast, noninfected control animals displayed an intense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, with densely clustered lymphocytes and scattered macrophages (Fig.3d5–8). Cellular pattern analysis of the DTH reaction demonstrated that BLV cattle had significantly lower counts of lymphocytes (p< 0.001), histiocytes (p< 0.001), and neutrophils than noninfected animals (Fig.3e). These findings indicate that cattle naturally infected with BLV display altered skin DTH responses to mycobacterial antigens.

Mycobacterium bovispathogenesis is critically influenced by the bacterium’s capacity to survive within host cells and the host’s ability to mount an effective immune response19,20. Coinfections may impair these defense mechanisms, thereby promoting pathogen persistence and transmission7,21. In this study, we employed a naturally infected bovine model to investigate the impact of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) on bTB progression. Our data reveal that BLV coinfection is associated with enhanced disease severity and reduced diagnostic sensitivity, suggesting a complex interplay between viral infection and mycobacterial immunity.

BLV/bTB coinfected animals exhibited elevated mycobacterial burdens, widespread lesion dissemination, and exacerbated pathological outcomes when compared toM. bovis-infected, BLV-negative counterparts. These findings support a model in which BLV-mediated immune modulation facilitatesM. bovisproliferation. Consistent with our observations, viral coinfections in other models—such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 withM. tuberculosis—have been shown to potentiate bacterial pathogenesis and disrupt host immune equilibrium22–24. In our cohort, BLV/bTB animals also demonstrated a marked reduction in humoral responses against MPB70 and MPB83, two antigens commonly targeted in antibody-based diagnostics. This attenuation of antigen-specific antibody levels may compromise serological test sensitivity, thus undermining bTB detection efforts.

Moreover, we observed significant immunological alterations in BLV/bTB animals, including lymphopenia and neutrophilia, suggestive of skewed leukocyte homeostasis. Granuloma integrity is contingent upon effective lymphocyte recruitment and function. CD4 + Th1 and Th17 cells, CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and γδ T cells are known to orchestrate antimycobacterial responses via TNF and IFN-γ secretion19,25,26, while B cells contribute to granuloma structure and stability27,28. The lymphocytic depletion observed here may impair granuloma encapsulation and bacterial containment. Reduced fibrotic encapsulation in BLV/bTB granulomas further supports this hypothesis, as fibrosis has been linked to robust Th1-driven immunity29,30. In contrast, increased neutrophil infiltration—although potentially reflecting a compensatory response—may exacerbate tissue damage, especially given the dysfunctional phagocytic capacity and proinflammatory bias reported in neutrophils from BLV-infected cattle31,32.

A critical aspect of our findings relates to the impact of BLV on delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. BLV-infected animals with persistent lymphocytosis exhibited significantly diminished DTH reactivity following mycobacterial antigen challenge. Given that DTH underlies the skin test-based diagnostics commonly employed for bTB (e.g., SICTT, IFN-γ release assays), such suppression may result in false-negative outcomes, thereby complicating surveillance and eradication efforts6. Similar diagnostic impairments have been described in coinfections involvingFasciola hepaticaor bovine viral diarrhea virus, which also interfere with IFN-γ signaling and lymphocyte activation7,33–35.

Although our study utilized a naturally occurring coinfection model, detailed mechanistic insights into BLV-induced immune modulation would benefit from experimental coinfection systems and single-cell immunophenotyping. Still, previous evidence indicates that altered expression of MHC class II and IL-2 receptor pathways in BLV-infected cattle21,36may further compromise antigen presentation and T cell activation, thereby weakening both host immune control and the reliability of diagnostic tests. These immunological disruptions likely contribute to the persistence ofM. boviswithin herds despite ongoing control efforts. Our findings identify BLV as a microbial cofactor capable of modifying the natural history of bTB, attenuating diagnostic accuracy, and sustaining the silent transmission ofM. bovisin endemic settings. Differences in breed susceptibility, regional management practices, and environmental exposures could affect immune responses to both BLV andM. bovis. Thus, while our findings provide crucial insights into the immunopathogenesis of BLV/bTB coinfection, further studies across diverse breeds, geographic regions, and production systems are warranted to validate and extend these observations.

All animals included in this study tested positive in the SICTT (PPD) and were confirmed as positive forM. bovisusing bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), histopathological examination, and Ziehl–Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The study population consisted of 108 crossbred Holstein/Jersey cows, aged between 1.6 and 11 years, which were mandatorily sent to abattoirs following a positive SICTT reaction in compliance with Brazilian regulations37,38. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation from the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (CETEA/UDESC) (Protocol #1.13.10). All procedures were performed in strict accordance with animal welfare regulations and international guidelines for the ethical use of animals in research and complied with the ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org). The animals originated from 18 dairy farms in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, operating under intensive husbandry systems. The SICTT was conducted following the guidelines established by the Brazilian Department of Agriculture37,38. Biological sample collections were performed on animals already destined for slaughter due to a positive bTB diagnosis, in federally inspected abattoirs and in accordance with PNCETB 06/2004 and MAPA 03/2000 regulations, as well as in compliance with Brazilian legislation and international ethical guidelines for animal welfare. Tissue samples from lesions suggestive of tuberculosis, which were identified at slaughter, were collected for histopathological analysis and AFB detection (fixed in 10% buffered formalin) and for mycobacterial culture and PCR detection (refrigerated at 2–8 °C). Additionally, blood samples were collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing tubes for hematological analysis and into tubes without anticoagulant for serological assessment.

Tissue samples containing granulomatous lesions were homogenized using a tissue homogenization system (TissueRuptor, Qiagen, Netherlands). Homogenized tissue (1 mL) was decontaminated and concentrated using the modified Petroff method38. For culture, 100 µL decontaminated homogenate was inoculated into Ogawa–Kudoh medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate (12 mg/mL). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C under aerobic conditions and monitored weekly for contaminants and mycobacterial colony growth. Colony-forming units (CFU) were counted after eight weeks. The reference strains,M. bovisAN5 andM. aviumD4, served as positive controls. Culture- and AFB-positive samples underwent PCR identification targeting IS1081 (approximately 135 bp)39and RvD1Rv2031c (approximately 500 bp)10to distinguishM. bovisfromM. tuberculosisandM. avium. Mycobacteria were isolated at the Immunobiology Laboratory of the Federal University of Santa Catarina. All procedures involving tissue homogenization, culture, and handling of mycobacteria were performed under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) conditions to ensure personnel safety and prevent environmental contamination.

ELISAs for BLV, BVD, IBR, andNeospora caninumwere performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (IDEXX Laboratories). Microagglutination testing was conducted forLeptospiraspp. The BLV ELISA specifically detects antibodies directed against the BLV gp51 envelope glycoprotein. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 1:1 in diluent solution and tested in duplicate. Reagents were added to 96-well plates, which were incubated for 30 ± 3 min (18–26 °C). Plates were then washed six times. Positive and negative control reagents were included to validate each microtiter plate and enable data calculation. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (800TS; Biotek, VT, USA).

Real-time PCR assays were performed to detect BLV, BVD, IBR, bovine herpesvirus type 5, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, andM. bovis. BLV infection was specifically confirmed using a TaqMan quantitative PCR assay as described by40. Reactions were carried out on a QuantStudio 3 instrument (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 µL. The forward primer MRBLVF (positions 2321–2339) was 5′-CCTCAATTCCCTTTAAACTA-3′, the reverse primer MRBLVR (positions 2421–2440) was 5′-GTACCGGGAAGACTGGATTA-3′, and the probe (positions 2340–2360) was FAM-5′-GAACGCCTCCAGGCCCTTCA-BHQ-3′. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial reaction at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 60 s.

Hematological analysis was performed on BLV-positive andM. bovis-negative cattle that had been inoculated with inactivated bacterial cultures ofM. bovis(CFPb,M. bovisAN5 strain) andM. avium(CFPa,M. aviumD4 strain). Measurements were conducted using an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (PocH-100iV, Sysmex, Japan), and differential leukocyte counts were assessed manually on Romanowsky-stained blood smears. Persistent lymphocytosis was defined as peripheral blood lymphocyte counts exceeding 8,000 cells/µL in at least two hemograms performed at a four-month interval.

Comprehensive postmortem examinations were performed on organs and tissues, including the lungs, pleura, pericardium, liver, spleen, intestines, mesentery, kidneys, heart, major muscle groups, genitourinary system, mammary gland, and lymph nodes (parotid, retropharyngeal, mandibular, palatine tonsils, tracheobronchial, bronchial, mediastinal, hepatic, mesenteric, iliac, and sciatic). These tissues were sectioned at 0.5–1.0-cm intervals for detecting visible lesions indicative of bTB. The anatomical dissemination of bTB lesions was categorized into five levels based on a semiquantitative scoring system8,18.

Level I: Lesions confined to lymph nodes of the head (retropharyngeal, mandibular, and parotid).

Level II: Lesions present in thoracic lymph nodes (mediastinal and tracheobronchial) or abdominal lymph nodes (mesenteric, inguinal, hepatic, gastric, splenic, renal, and iliac).

Level III: Simultaneous involvement of thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes.

Level IV: Lesions present in thoracic or abdominal organs with or without involvement of draining lymph nodes.

Level V: Concurrent lesions in both thoracic and abdominal organs with or without the involvement of the associated lymph nodes.

Lung lobes (left caudal, left cranial, right cranial, right caudal, middle, and accessory) were sectioned and scored from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no visible lesions and 5 denoting extensive coalescing lesions. A similar scoring system was applied to lesions observed in major organs and tissues, including the pleura, pericardium, liver, spleen, intestines, mesentery, and reproductive system. Lymph nodes were transversely sectioned at 0.5–1.0-cm intervals and scored from 0 to 3, with 0 representing the absence of visible bTB lesions and 3 indicating coalescent lesions.

A total of 34 crossbred Holstein/Jersey cows (17 BLV-positive and 17 BLV-negative) aged between 1.5 and 2 years that tested negative for bTB in the SICTT (PPD) were included in the study. Twelve BLV-positive and 12 BLV-negative cows were subcutaneously injected with 5 mL (180 mg/mL) inactivated bacterial culture ofM. bovis(CFPb,M. bovisAN5 strain) andM. avium(CFPa,M. aviumD4 strain). The control groups received 5 mL sterile PBS.

DTH was determined by measuring the increase in skin fold thickness (mm) after 56 days of sensitization. Two points in the medial cervical region, 15–20-cm apart, were trichotomized (± 3 cm2), and the skin fold was measured using a calibrated cutimeter. PPD (0.1 mL) ofM. bovisstrain AN5 (PPDb, 1 mg/mL) andM. aviumstrain D4 (PPDa, 0.5 mg/mL) were injected into both points. The skin fold thickness at the PPD application sites was measured 72 ± 6 h after inoculation. The size of the DTH reaction was determined individually for each animal. Animals that presented an area of reaction ≤ 0.5 mm at the application site for one or both antigens were considered anergic and were excluded from the analysis. After assessing DTH, a skin biopsy was performed at the reaction site. The tissue fragments were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution (pH 7.2–7.4) for 48 h. Then, the tissue samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (4 μm), and stained with H&E. The histomorphological analysis and image capturing were performed using an Olympus BX40 optical microscope.

An IDEXXM. bovisAb Test kit was used for detecting antibodies against theM. tuberculosiscomplex antigens MPB70 and MPB83, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 50-fold in PBS and tested in duplicate. The test reagents (100 µL) were added to a 96-well plate, which were set up in duplicate, and incubated for 60 min, and the wells were then washed six times. Positive and negative test control reagents were used to validate each microtiter plate and obtain data for calculation. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer (800TS; Biotek, VT, USA).

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Differences in frequencies of categorical variables, such as lesion dissemination levels and granuloma encapsulation levels, were assessed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables, including mycobacterial load, pathology scores, antibody titers, cell counts, and DTH responses, were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney nonparametric test due to non-normal data distribution. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Corresponding p-values are also reported. Statistical significance was defined asp< 0.05.
