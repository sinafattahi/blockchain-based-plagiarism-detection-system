Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common malignancies arising in bone. Hypoxia and immune regulation are pivotal in tumor biology. However, their combined effects and mechanisms in OS remain understudied. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of hypoxic-induced M2 macrophages in promoting the progression of OS.

Differentially expressed proteins in hypoxic macrophage supernatants were detected by antibody array. Cell functional experiments, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, and overexpression transfection were used to study osteopontin (OPN) and its supernatant effect. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to investigate downstream targets and pathways, and a xenograft model was established to assess in vivo effects.

Our data revealed that hypoxic M2 macrophage supernatant enhanced OS malignancy and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, activating cancer pathways. Hypoxia upregulated OPN in M2 macrophages, and OPN inhibition reduced its tumor-promoting effect. Early growth response 3 (EGR3) was differentially expressed in OS cells treated with the supernatant, and its overexpression inhibited OS cell migration, reversing tumor promotion. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), a key differentially expressed gene related to OPN and EGR3 overexpression, inhibited OS cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, OPN increased retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) expression and enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor kappa B, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, while EGR3 and ISG15 overexpression inhibited these effects. Silencing ISG15 restored pathway activation and reversed the inhibitory effect of EGR3 on OS cell migration. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that EGR3 activates ISG15 transcription. OPN treatment upregulated DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression, and ChIP assays demonstrated that EGR3 overexpression enhanced DNMT1 binding to the EGR3 promoter. These findings suggest that OPN promotes OS malignancy by downregulating EGR3 and ISG15, and by enhancing RIG-I expression, as validated in a xenograft model of OS.

Our findings demonstrate that hypoxic-induced M2 macrophages promote OS progression through OPN-dependent mechanisms, including inhibition of EGR3 and ISG15 expression and upregulation of RIG-I.

Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary malignant bone tumor, shows a unique bimodal age distribution. The primary peak occurs in children and adolescents (median age of 18), and a second, smaller peak is observed in older adults over 60 years of age [1]. OS mainly occurs in long bones like the femur, tibia, and humerus, near growth plates, and rarely in the skull, jaw, and pelvis, and is characterized by malignant osteoblastic cells producing osteoid matrix, a feature associated with aggressive behavior and high metastatic potential [2]. While 68% of localized OS patients achieve 5 + years survival, 20–30% still develop metastasis or recurrence, and the prognosis for advanced cases has remained poor despite available anticancer therapies. [3–6]. Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of OS progression and identifying reliable biomarkers is essential to advance precision oncology and immunotherapeutic strategies.

Bone tumors, notably OS, develop within a unique bone tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a specialized and dynamic condition comprising bone cells (osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes), stromal cells (mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts), vascular cells (endothelial cells and pericytes), immune cells (macrophages and lymphocytes), and a mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) [7]. Under physiological conditions, a precise interplay between these cells maintains bone homeostasis, while in primary and secondary tumors, the bone TME provides a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell growth and progression [2]. The crosstalk between OS and the bone TME encompasses an intricate network of environmental signals triggered by myriad cytokines, chemokines, and soluble growth factors [8]. Hypoxia, a hallmark of the TME, reprograms gene and protein expression, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis [9,10]. For example, slowly proliferating cells in low-oxygen zones can resist cytotoxic drugs targeting fast-growing cells. In contrast, cancer stem cells may thrive there, facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and driving tumor progression [11].

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major immune cell group within the TME and can account for up to 50% of the cellular content in certain solid tumors [12]. They promote disease progression and therapy resistance by supplying nutrients and growth factors to malignant cells. TAMs exhibit significant heterogeneity across cancer patients, lesions, and tumors. This arises from their ability to adapt to the environment, adopting diverse phenotypes, metabolism, and functions, ranging from pro-inflammatory M1-like to anti-inflammatory M2-like states [13]. TAMs exhibit significant heterogeneity shaped by the complex TME, with hypoxia acting as a key driver that recruits TAMs to low-oxygen regions and promotes their polarization toward tumor-supportive phenotypes. For instance, studies have found that hypoxic niches drive TAM immunosuppression—a process exacerbated by vascular abnormalities induced by adaptive immunity in glioblastoma. Targeting these niches can disrupt TAM organization and improve tumor control [14]. Hypoxia also alters tumor-macrophage communication, favoring M2 polarization, which boosts tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune suppression, unlike M1 macrophages, which inhibit tumors. For example, activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and HIF-2α is one of the main initiators of macrophage-head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell interactions [15]. Additionally, hypoxia regulates the communication between TAMs and tumor cells by influencing the expression and release of mediators such as extracellular vesicles, cytokines, and growth factors. These interactions are crucial for tumor survival, proliferation, and invasion [13].

Increasing evidence has shown that hypoxia or the immune microenvironment plays a vital role in the development of OS [16–18]. However, reliable gene signatures based on the combination of hypoxia and the immune status for OS prognostic prediction have not been identified. This study aims to identify gene expression and biomarkers associated with both hypoxia and immune status and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of OS.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were generated from BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 weeks, which were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (License No. SCKK 2022-0004). Following euthanasia via cervical dislocation, femurs and tibias were collected under sterile conditions. After removing surrounding muscle tissues, both ends of the bones were excised, and the bone marrow was flushed out using a 1 mL syringe. The resulting suspension was passed through a 70 μm filter to eliminate tissue debris. Subsequently, red blood cell lysis buffer (2–3 mL) was applied to eliminate erythrocytes. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, s-FBS-x-015, SERANA, China) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, 15140-122, Gibco, USA). For macrophage differentiation, cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106per dish in a medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, HY-P70553, MCE, USA). Cultures were maintained at 37℃ in an incubator with 5% CO2and high humidity. On the third day, half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium, followed by complete medium replenishment on day 5. By day 7, the adherent macrophage population was collected and designated mature BMDMs for subsequent assays.

The cell lines HOS (YDT-0265), MG-63 (YDT-0400), THP-1 (YDT-0666), K7M2 (YDT-0317), and 293T (YDT-0019) utilized in this study were procured from INDIT Bio-Technology Co., Ltd (Hangzhou, China). The HOS and 293T cell lines were cultivated in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, C11095500BT, BDBIO, China), while Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, 02-5062EJ, BDBIO, China) was used to maintain MG-63 and K7M2 cells. The THP-1 cell line was grown in RPMI-1640. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide, and all media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.

Cells under hypoxic conditions were cultured in a tri-gas incubator (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) to simulate a low-oxygen environment. Normoxic conditions were maintained at 21% O2and 5% CO2. These oxygen levels were strictly controlled and consistently applied across all experiments involving normoxia-hypoxia comparisons.

THP-1 cells underwent differentiation into M0 macrophages following 24 h exposure to 100 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, HY-18739, MCE, USA). Following a 24 h recovery in a fresh complete medium, cells were cells were treated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, L2630, Sigma, USA) and 20 ng/mL interferon-γ (IFN-γ, HY-P7025A, MCE, USA) for 48 h to drive M1 polarization.

To induce M2-type polarization, THP-1 cells were initially treated with 100 ng/mL PMA for 24 h to facilitate differentiation. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 48 h with 10 ng/mL of Interleukin-4 (IL-4, 200-04-20UG, PEPROTECH, China) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13, 200-13-10UG, PEPROTECH, China). BMDMs were polarized to the M2 phenotype by treatment with 20 ng/mL IL-4 and 20 ng/mL IL-13 for 24 h.

To investigate the function of hypoxic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the progression of OS, human THP-1-derived macrophages were induced and polarized into both M1 and M2 subtypes under normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions, while primary mouse BMDMs were polarized into the M2 subtype under the same conditions. The supernatant from M2 macrophages was co-cultured with OS cell lines for an additional 24 h to assess its impact on the malignant phenotypes of OS cells.

HOS, MG-63, and K7M2 cell lines were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104cells per well. After 24 h of incubation, MTT (M2128, Sigma, USA) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. Following incubation, the formazan produced was solubilized using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, D2650, Sigma, USA). The absorbance at 570 nm was recorded using a microplate reader (51,119,570, Thermo Fisher, USA) to assess cell viability.

HOS, MG-63, and K7M2 cells were collected and seeded in the upper Transwell chamber (3422, COSTAR, USA) at a density of 1 × 104cells per well without adding serum. A culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the lower Transwell chamber. After 24 h of culture, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet (C110703, Aladdin, China). Invasion assays were performed by adding Matrigel (356,234, Corning, USA) to the upper chamber half an hour in advance. Cell migration and invasion were observed and imaged using a microscope (IX73, Olympus Corp, China).

HOS, MG-63, and K7M2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 105cells per well. After cell adhesion, the medium was carefully removed, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (1 mL per well) for 30 min. Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet solution (1 mL per well) for 20 min to visualize colonies. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were considered viable and counted under an inverted microscope (ECLIPSE Ts2, Nikon, Japan). Colony images were captured and analyzed using ImageJ software (v1.8.0).

Cell lysates were generated using RIPA buffer, and protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (PC0020, Solarbio, China). WB was performed in accordance with the published description [19]. The protein samples were separated using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The ECL kit (BL520B, Biosharp, China) was used to visualize those specifically bound to primary and secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used in this experiment are listed in Table1.

To identify differentially expressed proteins in the supernatant of THP-1 cells differentiated into M2 macrophages and treated under hypoxic conditions for 24 h, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and samples were diluted as required. Cytokine and chemokine expression was assessed using the Human Cytokine Antibody Array (ab133998, Abcam, UK), a multiplexed, semi-quantitative array designed to simultaneously detect and quantify multiple cytokines and chemokines in a single sample. The antibody array membrane was initially blocked with 1 × blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature to prevent non-specific binding. Subsequently, diluted supernatant samples were added to the array and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After a series of buffer washes, biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied, followed by a 2 h incubation at room temperature. Additional washes were performed before adding HRP-conjugated streptavidin, with a further incubation of 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system to compare signal intensities at specific antigen–antibody spots, determining relative protein expression levels among the samples. Signal intensity was quantified using ImageLab software.

Cells were lysed using Trizol reagent (15,596,018, Ambion, China) to extract total RNA. RNA extraction was performed using isopropanol (327,270,010, Acros Organics, USA), followed by a 75% ethanol wash, and then dissolved in Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water (BL510B, Biosharp, China). The subsequent procedures were performed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1622, Thermo, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR amplification was conducted on a Thermo 7300 RT-qPCR system with the Genious™ 2 × SYBR Green Fast qPCR Mix (RM21204, Abclonal, China). Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCtmethod, with β-actin as the reference gene. RT-qPCR was performed using optimized primer pairs and commercial SYBR Green reagents under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Only Ct values within the accepted linear range were included in the analysis. The primer sequences can be found in Table2.

To evaluate the levels of OPN in the supernatant of THP-1 cells that had been induced to the M2 phase and subjected to hypoxic treatment, we employed an ELISA kit (EK2135, MultiSciences, China). The process commenced with the addition of 50 μL of diluent to each well of the microplate, which was then followed by the introduction of 50 μL of either the standard, control, or sample. The plate was left to incubate at room temperature for a duration of 2 h. After this, the plate underwent four washes before a conjugate reagent was applied to each well, with further incubation at room temperature for 2 h. After another set of four washes, 100 μL of substrate solution was added to each well. The enzymatic reaction was halted after 30 min with the addition of the stop solution. Finally, the absorbance was determined at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (840-297000, Thermo, USA).

The stable lentiviral constructs for early growth response 3 (EGR3) or interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) overexpression (Lenti-EGR3 and Lenti-ISG15), as well as for OPN knockdown (sh-OPN), along with their corresponding negative controls, were generated using 293 T cells. The overexpression plasmids were obtained from Suzhou Genewiz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and the shRNA plasmids were sourced from Tsingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). Plasmids and transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000, 11,668,019, Thermo, USA) were diluted in serum-free medium, combined, and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min to form complexes. These complexes were subsequently added to the cell medium, mixed gently, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2for 24 h.

HOS and MG63 cells were cultured in a serum-free medium for 12 h before the start of the experiment. To construct HOS and MG63 cell lines overexpressing EGR3 and ISG15, plasmids overexpressing EGR3 (NM_004430) and ISG15 (NM_005101) were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector, which contains a CMV promoter commonly used to achieve high expression levels. For gene silencing, siRNAs targeting ISG15 and a negative control siRNA (siR-NC) were used. EGR3 or ISG15 and their corresponding empty control plasmids or siRNAs were transfected into the corresponding HOS or MG63 cells for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000. The transfection efficiency was detected by WB. All plasmids were obtained from Youbio (Hunan, China). The sequences used in this experiment are listed in Table3.

To evaluate the impact of wild-type OPN on promoter activity in a hypoxic environment, M2 macrophages (THP-1) were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the wild-type human OPN promoter region (− 1000 to + 1) cloned into the pGL3-basic vector. The cells were cultured for 24 h in a hypoxic environment with normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions, lysed with 1 × lysis buffer, and then centrifuged to remove debris. Luciferase activity was measured in a 96-well plate using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (E1910, Promega, USA). LAR II and Stop & Glo® Reagents were added sequentially, and relative luciferase units were calculated and normalized to the empty vector control.

For assessing EGR3 transcriptional activation of ISG15, luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type or mutant EGR3-binding sequences within the ISG15 promoter were generated. HOS cells were simultaneously transfected with reporter plasmids and either pcDNA3.1-EGR3 or an empty pcDNA3.1 vector. Luciferase activity was assessed 24 h after transfection.

Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, lysed, and chromatin was sheared using ultrasound. Overnight incubation of the sheared chromatin with a DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-specific antibody was followed by immunoprecipitation using protein G magnetic beads at 4 °C. After crosslink reversal and protein digestion with NaCl and Proteinase K at 65 °C for 2 h, DNA was purified for subsequent analysis. PCR amplification was performed using primers targeting the DNMT1-binding region within the EGR3 promoter (forward: 5′-CTTTCTAACTGCTGGGGTG-3′, reverse: 5′-CTATTTATCTGAGCCCCGG-3′).

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (15,596,018, Ambion, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. A NanoDrop ND-1000 was used to assess RNA concentration and purity, while an Agilent Bioanalyzer and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the integrity (RIN > 7.0). From 1 µg of total RNA, Poly(A) RNA was extracted using Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25. The purified RNA was then fragmented at 94 °C for 5–7 min and converted to cDNA using SuperScript™ II. The second strand synthesis involved E. coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and dUTP. An adenine base was introduced to the cDNA for adapter ligation, and size selection was performed using AMPureXP beads. PCR amplification was performed under defined thermal conditions, resulting in an average insert size of 300 ± 50 bp. Paired-end sequencing of 150 bp was subsequently conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq™ 6000 (LC-Bio Technology, Hangzhou).

For gene expression profiling, two independent RNA-seq analyses were conducted. In Fig.4, HOS cells were treated for 24 h with supernatants from THP-1-derived M2 macrophages cultured under hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) conditions. In Fig.6, MG-63 cells were transfected with either a plasmid for EGR3 overexpression or a control vector, followed by recombinant OPN treatment.

Raw sequencing data were obtained in FASTQ format and subjected to quality control using FastQC. Adapter sequences and low-quality reads were removed using fastp (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) to generate clean reads. Clean reads were aligned to the human reference genome using HISAT2 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2), and gene-level quantification was performed using featureCounts. Raw count matrices were normalized and analyzed for differential gene expression using DESeq2. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined using a threshold of |log2FC|≥ 1 and adjusted q-value < 0.05. DEG statistics, including the number of upregulated and downregulated genes, were visualized using ggplot2 (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare/). Functional enrichment analyses for Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were conducted using the clusterProfiler R package, and the top 20 enriched pathways were presented. For the Hypoxia vs. Normoxia comparison, the top 100 DEGs (ranked by q-value) were selected for heatmap visualization using the pheatmap package, with expression values shown as Z-scores. For OPN_EGR3 vs. OPN and OPN vs. pCDH groups, heatmaps were similarly generated based on DEGs, with standardized expression displayed using Z-transformed values.

Xenograft tumor models were established by subcutaneously injecting MG-63 cells with stable overexpression of EGR3 or ISG15 or control cells (5 × 106/200 μL) into 5-week-old female nude mice (n = 6) obtained from Slaccas (Shanghai, China). The mice were assigned to six groups: Lenti-control + PBS, Lenti-EGR3 + PBS, Lenti-ISG15 + PBS, Lenti-control + OPN, Lenti-EGR3 + OPN, and Lenti-ISG15 + OPN. After tumor formation, the treatment group mice were administered 100 μL of a 150 μg/mL OPN solution through intratumoral injection twice a week, while the control group mice received an equivalent volume of PBS. All mice were kept under pathogen-free conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle at 22°C for approximately one week before treatment. Tumor growth was closely monitored, and once the control group tumors reached a volume of 1500 mm3, all the mice were euthanized, tumors were stripped, and their volumes and weights were measured. The experimental procedures conducted in this study adhered strictly to the Chinese Regulations for the Administration of Laboratory Animals. The animal experiments were approved by the Laboratory of Animal Experimental Ethical Inspection of Dr. Can Biotechnology (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd. (Approval No. DRK-20240914021).

The expression of EGR3, ISG15, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (p-NFκB), and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) of the tumor tissues was determined by the IHC assay. After dewaxing and rehydration, longitudinal sections of 5 μm thickness were stained with hematoxylin for 5 min, followed by cytoplasmic staining with eosin. The sections were rinsed in distilled water for 30 s and then dehydrated using a graded alcohol series. Afterward, the sections were cleared with xylene and examined and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (BX53, Olympus). For immunohistochemistry, the sections were blocked with 3% BSA and incubated overnight with specific primary antibodies. Following this, they were treated with a secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min. Staining was visualized using DAB (G1212, Servicebio), and counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Finally, three randomly selected fields were photographed under the microscope. The primary antibodies used in this experiment are listed in Table1.

The TUNEL assay was performed on isolated xenograft tumors to detect apoptosis. Briefly, the tumors were paraffin-embedded and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. The tumor sections were stained using the TUNEL FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (A111-01, Vazyme, China) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Following this, the nuclei were stained with DAPI solution (C1002, Beyotime, China). The stained sections were then analyzed and photographed with a fluorescence microscope (BX53, Olympus, Japan).

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18 (SPSS, Inc.) and GraphPad software 6.0. Measurement data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was employed for group comparisons, while one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was utilized for comparisons among multiple groups. Ap-value of less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.

To investigate the function of hypoxic TAMs in the progression of OS, we selected MG-63, HOS, and K2M7 cell lines for further study. These cell lines are widely used in OS research, with stable genetic profiles, and have been employed in studies related to metastasis, drug response, hypoxia, and hypoxia-driven signaling [20,21]. Human THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into both M1 and M2 subtypes under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Primary mouse BMDMs were also polarized into the M2 subtype under the same conditions to assess their impact on the malignant phenotypes of OS cells. WB analysis was performed to assess HIF1A expression in K7M2 cells after co-culture with supernatants from primary mouse BMDMs polarized to the M2 phenotype under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The results showed that HIF1A expression was significantly upregulated in K7M2 cells co-cultured with supernatants from hypoxic M2 macrophages, validating the induction of hypoxia (Fig.1A). Subsequently, we demonstrated that hypoxic M2 macrophage supernatants significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation in OS cells. In contrast, supernatants from M1 macrophages had no significant effect on cell migration and invasion (Fig.1B–E). The detection of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway-related proteins indicated that hypoxic M2 macrophages enhanced the activity of the EMT pathway (Fig.1F). Furthermore, hypoxic M2 macrophages activated multiple cancer-related signaling pathways, including the STAT3, PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK, and NFκB signaling pathways (Fig.1G). These findings suggested that hypoxic M2 macrophages play a significant role in the promotion of malignant phenotypes in OS cells.

To investigate the effect of hypoxia on M2 macrophage secretory profile, an antibody array was utilized to identify differentially expressed proteins in the supernatant of M2 macrophages with hypoxic treatment for 24 h. The results demonstrated there were eight significantly differentially expressed proteins, including epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78/CXCL5), growth-regulated oncogene (GRO/CXCL1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), OPN (Fig.2A). Among these, OPN showed the most notable increase and was selected for further functional investigation based on its previously reported involvement in OS progression and immune modulation [22,23]. To corroborate the identification outcome derived from the antibody array, we further examined the levels of OPN in the supernatant and intracellular environment of hypoxic M2 macrophages. The results revealed an upregulation of OPN in both locations (Fig.2B,C). Consistently, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that hypoxic treatment enhanced the fluorescence intensity of OPN in M2 macrophages (Fig.2D).

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the function of OPN within M2 macrophages in the progression of OS, OPN was knocked down in THP-1 cells (Fig.3A). The shRNA with the most effective knockdown, sh-OPN-1, was selected for utilization in the subsequent experiments. The results demonstrated that hypoxic M2 macrophages significantly facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, whereas knockdown of OPN within M2 macrophages attenuated these effects (Fig.3B–D). This indicated that the tumor-promoting effects of hypoxia-treated M2 macrophages were achieved through OPN-dependent mechanisms, at least in part.

To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting effects of hypoxic M2 macrophages, HOS cells were treated with the supernatant from THP-1-derived M2 macrophages cultured under hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) for 24 h, followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results revealed a total of 124 upregulated genes and 136 downregulated genes among the DEGs (Fig.4A,B). A heatmap was utilized to visualize the significant DEGs (Fig.4C). Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were intimately involved in positive regulation of peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, oxygen carrier activity, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (Fig.4D). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were predominantly enriched in pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer (Fig.4E).

After filtering the DEGs based on fold change and p-value, five genes were identified as worthy of further investigation: Enolase 4 (ENO4), Glutamate Receptor, Ionotropic, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate 3B (GRIN3B), Wnt Family Member 11 (WNT11), Distal-Less Homeobox 5 (DLX5), and Early Growth Response 3 (EGR3). The analysis of their expression levels revealed that EGR3 exhibited the most significant differential expression in HOS cells treated with the supernatant from hypoxic M2 macrophages, with a tendency towards downregulation (Fig.5A). Therefore, EGR3 was selected for further investigation. The results demonstrated that overexpression of EGR3 markedly suppressed the migratory capacity of OS cells (Fig.5B,C). Furthermore, overexpression of EGR3 resulted in a reduction in the migration of OS cells promoted by hypoxic M2 macrophages (Fig.5D). Importantly, the tumor-promoting effects of recombinant OPN were reversed by overexpression of EGR3 (Fig.5E). These findings suggested that OPN in hypoxic M2 macrophages promoted malignant phenotypes by inhibiting the expression of EGR3 in OS cells.

As OPN was previously found to be upregulated in hypoxia-treated M2 macrophages, we further investigated whether recombinant OPN exerts a similar regulatory effect on immune-related gene expression in OS cells. MG-63 cells were transfected with either an EGR3 overexpression plasmid or a control vector, followed by treatment with OPN. Total RNA was extracted, and high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify DEGs. The results demonstrated that, in comparison between the control group and the OPN treatment group, there were 298 upregulated genes and 612 downregulated genes. In the comparison between the OPN treatment group and the EGR3-transfected plus OPN treatment group, there were 304 upregulated genes and 143 downregulated genes (Fig.6A,B). The heatmaps illustrated the gene expression data (Fig.6C). Subsequently, GO enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were predominantly enriched in various responses to viruses, immune system processes, innate immune response, protein binding, and interferon signaling pathways (Fig.6D). KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that the DEGs identified from both comparisons were closely associated with multiple signaling pathways, including the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, NFκB signaling pathway, and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway (Fig.6E).

Among the DEGs, four genes were identified as warranting further investigation: Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 2 (BATF2), Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Tripartite Motif Containing 5 (TRIM5), and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 7 (PTPN7). The assessment of the mRNA expression levels demonstrated that OPN treatment significantly downregulated the expression of these proteins (BATF2, ISG15, and TRIM5) in MG-63 cells. Overexpression of EGR3 reversed the inhibitory effects of OPN on these proteins (Fig.7A). Notably, ISG15 is known to be involved in the RIG-I-like (Retinoic acid-inducible Gene I-like) receptor signaling pathway [24]. Given the results from 6E, the DEGs were enriched in the RIG-I signaling pathway. These results suggested that OPN in M2 macrophages and EGR3 in OS cells exerted their influence on the malignant phenotype of OS cells, potentially through the regulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway via ISG15. These results suggested that OPN suppresses ISG15 and associated immune-related genes, while EGR3 overexpression reverses these effects, potentially influencing the malignant phenotype of OS cells via the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway.

ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that modifies target proteins through ISGylation [24,25]. It has been reported that RIG-I, a key protein in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, is ISGylated by the ISG15 E3 ligase [24,26,27]. Additionally, RIG-I can enhance the stability of PD-L1 through post-translational modifications [28]. The results demonstrated that OPN treatment reduced the expression of ISG15 while upregulating the expression levels of RIG-I and PD-L1 (Fig.7B). Conversely, overexpression of EGR3 exerted the opposite effect on these proteins (Fig.7C). These findings suggested that OPN may modulate RIG-I-like receptor signaling in OS cells through coordinated changes in the expression of EGR3, ISG15, and RIG-I.

It has been reported that the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway plays a role in regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and immune evasion by activating downstream pathways such as NFκB, STAT3, and ERK/MAPK [29–31]. In our study, ISG15 overexpression in OS cells was associated with reduced RIG-I protein expression and decreased activation of its downstream signaling components, including STAT3, NFκB, PI3K, and ERK (Fig.7D). Furthermore, overexpression of ISG15 inhibited cell proliferation and migration in OS cells (Fig.7E,F). Importantly, OPN treatment led to reduced ISG15 levels and upregulation of RIG-I, along with enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3, NFκB, ERK, and PI3K. Conversely, the tumor-promoting effects of OPN were reversed by overexpression of EGR3 (Fig.7G).

To further investigate the impact of EGR3 on these pathways, WB analysis showed that EGR3 overexpression significantly upregulated ISG15 expression and concurrently inhibited downstream signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of STAT3, NFκB, ERK, and PI3K. Silencing ISG15 restored the activation of these pathways (Fig.7H). Transwell assays demonstrated that knockdown of ISG15 reversed the inhibitory effect of EGR3 overexpression on OS cell migration (F7g.7I). Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that EGR3 transcriptionally activates ISG15 expression by binding to its promoter (Fig.7J). Additionally, OPN treatment markedly increased the protein expression of DNMT1, a key maintenance DNA methyltransferase [32], in OS cells (Fig.7K), suggesting a potential epigenetic regulatory mechanism. ChIP assays further demonstrated that EGR3 overexpression enhanced DNMT1 binding to the EGR3 promoter, indicating that DNMT1 contributes to the transcriptional repression of EGR3 through promoter methylation (Fig.7L). Taken together, these findings suggested that OPN exerted a pro-cancer effect on OS cells by suppressing EGR3 and ISG15, thereby increasing RIG-I expression and activating downstream signaling pathways.

To validate the role and mechanism of OPN in vivo, the xenograft tumor models were constructed with MG-63 cells. Consistent with the results from cell experiments in vitro, OPN treatment promoted tumor growth in vivo, while the overexpression of EGR3 or ISG15 effectively reversed the pro-cancer effects of OPN (Fig.8A and8). The results of apoptosis assays on tumor samples demonstrated that OPN treatment inhibited tumor cell apoptosis in OS, whereas overexpression of EGR3 or ISG15 promoted apoptosis and attenuated the inhibitory effect of OPN (Fig.8C). IHC analysis of relevant indicators in tumor samples demonstrated that OPN treatment results in a decrease in the expression of EGR3 and ISG15, while significantly increasing the levels of p-STAT3, p-NFκB, and p-ERK. Conversely, overexpression of EGR3 or ISG15 has been observed to diminish the upregulation of these markers induced by OPN (Fig.8D). This is consistent with our cellular findings, in which OPN treatment was associated with enhanced activation of the STAT3, NFκB, and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, accompanied by downregulation of EGR3 and ISG15 in OS cells.

In summary, this study demonstrated that hypoxia-induced OPN in M2 macrophages contributes to OS progression by altering the expression of EGR3, ISG15, and RIG-I, thereby modulating RIG-I-like receptor signaling and activating multiple downstream tumor-related pathways.

Recently, OS has become well-known for highly aggressive bone tumors with an elevated tendency of metastasis [1]. The emerging evidence highlights the role of hypoxia or the immune microenvironment in OS progression, reflecting the complex interplay behind tumor aggressiveness and treatment difficulties [33,34]. Despite knowing the OS immune evasion and tumor hypoxia's poor prognosis link, current studies mainly focus on analyzing and predicting this relationship [35,36], and their underlying mechanisms are unclear. With the development of bioinformatics and HTS technology, many aberrantly expressed oncogenes have been identified and can serve as prognostic signatures for OS [37–39]. However, these single-characteristic-based prognostic signatures fail to adequately reflect OS's disease features, and reliable gene signatures combining hypoxia and immune status for OS remain unidentified. Here, our findings have provided compelling evidence that hypoxia stimulated the expression of OPN in M2 macrophage supernatants, which in turn inhibited the expression of EGR3 and promoted the malignant phenotype of OS through the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and immune evasion of PD-L1. Our findings highlight the contribution of the hypoxia-immune microenvironment to OS progression and offer new perspectives on its potential regulatory interactions.

Immune evasion plays a critical role in OS progression by enabling tumor cells to escape immune surveillance.. Studies indicate that OS cells can upregulate CD47 to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis and express PD-L1 to suppress T cell activity via PD-1 interaction [33,40]. Additionally, TME remodeling and impaired antigen presentation further contribute to immune evasion in OS [41,42]. Tumor hypoxia is another important factor in OS progression, promoting angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy by activating various signaling pathways. For instance, hypoxia has been shown to upregulate vascular endothelial frowth factor (VEGF) expression via stabilization of HIF-1α, thereby facilitating angiogenesis and tumor progression in OS cells [43]. In addition, hypoxia-mediated downregulation of spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 1 (SKA1) has been associated with increased chemoresistance in OS [44]. These findings underscore that immune response or tumor hypoxia is important for OS cell growth and metastasis. In this study, we were surprised to find that hypoxic-treated M2 macrophage supernatant promoted the malignant phenotype of OS cell lines, which was consistent with the first research to preliminarily establish a prognostic signature based on hypoxia and immune response in OS cells [16]. To validate hypoxia in our model, we confirmed HIF1A upregulation in OS cells treated with supernatants from hypoxia-exposed M2 macrophages. Unexpectedly, HIF1A was also detectable under normoxia. This may result from M2-derived cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β, VEGF) activating PI3K/AKT and NFκB pathways, which enhance HIF1A transcription and translation. Notably, NFκB can bind the HIF1A promoter and upregulate its transcription even in normoxia [45,46]. In addition, oxygen consumption in dense co-cultures may create localized hypoxia that contributes to this effect [47]. More importantly, this supernatant promoted the expression of EMT-related proteins and the phosphorylation of STAT3, P13K, AKT, ERK, and NFκB in OS cells, alterations of which are vital for the malignant progression of cancers [48]. We observed that, under hypoxic conditions, macrophages differentiated into the M2 type. Antibody arrays were subsequently used to screen and validate hypoxia-induced differential proteins within macrophages. Among these, the upregulation of OPN attracted our great research interest. OPN, initially identified in OS cells [49], is a highly glycosylated and phosphorylated protein widely distributed in tissues, cells, and body fluids. It plays crucial roles in bone metabolism, immune regulation, tumor biology, cardiovascular health, neurobiology, and gastrointestinal protection [50]. Recent studies highlight the context-dependent role of OPN in OS, which may vary due to differences in OPN source, cellular context, hypoxic conditions, or tumor stage. For instance, hypoxia-induced OPN expression occurs via αvβ3 integrin–mediated GLUT1/3 upregulation, activating the FAK pathway [51]. IRF8 downregulation increases OPN levels, impairing T-cell activation and facilitating immune escape [52]. Conversely, some studies suggest that OPN downregulation inhibits mesenchymal stem cell or osteoblast maturation, potentially leading to OS [53]. In our study, we specifically focused on OPN derived from hypoxia-induced M2 macrophages, which was associated with reduced expression of EGR3 and ISG15 and increased RIG-I levels in OS cells, along with activation of downstream signaling pathways. This context-dependent regulatory pattern may help explain discrepancies observed in previous studies.

The hypoxia-immune-related gene signature has already been associated with the overall survival in multiple types of tumors, such as bladder cancer [54], hepatocellular carcinoma [55], and triple-negative breast cancer [56]. These studies have demonstrated that the hypoxia-immune-based genes possess high prognostic potential and clinical guidance values. Notably, our study has first identified and validated the significant upregulation of OPN in hypoxic M2 macrophage supernatants, and silencing OPN markedly reversed the stimulatory effect of these macrophages on the malignant phenotypes of OS, suggesting its pivotal role in mediating the pro-tumorigenic actions of hypoxic M2 macrophages for OS. Using HTS, we conducted an analysis of the DEGs and their enrichment in HOS cells exposed to supernatants from hypoxic M2 macrophages, uncovering a significant downregulation of EGR3-a transcription factor, pivotal in regulating gene expression during cellular differentiation, inflammatory responses, and cell migration [57]. EGR3 exhibits tumor-suppressive functions in various cancers. In breast cancer, EGR3 triggered apoptosis by directly binding to the promoter of the anti-apoptotic factor MCL1 gene, facilitating its transcription [58]. In prostate cancer, EGR3 regulated the expression of approximately 330 genes, with 35% involved in immune responses and inflammatory processes, and 15% intersecting with the NFκB signaling pathway, and promoted prostate cancer progression by upregulating IL6 and IL8, two interleukins highly relevant to prostate cancer [59]. Additionally, EGR3 regulated gene expression, transcriptionally activating zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible beta (GADD45B), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in prostate cancer, contributing to its antitumor effects [60]. Here, we confirmed EGR3's inhibitory effect on OS migration. Surprisingly, EGR3 overexpression reversed the promotion effect of hypoxic M2 macrophage supernatant or OPN treatment on OS migration. Another in-depth analysis of the DEGs and their enrichment pathways uncovered the important role of OPN and EGR3 in OS immune responses. This revelation stemmed from our observations that the DEGs were predominantly enriched in various viral responses, immune system processes, and signaling pathways such as Toll-like receptor, NFκB, and RIG-I-like receptor. Furthermore, we observed that ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein involved in antiviral immune responses [61], was downregulated following OPN treatment, and its overexpression significantly inhibited OS cell proliferation and migration. EGR3 overexpression reversed the pro-tumorigenic effects of OPN in vitro and in vivo, potentially through coordinated regulation of ISG15 and RIG-I. RIG-I plays a crucial role in antiviral defense and immune regulation [62]. Notably, ISG15 is typically induced downstream of RIG-I activation. In this study, we observed an alternative relationship wherein OPN suppresses EGR3 and ISG15, leading to increased RIG-I protein levels. This may reflect reduced ISGylation-dependent degradation of RIG-I rather than classical activation [63,64]. Given the immune regulatory role of RIG-I and the associated PD-L1 changes, our findings our findings raise the possibility that restoring EGR3 and ISG15 expression may influence RIG-I-mediated immune responses in OS, which warrants further investigation.

We acknowledge several limitations in this study. First, the ectopic overexpression of EGR3 and ISG15 using a CMV promoter may not reflect physiological levels, and supraphysiological expression could have influenced some outcomes. Inducible systems or endogenous modulation strategies (e.g., CRISPRa, hypoxia mimetics) should be considered in future studies. Second, although xenograft models were used, the tumor immune microenvironment was not assessed, limiting our understanding of the ISG15/RIG-I axis in an immune context. Immunocompetent or humanized models will be needed to evaluate immune infiltration and checkpoint activity. Third, while our data suggest a correlation between OPN stimulation, ISG15 suppression, and RIG-I upregulation, direct mechanistic links remain unconfirmed. The increase in RIG-I may reflect reduced ISGylation-dependent degradation rather than classical activation, and further validation is required. Fourth, among the upregulated cytokines, only OPN was functionally characterized; other candidates merit investigation. Lastly, the therapeutic relevance of modulating OPN and its downstream regulatory interactions involving EGR3, ISG15, and RIG-I should be further evaluated in orthotopic or patient-derived models to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

This study proposed innovatively that hypoxic M2 macrophages, through OPN-dependent mechanisms, played a pivotal role in accelerating the progression of OS by inhibiting the expression of EGR3 and ISG5. This finding enhanced our understanding of OS mechanisms and offered potential therapeutic targets.
