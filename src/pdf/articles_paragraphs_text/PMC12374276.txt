Functional ankle instability (FAI) is a common chronic disease after ankle sprains, and exercise intervention can improve symptoms of instability. This research aims to assess the effect of two new ankle balance device training programs on the ankle function and postural control ability in individuals with functional ankle instability.

A total of sixty-eight participants with FAI were randomly assigned to three groups: the spherical ankle balance device (SABD) group, the ensiform ankle balance device (EABD) group and the control group. Participants in all three groups engaged in an 8-week exercise intervention, conducting 4 times per week, each lasting 30 min. Variables were assessed before and after the intervention immediately, including the CAIT score, peroneal muscle reaction time, joint position sense, ankle inversion and eversion torques, and postural control ability. A paired t-test was utilized to compare results within each group, while one-way ANOVA was applied for comparisons between groups. Stepwise regression analysis was performed using the changes in CAIT score post-training as the dependent variable, with changes in peroneal muscle reaction time, position sense, postural control ability, and ankle torque as independent variables to establish a regression equation. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences.

After eight weeks of intervention, the SABD and EABD groups exhibited significant reductions in peroneal muscle reaction time (P< 0.05) and increases in ankle eversion torque (P< 0.05) compared to the control group. The EABD group demonstrated superior outcomes in ankle inversion and eversion torque and postural control compared to SABD groups (P< 0.05).

Training with new ankle balance devices significantly enhanced postural control and ankle function in patients with FAI, especially for ensiform ankle balance device.

Current Controlled Trials ChiCTR2500107096, 20,250,804 (Retrospectively registered).

Functional ankle instability (FAI), characterized by recurrent ankle sprains and subjective instability due to impaired neuromuscular control and proprioception, is a prevalent condition affecting approximately 40% of individuals following an initial lateral ankle sprain [1–3]. Epidemiological studies highlight that up to 20% of acute ankle sprain cases progress to chronic FAI, leading to persistent deficits in postural stability, balance, and gait control [4,5]. These deficits not only increase the risk of secondary injuries but also impair daily functional activities and athletic performance, imposing significant socioeconomic burdens due to prolonged rehabilitation and reduced quality of life [6,7]. Systematic reviews further emphasize that FAI is associated with sensorimotor dysfunction, including delayed peroneal muscle reaction time and altered foot pressure distribution during dynamic tasks, which exacerbate instability and fall risks [8].

Exercise therapy is an important method to promote the recovery of neuromuscular function in FAI patients [9]. Up to now, the most common clinical rehabilitation treatment for FAI patients is single function therapy in a stable environment, which is not conducive to the comprehensive improvement of the dysfunction, especially the neuromuscular control defects [10]. Studies have shown that strength, balance, and range-of-motion training alone or in combination can significantly improve self-reported ankle function in FAI patients [11], but not for functional activity which is defined as dynamic, closed kinetic chain activity other than quiet standing [12].

Current balance training methods, such as balance boards and balance balls, although effective to some extent, are not capable of adapting to complex movement environments with ease, and large-scale balance training equipment, such as the Biodex system, has the drawbacks of inconvenient use, high cost, and limited accessibility. To better improve ankle function, wearable ankle instability devices have been developed to address the limitations of traditional unstable plane training. These devices, such as the Myolux Athletik and Myolux II, are designed to mimic the natural motion of the ankle joint during functional activities, facilitating feed-forward motor control and increasing muscle activation, particularly in key muscles like the peroneus longus [13,14]. Building on these principles, the two novel ankle balance devices used in this study were designed to be lighter and more cost-effective, making them more comfortable for long-term use and reducing the financial burden on patients and healthcare providers. However, whether they can comprehensively improve ankle joint function and postural control remains to be determined.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of two distinct ankle balance devices and conventional functional training in FAI patients. We hypothesized that the ensiform ankle balance device training would be superior to the spherical ankle balance device training and conventional functional training. This study aims to provide more effective training methods and a theoretical foundation for FAI rehabilitation.

This study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of two novel ankle balance devices (ensiform and spherical) with conventional functional training in patients with FAI.

Sample size was calculated using G-power software (Ver.3.1.9.7) based on a previous study [15], with a moderate effect size of 0.5, level of 0.05, and 1-β = 0.85, requiring a minimum of 18 participants per group. Participants were thoroughly informed of the study protocol and provided their written informed consent to participate in the study.

The use of human participants for this study was approved by the internal review board of Shandong First Medical University (Batch No.: R202107080167) and was conducted in strict accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was sponsored by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant numbers: 2024A515010442).

Ultimately, 68 participants completed the study. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: the ensiform ankle balance device (EABD) group, the spherical ankle balance device (SABD) group, and the control group. Randomization was performed using the random number table method in SPSS software. The personnel generating the random sequence were unaware of the intervention plan, and the personnel assigning participants to groups were also unaware of the recruitment and intervention plans.

Inclusion criteria were: (1) at least one acute ankle sprain within the past 3 months to 1 year; (2) multiple episodes of the feeling of ankle instability; (3) at least two episodes of ankle instability or fear of sprain during exercise in the past 6 months; (4) Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) score < 24; (5) negative talus tilt and anterior drawer tests.

Exclusion criteria included: (1) history of lower extremity surgery, fracture, or musculoskeletal injury caused by other diseases; (2) participation in systematic exercise training other than this experiment; (3) any diagnosed clinical diseases affecting the study, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease.

All participants were instructed to be familiar with the testing tasks and experiment procedures before the test. Each participant performed baseline test after the initial screening test. The assessment was conducted by two individuals who were unaware of the patient grouping and did not participate in the intervention process at all. The intervention group immediately underwent ankle balance device training for 30 min each time, 4 times a week, for 8 weeks. The control group participated in conventional functional training, 4 times a week for 8 weeks, 30 min each time. All participants participated in a post-intervention test at the end of the 8th week (Fig.1).

The spherical ankle balance device consists of a 2 cm-thick wooden base, two 5 cm-diameter wooden hemispheres, and an elastic fixed belt. These hemispheres correspond to the first metatarsal head and the calcaneal tubercle, forming a rotation axis that aligns with the functional axis of ankle inversion motion and creates a 16-degree angle with the foot’s longitudinal axis. This design allows the device to produce an ankle inversion angle of 0 to 30 degrees, forcing users to actively contract their fibularis muscle to maintain neutrality (Fig.2). The ensiform ankle balance device features a semi-curved wooden structure positioned at the midpoint of the line connecting the calcaneal tubercle and the first metatarsal head (Fig.3).

In this study, to prevent muscle reaction time measurements from being affected by muscle fatigue, muscle reaction time was measured first. The order of measurement for the remaining indicators was randomized to reduce order effects and potential biases. Participants were randomly assigned to different measurement sequences using a computer-generated random number table.

The Chinese version of CAIT scale was used before and after intervention to evaluate ankle joint stability in patients with FAI. It is a tool used to identify and assess ankle dysfunction and consists of nine sections with a total score of 30.

Muscle reaction time around the ankle was measured before and after the intervention using a 16-channel surface electromyography testing system (1000 Hz; desktop DTS, NORAXON, USA). The medial and lateral heads of gastrocnemius muscle, fibularis longus muscle and tibialis anterior muscle of the included side were selected as test muscles. The skin surfaces of the tested muscles were shaved, abraded, and alcohol swabbed. Bipolar Ag-AgCl surface electrodes and connected wireless sensors were longitudinally placed on muscle belly at standard position, and the distance between two electrodes was 3 cm. The pasting position is shown in Fig.4[16]. The subjects took off their shoes and stood on the supporting plate of Trap-door test device with both feet. Their feet were the same width as their shoulders, looking ahead, relaxed all over the body, and the center of mass was placed in the middle of their legs. The EMG waveform was recorded after the subjects were naturally stabilized. At a randomly chosen time point within the 10- to 15-second interval, the plate was inverted without any prior awareness of the subjects, as shown in Fig.5. Simultaneously, Noraxon MR3.6 software marked the starting time of the plate inversion on the EMG waveform.

Raw EMG signals were full-wave rectified, band-pass filtered with a high-pass filter at 500 Hz and low-pass filter at 20 Hz at the fourth-order with no phase-shift and were then represented to the Root Mean Square. The muscle activation following the sudden inversion of the steel plate was defined as the onset of electromyographic (EMG) activity exceeding five standard deviations above the baseline activity of the tested muscle [17]. The baseline activity of the muscle was determined by calculating the EMG amplitude during quiet standing in the 0- to 10-second interval. The muscle reaction time around ankle were defined as the time interval between the initiation of the plate inversion and the onset of EMG activity [18].

Ankle eversion and inversion muscle strength were assessed using the Biodex Systems IV in both concentric and eccentric modes at an angular velocity of 60°/s, following the protocol outlined in the device manual. Subjects warmed up for 10 min to activate the relevant muscles, followed by three practice trials on the apparatus. Participants were seated on a testing chair with a backrest angle of 70°, secured with straps for the limbs, and their feet were fixed to the pedal with the shank parallel to the ground, the knee joint flexed at 90°, and the subtalar joint in a neutral position. The dynamometer was aligned on the same axis of rotation as the subtalar joint. All participants wore the same brand of athletic shoes for the test to minimize force loss transmitted to the isokinetic dynamometer. Visual encouragement feedback curves were displayed on the computer screen to ensure participants exerted their maximum effort. All muscle-strength values were evaluated as isokinetic peak torque and were normalized to body weight (kg). Participants rested for 30- to 60-seconds between two trials to allow muscle recovery.

The Biodex Systems IV was employed to assess active position perception of ankle inversion at a 30° angle, with the actuator moving at a velocity of 1° per second, which is optimal for accurate perception testing. To ensure the measurements were not confounded by external stimuli, subjects were fitted with an eye mask to obscure vision and earplugs to mitigate auditory distractions. Subjects began with their feet in a neutral position and actively positioned them to the test location, signaling the end by pressing a stop button. The mean absolute error (AE), calculated as the absolute difference between the subject-selected position and the target test position angle.

Y- balance test is a simple version of the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), which is a measure of dynamic balance. The 3 SEBT directions of anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial were measured. Before the test, participants were allowed to practice in each direction. Participants performed the test of postural control ability with barefoot. Keeping hands crossed in front of chest, the included limb stood on the center of test plane, the non-stance limb reached as far as possible along the reach direction and maintained 3 s at the end and then returned to a bilateral stance. The distance was measured from the center of the plate to the farthest reach point, during the test, if the participant’s hands leave the chest, the supporting leg’s heel lifts off the ground, or the participant is unable to return to the starting point, the trial is considered a failure. In the event of failure, the participant must restart the trial. The order of directions was randomized by drawing lots.

An average of 3 successful trials was used for analysis. The SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used to analyze and process the experimental data. Shapiro-wilk and Levene tests were used to test the normal distribution and dispersion of variance of the data. Paired sample t-test was used for intra group comparison, one-way ANOVA analysis was used for inter group comparison. With the change in CAIT scores of the EABD group as the independent variable, and the changes in muscle reaction time, joint position sense, dynamic postural control ability, and ankle joint torque of the EABD group as the dependent variables, stepwise regression analysis was performed to establish a predictive regression equation. The significance level was set at 0.05, with results below this threshold considered to indicate statistically significant differences. Additionally, the changes in the CAIT score and the Y Balance Test distance will be compared with the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) to determine whether the results are clinically meaningful.

No differences in participant characteristics were observed at baseline (Table2). Details for all results are summarized in Table3.

Compared with pre-intervention scores, the CAIT scores of all three groups significantly improved after the intervention (P< 0.05), and all groups with changes exceeding the MCID: 6.44 for the EABD group, 5.01 for the SABD group, and 3.96 for the control group. Post-intervention, the CAIT scores of both the EABD and SABD groups were significantly higher than those of the control group (P< 0.05). Additionally, the EABD group exhibited significantly higher CAIT scores than the SABD group (P< 0.05).

Compared with pre-intervention values, the reaction time of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, fibularis longus muscle, and tibialis anterior muscle significantly decreased in both the EABD and SABD groups after the intervention (P< 0.05). Post-intervention, these muscles in the EABD and SABD groups also exhibited significantly shorter reaction time compared with the control group (P< 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between the EABD and SABD groups.

Compared with pre-intervention values, the peak ankle eversion and inversion torque significantly increased in both the EABD and SABD groups (P< 0.05). Post-intervention, the eversion torque in the EABD group was significantly higher than that in the SABD (P< 0.05) and control groups (P< 0.05).

Regarding ankle joint position sense, only one significant difference was observed: the SABD group exhibited a significant decrease in AE after the intervention compared with pre-intervention values (P< 0.05).

Compared with pre-intervention values, the maximum reach distances in the posteromedial and posterolateral directions significantly increased in all three groups after the intervention (P< 0.05). Additionally, the maximum anterior reach distance significantly increased in both the EABD and SABD groups (P< 0.05). In terms of percentage changes, all three groups exceeded the MCID in the anterior direction, with changes of 18% (EABD), 9.4% (SABD), and 7.0% (control group), respectively. Only the EABD group exceeded the MCID in the posterolateral direction, with a change of 13.3%. Post-intervention, the EABD group exhibited significantly greater maximum reach distances in the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions compared with the control and SABD groups (P< 0.05).

Among them, x1represents a decrease in the reaction time of the fibularis longus muscle, and x2represents an increase in ankle eversion torque.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of two types of new ankle balance devices training on ankle function and postural control ability. The results showed that compared with control group and the SABD group, the CAI score, ankle eversion torque and postural control ability of FAI patients were significantly increased in the EABD group; Compared with control group, the muscle reaction time around the ankle in the EABD and SABD groups was significantly shortened, but there was no difference between the EABD and SABD groups.

The International Ankle Federation recommends that patients with a CAIT score of 24 or lower considered for inclusion as subjects [19], with lower CAIT scores indicating more ankle instability, serious pain and low ankle control ability. According to relevant studies, the MCID value for the CAIT score is 3 [20]. After the intervention, the CAIT scores of all three groups showed significant improvement, with changes exceeding the MCID value of 3 points. Specifically, the EABD group’s CAIT score improvement was the most substantial, indicating a clinically meaningful enhancement in ankle function. This improvement is likely due to the targeted training provided by the EABD device, which simulates ankle instability and forces subjects to make rapid adjustments, thereby strengthening neuromuscular control. In addition, the results from this study indicates that the CAIT score is linked to the reaction time of the peroneus longus and the strength of the ankle eversion, with a higher score signifying shorter reaction time and more robust eversion. Future rehabilitation programs for ankle instability should incorporate eversion muscle strength training and muscle responsiveness training to mitigate the risk of ankle sprains.

Clark et al. [6] found that in FAI patients, the reaction time of the tibialis anterior and fibularis longus muscles significantly shorted after a 4-week plate shaking intervention, with a notable improvement in ankle self-stabilization. Our study’s outcomes align with Clark et al. where both the EABD and SABD groups showed significant shorted in muscle reaction time when compared to the control group, which did not show any improvement in muscle reaction time for any muscle. These findings partially align with our hypothesis that training with the new balance device is superior to conventional functional training methods. Participants in conventional functional training may mechanically perform ankle exercises that do not necessitate substantial neural system involvement, which could result in minimal enhancement of their instantaneous reaction capabilities. However, participants in new balance device groups were instructed to quickly restore a neutral ankle position after any imbalance and to repeatedly practice this recovery process. This approach might enable participants to subconsciously restore the ankle to a neutral position during future instability, thereby shorted muscle reaction time. However, there was no significant difference in muscle reaction time improvement between EABD group and SABD group, which is believed to be due to the similar training mechanisms employed. Both types of devices had the same height from the ground for their base plates, meaning the intensity of the perturbations generated was identical. Furthermore, the responses made by the participants to the perturbations were also the same.

Chang et al. [21] showed that strength significantly increased in ankle inversion muscles after 6-week, training sessions in patients with CAI. The same conclusion was reached from the experimental study of Wang et al. [22]. This is consistent with our findings that after the 8-week intervention, both balance device groups demonstrated significant improvements in eversion and inversion muscle strength. Although no statistical differences were found between SABD group and the control group post-intervention, the EABD group showed some significant differences compared to both SABD group and the control group. This is partially consistent with our hypothesis that the EABD group outperforms both the SABD group and the control group. The reason why the SABD group did not outperform the control group may be due to the lower disturbance intensity generated by the ensiform ankle balance device, which correspondingly weakened the strengthening effect on muscle strength. Additionally, the training program of the control group also reinforces muscle strength, a larger perturbation strength may be required if differences between the two training protocols are to be observed. The increase in ankle muscle strength reduces the length change that muscles produce when facing external forces of the same size. This means that the stiffness of the ankle joint muscle increases, and the ability of the ankle joint muscle to resist abnormal deformation also increases. Muscles with higher stiffness may be more effective in resisting sudden joint displacement, thereby improving the stability of the ankle joint.

A large number of studies have shown that balance training can significantly improve the proprioception of lower limbs [23,24]. Eils et al. [11] showed that FAI patients who underwent 6 weeks of enhanced training using balance plates, and other devices had significant improvement in ankle position perception. And Jain et al. [25] showed that four weeks of balance training using Biodex Balance Stability System improved proprioception in FAI patients. However, our study did not find evidence of improved proprioception, which is inconsistent with our initial hypothesis. The lack of significant improvement compared to the control group may be attributed to the training protocol. Although the balance device used in this study was capable of stimulating proprioceptive receptors, the intensity of the training may not have been sufficient to elicit an adequate stimulus. Proprioceptive receptors play a role related to anatomical position, and the joint receptors are activated only when the joint is under high load bearing, the end of the range of motion and the high speed of dynamic motion [26,27]. The range of motion of balancing device training in this study are in the range of 0 ~ 30 °, may not be enough to activate the joint position of the receptor. Whether or not, after the intervention, there was an improvement in dynamic postural control ability across all three groups. The EABD group outperformed both the control and SABD groups. However, no significant differences were observed between the SABD group and the control group, which is inconsistent with our initial hypothesis. This discrepancy may be attributed to the spherical ankle balance device, which primarily perturbs the ankle joint in the eversion-inversion direction and offers limited therapeutic effects. In contrast, the ensiform ankle balance device challenges subjects to adapt to and adjust for perturbations in multiple directions around the ankle joint, enhancing multidirectional stability. For the Y-balance test, the MCID for anterior reach distance is 6%-8% [28], and for posterolateral reach distance, it is 10%-12% [29]. In terms of dynamic postural control, improvements in anterior reach distance exceeded the MCID (6%-8%) in all three groups, indicating clinically meaningful enhancements in this direction. For the posterolateral reach distance, only the EABD group’s improvement surpassed the MCID (10%-12%), further highlighting the superior effectiveness of the ensiform ankle balance device in multidirectional stability training.

This study also has some limitations. The subjects were mainly students from schools, so it cannot be ruled out that different ages, regions, and ethnicities may affect the experimental results, which may limit the external validity of this study. The physical activity levels of the subjects were not measured, which may have influenced the results by contributing to variations in baseline fitness levels and overall health status. Additionally, this study adopted a single-blind (assessor-blinded) research design. While this approach reduces bias in the assessment process, it does not eliminate potential biases that may arise from the subjects’ awareness of the intervention they received. Future studies should consider incorporating objective measures of physical activity and employing a double-blind design to further enhance the robustness of the findings.

Compared with traditional rehabilitation programs, training using balance devices shows better improvement in sensorimotor dysfunction for patients with FAI. The ensiform ankle balance device demonstrating superior therapeutic effects to the spherical ankle balance device. Training that integrates reaction time and eversion muscle strength may offer better therapeutic outcomes for patients with FAI.
