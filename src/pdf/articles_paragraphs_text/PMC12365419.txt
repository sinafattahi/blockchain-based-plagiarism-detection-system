Insulin is released by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory granules, while many receptors, ion channels, and transporters reach the plasma membrane by constitutive exocytosis of endosomal vesicles. Both processes rely on specific sets of solubleN-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins for membrane fusion. Here, we used live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence imaging to understand the role of vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), a SNARE reported to be involved in both types of exocytosis, in pancreatic β-cells. Both endogenous and overexpressed VAMP8 localized to Rab5-, Rab7-, and Rab11-positive endosomal vesicles, but not to insulin granules. Depolarization evoked slow exocytosis of VAMP8/Rab11-positive vesicles that was insensitive to tetanus neurotoxin cleavage and accelerated by somatostatin but not exendin-4. VAMP8-positive vesicles fused within seconds of their arrival at the plasma membrane, in contrast to insulin granules that remained docked for several minutes. Fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles released glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) and GLUT2 into the plasma membrane, and fusion of GLP-1R–positive vesicles, but not GLP-1R endocytosis, was suppressed by VAMP8 knockdown. Public data indicate a negative correlation between VAMP8 gene expression and secretory index in human donor islets, and we find that overexpression of full-length VAMP8, or soluble VAMP8 lacking its transmembrane domain, inhibited exocytosis of insulin granules. We conclude that VAMP8 associates with early, late, and recycling endosomes, supports exocytosis of recycling endosomes to control surface expression of physiologically important membrane proteins (GLP-1R and GLUT2), and can suppress insulin secretion. Finally, the data suggest that the previously described “newcomer” exocytosis reflects release from an endosomal compartment, rather than exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules.

Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8) localizes to endosomal vesicles and mediates their exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells.

VAMP8-dependent vesicle fusion delivers glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and GLUT2 to the plasma membrane.

VAMP8 overexpression inhibits insulin granule exocytosis.

“Newcomer” exocytosis likely involves endosomal compartments, not insulin granules.

Vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs or synaptobrevins) are vesicle-bound solubleN-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins that are essential for cellular membrane fusion (1), with various isoforms being involved in the different vesicle trafficking pathways (2). In pancreatic β-cells, VAMP2 (or synaptobrevin) mediates regulated exocytosis of insulin granules by forming a tight complex with its cognate SNARE proteins syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 (3). Like other SNAREs, VAMPs contain an evolutionarily conserved SNARE motif of 60–70 residues arranged in a heptad repeat that is C-terminally anchored to the vesicle membrane by a single transmembrane domain (TMD) (4). During membrane fusion, the SNARE domain of VAMP proteins forms a twisted parallel four-helical bundle with three SNARE domains of cognate SNARE proteins in the target membrane (5). Formation of this coiled-coil SNARE complex draws the opposing membranes toward each other and initiates membrane fusion (6). VAMPs contribute an arginine (R) to the central zero layer of the SNARE complex, while the three cognate SNARE domains contribute glutamines (Q) (7).

VAMP8 (or endobrevin) is a 12-kDa endosomal R-SNARE protein involved in endosomal sorting and recycling, and secretion (2,8). VAMP8 mediates fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes by interacting with syntaxin-17 and SNAP29 (9) and plays an essential role in zymogen secretion from pancreatic acinar cells where it forms a complex with syntaxin-4 and SNAP23 (10). Furthermore, VAMP8 has important roles in immunity, where it interacts with syntaxin-2 and SNAP23 during T-cell cytotoxicity (11). VAMP8 is involved in cytokine secretion from mast cells (12,13), lytic granule secretion from CD8+cells (14), platelet release (15), and recycling endosome fusion in cytotoxic lymphocytes (16). In pancreatic β-cells, VAMP8 colocalizes with the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (17), consistent with a role in the endosomal system. In addition, there is evidence for VAMP8 expression on insulin granules (18), and VAMP8-null mice exhibit defective insulin secretion that is thought to reflect the interaction of VAMP8 with syntaxin-3/4 to facilitate recruitment of rapidly fusing “newcomer” insulin granules to the plasma membrane (19).

The endosomal system consists of several vesicular compartments that exchange cargo by vesicle fusion and fission (2). Early endosomes serve as sorting stations that determine the fate of internalized cargo, either to be recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes or sorted via late endosomes for degradation in lysosomes. Many G-protein coupled receptors, including the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R), traffic through the endosomal system during agonist dependent desensitization (20). Isoforms of the Rab family of small G-proteins bind to specific stages of the endosomal pathway and contribute to their identity and specificity of fusion. The maturation from early to late endosomes requires coordinated activities of Rab5 and Rab7 (21,22), while Rab11 localizes to recycling endosomes that fuse with the plasma membrane to return proteins and lipids to the cell surface for reuse (23). In contrast, Rab3 isoforms play an essential role in the regulation of hormonal and neuronal exocytosis and are expressed on insulin granules and synaptic vesicles (24,25).

To understand the dual role of VAMP8 in both endosomal and insulin granule fusion of pancreatic β-cells, we used live-cell high-resolution imaging of vesicle behavior and associated proteins and cargo. We report that VAMP8 localizes to endosomal vesicles and is involved in the recycling of proteins important for β-cell function (GLP-1R and GLUT2) to the plasma membrane. In contrast, VAMP8 was not found on insulin granules, but expression of the protein suppressed insulin granule exocytosis. The data question a role of VAMP8 in insulin granule exocytosis and suggest that the previously described “newcomer” exocytosis reflects release from an endosomal compartment.

The rat insulinoma INS1 cell line, clone 832/13 (38), was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mmol/L glucose, 10% FBS, penicillin (100 µg/mL), sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L), HEPES (10 mmol/L),l-glutamine (2 mmol/L), and β-mercaptoethanol (50 µmol/L), at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine–coated coverslips and transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). For electroporation using a Neon System (Thermo Fisher Scientific), INS1 cells were resuspended in Buffer R and 100 nmol/L siRNA (QIAGEN, SI01997611 and SI01997618) or 5 µg plasmid DNA at 1,600 V, 3 × 10 ms. Imaging was performed 24–48 h after transfection.

Human islets were obtained from the Nordic Network for Clinical Islet Transplantation, Uppsala (26,27), under full ethical clearance (Uppsala Regional Ethics Board 2006/348) and with the donor families’ written informed consent. Isolated islets were cultured in CMRL1066 (5.5 mmol/L glucose, 10% FCS, 2 mmol/Ll-glutamine, and 100 units/mL penicillin) at 37°C. Prior to transfection, islets were dispersed into single cells and plated onto poly-l-lysine–coated coverslips. Cells were infected with adenovirus encoding neuropeptide Y (NPY)-td-Orange, transfected with VAMP8-EGFP, and imaged 24–36 h later. Human islet protein and transcript expression data were obtained from two publicly available databases, Islet Gene View (28) andHumanIslets.com(29).

For imaging experiments, cells were bathed in extracellular (EC) solution (in mmol/L: 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 3d-glucose, and 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). In most experiments, EC solution was supplemented with 10 mmol/L glucose, 200 µmol/L diazoxide (a K+-ATP–channel opener that prevents glucose-induced membrane depolarization), and 2 µmol/L forskolin to increase exocytosis. Forskolin was not added in experiments that tested the effects of exendin-4 or somatostatin inFig. 3CandD. GLP-1R uptake was recorded in EC containing 3 mmol/L glucose and no diazoxide or forskolin (Fig. 5O–Q). Exocytosis was stimulated by depolarizing the cells with local application of a high K+in EC (75 mmol/L KCl equimolarly replacing NaCl), through computer-controlled pressure ejection from a glass capillary.

Data are presented as mean values ± SEM forC,F,I,K,L,N,P, andQ. ***P< 0.001 and ns denotes not significant. Two-tailed paired Studentttests were used for bar plots inC,F, andI. The Mann-WhitneyUtest was used forK,L, andN. Two-tailed unpaired Studentttests were used forPandQ.

Plasmids NPY-EGFP and NPY-mCherry (30) were used as granule markers. The VAMP8 coding sequence (31) was inserted into pEGFP-N1, and several variants were created: VAMP8-ΔTMD-EGFP (deletion of amino acids 76–100), VAMP8-TMDstx1-EGFP (replacing VAMP8 TMD with syntaxin-1 TMD, amino acids 266–288), and VAMP8-MA-EGFP (replacing VAMP8 TMD with SNAP25 membrane anchoring domain, amino acids 85–120). Human EGFP-tagged Rab proteins were obtained by replacing the fluorescent protein in mCherry-tagged Rab5a, Rab7a, and Rab11a (14). Additional constructs included pEGFP-VAMP7 (1–220, a gift from T. Galli [addgene 42316]) (32), VAMP2-EGFP (a gift from W. Almers, Portland), and tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) light chain (a gift of W.S. Trimble, Toronto) (30). All recombinant DNA sequences were verified by commercial sequencing (Eurofins).

Insulin secretion was assessed in INS1 cells that were preincubated for 30 min in (EC containing 10 mmol/L glucose, 0.5% BSA, 200 µmol/L diazoxide), before being switched to either the same buffer (basal) or the same buffer with elevated K+(30 mmol/L, stimulated). After 5 min, the buffers were collected on ice, and secreted fractions or cell lysates quantified by ELISA (Mercodia AB no. 10-1250-10). Insulin secretion is given as fold-increase stimulated/basal after normalization for total insulin.

INS1 cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor (cat. no. 11836153 001, Roche), centrifuged, combined with Laemmli sample buffer, and denatured at 95°C. Proteins were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE (4–20% TGX Precast Protein Gel), transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with primary rabbit anti-VAMP8 (1:1,000; Synaptic Systems no. 104302) and secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated (1:20,000; Immun-Star Goat Anti-Rabbit [GAR]-HRP, Bio-Rad Laboratories no. 1705046). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Clarity Max Western ECL, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and quantified with a digital imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Data were normalized for total protein of each sample using stain-free technique.

Cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and blocked with 10% serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4°C (VAMP8: 1:300, Synaptic Systems, no. 104302; insulin: 1:100, Invitrogen, no. PA1-26938; Rab5: 1:100, Synaptic Systems, no. 108111; Rab7: 1:100, Abcam, no. ab50533; and Rab11: 1:100, Proteintech, no. 67902-1-IG). After PBS washing, cells were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000) for 30 min. Following final washes, cells were imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and confocal microscopy.

TIRF microscopy was performed on a custom-built setup based on an AxioObserver Z1 inverted microscope with a 100×/1.46 numerical aperture objective (Carl Zeiss). Excitation was from two diode-pumped solid-state lasers at 491 and 561 nm (Cobolt), passed through a cleanup quad-filter (zet405/488/561/640x, Chroma) and controlled with an acousto-optical tunable filter (AA Opto-Electronic). Emission light from the two color channels was split and projected onto electron multiplying charge–coupled device camera (Roper QuantEM 512SC) using a dual-view beam splitter (Optical Insights). For still images, the two color channels were acquired sequentially. Movies were recorded at 10 s−1(K+-stimulated exocytosis) or 1 s−1(prestimulatory time during residence time experiments). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM700, with a 63×/1.40 objective and using separate acquisition scans for the two color channels, 100 nm/pixel, and 12-bits. Color alignment was confirmed using beads, and images were linearly scaled for display using ImageJ.

Binding of fluorescently labeled proteins to the granule site was quantified as previously described (30). Briefly, granules were selected that appeared diffraction-limited and separated from their neighbors. At the granule location, the corresponding protein signal was quantified in a central circle (c), surrounding annulus (a), and background area (bg). We define ΔF=c−a, which estimates the fluorescence protein that is specifically localized to a granule. TheS=a−bgreports local protein expression that is not related to the presence of a granule. We then calculate ΔF/S, to adjust ΔFfor differences in expression level; ΔF/Sis proportional to the apparent affinity of the measured protein to the granule site. In addition, the fraction of vesicles that were colocalized with a protein of interest was estimated visually. For every vesicle identified in the ΔF/Sanalysis, a script written in MetaMorph presented an investigator with 21 × 21 pixel area of the protein of interest that was centered on the vesicle location and autoscaled. The investigator then made a yes/no decision whether punctate fluorescence was present in the center of the presented area. Granule density was determined using ImageJ. Exocytosis events were found manually as granule events with an obvious change in the fluorescence from the pre-exocytosis baseline, followed by sudden loss of the signal.

Experiments were conducted with at least three independent replicates. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, unless otherwise stated. Statistical tests were selected based on data distribution and experimental design. For two-group comparisons, two-tailed Studentttests (paired or unpaired, as appropriate) were used for normally distributed data, while the Mann-WhitneyUtest was applied for nonparametric data. Multiple group comparisons were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, followed by the Dunn's post hoc test for pairwise comparisons against the control group. APvalue of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

To determine the subcellular localization of VAMP8 in primary human β-cells and in insulin-secreting INS1 cells, EGFP-tagged VAMP8 (VAMP8-EGFP) was coexpressed with the secretory granule marker NPY-mCherry and imaged by TIRF microscopy (Fig. 1A). VAMP8-EGFP fluorescence was localized to vesicles that appeared diffraction limited in size, in addition to a weak hazy background due to minor expression on the plasma membrane. Visually, VAMP8-positive structures did not overlap with the granule marker in INS1 cells or human β-cells. This was confirmed by quantifying VAMP8 fluorescence that was specifically localized to granule locations (Fig. 1C, seeRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS). Briefly, the fluorescence in small circles centered on granule locations (c) was subtracted with a local background (a), yielding the excess VAMP8 fluorescence associated with a granule (c − a=ΔF). This value was then divided by the average background-corrected fluorescence near the granule (a − bg=S) to normalize for cell-to-cell variations in VAMP8-EGFP expression. According to this analysis, in which positive ΔF/Svalues indicate specific binding to the granule, VAMP8-EGFP was not expressed on docked granules in INS1 or human cells (Fig. 1C). Antibody staining for insulin in INS1 cells expressing VAMP8-mCherry did not show obvious colocalization, and quantitative analysis indicated approximately eightfold weaker expression of VAMP8 compared with NPY at insulin-positive vesicles (Fig. 1BandC). We then stimulated the cells with elevated K+(75 mmol/L, for 40 s) to evoke membrane depolarization, Ca2+influx, and exocytosis of insulin granules. As expected, insulin granule exocytosis was readily observed as loss of NPY-mCherry puncta. VAMP8-EGFP remained absent from the release site during these events, as indicated by the negative ΔF/Svalues (Fig. 1D–F). Conversely, during exocytosis of VAMP8-EGFP–positive vesicles, the insulin granule marker NPY-mCherry was not detected (Fig. 1G–I).

Similar coexpression experiments were performed using Rab isoforms as markers of specific endosomal compartments. INS1 cells expressed either NPY-mCherry (Fig. 2A) or VAMP8-mCherry (Fig. 2B), together with Rab5 (early), Rab7 (late), and Rab11 (recycling), or Rab3 (granules). Visually (Fig. 2AandB) and by quantitative analysis of hundreds of vesicles (as ΔF/Sand percentage positive) (Fig. 2C), Rab3 fluorescence colocalized well with the NPY granule marker. In contrast, VAMP8 was found preferentially on Rab5-, Rab7-, or Rab11-positive vesicles (Fig. 2BandC), but not granules (Fig. 2A–C). Taken together, the data indicate that VAMP8 is primarily expressed on an endosomal vesicles population that is distinct from insulin granules. Since VAMP8-positive vesicles were observed to fuse with the plasma membrane, we asked from which endosomal subcompartment this exocytosis originated. VAMP8-EGFP was coexpressed with mCherry-labeled Rab7 or Rab11 in INS1 cells. Vesicle fusion was stimulated with elevated K+and observed as sudden disappearance of the VAMP8 signal (Fig. 2D). The time course of the two protein signals was then quantified at individual exocytosis events of VAMP8-positive vesicles (Fig. 2D–G). In contrast to the stable NPY-mCherry signal that was observed prior to exocytosis (Fig. 1DandE), the VAMP8-EGFP signal increased in the seconds prior to exocytosis because many of the vesicles arrived within a few seconds of exocytosis (Fig. 1GandHandFig. 2E). mCherry-Rab7 could not be detected at sites of VAMP8 exocytosis (Fig. 2DandF). In contrast, the mCherry-Rab11 signal increased in parallel with the VAMP8 marker during (Fig. 2D,E, andG), indicating that the protein arrived at the membrane together with the vesicle. After exocytosis, Rab11 disappeared from the release site with a half-time of about 0.2 s (Fig. 2DandG). Colocalization was also assessed using antibody staining, which confirmed the largely endosomal localization of endogenous VAMP8 (Fig. 2H–J).

VAMP8-positive vesicles and NPY-positive insulin granules both underwent stimulated exocytosis during depolarization with elevated K+(75 mmol/L, for 40 s), although with a different time course (Fig. 3AandB, NPY-EGFP vs. VAMP8 [V8]-EGFP). Insulin granule exocytosis originated entirely from predocked granules (see example inFig. 1D) and followed a biphasic time course consistent with rapid release of readily releasable granules, followed by slower exocytosis of granules that attained release competence during the stimulation (Fig. 3A, dark blue curve). In contrast, VAMP8-labeled vesicles underwent exocytosis almost immediately after their arrival at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1G) and exhibited a slower monophasic time course of exocytosis (Fig. 3B, dark pink curve). The residence times of the two populations at the plasma membrane differed strongly, with VAMP8-positive vesicles fusing on average 4 s after their arrival at the plasma membrane, compared with several minutes for NPY labeled insulin granules (Fig. 3IandJ). Coexpression of the light chain of TeNT, a clostridial neurotoxin that inactivates VAMP isoforms 1–3 but not 8, almost completely blocked exocytosis of NPY-EGFP–positive granules (Fig. 3A). In contrast, TeNT had no effect on the fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles (Fig. 3B), indicating that the two vesicle populations rely on different VAMP isoforms for fusion. The two vesicle populations also reacted differently to activation of β-cell signaling pathways. Insulin granule exocytosis was more than doubled by the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4, and slightly inhibited by somatostatin (Fig. 3C). In contrast, fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles was accelerated by somatostatin but not by exendin-4 (Fig. 3D). Deletion of the syntaxin chaperone Munc18-1 in genome-edited INS1 cells prevented insulin granule exocytosis but had no effect on the fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles (Fig. 3EandF). Likewise, removal of extracellular Ca2+prevented insulin granule exocytosis but had little effect on the fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles (Fig. 3F).

We tested whether VAMP8 overexpression or knockdown affects insulin granule exocytosis. VAMP8-EGFP was overexpressed together with NPY-mCherry in INS1 cells or human β-cells, and K+-dependent insulin granule exocytosis was quantified by imaging (Fig. 4A–F). In both preparations, VAMP8-EGFP expression inhibited insulin granule exocytosis by 50–60% (Fig. 4A,B,D, andE). This inhibitory effect remained with VAMP8 mutants in which the TMD was removed (VAMP8-ΔTMD), replaced with the TMD of syntaxin-1 (VAMP8-TMDstx1), or replaced with the membrane anchoring domain of SNAP25 (VAMP8-MA) (Fig. 4G–I). In humans, expression of VAMP8 mRNA in islets varies among individuals, which allowed us to use publically available data to test for correlation between endogenous VAMP8 mRNA expression (RNA sequencing) and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Published mRNA sequencing data of islets from 182 human donors (28,33), available athttps://mae.crc.med.lu.se/IsletGeneView/, indicated negative correlation of VAMP8 transcript expression with GSIS (quantified as secretory index) in this population (R2= 0.12,P= 0.012,n= 182), indicating that high VAMP8 expression is inhibitory for insulin secretion. Moreover, data from the HumanIslets database (29), available athttps://www.humanislets.com/, show positive correlation between VAMP8 protein expression in human islets and donor HbA1c(coefficient 2.36, adjustedP= 0.009,n= 120 donors) or type 2 diabetes diagnosis (coefficient 0.30, adjustedP= 0.01,n= 134 donors), suggesting that inhibition of insulin secretion by VAMP8 may have a physiological role. Taken together, the data suggest that VAMP8 inhibits insulin granule exocytosis, perhaps by competing with VAMP2 for productive SNARE complex formation (34).

We tested the idea that VAMP8/Rab11-positive vesicles supply physiologically relevant proteins to the β-cell plasma membrane. The mCherry-labeled GLP-1R, GLUT2, or the autophagy-related membrane protein LC3 were coexpressed together with VAMP8-EGFP (Fig. 5A–I), and exocytosis was stimulated with elevated K+, seen as sudden disappearance of the VAMP8-EGFP–labeled vesicle. Expression of the proteins was then quantified on VAMP8-positive vesicles that underwent exocytosis (Fig. 5C,F, andI). As inFig.1H, the averaged VAMP8 vesicle fluorescence increased prior to exocytosis, reflecting the arrival of the vesicles at the plasma membrane. Notably, the ΔF/Ssignal of GLP-1R, and to a lesser degree GLUT2, increased in parallel during this time. During exocytosis, the signal fell to 0, indicating that both proteins were lost rapidly from the fusion site, presumably by being dispersed into the surrounding plasma membrane (Fig. 5A–F). In contrast, we could not detect loss of LC3 from the exocytosing vesicles (Fig. 5G–I). The data suggest that GLP-1R and GLUT2 are recycled to the plasma membrane by fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles. We therefore tested the idea that internalized GLP-1R after agonist exposure would traffic to VAMP8-positive vesicles. Indeed, when cells coexpressing labeled GLP-1R and VAMP8-EGFP were incubated in exendin-4, we observed a doubling of the GLP-1R signal at VAMP8 vesicles compared with control (Fig. 5K), while the frequency of VAMP8 vesicle fusions was unchanged (Fig. 5L). This finding was confirmed by antibody staining of cells expressing EGFP–GLP-1R after incubation in exendin-4 or control (Fig. 5MandN). Finally, we asked whether trafficking of GLP-1R depends on VAMP8 expression. VAMP8 knockdown of scrambled control cells (seeFig. 4J) were transfected with EGFP–GLP-1R and imaged in TIRF mode. Addition of exendin-4 to the bath caused clustering of the labeled GLP-1R at the membrane, followed by partial removal from the plasma membrane by endocytosis, with no difference in time course or amplitude (Fig. 5OandP). In contrast, exocytosis of vesicles labeled with EGFP–GLP-1R after >20 min exposure to exendin-4 was reduced by half in the VAMP8 knockdown cells compared with scramble control (Fig. 5Q). We conclude that recycling of GLP-1R to the plasma membrane relies on VAMP8, but not its agonist-dependent endocytosis.

We report here that VAMP8 has a role in the endosomal system in pancreatic β-cells and insulin-secreting INS1 cells, where we detected expression on early, late, and recycling endosomes. Recycling endosomes return endocytosed membrane proteins back to the cell surface as part of the endosomal recycling pathway, and we show here that single VAMP8/Rab11-positive endosomes fused with the plasma membrane, where they delivered GLP-1R (Fig. 5A–C) and GLUT2 (Fig. 5D–F). We show that this vesicle fusion depends on functional VAMP8 and that it recycles the GLP-1R back to the membrane after agonist-induced internalization. We also find that agonist stimulation leads to rapid GLP-1R clustering at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5JandO) that precedes endocytosis. The internalized protein then enters the endosomal pathway before eventually recycling back to the membrane. We find that VAMP8 localizes to late endosomes and recycling endosomes in β-cells, which is in line with its role in endosomal fusion processes, as reported in a variety of other cell types (2). It is plausible that recycling endosome fusion is driven by VAMP8 in β-cells, since it was unaffected by TeNT (which cleaves VAMP2, but not VAMP7 or VAMP8), and GLP-1R recycling was suppressed by VAMP8 knockdown. Possible cognate Q-SNAREs are syntaxin-7/8 and Vti1b (35), syntaxin-11 and SNAP23 (36), or with syntaxin-3 and SNAP23 (37).

We did not detect VAMP8 on insulin-containing secretory granules, and fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles differed in several aspects from that of insulin granules. The latter is surprising given that a proteomics approach found VAMP8 on isolated insulin granules (38) and reports that VAMP8 in complex with syntaxin-3, SNAP25, and Munc18b, supports exocytosis of insulin granules (19,39). VAMP8 in a complex with syntaxin-4 and SNAP23 also mediates exocytosis of secretory granules in exocrine (15) and mast cells (12,40), but not in acinar cells (37). We show that VAMP8 overexpression inhibits exocytosis of insulin granules, perhaps by competition of VAMP8 with VAMP2 for forming productive SNARE complexes for granule fusion. The physiological relevance of this effect is unclear, given that insulin granule exocytosis was unaffected by VAMP8 knockdown. Alternatively, intracellular pathways required for granule maturation and protein sorting may rely on VAMP8, for example, sorting of membrane proteins away from immature granules or, as we show here, recycling of the GLP-1R. The latter may reduce GLP-1R surface expression and thus the stimulating effect of GLP-1 or exendin on insulin granule exocytosis.

Fusion of VAMP8-positive endosomes with the plasma membrane was distinct from insulin granule exocytosis, in that it was insensitive to tetanus toxin, was only mildly Ca2+-dependent, and lacked the typical rapid phase of depolarization-induced insulin granule exocytosis. Single VAMP8 vesicles also had vastly shorter membrane residence times before undergoing exocytosis compared with insulin granules. The latter is reminiscent of the previously described “newcomer” exocytosis events in rodent (but not human) β-cells, where single granules undergo fusion immediately after their arrival at the plasma membrane, rather than remaining docked for minutes before becoming release-ready (33,41) (Fig. 1GandH). Newcomer exocytosis occurs preferentially during the slower 2nd phase of insulin secretion, and knockout of VAMP8 in mice decreased both the frequency of newcomer exocytosis and the amplitude of the 2nd phase of insulin secretion (19,38,39), suggesting that insulin granule exocytosis occurs from distinct pools of granules that use either VAMP2 for exocytosis of predocked granules or VAMP8 for newcomer exocytosis during the 2nd phase. Our findings suggest instead that fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles reflects release from an endosomal compartment, rather than exocytosis of newcomer insulin-containing secretory granules. Exocytosis of insulin granules in INS1 cells and human β-cells occurs from a docked pool in which individual granules remain at the plasma membrane for minutes (33,42) (Fig. 3I). Since labeling of granules with genetically encoded granule markers is quite efficient in these experiments, it is unlikely that newcomer granules escaped detection by not being fluorescent. Conversely, overexpressed granule markers may be partially mistargeted to endo- or lysosomes (43), which could explain trace amounts of NPY-mCherry detected in Rab5- and Rab7- positive (but not Rab11-positive) vesicles (Fig. 2C). Finally, VAMP8 promotes compound fusion of granules in acinar cells, whereby homotypic granule-granule fusion combines the content of several granules to be released through a single fusion pore (37). However, compound release is rare in β-cells and was not apparent in our experiments.
