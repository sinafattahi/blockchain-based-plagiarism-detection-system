With the introduction of technologies such as structural optimization and error correction, the performance of the MEMS quad-mass gyroscope (QMG) has significantly improved, while noise has gradually become a critical factor limiting its performance. For ease of analysis, this paper categorizes noise into two types: noise at the signal detection end and noise at the excitation end. Firstly, a closed-loop noise model for QMG is established, and the effects of these two types of noise on the dynamic and static performance of QMG are investigated. Additionally, the correlation between structural parameters and noise transmission is analyzed, and the dual impact of DC Bias Voltage optimization on improving QMG performance is explored. Based on the above analysis, a force-to-rebalance (FTR) dual-loop control method incorporating SID and normalized least mean squares (NLMS) is proposed and applied to the MEMS QMG, where SID and NLMS are respectively employed to mitigate the influence of detection-end and drive-end noise on the bias performance. Compared to the traditional method, the proposed approach reduces the bias instability (BI) of the MEMS QMG from 0.407°/h to 0.024°/h and the angular random walk (ARW) from 0.137°/√h to 0.006°/√h, achieving improvements of 16.96 times and 22.83 times, respectively. Furthermore, the system achieves a threshold of 0.0001°/s.

High-precision micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) resonant gyroscopes are critical components in precision guidance, unmanned vehicles, and collision detection due to their simple structure, compact size, light weight, and low power consumption1–3. Among these, fully symmetric MEMS resonant gyroscopes, a Type II variant, offer high mechanical gain and stability4,5. The QMG, as a derivative, features large inertial mass, significant vibration displacement, mode-matching capability, and advanced manufacturing maturity, making it a promising candidate for achieving high precision and performance, garnering widespread domestic and international attention.

In 2014, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) introduced a MEMS QMG with a BI of 0.2°/h and an ARW of 0.05°/√h in FTR mode6,7. By 2016, UCI enhanced the quality factor to 1.2 × 106, achieving a BI of 0.0733°/h and an ARW of 0.045°/√h after mode matching8. In 2017, UC Davis explored the nonlinearity–A–frelationship9. In 2021, UCI demonstrated that higher quality factors improve drive-mode frequency stability and noise performance in QMGs8,10. In 2023, Tsinghua University achieved a BI of 0.136°/h and an ARW of 0.033°/√h with a low-1/f-noise BGR11. In 2024, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory optimized QMG mode matching, achieving >2 µm vibration amplitude12. The Chinese Academy of Sciences mitigated bias drift via parameter and Sigma-Delta modulation13, and Nanjing University introduced phase auto-compensation, achieving a BI of 0.14°/h and an ARW of 0.06°/√h14.

With the introduction of technologies such as QMG structural improvements6,7,9,10, quadrature stiffness suppression6, mode matching8,12,15–17, and phase compensation14, the BI performance of QMG has been significantly improved. However, there still remains a considerable gap compared to theoretical performance, primarily due to the neglect of the impact of noise18on gyroscope performance. The influence of noise on the gyroscope can be manifested in the following ways: (1) Noise directly affects the gyroscope zreo-rate output (ZRO) signal, causing the measured results to deviate from the true values and reducing measurement accuracy; (2) noise impacts the gyroscope’s response to changes in angular velocity, degrading its dynamic performance; (3) noise accumulates during integration, leading to drift in the gyroscope’s output. Over long-term use, this drift can affect system stability, which is particularly critical in high-precision applications such as inertial navigation. Therefore, effectively reducing the impact of noise on gyroscope performance and closed-loop accuracy is critical for improving BI and ARW.

To mitigate the impact of noise on gyroscopes, in 2016, B. Sheng from Suzhou University19proposed a high-performance transverse axis capacitive electromechanical modulator vibrating gyroscope based on dual quantization technology. In 2018, R. Lv and colleagues from Harbin Institute of Technology20introduced a multi-stage noise shaping switched-capacitor analog-to-digital converter. In 2019, Daisuke Maeda and others21proposed a self-clocked architecture with a band-pass analog-to-digital converter. In 2020, M. Liu from Nanjing University of Science and Technology22developed a system phase analysis method for MEMS QMG, mitigating noise through third-order noise shaping. In 2023, H. Alaeiyan and colleagues from Tehran University of Science and Technology, Iran23proposed a hybrid noise elimination method using a genetic algorithm-optimized wavelet transform. In 2024, Ke Li from North University of China24introduced a novel fusion algorithm based on a double U-beam vibrating ring gyroscope. However, these methods primarily focus on denoising the gyroscope’s ZRO data, without addressing the noise at its source. As a result, the impact of noise on closed-loop control accuracy remains, and in practical applications, these approaches also face adaptability challenges. In 2022, Lei Wu25from the University of Science and Technology of China proposed a synchronous integrator demodulation method tailored for high-precision sensors, which demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in signal demodulation and noise suppression. However, it is regrettable that the application of this method to MEMS QMGs has been rarely reported.

To propel the development of gyroscopes and break through the current performance limitations, this paper conducts the following research: (1) A closed-loop noise model for the gyroscope FTR is established, where the gyroscope circuit noise is divided into signal detection end and excitation end noise. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, the impact of noise from both ends on the gyroscope performance is explored; (2) the impact of noise at the gyroscope signal output end on BI and ARW is evaluated. A synchronous integrator demodulation circuit is introduced to perform off-chip demodulation and noise suppression of the gyroscope signal, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the gyroscope ZRO. (3) The influence of the DC bias voltage at the gyroscope excitation electrode on excitation end noise is studied. Based on this, a FTR dual-loop control method based on SID–NLMS is proposed, and the effectiveness of this method in improving QMG BI and ARW is verified through experiments.

This paper studies the MEMS QMG, with its structure shown in Fig.1a. The QMG structure consists of four identical mass blocks, symmetrically arranged along thex-axis andy-axis in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Each mass block is connected to the drive and detection axes through support springs in the drive and sensing directions. Additionally, an internal coupling mechanism and external lever action enable the four mass blocks to move in anti-phase along the X mode (drive mode) and Y mode (sensing mode), reducing energy loss through the substrate and avoiding operation in the interference mode. The Y mode employs large-capacity comb electrodes and a differential sensing mechanism, improving mechanical sensitivity and reducing common-mode interference. Figure1bshows the mode order and distribution of the MEMS QMG. Table1lists some significant design parameters of the QMG.

WhereL=[x, y]Tare the vibration displacements of the X-mode and Y-mode along thex-axis and y-axis, respectively;τxandτyare the equivalent damping decay time constants for the two modes;τcis the equivalent damping coupling decay time constant between thex-axis andy-axis for the resonator;ωxandωyare the equivalent resonant frequencies for the two modes;ωcis the equivalent coupling frequency between thex-axis andy-axis for the resonator;meqis the equivalent mass of the resonator;F=[Fx, Fy]Tare the external excitation forces applied to the resonator along thex-axis andy-axis, respectively;Agis the angular gain of the resonator; andΩis the angular velocity of the gyroscope system along thez-axis.

Figure2shows the traditional control system block diagram of the MEMS QMG. The closed-loop for the X mode consists of a phase-locked loop (PLL) and automatic gain control (AGC). The PLL is used to track the resonant frequency of the gyroscope and provide modulation and demodulation signals for the system, while the AGC compensates for the energy loss due to damping during the resonator’s vibration. The quadrature closed-loop is used to suppress the quadrature error signals generated by the stiffness coupling between the two modes. The FTR closed-loop for the Y mode is used to detect the angular rate and enhance the gyroscope’s operating bandwidth.

It is important to note that the above closed-loop control is conducted under ideal conditions. When noise signals are taken into account, several issues may arise in the actual signal control process: (1) The noise signals introduced by the C/V circuit, capacitive feedthrough, and ADC circuit will be combined with the gyroscope’s vibration displacement signals and entered into the FPGA, where they will be amplified by the proportional part of the PI error controller; (2) the quantization noise generated by the ADC/DAC circuits will be superimposed on the gyroscope signal; (3) the noise introduced by the circuit will ultimately be applied, along with the error control signal, to the gyroscope’s excitation electrodes, forming a control loop.

In the equation,Kcoriolisis the Coriolis coupling coefficient between the two modes,Kc/vis the amplification gain of the C/V circuit, LPF represents the low-pass filter, and PI refers to the error controller.Kvfis the voltage-to-electrostatic force coefficient, andG(s) is the equivalent transfer function of the Y mode. The injected system diagram’s signal is divided into two parts: the signal detection noiseNsdand the excitation noiseNfb. The signal detection noise includes the noise from the C/V circuit, capacitive feedthrough, and the ADC circuit. The excitation noise includes the noise from the DAC circuit and mechanical thermal noise (which can be neglected in high-Q gyroscopes).

From Eq. (4), it is evident that the ZRO of the gyroscope contains bothNsdandNfb, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis. This phenomenon leads to the continuous and harmful accumulation of noise signals within the closed-loop control system. As time progresses and integration drift occurs, it severely affects the closed-loop control accuracy and stability of the gyroscope. By simplifying the FTR loop in the Y mode, the simplified FTR system noise model is shown in Fig.3a.

Here,SNsdandSNfbrepresent the power spectral densities (PSDs) of theNsdand theNfb, respectively, with units of V2/Hz. According to Eq. (7), theNfbis influenced not only by the background noise of the DAC circuit but also byKvfandKc/v; whereasNsdis determined by the C/V circuit, electrostatic feedthrough effects, and the background noise of the ADC circuit. The theoretical analysis of Eq. (7) is presented, with the results shown in Fig.3b.

As shown in Fig.3b, at low frequencies,Nfbdominates. The impact of low-frequency noise on the gyroscope manifests in the following ways: (1) low-frequency noise directly affects the gyroscope’s BI, leading to long-term random drift in the output; (2) when the gyroscope operates at low angular velocities, low-frequency noise may combine with the signal, reducing the ability to resolve small signals. At high frequencies,Nsddominates. The impact of high-frequency noise on the gyroscope is mainly reflected in the following aspects: (1) high-frequency noise will be superimposed on the gyroscope’s output signal, causing spikes or fluctuations in angular velocity measurements and affecting dynamic performance; (2) if the noise frequency is close to the drive frequency, phase noise may be generated, affecting the accuracy of signal demodulation.

In Eq. (9) and Fig.3c, with the material and manufacturing processes already determined,Vdcgoverns the low-frequency noise level, directly affecting the BI and ARW of the QMG.

WhereAxis the vibration displacement of the drive mode, andVacMAXis the maximum feedback voltage, which depends on the DAC range. When theVdcis reduced, the SF of the MEMS QMG and the AC signalVacgenerated by the PI controller will increase (as shown in Fig.3d), while theΩMAXwill decrease.

Figure4delineates the performance characterization of the MEMS QMG under varyingVdcmeasured under 25 ± 0.1 °C controlled conditions. From the experimental results, it can be observed that when theVdcis below 0.5 V, the measurement range of the gyroscope decreases from ±200°/s to ±150°/s, and the scale factor nonlinearity significantly deteriorates, increasing from 429 ppm to 1810 ppm. Additionally, the increase in the scale factor exacerbates the impact of environmental noise on the gyroscope. The ARW degrades from 0.0099°/√h to 0.022°/√h, and the BI worsens from 0.037°/h to 0.055°/h. Table2quantitatively compares gyroscope performance metrics acrossVdcfrom 5 V to 0.2 V.

The increase in SF is a double-edged sword for MEMS QMG. While the gyroscope needs to be more sensitive to weak angular velocity signals, a higher SF also amplifies noise and limits theΩMAX. Therefore, selecting an appropriateVdc, which improves SF while mitigating noise, is the core challenge of the excitation end noise reduction design.

Figure5ashows the MEMS QMG closed-loop control block diagram based on SID–NLMS. Compared to Fig.2, the main differences lie in the following aspects: (1) A 4 MHz high-frequency carrier signalVsquareis applied to the MEMS QMG resonator, which effectively mitigates the feedthrough effect and the impact of low-frequency noise on the QMG output signal. (2) A cascaded integrator replaces the original multiplication demodulation scheme, enabling off-chip demodulation, reducingNsd, and improving the SNR in the QMG loop. (3) The NLMS algorithm is integrated into the FTR loop to address the limitations of theVdcreduction method and improve the impact ofNfb.

To mitigate the impact ofNsdon the performance of the gyroscope, this paper utilizes the principle of synchronous integrator demodulation (SID)25,26. A multi-stage cascaded integrator is designed at the signal detection end of the QMG to achieve off-chip demodulation. The multi-stage cascaded integrator consists of multiple first-order SIDs connected in series (Fig.5b). Here, we introduce a single first-order SID. The SID is controlled by a synchronous switching signal. When the input signal is in the positive half-cycle, the synchronous switch connects the demodulated signal and the output signal to Integrator 1. When the input signal is in the negative half-cycle, the synchronous switch connects the demodulated signal and the output signal to Integrator 2.

The cascaded integrator offers several advantages: (1) Random noise and interference are unsynchronized with the switching signal, which effectively mitigates noise and interference signals25; (2) cascaded integrators enable external demodulation, improving the SNR of the loop; (3) the resistorRand integration capacitorsCform a low-pass filter, avoiding the need for complex digital filter designs. In this work, the SID bandwidth was strategically configured at 10.2 ± 0.5 Hz through rigorous trade-off analysis between noise suppression and dynamic response requirements.

Considering that excessively lowVdccan increase the nonlinearity of the gyroscope’s SF and mitigate itsΩMAX, this study adjustsVdcto 0.5 V. Additionally, an NLMS algorithm is designed at the output end of the closed-loop system. This algorithm adaptively adjusts the amplitude of the closed-loop system output based on the gyroscope’s operating state, thereby enhancing the SNR at the gyroscope’s excitation end. The detailed process of Algorithm 1 is provided in Table3.

Figure5cshows the FTR loop diagram with the NLMS algorithm incorporated. This control loop includes both an inner loop and an outer loop. The outer loop implements the FTR control, which is responsible for detecting angular rate and improving the operational bandwidth. The inner-loop implements NLMS to suppress noise components and drift terms in the PI control signals, thereby enhancing the SNR at the gyroscope’s drive interface. Notably, this work employs a cascaded NLMS-FTR topology that exclusively optimizes the PI output signal while preserving the original PI controller parameters. The NLMS algorithm operates at a 1 kHz update rate, strategically balancing the gyroscope’s disturbance rejection capability with the FPGA’s computational load constraints.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the SID–NLMS method, an experimental platform for the SID–NLMS QMG was built, as shown in Fig.6a. The experimental platform consists of the QMG prototype, a high-precision three-axis turntable, a PC, and a voltage source. The QMG prototype is composed of an analog board and a digital board: (1) The analog board mainly includes the QMG sensor head, the ring diode C/V circuit, the SID circuit, the driving circuit, and a 4 MHz carrier circuit; (2) the digital board mainly includes the FPGA minimum system circuit, a 24-bit 4-channel ADC, and a 20-bit single-channel DAC.

It is important to note that the MEMS QMG used in this study has an asymmetric structure, and the frequency response test results in open-loop mode are shown in Fig.6b. The resonant frequency of the X-mode is 4642.65 Hz, with a quality factor of 102 × 104; the resonant frequency of the Y-mode is 4708.88 Hz, with a quality factor of 38.4 × 104. The frequency difference between the two axes is concentrated in the range of 60–100 Hz. Figure6cshows the output waveforms of the MEMS QMG X-mode and Y-mode when operating in SID–NLMS mode. The green waveform represents the input signal of the X-mode, the yellow waveform represents the output signal of the X-mode, the blue waveform represents the input signal of the Y-mode, and the pink waveform represents the output signal of the Y-mode.

After the closed-loop control, the QMG prototype was fixed onto the test bench, and the power supply was connected. The sampling program was initiated, and the system recorded data for 61 min, with 60 min of valid data selected for Allan variance and PSD analysis. Figure6dshows the Allan variance results for both the traditional method and the method proposed in this paper. Under the traditional control method, the BI of the QMG was 0.407°/h, and the ARW was 0.137°/√h. With the proposed method, the BI was reduced to 0.024°/h, and the ARW decreased to 0.006°/√h, achieving a 16.96-fold reduction in BI and a 22.83-fold reduction in ARW. Figure6epresents the PSD comparison between the two methods. The low-frequency PSD improved from −32.73 dB (approximately equal to 5.34 × 10−4V2/Hz) to −60.71 dB (approximately equal to 8.51 × 10−7V2/Hz), while the high-frequency PSD improved from −39.97 dB to −51.53 dB. The above analysis demonstrates a significant performance improvement of the QMG in SID–NLMS mode, which is attributed to the enhancement in the QMG loop noise. The PSD peak at 10 Hz in Fig.6e(blue trace) is induced by the combined effect of DC bias voltage adjustment and SID bandwidth configuration.

In addition, after applying the method proposed in this paper, the threshold of the MEMS QMG reached 0.0001°/s, which has not been reported in previous studies (Fig.6f). Table4provides a comparison of QMG performance before and after applying the method proposed in this paper.

With the optimization of structural design, quadrature correction, mode matching, and damping matching technologies, the performance of QMG has made significant advancements. However, the noise in the QMG closed-loop system has gradually become a critical factor limiting further improvements in QMG performance.

Therefore, this paper analyzes the noise mechanisms of QMG, deeply investigates the impact of different electrode-end noise on BI and ARW, and proposes a control method based on SID–NLMS for QMG. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the QMG with the SID–NLMS architecture was significantly enhanced, with BI and ARW reduced by factors of 16.96 and 22.83, respectively. The threshold was further improved, reaching 0.0001°/s, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating QMG noise.

Although the SID–NLMS architecture has been successful in mitigating noise and improving the BI and ARW of the QMG, there are still the following limitations: (1) the SID off-chip demodulation scheme introduces an additional phase shift (18.2°), which leads to severe signal coupling between the two modes; (2) mode matching has not been performed, and performing mode matching would further improve the SNR of the QMG. Therefore, in future work, we will focus on addressing these issues and challenges, particularly by improving and evaluating these methods on fully symmetric multi-mass gyroscopes.

The MEMS QMG is fabricated using Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technology, with a single (111) silicon wafer measuring 7800 µm × 7800 µm × 50 µm. Each oscillator has a mass of 1.9 × 10−6kg, and the suspension beams are 6 µm wide. The silicon wafer leads are connected to a ceramic leadless chip carrier (LCC) package through eutectic bonding. After wafer-level packaging, the Q-factor reaches approximately 100,0000, and the resonant frequency is 4640 Hz. The gyroscope includes 48 comb capacitive electrodes and 24 parallel-plate capacitors, each with a capacitive gap of 2.5 µm, and 24 electrodes are allocated for each mode. In the X mode, Dx+ and Dx− represent a set of differential drive electrodes, while Sx+ and Sx− represent a set of differential sense electrodes. Similarly, in the Y mode, Dy+ and Dy− denote the differential drive electrodes, and Sy+ and Sy− are the differential sense electrodes. QA, QB, QC, and QD are four independent quadrature suppression electrodes, while T serves as the tuning electrode for the Y mode. The MEMS QMG control method, utilizing cascade integrator and dual closed-loop FTR architecture, comprises SID, adjustment of the FTR electrode’s AC and DC signal distribution strategy, and a dual closed-loop FTR architecture based on the NLMS algorithm. This approach achieves noise suppression at both the gyroscope signal detection and feedback ends, improving the gyroscope’s ZRO, BI, and ARW. For the analog circuit design, the differential C/V amplifier circuit is built with the Schottky ring diode HSMS2827 and the AD8221. The digital circuit employs a 4-channel, 24-bit ADS1294 ADC, while the DAC converter used is the 20-bit AD5791.
