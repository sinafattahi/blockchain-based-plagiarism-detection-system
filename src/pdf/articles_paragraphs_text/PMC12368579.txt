Microfluidic devices are miniaturized systems engineered to precisely manipulate microliter- to nanoliter-scale fluid volumes through microscale channels.1–3These platforms offer substantial benefits, including reduced reagent and sample consumption, faster assay times, enhanced analytical sensitivity, and portable operation.3,4These advantages have led to widespread implementation in point-of-care diagnostics, therapeutic monitoring, and lab-on-chip platforms.5–7The continued miniaturization of healthcare systems has driven the evolution of microfluidic technologies toward wearable and implantable formats capable of real-time analysis, seamless data transmission, and closed-loop feedback, all while maintaining user comfort and system reliability.8–10As illustrated inFig. 1, these developments have enabled a range of wearable and implantable microfluidic systems, which interface seamlessly with wireless communication modules and AI-assisted diagnostics to deliver dynamic health insights.

Despite significant progress, the widespread adoption of wearable and implantable microfluidic technologies is constrained by several challenges.17Long-term sensor stability, biofouling resistance, mechanical durability, and continuous power supply remain major concerns.31For wearable systems, adhesion to dynamic skin surfaces and susceptibility to environmental interferences such as sweat pH or temperature variations can affect signal fidelity.32Implantable devices must contend with immune responses, fibrosis, and biofluid ingress, all of which can deteriorate sensing accuracy or therapeutic function over time.28Miniaturization of multi-modal systems while maintaining performance, as well as the integration of secure wireless communication and cloud-based analytics, is essential for broader clinical deployment.32Moreover, regulatory compliance, ethical data handling, and large-scale manufacturing remain as barriers that must be addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration.

This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in wearable and implantable microfluidic systems, highlighting how design considerations guide material selection and inform compatible fabrication methods for targeted biomedical applications (Fig. 2). Key topics include fluid manipulation mechanisms, sensing modalities, and material selection parameters that collectively enhance device functionality, biocompatibility, and user comfort. A comparative analysis of fabrication methods—such as soft lithography, 3D printing, and screen printing—is provided, with attention to their resolution, throughput, and scalability. Application areas span wearable platforms for sweat analysis, wound monitoring, and ocular diagnostics, as well as implantable systems for precision drug delivery and chronic disease management. Critical challenges—including material degradation, long-term biostability, power supply limitations, and regulatory compliance—are discussed in the context of real-world deployment. Future directions highlight the integration of self-sustaining power sources, advanced biomaterials, and AI-assisted data analytics to enable intelligent, autonomous health monitoring. By addressing both the transformative potential and practical barriers, this review aims to inform and inspire continued innovation in microfluidic technologies that support personalized, preventive, and responsive healthcare.

The development of microfluidic devices for wearable and implantable applications necessitates the careful integration of material science, fluid mechanics, sensor engineering, and system-level design.31,33Key considerations include material flexibility and biocompatibility, efficient biofluid handling, sensor and electronic integration, power sustainability, and reliable data communication.34,35Material selection not only dictates mechanical resilience and skin or tissue compatibility but also influences resistance to biofouling and degradation.9,36Fluid handling mechanisms—whether passive or active—must ensure precise transport and sampling under physiological conditions. Sensor integration is essential for real-time,in situdetection with minimal interference.37Compact power solutions and wireless communication modules further enable autonomous operation and connectivity with external healthcare platforms.38,39The following sections detail the specific design requirements and challenges for wearable and implantable microfluidic systems.

Recent advances in materials science have addressed these challenges across both domains.41–43Developments in stretchable nanocomposites, conductive and stimuli-responsive hydrogels, and biodegradable polymers have enabled improved integration with biological tissues and expanded the functional versatility of microfluidic platforms.44–46Table 1summarizes representative materials employed in wearable and implantable systems, which are further discussed in the following sections.

Wearable microfluidic devices demand materials that are not only biocompatible but also capable of maintaining mechanical integrity and functional reliability under continuous motion and environmental exposure.47A primary design objective is to achieve intimate, conformal contact with the skin by replicating its mechanical characteristics.40,48Human skin exhibits a Young's modulus typically ranging from ∼0.05 to 2 MPa, depending on both anatomical region and depth within the skin layers. Its stretchability also varies with location, with jointed regions such as the elbow and knee capable of sustaining strains up to 60–70%, while flatter areas like the forearm or abdomen typically experience lower strains in the range of 20–30% during normal movement.49–51To accommodate such deformation, wearable microfluidics employ materials that balance softness, stretchability, and durability, ensuring stable operation during prolonged daily use.

Emerging trends in implantable microfluidics include the integration of dynamic, resorbable, or biointeractive materials.79Hydrogels are increasingly incorporated as compliant, tissue-mimicking interfaces or bioactive scaffolds. Meanwhile, biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(anhydrides), and other bioresorbable materials enable the fabrication of transient implants.31,80These devices are engineered to function over a defined therapeutic window—such as for drug delivery or tissue regeneration—and subsequently degrade harmlesslyin situ, eliminating the need for surgical retrieval. A representative example is a PLGA-based microfluidic drug delivery implant that achieved controlled release over several weeks before undergoing complete resorptionin vivo, demonstrating the feasibility of biodegradable platforms for temporary therapeutic applications.81Balancing degradation kinetics with mechanical integrity remains a major design challenge, particularly for systems requiring precise fluid handling or long-term structural stability.

Designing microfluidic devices for wearable and implantable use involves shared engineering demands—miniaturization, precise fluid handling, biocompatibility, and reliable sealing—alongside distinct contextual challenges. Both systems must autonomously manage fluids at microliter to nanoliter scales and integrate compact, low-power electronics for sensing and communication.82Wearables emphasize simplicity, passive flow, and user robustness, while implants require long-term stability, active control, and surgical compatibility.83Engineers must also address thermal regulation and mechanical safety. The following sections outline key strategies for fluid management, power integration, and device reliability, highlighting recent advances tailored to wearable and implantable microfluidic platforms.

To address this, researchers have introduced active fluid control elements in soft, conformal platforms. For example, Linet al.developed a programmable epidermal system incorporating thermo-responsive hydrogel valves actuated by thin-film microheaters, enabling consistent and on-demand sweat routing.87Active components are embedded using stretchable electronics, micro-actuators, or stimuli-responsive materials, which swell or shrink in response to external stimuli (e.g., temperature or hydration). The method enabled dynamic control while maintaining mechanical compliance with the skin.

Overall, wearable microfluidic systems integrate soft materials, autonomous fluid handling, embedded sensors, and wireless modules to achieve high-performance biosensing in a user-friendly, skin-conformal form.

To enable continuous monitoring, biosensors are embedded within the implantable platforms to measure physiological markers such as glucose, pH, and electrolytes. However, sensor reliability is challenged by biofouling, resulting from protein adsorption or cellular overgrowth.31This is mitigated by antifouling strategies, including PEGylated surfaces, zwitterionic coatings, or semi-permeable membranes that isolate sensing elements.98Advances in MEMS fabrication have further enabled the integration of miniaturized, high-resolution sensors into microfluidic systems, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling localized biochemical analysis in real time.

Reliable wireless communication is equally critical for enabling real-time monitoring and remote diagnostics. Technologies such as bluetooth low energy (BLE), near-field communication (NFC), and custom RF telemetry allow implants to transmit data through tissue to external receivers.103Given the sensitivity of health data, secure data handling is imperative. End-to-end encryption, robust authentication protocols, and emerging blockchain-integrated frameworks are being developed to safeguard medical information and ensure data integrity within connected healthcare ecosystems.

The fabrication of wearable and implantable microfluidic devices requires precise methods to ensure structural integrity, functional reliability, and biocompatibility. These techniques must accommodate diverse material properties while enabling the seamless integration of microchannels, biosensors, and electronic components.16The choice of fabrication method depends on the intended application, resolution requirements, and material compatibility. Various fabrication techniques have been developed to meet these demands.104The following sections give detailed introductions to key fabrication methods and present specific examples of these fabrication techniques for wearable and implantable microfluidic devices, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and potential improvements for future biomedical applications.

Wearable and implantable microfluidic devices require fabrication techniques that accommodate miniaturization, flexibility, and biocompatibility. Early lab-on-chip devices were typically made using photolithography and etching on silicon or glass, yielding precise microchannels but with high cost and rigidity.105To overcome these limitations, a range of newer methods—such as polymer casting (soft lithography), laser micromachining, hot embossing, 3D printing, and fiber-based microfluidics—have been developed.106Each method offers distinct advantages and challenges, and careful integration and encapsulation are needed to translate microfluidic systems into wearable or implantable form factors.

In contrast, CNC micromachining offers improved surface finish and tighter geometric control, particularly in polymer and metal substrates, making it a valuable complementary technique. It uses computer-controlled miniature endmills to mechanically cut microchannels and 3D features—such as pockets, chambers, and through-holes—directly into the substrate.105Like laser ablation, it is a mold- and mask-free approach well-suited for rapid prototyping. However, heat generated during milling can lead to burr formation, and the small size of micro-tools makes tool wear difficult to monitor and failure harder to predict. Issues such as built-up edge formation, runout, and tool fragility can limit the minimum achievable feature size and compromise machining precision if not carefully controlled.119Given these traits, subtractive techniques are most effective for rapid prototyping or for fabricating high-fidelity molds and master structures, which can then be employed in replication-based methods.

In fibrous microfluidics, fluid transport is governed by the porosity and fiber architecture of the material, rather than by defined channel walls. For example, liquid wicks along cellulose fibers in paper or through the core of braided threads. This results in higher microscale roughness and variability in flow paths compared to lithographically defined microchannels, but such irregularities are acceptable for capillary-driven transport and the relatively large sample volumes typical of these systems. Key advantages of fibrous platforms include mechanical flexibility—enabling integration with skin or textiles—and low fabrication cost. Printing techniques are easily adaptable to large-area or roll-to-roll manufacturing, making fibrous microfluidic devices well-suited for scalable, disposable, and wearable diagnostic applications.

Fabrication strategies for wearable and implantable microfluidics must be aligned with functional priorities—namely precision, mechanical adaptability, and production scalability. While no single technique consistently excels across all these dimensions, understanding their respective trade-offs enables rational selection based on the specific demands of a given application.

Table 2summarizes the above-mentioned fabrication techniques for wearable and implantable microfluidic devices, comparing their respective advantages and limitations. As device complexity and functional integration increase, converging high-resolution fabrication with soft material compatibility and scalable production will be pivotal to advancing next-generation wearable and implantable microfluidic systems.

The following subsections highlight examples of how fabrication techniques have been adapted for polymer-based and fiber-based wearable microfluidic devices, demonstrating their role in real-time health monitoring, personalized diagnostics, and scalable manufacturing.

Soft lithography remains a cornerstone technique for fabricating polymer-based wearable microfluidics.138A notable example is the PDMS-based device by Kohet al.(Fig. 3A), engineered for multiplexed sweat analysis and wireless monitoring.139The system comprises three layers: (i) a skin-adhesive substrate with micromachined sweat inlets, (ii) a soft lithography-molded PDMS layer featuring sealed microchannels and reagent-filled reservoirs for colorimetric detection of biomarkers such as pH, chloride, and glucose, and (iii) a flexible NFC antenna for wireless data transfer. With an effective modulus of ∼0.16 MPa, the device conforms closely to skin mechanics, enabling unobtrusive wear. Finite element analysis further validated its mechanical compliance, showing interface stresses under 30% simulated skin strain remained well below the 20 kPa threshold for tactile perception. As one of the earliest demonstrations of integrated, battery-free, flexible colorimetric microfluidic sensing in a wearable format, this work marks a paradigm shift toward autonomous biofluid analysis and reliable on-body operation—helping define a new direction for epidermal health monitoring systems.

Despite its advantages, soft lithography can be labor-intensive and challenging to scale for mass production.140Recent innovations have sought to evolve this foundational technique by enhancing scalability, precision, and material integration while preserving the intrinsic softness and skin-conformability critical to wearable applications. Advances such as multi-layered PDMS structuring, hybrid lithographic approaches, and microcontact printing have improved microchannel resolution and reproducibility on flexible substrates.141However, conventional soft lithography struggles to achieve high-resolution patterning on non-planar or curved surfaces—a critical requirement for anatomically adaptive wearables. To overcome this, Anet al.integrated thermoforming with soft lithography, enabling precise molding of curved microchannels.142This hybrid approach facilitated the development of microfluidic contact lens sensors for continuous intraocular pressure monitoring, improving adaptability and performance. Concurrently, Zhanget al.introduced a transformative one-step process for fabricating liquid metal (LM)-integrated soft microfluidic sensors.143By combining microchannel patterning with electrochemical LM deposition, their method bypassed traditional photolithography and invasive LM injections. The use of electrochemically functionalized LM stamps ensured precise metal transfer onto PDMS, while interfacial hydrogen bonding reinforced mechanical stability and adhesion. These advancements underscore soft lithography's evolving synergy with next-generation fabrication paradigms, expanding its utility in wearable biosensing and underscoring its adaptability to emerging design and material challenges.

3D printing has emerged as a transformative approach for fabricating wearable microfluidics, enabling customizable, multi-material architectures with embedded biosensing capabilities.144A notable innovation is the 3D-printed “sweatainer” (Fig. 3B), which leverages vat photopolymerization to fabricate enclosed microfluidic channels monolithically, bypassing the multi-step assembly required in traditional PDMS-based systems.145This design supports multi-draw sweat collection for both real-time on-body analysis and offline biomarker quantification, enhancing versatility in fluidic handling. By enabling fully three-dimensional microfluidic architectures and integrated capillary control in a single-step process, this work represents a major advance beyond the planar constraints of conventional soft lithography, enabling the development of autonomous, digitally fabricated fluidic systems. Building on this platform-level progress, Chenet al.demonstrated a direct ink writing (DIW)-printed flexible wearable monitor forin situsweat analysis.146Although the device adopts a similar colorimetric sensing strategy, the DIW process removes the need for sacrificial materials and incorporates single-atom catalyst (SAC)-based biosensors through pick-and-place assembly. As a notable improvement, this work achieves high sensitivity and selectivity for real-time monitoring of metabolites such as glucose, lactate, and uric acid, reinforcing 3D printing's growing role in uniting structural customization, material versatility, and functional integration in wearable diagnostics.

Complementing these additive manufacturing techniques, laser-induced graphene (LIG) has emerged as a versatile platform for monolithic microfluidic biosensor fabrication. Garlandet al.demonstrated this potential by employing CO2laser writing to simultaneously pattern microfluidic channels and porous graphene electrodes directly onto polyimide substrates.147This single-step, maskless process eliminates the need for sacrificial materials or multi-step etching, enabling scalable and cost-effective production of biosensing systems. The resulting sensors are seamlessly integrated with flexible tape-based microfluidics, conforming to the skin for real-time monitoring of biomarkers such as glucose, lactate, and sodium ions. By streamlining fabrication and improving deployment efficiency, this approach advances the accessibility and versatility of wearable diagnostics.

Hybrid fabrication approaches are increasingly merging printed techniques with established methods such as injection molding and laser structuring to expand functionality and scalability. Makhiniaet al., for example, introduced a digitally programmable strategy by combining stereolithography (SLA)-printed microchannels with inkjet-printed hydrophilic coatings to achieve capillary-driven flow control, including stop and delay valves—an advance that enabled autonomous sequencing and integration with screen-printed organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) for real-time chloride ion sensing.150This represents a transformative step toward fully additive, programmable microfluidic systems. In parallel, Chaiet al.demonstrated a sustainable fabrication route using injection-molded cellulose acetate (CA) substrates structuredviaCO2laser ablation.151By leveraging the inherent hydrophilicity of CA, the device achieved spontaneous capillary flow without requiring additional surface treatment, supporting functionalities such as droplet generation and passive mixing. While the fabrication methods themselves are established, the use of biodegradable materials and laser-tuned flow behavior marks a strong incremental improvement in eco-conscious microfluidic design. Together, these innovations illustrate how hybrid strategies are advancing microfluidic platforms by integrating digital control, material sustainability, and scalable manufacturing.

Fiber-based microfluidic systems have emerged as a versatile, scalable platform for wearable biosensing, leveraging porous textiles, threads, and paper substrates to enable passive, capillary-driven fluid transport.152Among these, paper-based microfluidics represent a paradigm shift in low-cost, disposable diagnostics.153A prominent approach involves the use of wax-based inks to create hydrophobic barriers on porous fabrics, directing fluid flow through predefined hydrophilic pathways. For example, Chenget al.developed an origami-structured sweat sensor using hydrophilic/hydrophobic filter paper layers folded into programmable microfluidic channels.154By patterning hydrophobic wax barriersvialaser printing, the device directs sequential sweat flow to integrated colorimetric assays (glucose, lactate, uric acid, pH, and magnesium ions) and electrochemical cortisol sensors. Screen-printed electrodes and synchronized enzymatic reactions with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) enable multiplexed signal capture within a single 30-minute assay. Combined with smartphone-based RGB analysis, this foldable design represents a notable advance in functional integration and usability for mass-producible, point-of-care sweat diagnostics.

Despite its advantages, conventional wax printing often requires post-heating optimization to balance hydrophobic barrier integrity with channel resolution. Addressing this limitation, Tzianniet al.(Fig. 3C) developed a wax screen-printable ink for direct, post-treatment-free fabrication of hydrophobic barriers on cotton/elastane fabrics.155This method achieves high-resolution patterning with robust adhesion and reproducibility, critical for high-throughput manufacturing. The resulting screen-printed fabric microfluidic devices (μFADs) integrate colorimetric assays for multiplexed sweat analysis (e.g., pH and urea detection), exemplifying a mass-producible, cost-effective diagnostic platform.

Beyond wax-based methods, xurography offers a rapid, cost-effective alternative for patterning flexible substrates. Kongkaewet al.developed a craft-and-stick xurographic method, utilizing a computer-controlled cutting plotter to precisely pattern graphene paper electrodes (GPEs) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microfluidic layers.156The components were assembled using adhesive tape, forming a thin, lightweight, and flexible microfluidic-integrated GPE (MF-iGPE). This technique enables rapid prototyping with high reproducibility while eliminating the need for complex lithographic or chemical processes.

Sewing and embroidery techniques have broadened the fabrication toolkit for fiber-based microfluidics by enabling precise integration of hydrophilic threads into textile substrates. Zhaoet al.demonstrated this with a thread/fabric-based wearable microfluidic device (μTFAD), where hydrophilic threads were embedded within hydrophobic fabric to form directional microchannels for sweat transport.157These channels guided fluid toward colorimetric sensing zones for real-time analysis of pH, chloride, and glucose, with smartphone-based RGB analysis enhancing readout accuracy. The use of automated embroidery supports scalable production while preserving the flexibility and durability required for conformal wear. Expanding on this approach, Hanzeet al.developed 3D stitched textile microfluidics using computerized embroidery to pattern hydrophilic Coolmax® polyester yarn onto hydrophobic fabric, forming complex 2D/3D channel architectures for capillary-driven fluid mixing and separation (Fig. 3D).158In parallel, gold-coated conductive threads were co-embroidered to function as electrochemical sensors, enabling real-time biomarker monitoring in a reusable, machine-washable T-shirt platform. This method aligns with conventional garment manufacturing workflows, offering a scalable route to discreet, high-performance wearable diagnostics integrated into everyday clothing.

Expanding fabrication versatility, hybrid approaches combine multiple techniques to enhance performance and manufacturability. Liet al.developed a plasmonic paper-based microfluidic device integrating laser cutting, hydrophobic patterning, and screen-printed electrodes for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sweat sensing.159This device regulates sweat transport through segmented channels, achieving real-time uric acid and pH detection while maintaining structural flexibility and high signal reproducibility. By merging printed electronics, microfluidic patterning, and optical sensing, hybrid fabrication methods optimize precision, scalability, and functionality, further pushing the boundaries of wearable microfluidic biosensing.

To complement these diverse fabrication strategies, it is important to critically assess the translational challenges facing fiber-based microfluidic systems. While paper-based platforms offer distinct advantages—such as low cost, ease of patterning, and capillary-driven flow—their long-term deployment in wearable diagnostics remains limited. Mechanical fragility, sensitivity to environmental fluctuations (e.g., humidity, temperature), and degradation of signal fidelity due to chromogen leaching or enzymatic instability are persistent issues.160These issues extend to textile- and thread-based systems, which, despite improved mechanical flexibility and garment integration, face parallel hurdles. Sweat and skin oils can foul conductive inks or fibers, causing signal drift, while frequent washing and prolonged wear can degrade printed or embroidered electrodes. Additionally, waterproofing and electrical insulation—oftenvialaminates or coatings—increase fabrication complexity and may impact recyclability and breathability.161Despite promising prototypes, few fiber-based systems have reached regulatory approval or commercialization. Advancing material durability, standardized encapsulation, and protective coatings will be key to enabling reliable real-world deployment.

The fabrication of implantable microfluidic systems necessitates the integration of high-resolution fluidic channels, biocompatible and often biodegradable materials, and robust yet minimally invasive packaging strategies. These systems must maintain mechanical integrity and functional stability within dynamic biological environments over clinically relevant timescales.28To meet these multifaceted requirements, a diverse set of microfabrication strategies has been explored. This section categorizes key fabrication approaches into molding and sacrificial techniques, lithography-based methods, additive manufacturing, and textile-based integrations, emphasizing their unique advantages, limitations, and representative applications.

Molding-based approaches are among the earliest and most versatile methods used to fabricate microfluidic architectures, particularly when high throughput and geometric complexity are required. These techniques utilize rigid molds to shape elastomeric or hydrogel-based materials into functional microfluidic components, often suitable for integration with other soft biointerfaces. For example, Chenet al.(Fig. 4A) developed an implantable magnetic microfluidic pump with a diameter of 22 mm and a thickness of 5 mm using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cast within precision-machined stainless-steel moldsviainjection molding to yield a thickness of approximately 400 μm.162Such defined dimensions highlight the capability to achieve high geometric fidelity, which is critical for the intendedin vivoapplication in small anatomical spaces like the rat femoral intramedullary cavity.

Sacrificial molding expands the design space by allowing fabrication of enclosed 3D microchannel networks within otherwise difficult-to-pattern matrices. Zhaoet al.utilized gelatin as a sacrificial template to create microchannels within a silk protein-based hydrogel, resulting in a bioresorbable platform with interconnected vascular-like networks.163This method, achieving channel dimensions as small as 100 μm, is particularly attractive for soft implants intended for tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and other transient applications where biodegradability and biocompatibility are essential.

While conventional molding offers scalable and reproducible fabrication, the use of bioresorbable sacrificial templates like gelatin within biodegradable hydrogels represents a transformative approach. This strategy enables fully transient, tissue-mimicking architectures for regenerative implants—moving beyond static structural replication toward dynamic, biointegrated systems. These molding-based strategies demonstrate a clear advantage in forming complex, bio-integrated 3D microstructures and are often paired with soft materials to match tissue compliance, making them well-suited for long-term implantation.

Lithographic techniques, particularly soft lithography, have been instrumental in the evolution of planar microfluidics and continue to be central to the fabrication of high-resolution, functionally integrated implantable devices. These methods offer precise control over feature dimensions and alignment, allowing the creation of microchannels, valves, and hybrid interfaces with sub-micron accuracy.164,165A representative example is shown inFig. 4B, researchers fabricated a 2.7 mm diameter, 450 μm thick circular window PDMS-glass microfluidic platform for neural applications using soft lithography.166The integration of a fused silica window enabled simultaneous two-photon imaging and localized drug delivery to the mouse cortex, demonstrating the effectiveness of lithographically patterned microchannels for seamless interaction with central nervous system tissues.

To achieve further miniaturization and effective integration with rigid substrates, a thin-film transfer method was employed using dual-depth silicon molds fabricated through deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).167This approach enabled the one-step fabrication of PDMS channels with a depth of 10 μm, which were subsequently bonded to silicon dioxide surfaces using oxygen plasma. The resulting structure facilitated seamless incorporation of microfluidics onto silicon-based neural probes, supporting precise nanoliter-scale drug delivery.

Expanding on the versatility of lithographic methods, researchers have demonstrated the use of multilayer lithography for the integration of optical and fluidic functionalities.168They developed a fully implantable optofluidic cuff by employing adhesive and plasma bonding techniques for accurate multilayer alignment, achieving interlayer registration within ∼50 μm. This configuration allowed for targeted fluid delivery through the microfluidic channels with cross-sectional areas of 60 × 60 μm alongside neural interfacing capabilities, illustrating the modularity and multifunctional potential of layered lithographic fabrication for complex implantable systems.

To improve long-term device stability and prevent gas permeation, a parylene-coated microfluidic system was developed and embedded within an intraocular lens.169The PDMS microchannels were fabricated using standard soft lithography techniques, achieving feature resolutions down to 50 μm. The channels had dimensions of 50 × 50 μm2in cross-section and lengths on the order of several millimeters, connected to a gas reservoir measuring approximately 500 × 500 × 300 μm3. A thin, uniform parylene-C coating was deposited onto the PDMS structures to significantly reduce gas permeability. This approach was particularly advantageous for preserving delicate microstructures in sensitive ophthalmic environments, ensuring durability and functional integrity over extended periods of implantation.

A more radical implementation of lithography-enabled microfluidics was presented recently with a soft, bioresorbable evaporative cooling device for nerve modulation.170The fabrication involved poly(octanediol citrate) (POC) as a bioresorbable elastomer to create microchannels through soft lithography techniques, achieving serpentine geometries with precisely controlled dimensions and a cuff structure tailored specifically to a 1.5 mm nerve diameter. The device integrated bioresorbable magnesium-based temperature sensors patterned onto cellulose acetate substrates, facilitating real-time temperature feedback. The microfluidic channels, with widths and lengths optimized to about 100 μm and several millimeters respectively, successfully delivered perfluoropentane and nitrogen, enabling localized evaporative cooling without the need for sutures or explantation. This illustrates the remarkable potential of lithographic methods in transient therapeutic systems requiring precise spatiotemporal control.

While many of the fabrication techniques discussed—such as soft lithography or micromolding—offer incremental refinements in biocompatibility and resolution, certain approaches represent more transformative shifts. Notably, hybrid lithography strategies combining soft and hard lithography for multilayer optofluidic integration enable unprecedented neural interfacing capabilities. Similarly, the use of bioresorbable materials patternedviaphotolithography to create transient, stitch-free evaporative cooling devices signifies a paradigm shift in temporary implant design. These advances go beyond performance optimization, fundamentally altering how microfluidic systems interface with biological tissue and resolve long-standing challenges in surgical retrieval, device miniaturization, and multimodal function.

Additive manufacturing (AM) has introduced a paradigm shift in microfluidics by enabling rapid, on-demand fabrication of complex, three-dimensional architectures on both flat and irregular substrates. Techniques such as stereolithography (SLA), two-photon polymerization (2PP), and aerosol-jet printing allow for the integration of microfluidics with electronics, optics, and soft robotics in a compact form factor.

Iveset al.designed a microfluidic force sensor embedded within a 3D-printed hip implant using SLA for the fluidic structure and aerosol-jet printing for flexible electrodes on Kapton.171The device withstood surgical loads exceeding 400 N and maintained a compact, mechanically adaptive profile. Bonding was achieved using precision-cut double-sided adhesives, demonstrating the feasibility of AM techniques for orthopedic applications requiring structural durability.

At the microscale, Muet al.(Fig. 4C) used 2PP to fabricate fluidic channels directly onto photonic neural probes, achieving nanoscale alignment between waveguides, electrodes, and microchannels.172Printed using a high-resolution Nanoscribe system and IP-S resin, the integrated structure exhibited precise dimensions, with channel inner dimensions of approximately 70 μm width and 18 μm height, highlighting the high fabrication precision attainable with 2PP. These probes enabled localized, addressable uncaging of fluorescein at micrometer-scale resolution, demonstrating the capability of 2PP for achieving not only structural precision but also functional precision through highly controlled fluid and light delivery. Furthermore, Muet al.confirmed strong adhesion and structural integrity of the printed microfluidics, even after repeated insertions into brain tissue, underscoring the excellent mechanical stability and surface quality achievableviathis technique. This approach underscores the strength of 2PP in achieving seamless optofluidic integration for high-precision neuromodulation.

A distinctive example of functional integration using AM is provided by Xuet al.(Fig. 4D), who engineered a wirelessly actuated pump and valve system within a dental implant.173The system utilized an SLA-printed body, a PDMS- and parylene-C-coated steel piston with an embedded magnet, and a magnetically actuated Ecoflex valve. Wireless operation was achievedviaan external rotating magnetic field, enabling localized, on-demand therapeutic delivery to the bone–implant interface. This comprehensive design exemplifies the synergy between 3D printing, soft magnetics, and remote actuation for smart therapeutic implants.

Textile-inspired microfluidics offer an unconventional yet highly effective approach for embedding sensing and fluidic functionality into biologically compliant, soft materials. Threads and yarns inherently possess properties such as flexibility, porosity, and capillarity, which can be harnessed to form microfluidic networks and biosensors that conform seamlessly to biological tissues.

Thread-based microfluidics were pioneered through the sequential coating of cotton threads with conductive and functional inks to create flexible, integrated fluidic systems.174Mostafaluet al.employed dip-coating processes to functionalize threads with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), polyaniline (PANI), and silver/silver chloride inks, yielding conductive threads with microscale features governed primarily by thread diameter (ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers). SEM analysis indicated that functional nanomaterials effectively infiltrated thread pores, creating stable, interconnected conductive surfaces suitable for reliable electrochemical sensing. Each coated layer was carefully stabilized through drying and curing steps to enhance mechanical integrity and prevent delamination under strain. The resulting robust, flexible sensors demonstrated high sensitivity, with strain sensors achieving gauge factors around 3 at strains up to 100%, while chemical sensors maintained stable, near-Nernstian responses (−59.63 mV pH−1) with minimal drift (2.5 mV h−1). These thread-based platforms, with their precise and scalable fabrication, can be directly embedded into biological tissues, offering a minimally invasive route for continuousin situbiochemical monitoring and therapeutic actuation within soft, tissue-compliant environments.

While thread-based platforms originated as low-cost flexible sensors, their evolution into multi-layered, tissue-compatible sensing and drug delivery systems suggests a transformative direction. These platforms challenge traditional rigid implant geometries by embedding capillary networks and electronics within soft, thread-like substrates that mimic native tissue architecture.

The previous sections have outlined the fundamental design principles and fabrication strategies that underpin the development of wearable and implantable microfluidic systems. These innovations have paved the way for practical biomedical applications, where microfluidic devices serve as powerful tools for continuous health monitoring, targeted drug delivery, and real-time biochemical analysis. This section focuses on the practical applications of microfluidic technology in both wearable and implantable formats. Wearable microfluidic systems have been developed for non-invasive health monitoring through sweat analysis, epidermal biosensing, and integration into smart textiles, offering continuous and personalized diagnostics in real-time. In contrast, implantable microfluidic platforms are engineered forin vivomonitoring, precise drug delivery, and interfacing with neural and biochemical environments, enabling long-term therapeutic interventions with minimal patient discomfort. Together, these innovations underscore the transformative impact of microfluidics in advancing minimally invasive, responsive, and patient-centric healthcare solutions.

Wearable microfluidic devices represent a major advancement in biomedical sensing, enabling non-invasive, continuous, and personalized health monitoring through real-time analysis of biofluids. By integrating soft, skin-conformal materials with passive or low-power fluid manipulation strategies, these systems achieve long-term compatibility with the human body. The following subsections examine representative devices by targeted biofluid.Table 3presents a comparative summary of recent progress across sweat, tears, interstitial fluid, wound exudate, saliva, and genitourinary secretions—highlighting sensing targets, detection methods, application areas, clinical readiness, and remaining challenges.

Recent developments illustrate how integrated microfluidic architectures can enhance analytical performance while maintaining device wearability and user comfort.184–190Yeet al.designed a fully autonomous aptamer-based biosensor for estradiol monitoring in sweat (Fig. 5A).191The device employed a reagentless “signal-on” detection strategy based on strand displacement, coupled with microfluidic iontophoresis for controlled sweat stimulation and sample acquisition. Embedded sensors for pH, ionic strength, and temperature enabled real-time calibration, while gold nanoparticle–MXene electrodes enhanced electrochemical sensitivity, achieving an ultralow detection limit of 0.14 pM and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. The system demonstrated strong correlation with serum hormone levels in clinical studies, highlighting its potential for real-time, at-home monitoring of reproductive health.

Recent efforts have focused on leveraging localized sweat analysis to extract physiological insights.197,198A skin-interfaced microfluidic band developed by Choet al.enabled time-resolved mapping of sweat biochemistry across body locations and exercise conditions, incorporating a colorimetric timing module to track dynamic changes in pH and lactate during physical activity.199The study demonstrated a strong correlation between sweat pH and blood lactate over active muscle groups, establishing sweat pH as a viable non-invasive biomarker for muscle fatigue and exertion levels. Together, these studies exemplify how skin-conformal sweat microfluidic sensors can support both performance optimization and individualized metabolic health monitoring in real-world settings.

One notable example is the microneedle-based microfluidic patch developed by Silvaet al., which utilizes two-photon polymerization to fabricate hollow microneedles directly onto microfluidic substrates.204The needles demonstrated mechanical strength of 411 ± 3 mN per needle, sufficient to withstand at least 10 consecutive insertions into skin-mimicking materials without deformation.In vivoevaluations conducted over a 72-hour period confirmed the device's biocompatibility, structural reliability, and capability for fast and consistent ISF extraction. This approach highlights the growing role of advanced microfabrication and integration strategies in enhancing ISF accessibility and reliability for continuous biomarker sensing.

Another notable example is the fully integrated wearable microneedle sensor developed by Tehraniet al.(Fig. 5B), which enables real-time, continuous monitoring of glucose, lactate, and alcohol in ISF.205The system employs a microneedle array manufacturedviaa high-resolution CNC micromachining process, allowing precise fabrication of high-aspect-ratio channels and robust through-holes for effective ISF extraction and guided transport. Multiplexed electrochemical sensors and low-power custom electronics are embedded to support wireless data transmission and app-based visualization. On-body trials confirmed a glucose detection limit of 0.32 mM and a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 9.6% compared to standard blood glucose meters. Dual-analyte sensing with minimal crosstalk was achieved through spatial electrode separation and tailored sensing chemistry. These advances reflect the rapid maturation of ISF biosensing platforms, transitioning from invasive subdermal systems toward epidermal patches capable of autonomous, continuous monitoring.

An illustrative example is the smart bioelectronic pacifier by Limet al.(Fig. 5C), designed for real-time monitoring of salivary sodium and potassium in neonates.212The system embeds solid-state ion-selective electrodes (SS-ISEs), a PDMS-PEG microfluidic channel, and a wireless circuit into a compact pacifier form. Capillary-driven flow enables passive, continuous sampling without the need for suction or user interaction. The sensors exhibit high sensitivity—53 mV per decade for sodium and 63 mV per decade for potassium—and stable output over 10 hours.In vivotesting showed reliable tracking of salivary ion levels (sodium: 5.7–9.1 mM; potassium: 4.2–5.2 mM), demonstrating the system's suitability for non-invasive, neonatal electrolyte monitoring.

Another example is the wearable mouthguard sensor developed by de Castroet al., which integrates microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) for salivary glucose and nitrite detection.213Fabricatedviacraft cutter printing, the μPADs feature two detection zones with colorimetric readouts and achieved low detection limits of 27 μmol L−1for glucose and 7 μmol L−1for nitrite. In clinical samples, the device reliably distinguished elevated glucose and nitrite levels in patients with diabetes and periodontitis, respectively. Its low cost, simplicity, and instrument-free operation make it a promising platform for accessible salivary diagnostics.

A representative example is the AI-assisted wearable microfluidic colorimetric sensor (AI-WMCS) introduced by Wanget al., which enables multi-analyte detection in tear fluid using smartphone-based image analysis.221The PDMS-based microfluidic patch detects vitamin C, pH, calcium ions, and proteins with minimal sample volume (∼20 μL), and integrates a cloud-based deep learning algorithm to automatically correct for ambient lighting and pH-induced signal variation. The system achieved excellent analytical performance (R2> 0.99 across targets), highlighting its potential for remote diagnostics and telehealth.

Building on the eye-conformal sensing paradigm, Shiet al.developed a fluorescent smart contact lens for real-time detection of glutathione (GSH), a key oxidative stress biomarker.222The device incorporates a coumarin-based probe within a laser-patterned microfluidic channel to autonomously collect tear fluid and transduce GSH concentrations through a reversible Michael addition reaction. Smartphone-assisted hue analysis allowed detection of physiological GSH levels (0.15–1.05 mM) with a sensitivity of 0.12 mM, and week-long stability testing confirmed biocompatibility for extended use.

Further expanding this class of diagnostic lenses, Moredduet al.demonstrated a microfluidic contact lens integrating paper-based colorimetric sensors for simultaneous detection of five tear biomarkers, including glucose, pH, proteins, nitrites, andl-ascorbic acid.223The poly(HEMA) lens design incorporates laser-inscribed microchannels to direct tear fluid (∼2 μL) toward embedded sensing zones, achieving sub-minute response times and clinically relevant detection limits (e.g., 1.1 mmol L−1for glucose). A smartphone app supports real-time image capture and analysis, underscoring the practicality of this platform for point-of-care ocular diagnostics.

Beyond diagnostics, microfluidic contact lenses also offer a promising avenue for ocular drug delivery.224Duet al.developed a pressure-triggered microfluidic contact lens that enables controlled release of ophthalmic drugs using a blink-driven micropump system (Fig. 5D).225Unlike traditional eye drops, which suffer from poor retention and low bioavailability, this lens incorporates an embedded microchannel network and a check valve that activates drug release in response to natural eyelid pressure. The device demonstrated the capability to store and release ∼3.5 μL of liquid from compartmentalized drug reservoirs, supporting both small- and large-molecule therapeutics. The PDMS-based design maintains lens comfort and oxygen permeability, establishing a soft and self-actuating drug delivery interface for chronic eye conditions. Collectively, tear-based microfluidic sensors and drug delivery systems represent a convergence of precision engineering, biocompatible materials, and user-centric design.

A landmark development is the VeCare platform introduced by Gaoet al., which integrates an immunosensor array with a biomimetic microfluidic collector inspired by the Texas horned lizard's skin (Fig. 5E).231The sawtooth-shaped capillary channels enable unidirectional flow of exudate, preventing reverse contamination and ensuring efficient delivery to sensing zones. The device enables multiplexed electrochemical detection of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1), pH, temperature, and bacterial load (S. aureus). Wireless data transmission to a smartphone interface supports remote wound evaluation, andin vivovalidation in both animal and clinical settings demonstrated high biocompatibility and responsiveness to wound state changes.

In another work, Zhenget al.developed the PETAL sensor—a battery-free, paper-based wound sensing platform integrating five colorimetric sensors for temperature, pH, moisture, uric acid, and trimethylamine (TMA).25Fabricated using wax-printed microfluidics, the system incorporates blood filtration and passive sampling layers to manage heterogeneous exudate. Smartphone-based imaging, combined with deep learning algorithms, enables automated classification of wound healing status with up to 97% accuracy. This low-cost, scalable design represents a major step toward low-cost, point-of-care wound diagnostics and early infection warning systems.

To enhance sensitivity and analytical resolution, Chenet al.introduced a dual-mode microfluidic chip combining electrochemical and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensing for interleukin-6 (IL-6), a critical inflammatory cytokine.232A square-wave micromixer improves antigen–antibody interaction kinetics, and outputs from both detection modes are fused using a neural network for high-fidelity quantification across a wide dynamic range (0.05–1000 pg mL−1). The system achieved detection limits as low as 0.047 pg mL−1(SERS) and 0.085 pg mL−1(EC), validated against ELISA using diabetic wound fluid. Such hybrid platforms enable granular profiling of wound inflammation, enabling proactive, data-driven interventions.

Among these fluids, urine remains the most extensively studied in clinical diagnostics due to its abundant volume and diagnostic versatility. It is widely used for detecting kidney diseases, urinary tract infections (UTIs), metabolic disorders, and monitoring hydration status.237Vaginal secretion and menstrual blood are increasingly recognized in clinical research for its potential to reflect bacterial vaginosis, endometrial health, hormonal fluctuations, iron deficiency, and markers associated with reproductive disorders and inflammatory conditions.235,238Their external accessibility and diagnostic relevance make genitourinary fluids ideal targets for wearable sensing technologies, although research in this area is still in its early stages.

One recent advance comes from Biet al., who introduced a universal fully integrated wearable sensor array (FIWSA) designed for simultaneous, noninvasive monitoring of electrolytes (Na+, pH) and metabolites (uric acid) across multiple raw biofluids—including sweat, saliva, and urine.240The system combines 3D carbon-based electrochemical sensors, microfluidic routing, and wireless telemetry within a single platform. In urine samples, it enabled accurate monitoring of sodium, pH, and uric acid levels, demonstrating utility for metabolic assessment and hydration tracking. While the proof-of-concept was validated in controlled environments, further optimization forin situurine capture—such as in smart diapers or wearable liners—remains a key translational step.

Expanding to women's health, Dosnonet al.introduced MenstruAI, an in-pad diagnostic platform for multiplexed biomarker detection in menstrual blood (Fig. 5F).236The multilayered microfluidic architecture incorporates plasma filtration and lateral flow immunoassay zones to detect markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA-125—relevant to inflammation, cancer, and endometriosis, respectively. The platform enables semi-quantitative readoutsvianaked-eye observation or smartphone imaging, with machine learning–assisted interpretation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of non-invasive, self-administered diagnostics for reproductive health and disease screening directly within menstrual hygiene products. Together, these advances highlight the transformative potential of genitourinary fluid microfluidics.

Implantable microfluidic devices are opening new avenues in precision medicine by enablingin vivofluid handling, sensing, and therapeutic delivery at the microscale. These miniaturized systems offer the potential for continuous physiological monitoring and localized treatment, enhancing targeting precision while improving patient compliance. In the following section, we examine representative applications across major biomedical domains, outlining key device types, clinical or research status, and notable studies.Table 4provides a consolidated overview of emerging implantable microfluidic systems and their translational progress.

A milestone in implantable drug delivery was the first human trial of a wireless microchip implant for drug delivery in 2012.245Their microfluidic chip as shown inFig. 6A, implanted subcutaneously in osteoporotic women, contained sealed reservoirs of parathyroid hormone that could be opened electronically to release precise doses on a programmed schedule. Over 4 months, the chip safely delivered daily doses with pharmacokinetics matching injections, improving bone formation markers without adverse events. Similarly, a drug-loaded micro-reservoir implant (∼6 mm diameter, ∼550 μm depth) was designed to enable magnetically actuated drug delivery, where deformation of an iron-oxide-doped PDMS membrane under a ∼200 mT magnetic field allowed precise and repeatable release.246Several platforms have demonstrated the power of localized, programmable drug delivery. One notable example is the wireless, magnetically actuated microfluidic pump developed for dental implants, which enables localized delivery up to 52 μL of antibiotics or regenerative agents directly at the bone-implant interface to promote osseointegration and prevent infections.173The pump integrates a magnetically (<65 mT) responsive valve system that allows external control of fluid release without the need for batteries or onboard electronics.

In a related advance, a self-powered implantable drug delivery system was demonstrated using a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to harvest biokinetic energy and drive an electrochemical microfluidic pump, achieving flow rates up to 40 μL min−1.247Inex vivostudies, this platform successfully delivered fluorescent particles into porcine eyes, offering a promising battery-free solution for chronic ocular drug therapies. Similarly, a swarm of autonomous untethered microinjectors was developed to penetrate the gastrointestinal epithelium and deliver insulin systemically in live ratsin vivo, as shown inFig. 6B.248Although transient, these devices exemplify how microfluidic architectures in such a tiny origami-based self-folding design can enable minimally invasive drug delivery to internal tissue just using body heat.

Thermally triggered systems offer another promising avenue for rapid therapeutic delivery. Elmanet al.proposed an implantable microfluidic device that used local heating to boil fluid inside a reservoir, bursting a brittle membrane to deliver drugs in emergency scenarios.249Such systems are particularly valuable for treatments requiring immediate intervention, such as acute cardiovascular or neurological crises. Another promising platform is a low-flow, implantable microfluidic pump that uses thermally actuated gallium phase-change material to deliver infusion rates ranging from 18 nL min−1to 104 nL min−1to sensitive tissues such as the eye, ear, and brain.250The system enables energy-efficient, periodic infusion at nanoliter-per-minute rates, making it well-suited for chronic therapeutic applications.

Microfluidic systems have also been employed in cancer therapy. An implantable drug-screening microdevice was developed to release microdoses of up to 16 different anticancer agents directly into tumor tissue, as shown inFig. 6C.251Following short-term exposure, the local tissue response to each drug was evaluated, enabling personalized therapy selection without subjecting the patient to systemic toxicity. Further advancements allowed multiplexed testing of immunotherapies in breast cancer models, demonstrating synergistic drug effects identified through localized microfluidic delivery. An electrochemically actuated implantable microfluidic device was developed featuring a single refillable PDMS reservoir and nano-sandwiched Pt/Ti electrodes, enabling programmable drug release at flow rates of 1 to 2.3 μL s−1under applied voltages of 5–9 V.252In vivostudies in Kunming mice confirmed excellent biocompatibility over 28 days and effective localized delivery of doxorubicin for pancreatic cancer treatment. An important clinical example of targeted drug delivery is the TAR-200 device, a novel implantable system designed for the sustained release of gemcitabine within the bladder lumen for the treatment of bladder cancer.253The device utilizes osmotic pressure to achieve controlled, continuous drug elution over several weeks, maintaining therapeutic drug concentrations at the target site while minimizing systemic exposure. By overcoming the limitations of traditional intravesical therapies, such as rapid drug washout, TAR-200 exemplifies the clinical potential of implantable microfluidic platforms for localized, long-term cancer treatment.

In the field of neuropharmacology, wireless soft optofluidic implants were developed integrating four microfluidic drug reservoirs, each independently controlled by microscale LEDs for precise drug release.254They demonstrated wireless optofluidic neural probes integrating ultrathin (∼80 μm) microfluidic channels and microscale LEDs (100 μm × 100 μm), achieving efficient wireless drug delivery (0.5 μL at ∼5.2 μL min−1) and photostimulation in freely behaving animals without significant brain tissue damage. These soft, battery-free devices enabled pharmacological and optical modulation of brain circuits in freely behaving animals, representing a powerful tool for studying behavior and developing therapies for neurological disorders. A lot of devices with combinations of neural interface with drug/chemical agents delivery have been shown by researchers, and we will cover more details in section 4.2.3 as these devices can have dual or more functionality.

Many implantable pumps provide incremental improvements in control, volume, or longevity. However, innovations like magnetically actuated refillable reservoirs, triboelectric-powered ocular implants, and thermally triggered burst devices represent transformative strategies. These eliminate batteries, enable remote actuation, and introduce autonomous or emergency-triggered delivery—broadening therapeutic use-cases and reducing surgical burden.

One of the most notable advances in this area is the development of bioartificial kidneys using implantable microfluidic filtration systems. An implantable renal assist device was developed incorporating 400 nm-thick polysilicon flat sheet membranes with 5–8 nm, 2 μm slit-shaped silicon nanopore membranes capable of size-selective filtration of waste products while retaining essential proteins and cells for up to 3–8 days.260The device mimics glomerular filtration and, when combined with a bioreactor of renal tubular cells, could replace both the filtration and reabsorption functions of the kidney as shown inFig. 6D. These devices utilize microfluidic architectures to achieve efficient solute clearance and electrolyte balance while minimizing blood flow resistance. Additionally, work by Humeset al.on renal assist devices has laid the groundwork for combining living cells with mechanical filtration.261Innovations such as dialysate regeneration loops, miniaturized closed-circuit designs, and urea removal strategies are now bringing fully implantable kidney replacements closer to clinical reality.262Such systems exemplify how microfluidic architectures can be leveraged to recreate complex organ-level functions within compact, implantable platforms.

While many microfluidic dialysis systems refine membrane performance or reduce footprint, implantable bioartificial organs that integrate living cellular components within microfluidic scaffolds mark a fundamental shift. These systems move beyond passive filtration toward dynamic tissue mimicry and biologically interactive function, setting a transformative precedent in organ replacement.

Implantable microfluidic systems have opened transformative avenues in both neuroscience research and clinical neurotechnology.271Platforms like the lab-on-a-brain developed by Takeharaet al.exemplify how implantable micro-optical fluidic devices can enable long-term two-photon imaging while locally delivering pharmacological agents into the brain.166By replacing part of the skull with an integrated device, these systems allow repeated chemical interventions at a rate of 10 μL min−1for 20 min and high-resolution imaging of neuronal structures (<1 μm), facilitating studies on synaptic plasticity, memory, and neurodegeneration. This minimally invasive approach preserves the natural microenvironment of the brain and reduces inflammation compared to traditional cannulation techniques.

Beyond imaging, flexible multifunctional probes that combine fluidics with optogenetics and electrophysiology have enabled advanced neural circuit interrogation. Fiber-based neural probes with feature sizes as small as 5 μm have been developed to enable simultaneous optical stimulation, localized drug delivery, and electrophysiological recording. These multifunctional probes are embedded within a soft, stretchable architecture, making them well-suited for chronic implantation and long-term neurophysiological studies.272Similarly, wireless optofluidic systems integrating micro-LEDs and fluidic drug reservoirs, as demonstrated by Jeonget al.and Qaziet al., have removed the need for tethered operation, enabling real-time programmable pharmacology and optogenetic stimulation in freely moving animals.254,273Qaziet al.demonstrated the wireless optofluidic probe system (Fig. 6E), weighing approximately 2 g and occupying 1260 mm3, reliably delivered 0.47 μL of fluid per activation within 12 seconds, while exerting minimal tissue pressure (∼0.77 kPa), ensuring safe chronic pharmacological interventions in freely moving mice.273These platforms allow complex behavioral experiments that require spatiotemporal control over neuronal populations, critical for studying reward, addiction, and mood regulation.

A major advance in implantable microfluidic design is represented by SU-8-based multi-site neural probes that combine high-resolution depth recordings with independent drug delivery channels. This platform enables precise administration of small drug volumes—from nanoliters to microliters—while simultaneously recording local field potentials and single-neuron activity.274Chemical neuromodulation has been further expanded through the development of multiplexed drug delivery platforms. In a similar context, a neural “chemtrode” was developed by integrating a 3-inlet staggered herringbone mixer (SHM) into a silicon microfluidic probe, enabling multiplexed delivery of neuroactive agents at dynamically tunable concentrations through a compact platform (Fig. 6F).275The system achieved rapid switching between drugs with a residence time of approximately 14 seconds and a total swept volume of only ∼66 nL, supporting real-time modulation of neural activity with minimal fluid burden on brain tissue.In vivoexperiments demonstrated controlled delivery of pilocarpine and tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the hippocampus, allowing reversible modulation of neuronal firing rates during a single implantation. In a related development, flexible penetrating microelectrode arrays (FPMAs) integrated with microfluidic cables were demonstrated to simultaneously record electrophysiological signals and deliver chemical agents.276In vivoexperiments demonstrated effective KCl infusion at a flow rate of 1.4 ± 0.15 μL min−1, resulting in an ∼80% increase in neural spiking activity across the electrode array, confirming the platform's utility for modulating brain activity with minimal tissue disruption offering a powerful method to study drug effects on brain networks and to bypass the blood–brain barrier for targeted therapies.

The integration of microfluidics with real-time optical monitoring technologies marks another major application domain. An integrated wireless microfluidic and fiber-photometry platform was introduced to enable simultaneous drug delivery and neural activity recordingviafluorescence-based indicators.277By coupling fluidic drug delivery with calcium, neurotransmitter, or neuromodulator imaging, these systems enable closed-loop experiments where the immediate biochemical and electrophysiological impacts of pharmacological interventions can be observedin vivo. This approach holds enormous potential for dissecting the real-time dynamics of neuromodulatory systems in behavior and disease.

Peripheral nervous system (PNS) applications have also benefited significantly from implantable microfluidics. Hydrogel-based soft agarose-filled microfluidic nerve cuffs have been developed to provide a self-folding, ion-conductive interface that enables safe delivery of direct current nerve blocks (above 75 μA), addressing the electrochemical and mechanical limitations of traditional metallic nerve cuffs.278Furthermore, Reederet al.introduced a soft, bioresorbable microfluidic device capable of reversible peripheral nerve conduction block through localized cooling as shown inFig. 6G.170The implant wraps around the nerve without sutures and delivers evaporative coolingviaperfluoro-pentane and dry nitrogen gas.In vivoexperiments in rats demonstrated a rapid cooling rate of 3 °C s−1, with nerve temperatures reaching as low as −1.4 °C and maintained near 3 °C for over 15 minutes. Acute trials showed a 92% reduction in electromyography (EMG) amplitude and a 7-fold increase in mechanical pain threshold, confirming effective analgesia without permanent tissue damage. The device bioresorbed safely within 20–50 days, highlighting its potential as a non-opioid, minimally invasive alternative for post-surgical and neuropathic pain management.

Beyond chemical and electrical modulation, dynamic structural control is also becoming possible. Notably, an inflatable spinal cord stimulator featuring microfluidic channels that allow the implant to expand into a wide paddle-like shape after insertion.279This design enables minimally invasive implantation while achieving broad coverage of the spinal cord, improving therapeutic efficacy for conditions like intractable back pain and muscle spasms. Outside the mammalian system, implantable microfluidics have been used in biohybrid robotics. One such system integrated electrical stimulation and microfluidic neurotransmitter delivery to modulate the flight behavior ofManduca sextamoths.280By combining electrical initiation of flight with chemical modulation of wing power, they achieved enhanced flight control and duration, highlighting the broad potential of microfluidic systems not only for biomedical applications but also for cyborg and environmental sensing platforms.

One notable area of advancement is pressure sensing within body cavities. Loet al.developed an implantable, refillable ocular drug delivery system that also incorporated pressure regulation features using microfluidics, illustrating the dual potential of therapeutic delivery and diagnostics within a single implant.286More recently, Jianget al.developed an implantable wireless microfluidic pressure sensor for non-invasive monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) using ultrasound imaging (Fig. 6H).287The sensor demonstrated a linear sensitivity of 42 kPa mm−1within physiological IAP ranges (0–12.6 kPa), with spatial resolution of 1.2 kPa/30 μm, and maintained functional integrity over 600 actuation cycles without leakage.Ex vivoexperiments confirmed accurate pressure readings through ∼15 mm of porcine skin, highlighting its potential for wireless, battery-free monitoring in critical care and surgical applications.

Expanding into orthopedic applications, a conformable microfluidic capacitive force sensor was developed and embedded in trial acetabular cups for hip replacement surgeries to enable real-time force measurement during implantation procedures.171These implants provide surgeons with real-time quantitative feedback on force distribution during joint placement accurately measured forces up to 400 N, significantly improving implant positioning accuracy into curved joint geometries without affecting function and reducing the risk of postoperative complications or early implant failure.

Additionally, researchers are exploring integration of biosensors with therapeutic implants to create smart closed-loop systems. For example, in the field of neuroengineering, an electrocorticography (ECoG) array was demonstrated with integrated microfluidic ion pumps, enabling simultaneous neural recording and localized pharmacological delivery.290Such multifunctional platforms blur the traditional boundaries between diagnostics and therapeutics, representing a major step toward fully autonomous, adaptive implants.

In summary, implantable microfluidic biosensors are redefining medical diagnostics by enabling continuous, real-time physiological monitoringin situ. As miniaturization, biocompatibility, and wireless readout technologies advance, these devices are poised to become essential tools not only for early disease detection but also for guiding dynamic, personalized therapeutic interventions.

Microfluidic platforms have emerged as transformative tools in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their ability to replicate complex biochemical and mechanical microenvironments. These systems enable fine control over nutrient delivery, waste removal, mechano-transduction, and spatial cell patterning—key factors in guiding tissue development and integration.291–294In this section, we highlight representative applications spanning bone, skin, and vascularized tissue regeneration to illustrate how implantable microfluidics can support diverse tissue types and repair strategies.

Mechanical stimulation is a fundamental principle in bone tissue engineering, as bone is a highly mechanosensitive tissue that remodels itself in response to mechanical cues.295Chenet al.leveraged this principle by designing an implantable, wireless, magnetically actuated microfluidic pump capable of generating controlled pressure fluctuations within the intramedullary cavity of long bones.162By modulating local fluid flow and inducing cyclic pressure changes, the device mimics the physiological mechanical environment experienced during normal skeletal loading, thereby promoting osteogenic activity without the need for pharmacological agents. This strategy directly targets mechanotransduction pathways to stimulate osteoblast proliferation and matrix mineralization, offering a microfluidic approach to enhancing bone regeneration. Furthermore, the system's wireless actuation and battery-free design minimize invasiveness and improve biocompatibility, making it a promising platform for long-term orthopedic implants aimed at treating bone loss disorders such as osteoporosis.

Implantable microfluidic platforms are revolutionizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine by offering precise control over the biochemical and mechanical environments essential for tissue development and function. Early strategies focused on flexible, thread-based microfluidic devices capable of embedding sensors and fluidic channels within 3D tissue architectures, allowing real-time monitoring and manipulation of physiological parametersin vivo.174These innovations provided a foundation for designing microfluidic scaffolds that intimately integrate with host tissues, enabling localized sensing, therapeutic delivery, and tissue remodeling.

Biomaterial innovation has been a critical driver in advancing implantable microfluidic scaffolds. Polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and natural hydrogels have been widely adopted to create biocompatible and functionalized scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix.296,297The integration of microfluidics with polymeric materials allows the fabrication of dynamic, biomimetic structures capable of guiding cellular growth, nutrient delivery, and waste removal. Notably, dynamically responsive hydrogel scaffolds were developed for skin flap regeneration, composed of MXene-incorporated poly(NIPAM) hydrogels that exhibited near-infrared (NIR)-responsive shrinkage. As shown inFig. 6I, the scaffolds achieved up to 55% volume reduction under 46 °C heating, facilitating cell infiltration and controlled VEGF release.298In vivomouse studies demonstrated that VEGF-loaded scaffolds under NIR irradiation significantly improved skin flap survival (reducing necrosis rates to 17.9% compared to 63.7% in controls), enhanced angiogenesis, decreased inflammation, and attenuated apoptosis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of microfluidically printed, stimulus-responsive implants.

Microfluidic technologies have catalyzed transformative advances in the development of wearable and implantable biomedical devices, enabling non-invasive monitoring, localized therapy, and personalized health management.31,106The integration of soft materials, miniaturized sensors, and scalable fabrication strategies has facilitated the realization of skin-conformal patches and implantable microsystems capable of direct interfacing with biological fluids.10,303Applications now span a broad range, including sweat-based fitness tracking, implantable drug delivery systems, biosensors for neurological monitoring, and microfluidic scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

For implantable systems, key barriers include long-term biocompatibility, immune responses, material degradation, and power autonomy.306Many current devices depend on external power supplies or rigid components, hindering miniaturization and patient comfort. Importantly, clinical translation faces regulatory constraints, including compliance with FDA regulations and ISO standards.307Most such devices are classified as Class III by the FDA, requiring rigorous Premarket Approval (PMA) that includes extensive evidence of biocompatibility (ISO 10993), manufacturing quality (ISO 13485), and electrical safety (IEC 60601-1). In addition to technical validation, manufacturers must also demonstrate long-term safety, sterility assurance, and reproducibility across patient populations. Furthermore, lack of established reimbursement codes and limited clinical familiarity with microfluidic systems can slow adoption, underscoring the need for collaborative engagement with regulatory agencies, clinicians, and health economists.

A particularly promising direction lies in the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms with microfluidic sensors to enable real-time, on-device data interpretation and predictive diagnostics.309–311Coupling such analytics with closed-loop control systems could usher in a new era of personalized therapy, allowing wearable or implantable devices to autonomously respond to changes in a patient's physiological state. Furthermore, scalable and modular manufacturing approaches—such as roll-to-roll printing, soft lithography, and 3D hybrid integration—will be essential for transitioning from benchtop prototypes to mass-producible and clinically deployable products.

Looking ahead, wearable and implantable microfluidic platforms are poised to play a central role in decentralized and precision healthcare. However, their success will depend not only on continued innovation in materials, electronics, and system integration, but also on early-stage alignment with regulatory requirements and clinical needs. Multidisciplinary collaboration among engineers, clinicians, regulators, and industry stakeholders will be vital to navigate the complex pathway from lab discovery to bedside adoption. With thoughtful design and translational foresight, these technologies have the potential to revolutionize disease monitoring, treatment personalization, and long-term health management.
