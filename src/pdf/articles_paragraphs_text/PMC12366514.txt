For patients with uraemia, the most effective treatment, aside from surgical interventions like kidney transplantation, is maintenance haemodialysis. First-time haemodialysis patients often lack an understanding of the treatment, making them susceptible to negative emotions such as anxiety and depression, as well as shifts in their perception of life’s meaning. This study aims to explore the sense of meaning in life experienced by patients undergoing their first session of haemodialysis.

This qualitative study employed purposive sampling to select 11 patients, followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews. The content analysis approach proposed by Graneheim and Lundman was employed to analyze the data.

Four main categories and ten subcategories emerged from the data. The categories included: (1) Experiencing shock and loss in life, (2) Longing for emotional and psychological support, (3) Adapting and adjusting to the sense of meaning in life, and (4) Growth and transcendencein the cognitive development of life’s meaning.

Patients new to haemodialysis often undergo a complex and dynamic process. Healthcare professionals should implement targeted strategies to assist these patients in adjusting and adapting to changes in their sense of life’s meaning.

Maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) is now a widely utilized life support system for patients with end-stage renal disease. Studies have estimated that the global number of patients requiring dialysis ranges from 4,902,000 to 7,083,000 (Junejo et al.,2025). MHD accounts for 89.4% of China’s dialysis population (Cho et al.,2021). According to the Chinese National Renal Data System (CNRDS), the number of haemodialysis patients continues to increase, with over 1 million patients currently receiving dialysis in mainland China. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by long-term structural and functional impairment of the kidneys, typically resulting from various aetiological factors, with kidney damage persisting for more than three months (Levey et al.,2020). According to statistics, the global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is approximately 10% (Jadoul et al.,2024), and there are about 84 million adult CKD patients in China (Wang et al.,2023). CKD is characterized by a high prevalence, low awareness rate, poor prognosis, and substantial medical costs. Following cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and malignant tumours, CKD has emerged as another major threat to human health (Xie et al.,2018). It has emerged as a significant global public health concern.

As CKD progresses to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), haemodialysis becomes one of the most commonly utilized renal replacement therapies (Levin et al.,2024). First-time patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis are often unfamiliar with the procedure, leading to psychological challenges such as anxiety, panic, and uncertainty about the future (Mesbahi et al.,2021). Consequently, there is an urgent need for effective coping strategies to address these concerns. Kidney transplantation and dialysis therapy are the primary treatment modalities for patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, due to the high cost of kidney transplantation, along with frequent issues such as organ shortages and incompatibility, dialysis therapy is more commonly utilized (Hellemans et al.,2020). Studies have shown that most haemodialysis patients experience symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus, anxiety, and depression, which can negatively affect their quality of life (Hiramatsu et al.,2020). Moreover, previous research has indicated that a sense of meaning in life is positively correlated with quality of life (Winger et al.,2016). Individuals with a stronger perceived sense of meaning in life tend to have a higher quality of life. The sense of meaning in life, as a predictor of psychological well-being, has been shown to alleviate feelings of helplessness and negative emotions, enhance treatment confidence, and improve life satisfaction, hope, happiness, and overall quality of life (Kim et al.,2024; Mutuyimana & Maercker,2024).

Haemodialysis, as a form of renal replacement therapy, is still associated with challenges such as lifelong treatment, high costs, and serious complications. These factors make it difficult for patients to maintain normal daily activities and employment, often leading to a range of negative emotions, including feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and social alienation (Brown et al.,2021; Lu et al.,2024). Furthermore, research has shown that the symptom burden experienced by dialysis patients can also contribute to anxiety and depression (Tam et al.,2025). Therefore, it is essential to pay close attention to the mental health status of haemodialysis patients. Additionally, a sense of meaning in life is closely related to individual well-being (Zegarra-López et al.,2025). The concept of “meaning in life” was first introduced by Austrian psychiatrist and psychologist Viktor (2001) in 1963. It refers to an individual’s perception of their own existential value, purpose, and significance, as well as their understanding of the essence of life. When individuals experience a crisis of meaning, it can lead to a disintegration of self-perception and worldview, potentially resulting in a range of psychological issues, including despair, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal tendencies (Gnall et al.,2023; Sun et al.,2022). Research suggests that major life-altering events, such as illness, can disrupt patients’ original life goals and sense of meaning, making them particularly vulnerable to feelings of helplessness, aimlessness, and meaninglessness, as well as a profound loss of hope (Rambod et al.,2023). However, having a sense of meaning in life can provide individuals with purpose and value, allowing them to adjust their cognitive responses to stress, foster positive emotions, and ultimately protect their mental well-being.

Research indicates that the sense of meaning in life among haemodialysis patients varies to some extent across different countries, regions, and cultural backgrounds, with a predominantly pessimistic attitude towards life meaning (Liu & Mao,2022). However, it is important to note that current research on meaning in life within this population predominantly relies on quantitative methods (L. Y. Hsieh & Lin,2009; Lee & Yoonjin,2021), which may not fully capture the intrinsic nature of the experience. The discussion on the sense of meaning in life among dialysis patients has been largely limited to those who have undergone long-term haemodialysis. For first-time maintenance haemodialysis patients, the challenges are particularly pronounced, as they must not only cope with the physical suffering caused by their illness but also adapt to a new treatment modality, which places significant physical and psychological burdens on them (Fradelos,2021). Therefore, qualitative research aimed at exploring these patients’ perceptions of meaning in life is essential. Qualitative research methods can be employed to investigate the sense of meaning in life among haemodialysis patients, which is helpful for gaining a better understanding of their current situation and needs regarding life meaning. This study seeks to systematically describe the experiences of meaning in life among Chinese end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients during their initial haemodialysis sessions and identify the challenges they face. The findings are expected to offer new insights for improving meaning in life and enhancing the overall quality of life for dialysis patients.

This study employed a qualitative design with a content analysis approach. Content analysis focuses on understanding the lived experiences, interpretations, and meanings that individuals encounter. This method is particularly useful in studies aimed at explaining a phenomenon, especially when existing theories or research literature on the subject are limited. Content analysis allows for in-depth exploration of the phenomenon, providing rich insights into the participants’ perspectives (H. F. Hsieh & Shannon,2005).

This study was conducted at a blood purification centre in China. The study participants consisted of 11 adult patients (both male and female) aged 18 years and older, selected through purposive sampling. The inclusion criteria were as follows: the ability to communicate fluently in Chinese, being a first-time haemodialysis patient (including those with a history of peritoneal dialysis), and being over 18 years of age. Patients with severe complications were excluded from the study. The face-to-face interviews will be conducted following standard ethical protocols. Prior to each interview, participants will be informed about the study’s purpose and asked to voluntarily participate. Of the 25 eligible patients invited to participate, 11 agreed. Two patients were interviewed twice. No participants withdrew from the study during the process. Therefore, 13 interviews were included in the data analysis. All individuals who agreed to participate were required to sign a paper-based informed consent form to formally confirm their participation. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Data for this study were collected through semi-structured interviews, supplemented by observational methods and field notes. The data collection process spanned one and a half months, with all interviews conducted in Chinese by the authors. The interviews were initiated one hour after the patients had started dialysis and once their condition had stabilized. All interviews were conducted by the first author, who had substantial experience in qualitative research. The interviews began with open-ended questions, such as: (1) “How would you define the sense of meaning in life?” (2) “How has haemodialysis affected your sense of meaning in life? Can you describe the changes in your psychological state and daily life in more detail?” (3) “After starting dialysis, what things have become more important to you? What things seem less important now?” (4) “During your adjustment to dialysis, have certain people or experiences made you feel that life still has meaning? Are there any factors (such as physical discomfort or emotional fluctuations) that have weakened your sense of meaning in life?” (5) “What kind of support do you think could help dialysis patients find meaning in life?” Subsequently, probing questions were asked (see supplementary file). One pilot interview was conducted to identify any necessary adaptations to the interview guide. The face-to-face interviews were conducted individually at the patients’ bedside during their haemodialysis sessions, with each interview lasting 20–40 minutes. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim immediately after completion. The study employed a “data collection and analysis in parallel” approach. Data analysis was conducted concurrently with data collection by all four researchers. The specific workflow involved analysing each participant’s interview data before proceeding to the next interview.

Qualitative content analysis was employed in this study, facilitated by NVIVO 12.0 software, to systematically analyse both manifest and latent content. At present, there is limited theoretical and empirical literature on the sense of meaning in life among patients undergoing haemodialysis. This study employed the traditional content analysis method to analyse the interview data. The data analysis procedure followed these steps: (1) documenting the entire interview immediately after each session; (2) reading the complete interview transcript to gain a general understanding of its content; (3) identifying meaning units and primary codes; (4) categorizing similar primary codes into more comprehensive categories; and (5) determining latent content within the data. Accordingly, semantic units (words and paragraphs that contained interrelated aspects) were first derived from the participants’narratives. Subsequently, codes were extracted from the meaning units. The codes were organized into subcategories, and similar subcategories were grouped into overarching categories (Graneheim & Lundman,2004).

To ensure the rigour of the study and validate the results, we utilized naturalistic inquiry to guide the qualitative description, focusing on credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability (Ann Cutler et al.,2021). To enhance the credibility of the data, the researchers carefully listened to the interviews, immersed themselves in the data, selected a diverse sample of patients, and conducted the interviews in settings where participants felt comfortable. To ensure confirmability, the second and third authors of this study reviewed the extracted notes and codes, and an external researcher with expertise in qualitative research was also consulted. To verify the dependability and transferability of the findings, we meticulously documented and reported each step and process of the research. The participants were chosen to represent diversity in age and gender, which not only ensured dependability but also contributed to the transferability of the findings.

The characteristics of the study participants (N= 11) are provided inTables I and II. The participants included 6 men and 5 women, with ages ranging from 30 to 71 years (mean age = 50.4 years). In terms of education, 4 participants had completed primary or lower education, 1 had completed junior high school, 1 had completed senior high school, and 5 had obtained a university degree or higher. General information on the interviewees is presented inTable I.

The transition from health to illness, coupled with the shift from freedom to dependence on dialysis machines, often evokes intense feelings of loss and helplessness in patients. One participant reflected, “My life took a drastic turn after the doctor informed me that I needed to begin dialysis” (p.1). Another stated, “Why did it have to be me?” (p3). One patient expressed frustration with the restrictions imposed by dialysis: “I yearn for freedom, yet my life is bound by dialysis. I can’t venture far—the furthest I go is the outskirts of Zhengzhou, always rushing back within two days for treatment” (p10). A sense of confusion and overwhelm was conveyed by another participant: “I don’t know how to describe what I’m feeling, but right now, I just feel overwhelmed and lost” (p9).

The side effects of dialysis, such as fatigue and loss of appetite, along with the physical toll of the disease itself, gradually erode patients’ sense of self-worth and control over their lives. One participant shared,“I was a total gym rat before—never missed a week. Now? I can’t even budge the weights I used to throw around” (p3). Another stated,“My freedom is gone” (p4). One participant described the overwhelming fatigue following dialysis:“After dialysis, I feel completely drained. I had planned to go for a walk tonight, but now all I want to do is lie in bed and rest” (p6).

Concerns regarding disease progression, treatment outcomes, and life expectancy can trigger anxiety and fear, deeply affecting a patient’s sense of meaning in life. One participant expressed, “I don’t know how to face the future” (p4). Another shared the feeling of losing purpose:“After I got sick, my family wouldn’t even let me sweep the floor. It feels like my life has lost all meaning” (p7). A participant voiced the uncertainty about their remaining time:“I don’t know how much longer I have to live, but there are still so many things I want to do—I want to travel, to try things I’ve never done before…”(p10).

Patients undergoing their first dialysis treatment often experience feelings of helplessness due to the drastic changes in their treatment regimen. During this time, they particularly yearn for emotional support from family and friends. One participant shared,“My husband is working hard to cover the medical bills, which are pretty steep. Since my daughter works out of town and can’t come home, we video chat daily to stay connected. Being with my family is what makes life meaningful to me” (p4). Another participant reflected on the isolation of their age:“At my age, all my friends are still busy working—it’s hard to even find someone to talk to. If I could go back to those days of playing with friends, life would feel more meaningful than it does now” (p9). One participant expressed the sense of overwhelming busyness in the family:“My family members are all swamped” (p11).

The need for haemodialysis treatment signals that conventional therapies are no longer sufficient, making renal replacement options, such as kidney transplantation, essential. At this critical juncture, patients urgently seek to discuss treatment plans with their healthcare providers. One participant recalled,“I remember the doctor telling me I could have a kidney transplant—this feels like my only hope of regaining meaning in life” (p1). Another participant inquired,“Could you tell me when the doctor in charge will arrive?” (p7). One patient emphasized the importance of understanding the treatment process:“I need to understand how long hemodialysis treatment will last and what potential side effects it may have—these answers are crucial to my understanding of life itself” (p9).

When life’s priorities suddenly change, patients often begin to reflect on what truly matters to them, leading them to adjust their life goals and values. This shift often results in a greater emphasis on family, friends, or spiritual pursuits. One participant shared,“You know what? My wife and I rented a place near the hospital. Our happiest moments are our evening walks together. I just want to cherish every extra day I can spend with her” (p5). Another reflected on a shift in values:“I used to think social status and earning more money were what made life meaningful. Now, just living longer is the most important thing to me” (p6). One participant also described a shift in perspective on simple pleasures:“I used to think parks were so boring, but yesterday at the neighborhood park, I suddenly realized sunshine and grass can actually be pretty nice” (p9).

Despite the challenges, patients often strive to find joy and meaning in their daily lives by cultivating new hobbies or engaging in social activities. One participant shared,“During dialysis, when I’m stuck in bed for hours, I kept thinking—what can I do to take my mind off this? Then I started listening to audiobooks” (p1). Another expressed a desire to contribute to others:“After coming home from evening dialysis, I feel this emptiness inside. I’ve been wondering what else I can do—do you think I could volunteer in our community?” (p4).

Following illness and treatment, patients often experience a deeper existential awareness, leading to an enhanced appreciation for the present and renewed motivation in daily living. One participant reflected,“I’m sixty now. Sometimes when I look at old photos and reflect on my life, I feel some regrets, but I also realize every experience held its own meaning” (p2). Another shared,“The older generation avoided talking about death, but now I need to start making plans” (p5). One participant expressed a shift in their understanding of life’s priorities:“What really matters in life? What gives it meaning? Now I believe nothing is more important than being healthy and alive” (p6). Another noted a change in perspective:“I used to constantly worry about things that hadn’t even happened. After getting sick, I now feel like every new day is a bonus” (p9).

After overcoming the challenges of illness, patients often discover inner resilience, which leads to enhanced self-confidence and self-efficacy. One participant shared,“The doctor told me to limit my water intake. It’s hard to stick to, but I’m not sure if it’s just in my head—today I drank less and actually feel a bit better” (p2). Another expressed a sense of empowerment:“This is undoubtedly a challenging period for me, but I believe overcoming it will make future obstacles pale in comparison” (p5). One participant reflected on the transformative nature of dialysis:“The diagnosis felt like an ending, but dialysis offered an unexpected second life” (p11).

Several patients exhibit compensatory altruism by assisting more severely affected wardmates through experience-sharing and community initiatives, which in turn enhances their sense of purpose and self-validation. One participant shared,“I’ve done peritoneal dialysis before, so I’m pretty familiar with the dietary do’s and don’ts. When the nurse asked if I could share with others, it actually gave me a real sense of accomplishment” (p5). Another participant reflected on a meaningful act of kindness:“Yesterday, an 11-year-old girl was crying so heartbreakingly. I showed her the drawings my granddaughter made for me. That became the most meaningful thing I did all day” (p11).

The research results indicate that patients undergoing haemodialysis for the first time have a dual perception of the meaning of life and exhibit a strong desire for assistance. At the same time, after re-examining their sense of meaning in life, these patients develop new insights into life and death and begin to seek spiritual growth and renewal.

This study found that the experience of meaning in life exhibits duality: younger patients more frequently expressed feelings of “unfairness,” anger, and death anxiety, while older patients tended to adopt a “resignation” framework. This paradoxical experience can be explained by Life Course Theory, which posits that life stages are characterized by timing (Elder,1998). According to this theory, younger individuals experience a more significant psychological impact from crisis events compared to older adults (Weiss et al.,2022). This finding is consistent with existing research. A systematic review on young adults’ perceptions of kidney failure revealed that crisis events significantly affect their appearance, academic pursuits, and career development (Bailey et al.,2018). In contrast, a qualitative study on elderly patients’ experiences with kidney transplantation found that most participants viewed their advanced age as a protective factor (Kimberly & Bowers,2023). Additionally, this study highlights the uniqueness of first-time dialysis as a “turning point event” in life, with patients describing it as a “rebirth” or a “loss of freedom.” This heightened sense of transformation may stem from the uncertainty about the future that arises when disease trajectories shift (Scherer et al.,2021). These differences suggest that both age and disease stage significantly influence patients’ perceptions of meaning in life. As a result, healthcare professionals should assess patients’ psychological needs through an individualized, life-course-informed approach, taking into account their developmental tasks at various life stages.

The findings of this study indicate that the sense of meaning in life among first-time haemodialysis patients is closely associated with social support. Social support is a complex and dynamic process that involves various forms of assistance individuals receive from multiple sources. Among these, family and friends play a particularly significant role in shaping and sustaining one’s sense of meaning in life (2022). Research has shown that when individuals experience social exclusion, they tend to focus more on the present moment, which may reduce their capacity for delayed gratification and further diminish their sense of meaning in life (Williams & Nida,2022). Dameron and Goeke-Morey (2023) found that individuals raised in emotionally supportive family environments tend to exhibit a stronger sense of meaning in life in adulthood, compared to those from emotionally detached backgrounds. Additionally, social support has been shown to significantly influence life expectancy and self-worth in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients (Alexopoulou et al.,2016). Although there is currently a lack of quantitative studies directly examining the relationship between social support and meaning in life in dialysis patients, the results of this study suggest that the level of social support significantly impacts the degree to which these patients perceive meaning in life.

The findings of this study reveal that patients’ desire for professional assistance stems not only from technical needs related to disease management but, more profoundly, reflects existential yearnings when confronted with human vulnerability. First, professional help serves as a bridge for cognitive reframing. Healthcare providers’ expert explanations enable patients to transform unfamiliar medical procedures into comprehensible survival strategies. This cognitive shift grants patients an “interpretive sense of control”—psychological stability achieved through understanding treatment rationales, thereby restoring their ability to anticipate life trajectories. A study demonstrated that a three-phase communication model could effectively alleviate emotional distress in cancer patients (Dean & Street,2014), fostering tranquillity. Second, professional interactions provide existential validation. Through the treatment process, medical staff demonstrate respect for patients’ subjectivity. Their communication reinforces the patients’ sense that “human dignity remains intact despite illness,” counteracting identity crises triggered by organ dysfunction. Research indicates that most patients desire healthcare professionals to pay greater attention to their personhood (Engel et al.,2023; Melis et al.,2021). Finally, professional guidance cultivates adaptive hope. Clinicians help patients break down the extended dialysis journey into achievable short-term goals. This restructuring fosters “processual meaning”—discovering controllable micro-victories within the context of irreversible disease progression, thereby forming realistic resilience. A systematic review found associations between goal-setting and health outcomes in chronic illness (Tabaei- Aghdaei et al.,2023). Studies also show that cancer patients’ hope correlates with illness expectations shaped through professional communication (Loučka et al.,2024). This medical humanism practice echoes Frankl’s logotherapy: even in the direst circumstances, individuals can discover specific meanings in life through professional guidance.

Findings from this study reveal that first-time haemodialysis patients develop a deeper understanding of life and self. First, patients’ perceptions of life shift from being “taken-for-granted” to being “finite yet precious.” Many participants reported cherishing even the mundane joys—family time, pain-free moments, or an enhanced awareness of natural elements like sunlight and air. This transformation reflects Heidegger’s philosophical concept of “Being-towards-death” (Gullick & West,2020)—confronting mortality paradoxically sharpens the authenticity of existence. Second, patients experience an awakening of death awareness. Given China’s cultural particularity, death education remains largely taboo (Shu et al.,2023). However, disease progression forces patients to confront their mortality. They begin to integrate death as part of life’s continuum, prioritizing the quality of present life and spiritual fulfilment. This mirrors the “awakening experience” in existential psychology, where awareness of mortality catalyses deeper value-seeking. Studies confirm that death anxiety inversely correlates with meaning in life (Yu et al.,2022). Finally, patients exhibit enhanced altruistic motivation, shifting from self-focus to empathetic helping. Many patients voluntarily share experiences, offer peer support, or join patient-led groups. This aligns with Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) theory (Li et al.,2025), wherein adversity fosters empathy, stronger social bonds, and renewed meaning. Research shows that such altruism not only benefits others but also reinforces patients’ self-worth, creating a psychological anchor amidst illness Sterie et al. (2024); Moshiri and Moshiri (2021). Healthcare providers should not only focus on disease management but also prioritize patients’ meaning-making processes. Through psychological support, peer-assisted care, and meaning-oriented communication, healthcare providers can help patients experience the depth and value of life, even amidst illness.

Relevant studies have shown that the sense of meaning in life can be divided into two dimensions: the meaning of existence and the meaning of pursuit (Brandstätter et al.,2012). In this study, it was observed that patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing their first haemodialysis tended to exhibit a greater orientation towards the pursuit dimension. This tendency may be attributed to the sense of unease caused by the sudden change in their life trajectory. In addition, while most individuals hold a rather complex definition of the meaning of life (Miao et al.,2025), patients undergoing dialysis tend to have a simpler understanding of life’s meaning and are more inclined to cherish the present moment.

This study has several limitations. First, due to a lack of security among first-time haemodialysis patients and their shyness in expressing themselves, more than half of the eligible patients declined to participate in the interviews. This may have resulted in self-selection bias, with only more motivated patients being included, potentially influencing the findings. Second, the sampling was restricted to a single hospital, which limits the generalizability of the results. In the future, multi-centre qualitative research could be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the sense of meaning in life among dialysis patients. Finally, there was relatively little discussion on the definition of life meaning. Future research should adopt a mixed-method approach to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of how dialysis patients define their sense of life meaning.

This study reveals that first-time haemodialysis patients experience significant uncertainty about the future due to sudden changes in their life trajectory, while also demonstrating a dualistic pattern in meaning-making across age groups. Patients develop new perspectives on life and death, with some exhibiting enhanced altruism. Additionally, they express a strong need for support from family, friends, and healthcare providers. Therefore, it is necessary to develop educational programmes focused on promoting positive and constructive coping strategies to enhance the sense of meaning in life. Additionally, the roles of healthcare providers and family support should be emphasized, which may include approaches such as peer education and online expert lectures. In future research, it is recommended to incorporate these components into intervention methods. A mixed-method approach can also be adopted to gain a deeper understanding of patients’ needs related to their sense of meaning in life.
