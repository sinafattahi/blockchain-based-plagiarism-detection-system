The lung ultrasound (LUS) score is a semi-quantitative tool used to predict clinical outcomes in conditions such as congestive heart failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, its role in pneumonia remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the LUS score is associated with the need for intubation within 72 h of emergency department (ED) presentation.

This prospective observational study enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) who were diagnosed with pneumonia in the ED. The LUS score was calculated by summing findings from 12 thoracic regions. We then examined the relationship between the total LUS score and the need for endotracheal intubation (ETI).

Forty-five patients were included. The median LUS score was 13.0 (IQR: 5.5‒19.0). Patients who required ETI had a significantly higher median LUS score (19.0, IQR: 17.0‒26.0) compared with those who did not require ETI (12.0, IQR: 4.25‒18.0;P= 0.002). The LUS score demonstrated strong predictive ability for ETI, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71‒0.95). The optimal cutoff value of 16 yielded a sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 69.4%, positive predictive value of 42.1%, and negative predictive value of 96.2%. Higher LUS scores were significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality (P= 0.04).

Among patients with pneumonia presenting to the ED, the LUS score was associated with the need for ETI and was linked to higher 28-day mortality.

This study was registered in Thai clinical trial registry (TCTR20230518003) on May 18, 2023.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) has become an alternative tool for diagnosing patients presenting with dyspnea in the emergency department (ED), particularly in cases of pneumonia and acute heart failure [1]. Moreover, LUS has also been used to predict disease severity and to monitor treatment progress in conditions such as congestive heart failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome [2,3].

The semi-quantitative LUS score was developed based on the concept of diminished lung aeration. It has been applied in various clinical settings. In the pediatric setting, studies have shown that an increased LUS score can predict the need for respiratory support in newborns and children with respiratory conditions [4,5].

In adults, the usefulness of the LUS score has been reported in multiple conditions. A meta-analysis in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated a significant association between higher LUS scores and in-hospital mortality [6]. Another study showed that the LUS score can predict hospital readmission among patients with acute heart failure [7]. Furthermore, in COVID-19, the LUS score has proven to be a strong predictor of disease severity and mortality [8].

Pneumonia is a common respiratory disorder that often leads to respiratory failure, resulting in higher mortality. Many clinical predictors have been developed to estimate mortality in pneumonia [9]. However, data on LUS scores in pneumonia are scarce, particularly with regard to patient outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether the LUS score is associated with the need for endotracheal intubation (ETI) in patients with pneumonia.

We conducted a prospective study at a single-center, non-trauma emergency department of a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, between May 2023 and September 2024. The ED has an annual volume of approximately 15,000 non-trauma visits. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board.

Patients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old and had a diagnosis of pneumonia. We excluded individuals who were pregnant, had COVID-19 pneumonia, interstitial lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis), or congestive heart failure, or had a do-not-attempt-resuscitation order. Patients who required ETI, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula at ED arrival were also excluded.

The primary outcome was to assess the relationship between the LUS score and the need for ETI within 72 h of ED arrival. The secondary outcomes were determining the optimal LUS cutoff for predicting 72-hour ETI, examining the association between LUS score and the need for any form of respiratory support (ETI, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula) within 72 h, and evaluating the relationships between LUS score and 28-day mortality, as well as length of hospital stay.

We collected baseline characteristics and recorded the form of respiratory support (if any) required within 72 h of ED arrival. We also documented 28-day mortality and length of hospital stay. A radiologist interpreted the chest X-ray, and the ultrasound operators were blinded to both the chest X-ray findings and laboratory results. The decision to administer respiratory support was made by the attending physicians.

Pneumonia was diagnosed by the attending physician if the patient presented with an acute lower respiratory tract symptom, such as fever, sputum production, breathlessness, or chest discomfort, with positive signs on physical examination and had imaging evidence of a new infiltration on chest X-ray [10].

Two emergency physicians and two emergency medicine residents, each with experience in more than 50 LUS scans, performed the ultrasound assessments. Prior to patient enrollment, all four operators were trained to rate the LUS score by viewing 50 standardized LUS video clips. The ultrasound machine used was the GE Venue (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). All scans were recorded on video.

Patients were placed in a supine or semi-recumbent position for anterior and lateral chest imaging. They were then positioned in a decubitus posture to scan both posterior hemithoraces. Each hemithorax was divided into six scanning regions [11]. A transverse line at the fifth intercostal space divided each hemithorax into superior and inferior sections, while parasternal, anterior axillary, and posterior axillary lines demarcated the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions, respectively (Fig.1).

Operators identified the worst ultrasound finding in each of the 12 total regions (six per hemithorax). Each region was assigned a score from 0 to 3 based on the degree of lung aeration loss. A score of 0 indicated normal aeration (A-lines or up to two B-lines per intercostal space). A score of 1 indicated more than two B-lines per intercostal space. A score of 2 indicated coalescent B-lines or “white lung,” and a score of 3 indicated consolidation or pleural effusion(Fig.2). The final LUS score was the sum across all 12 regions, yielding a maximum possible score of 36 [3,7].

For inter-rater reliability, 20 recorded video clips were randomly selected and re-scored by the four operators. Their ratings were then analyzed to assess consistency.

According to a pilot study [12], the mean LUS scores for patients who required intubation (ETI group) and those who did not (non-ETI group) were 20 ± 4.8 and 14.4 ± 9, respectively. Using a two-sided alpha of 0.05, a power of 80%, a mean difference of 6, standard deviations of 5 and 9, and an ETI-to-non-ETI ratio of 1:2, the required sample size was calculated to be 45 patients.

We presented baseline characteristics as means with standard deviations or medians (interquartile ranges), as appropriate. An unpairedt-test or the Mann‒WhitneyUtest was applied for continuous variables, whereas the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimal LUS score cutoff to predict the need for ETI within 72 h. We also applied ROC curves to identify the best threshold for predicting other forms of respiratory support (ETI, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula).

We used Spearman’s rank correlation to assess the relationship between the LUS score and length of hospital stay. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient.

Between May 2023 and September 2024, a total of 55 patients with clinically suspected pneumonia were evaluated upon admission to the ED. Ten patients were excluded, leaving 45 participants for final analysis (Fig.3).

Of the 45 enrolled patients, 53% were male. The mean age was 71 ± 15 years. All patients were diagnosed pneumonia by CXR. Additional baseline characteristics, vital signs, biomarkers, and treatment details are shown in Table1. The median time from ED arrival to ultrasound examination was 103 min (IQR: 57.5‒141).

Overall, the median LUS score was 13.0 (IQR: 5.5‒19.0). Among patients who required ETI within 72 h, the median LUS score was 19.0 (IQR: 17.0‒26.0). In contrast, those who did not require ETI had a median LUS score of 12.0 (IQR: 4.25‒18.0). Inter-rater reliability among the four ultrasound operators was good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.83). Higher LUS scores were significantly associated with 72-hour ETI (P= 0.002). The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for predicting ETI was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71‒0.95; Fig.4). The optimal LUS cutoff value was 16, yielding a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI: 51.8‒99.7), specificity of 69.4% (95% CI: 51.9‒83.7), positive predictive value (PPV) of 42.1% (95% CI: 29.7‒55.6), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.2% (95% CI: 79.6‒99.4).

Patients who required any form of respiratory support (ETI, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula) within 72 h had a median LUS score of 18.0 (IQR: 12.0‒21.0), whereas those who did not require respiratory support had a median score of 10.0 (IQR: 3.0‒16.8). The difference was statistically significant (P= 0.006). The AUROC for predicting any respiratory support was 0.742 (95% CI: 0.60‒0.89; Fig.5). The optimal cutoff for the LUS score was 13, providing a sensitivity of 73.7% (95% CI: 48.8‒90.9), specificity of 65.4% (95% CI: 44.3‒82.8), PPV of 60.9% (95% CI: 46.2‒73.8), and NPV of 77.3% (95% CI: 60.4‒88.4).

Two patients (4%) died within 28 days. The median LUS score for these two patients was 26.0, whereas survivors had a median score of 12.0 (IQR: 5.0‒19.0). There was a significant association between higher LUS scores and 28-day mortality (P= 0.04).

The median length of hospital stay was 6.7 days (IQR: 3.1‒12.1). The correlation between length of stay and LUS score was weak, with a Spearman’s rank coefficient of 0.46.

Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics and provision of respiratory support in cases of respiratory failure are crucial for managing pneumonia. Delayed mechanical ventilation in pneumonia patients who develop respiratory distress can lead to increased mortality [13]. Therefore, predictive tools that can identify the need for early mechanical ventilation are essential to improve clinical outcomes.

This study is the first to evaluate the utility of the LUS score for predicting clinical outcomes in non‒COVID-19 pneumonia. Our results indicate that the LUS score demonstrates high accuracy in forecasting the need for mechanical ventilation among this patient population.

Our findings align with previous research showing that the LUS score can predict the need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia [14–17]. In patients with heart failure, the LUS score has also been used to guide ED disposition [7]. Additionally, it has been associated with mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome [6]. In pediatric populations, the LUS score has been shown to predict extubation failure in newborns [18] and to guide surfactant therapy in preterm infants [19,20].

We found that a cutoff value of ≥ 16 points for the LUS score could predict the need for ETI. This threshold is similar to a previously reported cutoff (> 15 points) associated with poor outcomes, including mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia [17]. However, our sample size was relatively small; thus, larger studies are needed to validate this proposed cutoff.

Several limitations should be noted. First, this was a single-center study, and the study population had a predominantly low BMI compared to non-Asian populations, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Second, the low mortality rate in our cohort constrained our ability to identify an optimal LUS cutoff for mortality. Third, participant enrollment relied on a convenience sampling design, introducing potential selection bias when operators were unavailable. Fourth, our relatively small sample size limited the ability to perform multivariable adjustments, leaving potential confounding factors—such as the lower oxygenation observed in the ETI group. Future studies with larger patient populations and systematic enrollment are warranted to confirm our results and refine the LUS score’s clinical utility.

In patients with pneumonia, higher LUS scores were significantly associated with the need for ETI.
