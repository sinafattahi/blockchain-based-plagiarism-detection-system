Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While microvascular decompression (MVD) is well established for classic TN, its role in idiopathic cases remains controversial due to the absence of an identifiable neurovascular conflict and lack of clear anatomical target. New strategies are needed to address this challenging patient population.

Six patients with idiopathic TN underwent MVD with a Teflon wrap placed around the trigeminal nerve. All had undergone high-resolution MRI (CISS or FIESTA sequence), and intraoperative exploration was negative for a neurovascular conflict. Intraoperative trigeminal-hypoglossal reflex (THR) monitoring was used as a functional marker of decompression. All patients exhibited intact THR at baseline and complete loss of THR after wrap placement, indicating adequate decompression. Preoperative Barrow Neurological Institute pain scores (BNI-PSs) ranged from III to V. Five patients achieved sustained pain relief (BNI-PS of 0 or I) by postoperative day 1. One patient experienced delayed improvement but progressed from BNI-PS IV to 0 by 6 months. All patients remained pain free at 18 months.

A Teflon wrap technique with intraoperative THR monitoring may represent a safe and effective surgical option for idiopathic TN. By addressing potential biomechanical or dynamic nerve dysfunction, this approach offers meaningful pain relief even in the absence of a visible vascular conflict.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a debilitating facial pain disorder characterized by recurrent, paroxysmal shock-like pain in one or more distributions of the trigeminal nerve, often triggered by innocuous stimuli.1Most cases are attributed to neurovascular compression at the root entry zone (REZ)2or secondary causes such as space-occupying lesions or multiple sclerosis.3,–,5However, a subset of patients present with idiopathic TN, in which no structural lesion or vascular conflict is identified despite advanced neuroimaging and intraoperative exploration.6The pathophysiology of idiopathic TN remains incompletely understood, although hypotheses include occult microscopic vascular compression,7circumferential arachnoid adhesions altering nerve biomechanics with possible tethering,8,9focal demyelination, axonal loss even in the absence of a neurovascular conflict,4or central hyperexcitability.10This mechanistic uncertainty complicates treatment decisions for this patient population.

Microvascular decompression (MVD), the gold-standard surgical treatment for classic TN with vascular compression, has demonstrated long-term efficacy in > 70% of appropriately selected cases.11However, its role in idiopathic TN remains controversial due to the lack of a neurovascular conflict. When first-line pharmacological treatment fails, interventions such as trigeminal rhizotomy, rhizolysis, intrafascicular neurolysis, and Gamma Knife radiosurgery12,13are offered. However, these techniques are associated with an increased incidence of trigeminal dysesthesias, corneal anesthesia, and masticatory weakness.14Moreover, the efficacy of these procedures tends to diminish with repeated treatments. Xu-Hui et al. reported recurrence rates of up to 35%, with most patients experiencing recurrence in the first 5 years and necessitating further intervention.15This therapeutic gap leaves many patients with idiopathic TN vulnerable to progressive, refractory facial pain, highlighting the need for alternative treatment options that can provide durable relief without sacrificing trigeminal nerve function.

We propose the use of a trigeminal nerve wrap technique with Teflon for nerve stabilization in patients, even in the absence of a neurovascular conflict, which we theorize may provide pain relief by mitigating dynamic compression or altering nerve biomechanisms. When combined with intraoperative trigeminal-hypoglossal reflex (THR) monitoring as an objective decompression marker, this technique emerges as a promising surgical alternative for medication-refractory idiopathic TN.

To contextualize our findings, we provide a comparative summary (Table 1) of reported outcomes across established treatment modalities for idiopathic TN.

* Outcomes for the Teflon wrap technique are based on the present study cohort (n = 6); long-term follow-up is ongoing.

Patients with idiopathic TN who demonstrated no evidence of a neurovascular conflict on neuroimaging and negative intraoperative exploration underwent MVD with the Teflon wrap technique. All patients had attempted a trial of pharmacological treatment and/or alternative interventions for at least 6 months before proceeding with surgery. All patients underwent preoperative MRI of the brain with a T2-weighted CISS or FIESTA sequence to evaluate for neurovascular conflict and the presence of any secondary causes of TN, including tumors or multiple sclerosis. All patients were counseled about surgery and the Teflon wrap technique, and informed consent was obtained.

The patients were asked to quantify their pain severity on admission (prior to surgery), on postoperative day 1, on postoperative day 30, and at the 6-month outpatient follow-up. The Barrow Neurological Institute pain score (BNI-PS)16(Table 2) was used as the pain assessment tool.

The patient is placed in the supine position with a large shoulder roll under the ipsilateral side. The head is slightly flexed and rotated contralaterally to optimize access to the cerebellopontine angle. The ipsilateral shoulder is gently retracted caudally and secured with adhesive tape to improve neck extension and surgical exposure.

A dedicated neurophysiologist is present to conduct intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), with our standard protocol including brainstem auditory evoked response, free running and stimulated electromyography, and THR monitoring as a functional marker of decompression efficacy. THR is a brainstem reflex that synchronizes tongue and jaw movements during oromotor activities. To elicit the THR, the lingual nerve (a branch of the trigeminal nerve) is stimulated using dual-needle electrodes placed near the temporomandibular joint. Hypoglossal muscle responses are recorded via electrodes inserted into the tongue’s lateral aspect.17,–,19THR is monitored before and after MVD of the trigeminal nerve, with its loss indicating successful decompression. The same stimulation threshold is used before and after decompression to confirm the absence of THR. Recorded responses are analyzed and correlated with postoperative clinical outcomes.

A 6- to 8-cm curvilinear incision is made 3 cm posterior to the pinna, with subperiosteal dissection to expose the mastoid bone. A standard retrosigmoid craniotomy is performed, extending medially to the sigmoid sinus, superiorly to the transverse sinus, and inferiorly to just above the mastoid tip. A curvilinear dural incision is made under microscopic visualization, and dural edges are retracted with 4-0 Vicryl stay sutures. The cisterna magna is opened for CSF drainage and to facilitate cerebellar relaxation.

Gentle retraction of the cerebellum is performed to expose the cerebellopontine angle, with the cranial nerve (CN) VII–VIII complex serving as the primary anatomical landmark. The petrosal vein is identified and followed to the tentorial edge, and the trigeminal nerve (CN V) is identified at its REZ near the pons. Careful arachnoid dissection around the REZ is performed with systematic inspection of the nerve from the pons to Meckel’s cave to identify potential neurovascular conflicts. Common offenders include the superior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, vertebrobasilar complex, or venous compression (i.e., petrosal or bridging veins).

If no neurovascular conflict is identified, a Teflon felt wrap measuring approximately 3–5 mm by 15–20 mm is fashioned into a cylindrical shape and gently looped around the trigeminal nerve REZ using microforceps, ensuring that there is no kinking or undue traction on the nerve (Fig. 1). The construct is thoroughly irrigated with saline to confirm stability. It is then further secured in place with fibrin glue to prevent dislodgment.

IONM ensures brainstem and cranial integrity during manipulation, and the loss of THR is taken as a marker that adequate decompression has been achieved. The dura is closed primarily in a watertight fashion with dural substitute graft and fibrin glue reinforcement if required, to minimize the risk of a CSF leak. The soft tissue is closed in layers.

The necessary informed consent was obtained in this study.

The patients’ demographics, site of disease, cause of TN, preoperative BNI-PS, presence or absence of THR at the start and end of surgery, and clinical outcomes are summarized inTable 3.

Six patients with idiopathic TN meeting inclusion criteria underwent MVD with Teflon wrap placement. The mean age of the patients was 66 years (SD 5.9). The preoperative BNI-PS ranged from III to V. All patients demonstrated intact THR at baseline. Intraoperative examination and comprehensive visualization of the trigeminal nerve from its REZ at the pons through Meckel’s cave revealed no neurovascular conflicts for all cases. A Teflon wrap was placed around the trigeminal nerve for each patient, with intraoperative loss of THR serving as an objective marker of adequate functional decompression.

Postoperatively, 5 of 6 patients (83%) experienced immediate and sustained pain relief (BNI-PS of I or II) by postoperative day 1, which was maintained through the 6-month follow-up. One patient (case 1) showed delayed improvement, progressing from a BNI-PS of IV on postoperative day 1 to a score of 3 at 1 month and eventually to complete pain relief (BNI-PS of I) by 6 months. All 6 patients remained pain free at 18 months. No patient experienced complications or neurological deficits. These results suggest that trigeminal nerve wrapping, guided by intraoperative THR monitoring, may offer durable pain relief in idiopathic TN even in the absence of a visible neurovascular conflict.

Idiopathic TN represents a particularly challenging subset of TN, characterized by debilitating facial pain in the absence of an identifiable neurovascular conflict. This condition carries significant morbidity, with patients experiencing significant impairment in quality of life. The current management paradigm remains controversial due to several factors: the relative rarity of pure idiopathic cases, an incomplete understanding of its underlying pathophysiology, and a lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment algorithms. We propose an innovative trigeminal nerve Teflon wrap technique for idiopathic TN. Initial findings from our study suggest that the technique is a promising viable surgical option to provide significant pain relief while preserving nerve function.

The success of the Teflon wrap technique in our cohort may be explained through several complementary mechanisms. First, the circumferential support provided by the wrap could mechanically stabilize hyperexcitable neural segments at the REZ, potentially addressing either focal demyelination or ion channel dysfunction. This mechanism is supported by the immediate pain relief observed in two-thirds of our patients. Second, the delayed response pattern seen in 1 case suggests possible neuromodulatory effects on central pain pathways, in which mechanical stabilization allows the nerve to gradually reset its abnormal signaling patterns and mirror the gradual improvement sometimes observed with pharmacotherapy. Lastly, the required arachnoid dissection during Teflon placement may independently contribute to pain relief by releasing occult adhesions or altering CSF dynamics around the nerve.

These observations collectively support an evolving spectrum model of TN pathophysiology, in which mechanical interventions may benefit patients across the etiological continuum through multiple synergistic mechanisms.

Our study introduces a significant advancement in TN management by adapting the Teflon wrap technique to directly address idiopathic cases. While previous applications of the technique have focused solely on classic TN and vascular decompression by isolating and transposing the offending vessel away from the trigeminal nerve,22,–,24our method involves directly placing a Teflon wrap on the trigeminal nerve itself. This fundamental modification is supported with the use of monitoring to establish the absence of THR as a reliable, objective marker of adequate decompression, which is particularly valuable in cases in which no visible neurovascular conflict is present.

The circumferential nerve wrapping technique addresses a fundamentally different pathophysiological concept compared with standard vascular decompression. Rather than simply separating nerve from vessel, this approach appears to modify diffuse mechanical stresses along the nerve’s course. This innovation is particularly valuable for idiopathic TN, in which the absence of a visible neurovascular conflict has historically limited surgical options.

These clinical findings offer important insights for the management of idiopathic TN. The described Teflon wrap technique offers a promising therapeutic option for carefully selected patients with idiopathic TN who have failed medical therapy and demonstrate no evidence of a neurovascular conflict despite comprehensive evaluation. However, surgeons should be cognizant of the technical demands inherent to this procedure, particularly the need for complete arachnoid dissection and circumferential nerve exposure, which may present considerable challenges in cases with restricted operative corridors or complex anatomical variations.

Importantly, while the wrap construct may provide mechanical stabilization or mitigate dynamic irritation, we acknowledge that pain relief could also stem in part from minor, intentional, or unintentional rhizotomy-like effects due to circumferential dissection. This parallels the mechanism seen in procedures such as intrafascicular neurolysis, raising the possibility that pain improvement may not solely reflect biomechanical stabilization but rather subtle injury-mediated neuromodulation.

Another potential application of the Teflon wrap technique could be in patients with recurrent TN following a previous MVD. In such cases, in which standard decompression has already failed, wrapping of the trigeminal nerve guided by intraoperative monitoring may provide an alternative surgical strategy. This subset represents a particularly high-risk, high-need cohort in which alternative strategies must be carefully evaluated and exhausted, with thorough informed consent taking.

Potential complications specific to this technique must also be considered. Although no adverse events were observed in our cohort, risks may include nerve constriction from excessive wrap tension, foreign body reaction to Teflon, or wrap migration despite fibrin fixation. There is also a theoretical risk of delayed CN palsy due to a fibrotic response or inadvertent thermal injury from fibrin polymerization. IONM is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure functional nerve preservation.

From a health economics standpoint, the cost implications of this technique are modest. It utilizes existing materials (Teflon and fibrin glue) and does not require high-cost adjuncts such as stereotactic platforms or radiosurgical infrastructure. Compared with Gamma Knife radiosurgery or repeat interventions, this method may offer an efficient, durable, and cost-effective alternative for refractory idiopathic TN.

The encouraging outcomes observed in our series underscore the need for expanded clinical investigation. Future studies should aim to compare outcomes with those of other interventions for idiopathic TN, ideally through prospective multicenter collaborative studies. Standardized protocols and extended follow-up are essential to establish the true efficacy of this approach, determine the durability of pain relief, and identify potential late recurrences. Technical refinements may include the development of specialized materials engineered specifically for neural applications, potentially incorporating bioactive properties to enhance long-term efficacy and therapeutic effects. Future refinements of this technique could support more precise biochemical modulation of the trigeminal nerve and revolutionize idiopathic TN treatment, offering durable pain relief while preserving nerve function.

Our preliminary findings indicate that Teflon wrap placement during MVD effectively relieves pain in idiopathic TN patients despite the absence of a neurovascular conflict. The consistent success observed with THR monitoring suggests that this technique may correct subtle dynamic compression or biomechanical nerve dysfunction. This approach represents a significant advancement over previously described procedures by preserving nerve function. While these initial results are encouraging, a larger patient cohort and further multicenter studies with extended longitudinal follow-up are required to validate the technique’s durability and refine patient selection criteria.
