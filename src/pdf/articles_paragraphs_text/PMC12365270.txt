Insulin resistance is one of the metabolic complications of COVID-19. Our previous study showed a 22% median increase in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese individuals at 12 months post-infection compared to acute infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between various subsets of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells and insulin resistance in convalescent COVID-19 patients over a one-year post-infection follow-up period. A nested case control study of 47 COVID-19 patients was followed for 12 months post-infection and categorized into three groups based on obesity and changes in HOMA-IR at one year: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO), obese without increased HOMA-IR (O), and obese with increased HOMA-IR (O-IR). Increased HOMA-IR was defined as a HOMA-IR ratio (12-month to 1-month convalescence phase) > 1.21. To study antigen-specific responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s were isolated and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide antigens for 24 h. Intracellular IFN-γ expression, as well as exhaustion and senescence markers, in various CD4+and CD8+T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. The abundance of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+T cells was lower in the O-IR group compared to individuals without increased HOMA-IR during the 9th to 12th months of follow-up (p< 0.05). Conversely, the O-IR group exhibited a mild but significantly higher IFN-γ-expressing CD8+T cells from the 3rd to the 9th month of the convalescence phase (p< 0.05). A reduced proportion of functional (PD-1−CD57−) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed in O-IR group. Furthermore, the reduced proportion of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells observed within 12 months of convalescence were have significant weak negative correlation with HOMA-IR ratio as well as HOMA-IR value. Our study demonstrates that obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR exhibited a reduced proportion of IFN-γ–expressing functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells one year after COVID-19. This reduction, along with the decreased frequencies of both functional CD4⁺ within 12 months of convalescence, suggests a potential association between impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell function and the development of insulin resistance following COVID-19. These findings warrant further investigation.

An increased risk of new-onset diabetes has been observed as a potential long-term complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in individuals who are overweight or obese1. Recent studies have shown that the incidence of new-onset diabetes following COVID-19 infection was 1.6% (95%CI: 0.8–2.7%%), highlighting it as a notable post-acute complication2. The persistence of insulin resistance, determined by an increased homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index has been observed in convalescent COVID-19 patients, even if the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) had returned to normal3. Among studies investigating metabolic alterations during the COVID-19 convalescence period, Lui et al.4reported a modest increase in insulin resistance over a 12-month follow-up. In their study involving 43 COVID-19 survivors, the median HOMA-IR at baseline (6 weeks post-acute COVID-19 infection) was 1.39 (0.91–2.21), which increased to 1.47 (1.14–2.22) at one year—representing a 5.7% increase. This was accompanied by a 3.6% rise in HbA1c and a 9.4% increase in 2-hour glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) among individuals without diabetes or with prediabetes4. In comparison, our previous study involving 49 COVID-19 patients—regardless of obesity or diabetes status—showed a 22% median increase in HOMA-IR at one year post-infection5. The increased HOMA-IR after COVID-19 is influenced by many factors, such as higher body fat percentages, lower lean mass and lean/fat mass ratio, and higher pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio5.

An imbalance in the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio resulting from viral infections—such as SARS-CoV-2—and the persistence of the virus in adipose tissue may contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation6,7. This inflammatory state is associated with the upregulation of negative regulators of T cell function, such as Programmed Death-1 (PD-1), and the expression of senescence markers like CD578. In obese murine models, activation of the PD-1 pathway has been shown to impair innate immune cell function within adipose tissue, potentially sustaining inflammation9. Senescent T cells (CD57⁺CD28⁻) have also been implicated in dysregulated glucose metabolism10.

Although no animal models have definitively demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2–specific T cells induce insulin resistance—largely due to genetic variability—studies in humans indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to T cell exhaustion and senescence, with these alterations persisting into the convalescent phase11,12. The expression of PD-1 and CD57 on T cells has been used to predict immune outcomes in various clinical settings, including transplant rejection in end-stage renal disease13and immune exhaustion in lung cancer14. However, it remains unclear whether T cell exhaustion and senescence following SARS-CoV-2 infection contribute to an increased risk of insulin resistance.

This study aimed to investigate the association between subsets of IFN-γ–producing SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells and insulin resistance in convalescent COVID-19 patients over a one-year follow-up period. IFN-γ was selected as the primary marker of antigen-specific T cell activation, based on previous findings showing that among various cytokines, IFN-γ was the most prominently expressed by CD4⁺ T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptide pools, particularly those derived from spike and nucleocapsid proteins15.

This study is a post hoc exploratory analysis conducted using data from the previously registered and published CARAMEL study (NCT04802044)16. It examined a subgroup of 47 participants (31 males and 16 females) with a mean age of 48 years and an average body mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m². Individuals were selected for this analysis based on the availability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples5,16. To assess the increase in insulin resistance and body mass index (BMI) during the 12-month convalescence phase, we categorized participants based on BMI and changes in HOMA-IR one year after infection. The HOMA-IR ratio was calculated by comparing values at 12-month and 1-month post-infection. Obesity status was classified according to the WHO Western Pacific Region criteria: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–22.9 kg/m2), overweight (23.0–24.9 kg/m2), obesity class I (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and obesity class II (≥ 30 kg/m2)17. Then, the participants were categorized into 3 groups: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO, BMI < 25 kg/m2and HOMA-IR ratio ≤ 1.21, n = 8); obese without increase HOMA-IR (O, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2and HOMA-IR ratio ≤ 1.21, n = 14), and obese with increase of HOMA-IR (O-IR, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, HOMA-IR ratio > 1.21, n = 25). The HOMA-IR ratio cutoff of 1.21 was made using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with ‘new-onset DM’ as the state variable. This cut off demonstrated a sensitivity of 72.4% and a specificity of 70% (Fig.1). Our rationale for classifying participants into obese and non-obese groups, as well as those with and without increased HOMA-IR, was based on the established association between obesity and a higher risk of insulin resistance, largely due to chronic low-grade inflammation. This classification was designed to minimize obesity-related bias. The NO group, considered metabolically healthy, served as a reference benchmark in the analysis.

To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to meet the following criteria: age > 18-year-old, first SARS-CoV-2 infection, not have received a COVID-19 vaccination, and have completed all follow-up appointments. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, history of autoimmune diseases, blood clotting disorders, or malignancies. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of oropharyngeal swab samples, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value < 40 indicating a positive result.

This cohort study contained five sampling moments: one at acute phase (called 0 month) and four during the convalescence period— at 1, 3, 9, and 12 months post infection. Acute phase and follow up data obtained for this study have been described in our previous study5. In brief, acute phase data including sociodemographic, comorbidities, and severity data, which were collected at the day of hospital admission. The following day, fasting (overnight) venous blood was sampled in all participants for determination of glycemic indices (Hba1c, FBG, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR), and PBMC isolation and cryopreservation. PBMCs from all participants were isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen using protocols described previously5. At each follow up session, any post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) symptoms and/or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were recorded and similar blood collection was performed. Individuals with PASC were defined as those experiencing persistent symptoms of PASC18lasting at least four weeks after infection resolved or experiencing a relapse of symptoms after a period of resolution.

Fasting blood glucose was immediately measured after blood collection using Accu Check Performa (Roche Diabetes Case, Mannheim, Germany). HbA1c was measured from ethylene-diamine-tetraacetid acid (EDTA) blood using a D-10 HbA1c analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Fasting plasma insulin was assessed using DRG Insulin ELISA kit (DRG, Marburg, Germany) with protocol according to the manufacturer. HOMA-IR was calculated using the formula developed by Mattew et al.19HOMA-IR = plasma glucose (mg/dL) × insulin (µIU/mL)/405.

After thawing, PBMCs (1 × 106cells) were seeded in a 96-well plate containing 100 µL per well of RPMI (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). After an overnight resting period at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator, the cells were stimulated with a cocktail of overlapping peptide (OLP) of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and N (2 µg/mL, Milteny Biotec, Gladbach, Germany) for 24 h. For the negative control, 1 × 106cells in 100 µL complete medium were seeded in a 96 well plate without stimulation. The cell suspension was then stimulated with 5 µg/mL brefeldin A (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, US) for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator.

Previous studies have established that a 24-hour stimulation period is commonly used in IFN-γ intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) protocols. Caraher et al.,20observed high frequencies of CD3⁺CD4⁺IFN-γ⁺ cells between 4 and 8 h, and identified 6 h with 1 µg/mL brefeldin A as optimal. Smith et al.,21found no significant difference in the number of IFN-γ⁺ cells between 4-hour stimulation with 3 µg/mL BFA and 18-hour stimulation with 3 µg/mL BFA. Based on this literature and our own optimization experiments using 5 µL/mL BFA at 4, 6, and 12 h, we determined that a 4-hour incubation yielded the highest frequency of IFN-γ⁺ T cells.

For this purpose, harvested cells were first washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with 5 µL of human Fc receptor blocking solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for 10 min at room temperature (RT) to prevent non-specific antibody binding. Subsequently, cells were stained for 30 min at RT with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, including FITC-CD3, FITC-CD4, PerCP/Cy5.5-CD8, PE/Cyanine7-CD45RA, APC-CCR7, BV421-PD-1, and PE-CD57 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Supplementary Material 1). Cells were then incubated with BV510 fixable viability stain (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) for 15 min at RT to exclude dead cells.

Following surface staining, cells were fixed using Cytofix fixation buffer and washed with Perm/Wash buffer (both from BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA). Intracellular staining for IFN-γ was performed using anti-IFN-γ antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min at RT. After a final wash, samples were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany), and data were processed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).

The gating strategy for identifying exhausted, senescent, and functional memory T cells is illustrated in Fig.2. Memory T cell subsets were defined based on CD45RA and CCR7 expression, following the classification by Sallusto et al.22: effector memory (CD45RA⁻CCR7⁻), central memory (CD45RA⁻CCR7⁺), and terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA; CD45RA⁺CCR7⁻). Within these memory populations, further gating was performed using PD-1 and CD57 expression: exhausted T cells (PD-1⁺CD57⁻), senescent T cells (PD-1⁻CD57⁺), and functional T cells (PD-1⁻CD57⁻).

Flowcytometry gating strategy. The viable T lymphocytes were gated within CD3+ gate, then were categorized into CD4+ and CD8+. The CD4+ or CD8+ T cells which expressed IFN-γ (IFN-γ+) were considered as total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The cells were gated based on CCR7 and CD45RA to differentiate memory and naïve T cells. Next, only memory T cell populations was further clustered based on PD-1 and CD57 expression. The subsets of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were defined as follows: exhausted T cells (PD-1+CD57−), senescent T cells (PD-1−CD57+), and functional T cells (PD-1−CD57−). Intensity of IFN-γ expression in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was also measured using median fluorescence intensity (MFI).

The intensity of IFN-γ expression in CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells was quantified using median fluorescence intensity (MFI). The frequency of IFN-γ⁺ T cells in OLP-stimulated wells was background-corrected by subtracting values from unstimulated controls. However, MFI values were obtained only from the OLP-stimulated conditions. Pre-pandemic PBMC samples (n= 20) were included as assay controls to validate the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 OLP-induced responses (Supplementary Material 2).

Intensity of IFN-γ expression in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was also measured using median fluorescence intensity (MFI).--> these sentences should be a figure caption.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistical Software package, version 23, and the figures were prepared using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Normality of each dataset was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test prior to analysis, and in cases where normality could not be assumed (p< 0.05), non-parametric approaches were applied. All continuous variable were presented as median or interquartile range and for categorical variables were presented as numerical value. Variations in T cell subset abundances during the 12-month follow up were evaluated using Friedmann test. For all pairwise comparisons following Kruskal–Wallis testing, we applied Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction. The adjusted p-values are now clearly reported in the figure legends and corresponding results. The correlation between T cell subset and HOMA-IR ratio was analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The data were considered statistically significant atp< 0.05.

Table1presents the differences in sociodemographic and metabolic parameters during acute infection among 47 participants, categorized into three groups: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO), obese without increased HOMA-IR (O), and obese with increased HOMA-IR (O-IR). Sex distribution, mean age, and COVID-19 severity were similar across these groups. However, the NO group was predominantly composed of non-diabetic participants, with only one individual having newly onset diabetes (p< 0.009). Obese participants, both with and without elevated HOMA-IR, had significantly higher BMI, HbA1c, FBG, and HOMA-IR levels compared to the NO group.

Table2shows that the O-IR group experienced a significant increase in both fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin levels after 12 months of follow-up. Although the median HOMA-IR values at 1-month were slightly higher in the O group (3.24 [0.96–13.74]) compared to the O-IR group (2.82 [0.88–7.79]), this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.313). In the O-IR subgroup, HOMA-IR levels at 9-month (3.48 [1.60–21.13]) appeared lower than at 3 months (4.09 [1.31–17.89]), though this difference was not significant (p= 0.288). However, paired comparisons revealed a significant increase in HOMA-IR from 1 to 9-month (2.82 [0.88–7.79] vs. 3.48 [1.60–21.13];p= 0.001), and from 9 to 12-month (3.48 [1.60–21.13] vs. 5.07 [1.66–21.04];p= 0.045). The HOMA-IR ratio between 12 and 1-month post-infection also differed significantly across groups: 1.01 [0.60–1.19] in the NO group, 0.75 [0.24–1.12] in the O group, and 1.69 [1.22–2.84] in the O-IR group (p< 0.001), indicating a pronounced progression of insulin resistance in the O-IR group over time.

Long COVID and COVID-19 vaccination status are presented as number (percentages) and analyzed using the chi-square test. The differences in BMI, HbA1c, FBG, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR represent the changes between the data collected at the 12 months of follow-up and the data collected at the 1 month of follow-up. These differences and actual data of BMI, HbA1c, FBG, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR are presented as median (minimum-maximum) and were compared using Kruskal Wallis test.

There was no significant difference in the number of participants who were vaccinated and developed PASC among the three groups. However, there was a trend towards increased PASC prevalence in the 2 groups with obese individuals (12.5% in non-obese vs. 57% and 52% in obese groups).

In this study, the majority of participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n= 22) were classified into the increased HOMA-IR group (13 participants, 59%), while the remaining 9 participants (41%) were in the non-increased HOMA-IR group. To explore the possible factors contributing to the differences in HOMA-IR progression, we analyzed various metabolic parameters, including HbA1c, GDP, fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR, body fat percentage, visceral fat, body, and medication use.

As shown in Table3, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender distribution, comorbidities, or overall medication use. However, it is noteworthy that the proportion of participants using sulfonylureas was twice as high in the increased HOMA-IR group. Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion, which may have contributed to the rise in HOMA-IR in this subgroup.

The age, body mass index, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-IR ratio are presented as median (minimum-maximum) and were compared using Mann Whitney test. The HOMA-IR ratio was calculated by dividing the HOMA-IR value at 12 months post-infection by the value at 1 month post-infection.

Regarding body composition, although BMI remained stable, participants in the increased HOMA-IR group exhibited a progressive rise in median body fat percentage, from 25.4% at 1 month to 33.2% at 12 months. This increase in body fat over the 12-month follow-up period may have contributed to worsening insulin resistance.

In terms of glycemic indices, unexpectedly higher HOMA-IR values were observed at 1 month post-infection in the diabetes group without increased HOMA-IR classification. Interestingly, this group demonstrated an overall improvement in HOMA-IR over the 12-month follow-up period. In contrast, the group classified with increased HOMA-IR showed progressive elevations in HbA1c, fasting insulin, glucose during diagnosis (GDP), and HOMA-IR from 1 to 12 months post-infection. Meanwhile, the non-increased HOMA-IR group exhibited improved glycemic control, with reductions in HbA1c, fasting insulin, GDP, and HOMA-IR over the same period.

We then wanted to associated SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells with metabolic alterations (Fig.3). Figure3a illustrates that the proportions of total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells were comparable across the three groups at all timepoints. However, the intensity of IFN-γ-expression in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+T cells was lower in the O-IR group compared to individuals without increased HOMA-IR during the 9th to 12th months of follow-up (Fig.3b). Conversely, the O-IR group exhibited a mild but significantly higher IFN-γ-expressing CD8+T cells from the 3- to the 9-month of the convalescence phase. These findings suggest that the capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+T cells to produce IFN-γ was impaired in obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR at the last time points.

The proportion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was determined by measuring the proportion of IFN-γ-positive T cells induced by overlapping peptide (OLP) SARS-CoV-2 antigens, corrected for the proportion of IFN-γ-positive T cells induced by complete medium without stimulation (negative control). Data are presented as median (minimum-maximum) and were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis’s test, followed by Dunn’s comparison with Bonferroni correction.

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were further categorized into two subsets based on PD-1 and CD57 expression. Over the 12-month convalescence phase, the proportions of exhausted (PD-1+) and senescent (CD57+) T cells did not differ significantly between groups. However, obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR had a significantly lower proportion of functional (PD-1−CD57−) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, particularly CD4+T cells, compared to those without increased HOMA-IR (Fig.3c and d,p< 0.05). A similar trend was observed in total CD4 + T cells. PD1-CD57-CD4+T cells were lower in obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR, accompanied by a higher proportion of PD1+CD4+T cells (Supplementary Material 3 and 4).

Regarding diabetes status, we observed that participants with diabetes who had higher HOMA-IR at 1 month post-infection showed an overall improvement in HOMA-IR over the 12-month follow-up. To further investigate this finding, we analyzed whether SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells were associated with the observed improvement. Notably, participants with diabetes who did not exhibit an increase in HOMA-IR had significantly higher frequencies of IFN-γ–expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4⁺ T cells at both 9 and 12 months post-infection compared to those with increased HOMA-IR (38.9 [26.1–49.5] vs. 26.24 [11.76–37.92],p= 0.003; and 37.1 [24.3–84.1] vs. 26.72 [17.92–68.48],p= 0.048; see Supplementary Material 5).

We fully acknowledge that the higher proportion of individuals with severe COVID-19 in the O-IR groups may confound the observed associations between T cell characteristics and HOMA-IR. Therefore, we conducted additional analyses treating HOMA-IR and immune parameters as continuous variables and examined them within stratified subgroups based on COVID-19 severity (asymptomatic–mild [n= 15] vs. moderate–severe [n= 32]) (Supplementary Material 6). No significant differences were observed in the proportions of SARS-CoV-2 memory-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells, including their functionality subsets (exhausted, senescent, and functional). However, the intensity of IFN-γ expression in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+T cells at three months post-infection was higher in the moderate–severe group (p< 0.05).

We assessed the correlation between T cell responses and HOMA-IR ratio at 1 year post infection. The correlation revealed that the proportion of CD57+SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells had weakly positive association with increased HOMA-IR ( CD4+T cells :r= 0.291,p= 0.047 at 3rd month andr= 0.277, p 0.048 at 9th month; CD8+T cells :r= 0.278,p= 0.048 at 3rd month andr= 0.289, p 0.047 at 12th month), while the proportions of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells at all post infection timepoints showed weakly negative correlations with elevated HOMA-IR at 1 year (Fig.4). Notably, the proportion of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells at the third month of convalescence exhibited the strongest negative correlation with HOMA-IR ratio (r= -0.383;p= 0.008, andr= -0.370;p= 0.011, respectively). These results indicate a possible association between functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and insulin resistance following COVID-19, which warrants further study.

The proportion of senescent T cells was also defined as PD1−CD57+T cells. The proportion of functional T cells was defined as PD1⁻CD57⁻ T cells. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman’s rank test.

To strengthen our longitudinal findings, we also performed cross-sectional correlation analyses between HOMA-IR values and T-cell subsets at 3, 9, and 12 months post-infection. These analyses further support our conclusions: HOMA-IR values showed a weak positive correlation with exhausted and/or senescent SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells, and a weak to moderate negative correlation with functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells (Supplementary material 7).

This study investigated the long-term immunological effects in post-COVID-19 patients, focusing on the proportions of PD-1⁺ (exhausted), CD57⁺ (senescent), and PD-1−CD57−(functional) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in relation to increase insulin resistance, as indicated by elevated HOMA-IR levels over a 12-month follow-up period.

Memory T cells and their associated cytokines play a critical role in eliminating viruses upon reinfection23. In our study, participants with a history of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection who later received 2–3 doses of vaccination exhibited detectable IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells even after 12 months post-convalescence. Notably, the proportion of these T cells did not differ significantly from levels observed at 3 months post-convalescence. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have reported that T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 can persist for 6–12 months following infection, whereas humoral responses tend to decline during the first 6 months of convalescence24,25. In this study, natural infection followed by vaccination might enhance the durability of memory T cells. Pitiriga et al.,26demonstrated that T cell responses were higher in individuals who experienced natural infection followed by vaccination.

We demonstrated that the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells over 12 months of convalescence was comparable among lean individuals, obese individuals, and obese individuals with elevated HOMA-IR. But, IFN-γ expression was altered in T cells of obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR, characterized by lower IFN-γ expression in CD4+T cells and higher IFN-γ expression in CD8+T cells. Similar findings were reported by Oyango et al.,27who showed that while the number of IFN-γ-expressing spike-specific T cells was similar between lean and obese individuals, obese individuals exhibited more robust and multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 CD8+T cells, indicating an over-reactive immune response.

The increased the intensity of IFN γ in SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+T cells in the O-IR group during early convalescence may reflect a compensatory mechanism due to CD4+T cell dysfunction. This elevated activity could contribute to persistent immune activation and tissue inflammation. Several studies suggest that sustained CD8+T cell activation, especially in the context of metabolic stress, may exacerbate insulin resistance through cytotoxic effects on adipose tissue, by amplifying inflammatory cascades, and induce glycolysis metabolism that will produce ROS28,29.

Obese individuals with elevated HOMA-IR exhibited reduced proportions of PD1−CD57−(functional) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells. A similar trend has been observed in influenza infection: in vitro influenza stimulation revealed that obese individuals had decreased expression level of IFN-γ30,31. Furthermore, Giovenzana et al.32demonstrated that chronic antigen exposure in adipose tissue during dysglycemia leads to an expansion of recirculating PD-1⁺ T cells. This expansion results in a relative reduction of functional PD-1⁻ CD4⁺ T cells in circulation.

CD4+T cells play multiple roles in the adaptive immune response. In our study, we observed a decrease in the frequency of functional CD4+T cells in obese individual with elevated HOMA-IR, which was associated with an increased accumulation of exhausted and senescent (dysfunctional) CD4+T cells. Similar to our findings, inflammation related conditions, such as aging, has been reported to increase exhausted CD4+T cells with reduced IFN-γ production, correlating with decreased vaccination responses33,34. Exhausted CD4+T cells were found to impair the optimal activation of CD8+T cells, reduce antibody class switching, and diminish the antibacterial activity of innate immune cells35. Additionally, these exhausted CD4+T cells showed reduced serum bactericidal antibody titers36Dysfunctional or exhausted CD4⁺ T cells may compromise immune regulation and promote sustained proinflammatory signaling within metabolic tissues. Previous studies have indicated that these exhausted T cells can induce mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to disrupted cellular metabolism and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production37,38. The resulting oxidative stress further impairs insulin signaling, ultimately contributing to insulin resistance. Several studies in both humans and animal models have shown an increased presence of PD-1⁺ CD4⁺ T cells, indicating disruption of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which has been linked to leptin signaling39,40.

We acknowledge that the observed association between specific T-cell subpopulations and HOMA-IR at 12 months post-infection may be influenced by confounding factors such as disease severity. To address this, we analyzed the impact of COVID-19 severity on HOMA-IR and T-cell populations. Our analysis showed no significant differences in HOMA-IR values or T-cell subsets between participants with asymptomatic/mild versus moderate/severe disease. These findings are consistent with previous studies. Venet et al.41reported no significant differences in the proportion of activated T cells specific to nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike of SARS-CoV-2 antigens between non-severe and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection groups at 9 and 13 months post-infection.

In our study, functional CD4⁺ T cells consistently showed a weak negative correlation with HOMA-IR. The strongest correlations observed were between functional CD4⁺ T cells at 12 months and HOMA-IR at 12 months (r= − 0.526), and between functional CD4⁺ T cells at 9 months and the HOMA-IR ratio (r= − 0.430). These correspond to r² values of approximately 27% and 18.5%, respectively, indicating that functional CD4⁺ T cells account for only a limited proportion of the variance in insulin resistance outcomes. These findings highlight the likelihood that additional, unmeasured factors contribute to the development of increased insulin resistance.

Regarding the observed variability in glycemic indices and cellular markers, particularly at 9 months post-infection, we believe this reflects normal biological variation. The 6-month gap between the 3- and 9-month follow-up points may have contributed to this variability. Factors such as differences in vaccination timing, physical activity levels, and diabetes management could have influenced the results at 9 months. Despite this variability, our longitudinal data consistently demonstrated a similar trend: a progressive decline in functional T cells, an increase in dysfunctional T cells, and a corresponding rise in HOMA-IR over time.

This study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. The sample size, while sufficient to detect significant differences, may limit the generalizability of our findings. We noted that the smaller NO group may reduce the power to detect certain differences and that findings related to this group should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the capabilities of our 8-color flow cytometry panel restrict the comprehensive assessment of multifunctionality in cytokine production by activated memory T cells, particularly in relation to IL-2, TNF-α, and granzyme B. We observed temporal variability in glucose indices and T cell memory parameters at the 9- and 12-month time points, which may be influenced by unmeasured confounders, potentially limiting the longitudinal interpretation. Therefore, future longitudinal studies with larger cohorts, particularly including more non-obese participants, are needed to validate these findings and to clarify the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to prolonged immune dysregulation and metabolic dysfunction. Our study participants had been vaccinated, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response observed may represent a hybrid response resulting from both vaccination and natural infection. Data on blood cell counts, CRP, and concurrent infections during the 12-month follow-up were not available in this study. However, during each follow-up visit, participants were asked about their general health status and whether they had undergone COVID-19 PCR testing or experienced reinfection. Future research should investigate the impact of dysfunctional T cells on adipocyte’s insulin resistance to further elucidate the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.

Our study demonstrates that reduced IFN γ-expressing functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+T cells is associated with elevated HOMA-IR in post-COVID-19 patients one year after infection. These findings suggest that impaired functional T cell responses, particularly in CD4+T cells, may serve as a potential predictive factor for the development of insulin resistance following COVID-19. These results indicate a possible association between functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and insulin resistance following COVID-19, which warrants further study.
