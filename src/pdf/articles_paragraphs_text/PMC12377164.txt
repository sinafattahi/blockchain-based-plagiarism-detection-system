This study investigates the catalytic potential of copper-based metal–organic frameworks (Cu-MOFs), specifically HKUST-1 and CuBDC, for the protodeboronation of aryl boronic acids. Protodeboronation, was explored under various bases, atmospheres, and substrates. Optimal conditions using K2CO3as the base and an oxygen atmosphere yielded up to 98% product with HKUST-1. While CuBDC also exhibited catalytic activity, its yields were slightly lower under identical conditions. Substrate size and substituent effects played a crucial role, with bulkier substrates favoring higher yields. Recyclability tests confirmed that both Cu-MOFs retained catalytic activity over three cycles, despite some structural changes. These findings demonstrate Cu-MOFs as promising heterogeneous catalysts for controlled protodeboronation.

Cu-MOFs (HKUST-1 and CuBDC) effectively catalyzed the protodeboronation of arylboronic acids, giving up to 98% and 95% yields. Both catalysts remained active for three recycling cycles.

The first detailed study of this process dates back to 1930, when Ainley and Challenger observed that phenylboronic acid in water at 140–150 °C formed benzene after 40 h in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of salts (ZnCl2, CrBr3, CuSO4).20Its synthetic potential was later explored by Brown and Zweifel in 1961.21Since then, protodeboronation has evolved from being viewed as a side reaction to becoming an intentional step in certain synthetic pathways. For instance, Laiet al.specifically studied a palladium-catalyzed protodeboronation of arylboronic acids under basic conditions and a nitrogen atmosphere.22In 2011, Elfordet al.utilized the protodeboronation of boronic acid esters as a pivotal step in the synthesis of the natural product (+)-erogorgiaene.23In the same year, Veguillaset al.demonstrated the synthesis of quinonyl boronic acid derivatives, where the boronic acid group played a critical role in initiating Friedel–Crafts alkylationviaprotodeboronation.24Further developments were reported in 2013 by Leeet al., who synthesizedo- andm-phenols using phenylboronic acid as a precursor, with the boronic acid group serving as a temporary blocking or directing group before being removed through protodeboronation.25In 2014, Lozadaet al.studied a variety of electron-deficient and heteroarylboronic acids subjected to protodeboronation under basic conditions.26More recently, Budimanet al.reviewed the influence ofo-fluoro substituents on the reactivity of arylboronic acids in basic aqueous conditions, demonstrating how functional groups can enhance the likelihood of protodeboronation.27These milestones underscore the growing importance of understanding and controlling protodeboronation, not only to minimize its occurrence as an undesirable side reaction but also to harness its potential as a deliberate tool in organic synthesis.

Building on our previous work optimizing HKUST-1 as a catalyst for the homocoupling of arylboronic acids,43we now report the protodeboronation of arylboronic acids catalyzed by copper-based MOFs. Specifically, we employed HKUST-1 and CuBDC as catalysts. Both MOFs feature copper as the central metal site; however, they differ in their organic linkers. HKUST-1 utilizes benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC),44forming a three-dimensional framework, while CuBDC incorporates benzenedicarboxylic acid (H3BDC),45resulting in a two-dimensional structure. This study explores the catalytic potential of these frameworks in protodeboronation reactions of arylboronic acids.

The synthesis of HKUST-1 was performed with a slightly modified electrochemical cell and solvent composition according to the literature procedure,46which was optimized by our previous research.471.06 g (5 mmol) of 1,3,5-H3BTC and 0.33 g (1 mmol) of tetra-butylammoniumtetra-fluoroborate (TBATFB) were dissolved in 50 mL of solvent mixture water : ethanol (1 : 1) and stirred for 15 min prior to electrolysis. After the formation of a homogenous solution, two copper electrodes (with the same area,i.e. 10.5 cm2) were placed into the electrochemical cell. The system was set up with regulated DC power supply ATTEN TPR 3005T-3C under a constant voltage (15 V) at room temperature and kept for 1.5 h for complete reaction. The obtained sky-blue precipitate of HKUST-1 [Cu3(BTC)2·3H2O] (0.801 g – 53%, based on ligand) was then collected by filtration and washed three times with ethanol and dried at room temperature. The compounds were then activated at 120 °C prior to the experiment. Infrared spectra (KBr pellet,ν/cm−1, electro-synthesized HKUST-1): 3489–3386 (br), 1619 (vs), 1567 (s), 1447 (s), 1373 (vs), 1246 (s), 1187 (m), 1112 (m), 730 (vs), 491 (w).

The synthesis of CuBDC followed a procedure from literature.45An equimolar quantity of 1.053 g copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and 0.724 g terephthalic acid (C6H4(CO2H)2) were dissolved in 87 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF). This solution was placed in a closed scintillation flask in an oven at 110 °C for 36 h. Small blue precipitated crystals were visible inside the flask upon removal from the oven. After repeated centrifugation and washing, the light blue crystals of CuBDC was obtained. The compounds were then activated at 120 °C prior to the experiment.

The reaction was carried out in a Schlenk tube by adding 10 mol% of the HKUST-1 or CuBDC catalyst, followed by 0.4 mmol of the arylboronic acid reactant and 1 equivalent of base. The Schlenk tube was then sealed with a septum, evacuated, and heated with a heat gun to re-activate the catalyst. Subsequently, a mixture of ethanol and water (1 : 1) was addedviasyringe modified with a cannula.

For reactions under controlled atmospheres, N2or O2was introduced by inflating a balloon attached to the syringe with the respective gas, while reactions in open air were performed by removing the septum from the Schlenk tube. The reaction was carried out at 70 °C for 1.5 h.

The reaction products were extracted using brine water (saturated NaCl solution, 2 mL) and ethyl acetate (2 mL), and washed with ethyl acetate up to three times. The ethyl acetate layer was accumulated, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and purifiedviacolumn chromatography usingn-hexane as the eluent to isolate the protodeboronation product. The extracted ethyl acetate layer containing the protodeboronation products were directly transferred to a vial after adding an equimolar amount of mesitylene (0.4 mmol) before being analyzed by GC-MS (Agilent 7890A) for its GC yield. Mesitylene was used as an internal standard to compare the GC response of the obtained products.

For catalyst recycling procedure, after extraction, the aqueous layer was centrifuged up to three times. The water was then decanted to separate it from the precipitated catalyst, which was recovered for reuse in another run.

Reaction conditions: 4-tert-butylphenylboronic acid (0.4 mmol), Cu-MOFs (10 mol%), EtOH/H2O (1 mL/1 mL), O2, 70 °C, 1.5 h. GC yields were reported with mesitylene as an internal standard.

To further investigate the impact of the different Cu-MOF catalysts used in the model, a series of bases were tested using both Cu-MOF catalysts. The choice of base had significant impact on the outcome, as the HKUST-1-catalyzed reactions with bases such as KHCO3, CH3COOK, Na2CO3, NEt3, and K2CO3produced low to excellent yields (Table 1, entries 4–9). Similarly, the CuBDC-catalyzed reactions yielded comparable results to HKUST-1, with slight variations in yield on the same base systems (Table 1, entries 13–18). A slight modification was explored by reducing the equivalent amount of one of the base variants to 0.5 and 0.2 equivalents. The results were consistent for both Cu-MOF catalysts, showing that a decrease in the amount of base led to a corresponding reduction in the reaction yield (Table 1, entries 10, 11 and 19, 20). Thus, we selected K2CO3as the base for the next section of this research.

It is evident that protodeboronation can occur under various atmospheric conditions, including air,49O2,50and an inert N2atmosphere.51Optimal conditions for copper salt-catalyzed protodeboronation of arylboronic acids were previously investigated by Liuet al.who reported that the reaction proceeds more efficiently under an O2atmosphere compared to air or N2.28The same study also highlighted that the active species in the copper-catalyzed protodeboronation reaction was Cu(ii), with oxygen playing a crucial role as an oxidant to regenerate the Cu(ii) species after protodeboronation occurred. To determine if these principles apply to our Cu-MOF catalysts, we conducted an atmospheric investigation using the previously established reaction model (Table 2). The atmosphere itself indeed played a role in facilitating the protodeboronation reaction when Cu-MOFs were used as the catalyst instead of copper salts. Higher yields were obtained under an oxygen atmosphere rather than in nitrogen (Table 2, entries 2 and 5vs.3 and 6). Interestingly, the results with an air atmosphere led to a higher protodeboronation product for CuBDC rather than HKUST-1 (Table 2, entries 1 and 4). This finding was in line with our previous work, where the use of HKUST-1 for arylboronic acid homocoupling in a normal atmosphere promoted the formation of its hydroxylation product, where Ar–B(OH)2species is converted to Ar–OH, instead of the desired C–C coupling product. However, this side reaction could be prevented by conducting the reaction under an O2atmosphere.43This occurs due to the nature of HKUST-1, which can absorb moisture from the air into its structure and initiate the hydroxylation process.52Additionally, the use of polar protic solvents such as ethanol and water can further promote this hydroxylation reaction. The same hydroxylation product was also observed in our reactions using the CuBDC catalyst, which was also present in the work by Puthiarajet al., who applied the same catalyst for aerobic arylboronic acid homocoupling.53However, the amount of hydroxylation product found was smaller compared to that with HKUST-1. With these results, the HKUST-1 catalyst, K2CO3base, and O2atmosphere were selected as the optimized model for further experimentation.

Reaction conditions: 4-tert-butylphenylboronic acid (0.4 mmol), Cu-MOFs (10 mol%), K2CO3(1 eq.) EtOH/H2O (1 mL/1 mL), 70 °C, 1.5 h.

GC yields were reported with mesitylene as an internal standard.

Conversion based on remaining boronic reagents detected in GC.

Due to high volatility of fluorobenzene (2f), the reaction proceeds at 40 °C.

A similar effect was observed for bulkier substrates, including biphenyl-, 4-tert-butylphenyl-, and benzo[b]thien-2-ylboronic acids (1h, 1i, 1j), which yielded significant amounts of the corresponding protodeboronated products (Table 3, entries 8–10). Among electron-withdrawing substrates,p-fluorophenylboronic acid (1f) andp-bromophenylboronic acid (1g) also followed this trend, with the former yielding noticeably lower amounts, likely due to its smaller molecular size and lower reaction temperature (Table 3, entries 6 and 7).

To further investigate this behavior, we compared HKUST-1 with CuBDC as a catalyst for selected substrates (Table 3, entries 1, 2, 6, and 9). Interestingly,p-tolyl,m-tolyl, andp-fluorophenylboronic acids (1a, 1b, 1c) gave lower yields with CuBDC, while 4-tert-butylphenylboronic acid (1i) showed no significant difference between the two catalysts. An additional investigation was conducted to verify whether the small molecule was adsorbed into HKUST-1. To this end, 0.4 mmol of toluene was added as a substrate to 1 mL of ethanol containing 10 mol% of HKUST-1, and the mixture was stirred overnight. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis showed no detectable peak corresponding to toluene, confirming its adsorption into the MOF (Fig. S2.19). This supports the hypothesis that small molecules are more likely to be adsorbed within the MOF framework. Furthermore, steric effects play a role, aso-substituted substrates generally yielded lower amounts of product than theirp- andm-substituted counterparts.

In addition to arylboronic acids, we examined heteroarylboronic acids and alkenyl- and alkyl-based boronic acids to expand the substrate scope. Benzo[b]thien-2-ylboronic acid (1j) underwent successful protodeboronation with HKUST-1 (Table 3, entry 10). Meanwhile,trans-2-phenylvinylboronic acid (1k) gave a moderate yield of the protodeboronated product (2k), whereas the protodeboronation of phenethylboronic acid (1l) was not detected, and interestingly it shows a minor hydroxylation product was observed. We have previously reported that HKUST-1 can promote the hydroxylation of electron-rich aryl–B(OH)2under moist conditions in DMF, in the presence of O2and notably in the absence of base.43We believe that, in addition to minor formation of the hydroxylated byproduct of 1l, the majority of the resulting protodeboronation products may have remained adsorbed within the porous HKUST-1 framework, making them undetectable by standard GC-MS analysis.52–54To verify this, we performed the reaction under standard conditions using ethylbenzene. After 1.5 hours, and with mesitylene as an internal standard, no ethylbenzene was detected by GC-MS, indicating its complete adsorption by HKUST-1.

Finally, we evaluated boronic acid pinacol esters (–Bpin) as substrates (Table 3, entries 13 and 14). A bulkier substrate, 2-naphthyl-Bpin (1m), underwent protodeboronation with moderate efficiency (2m). In contrast, a smaller substrate,m-tolyl-Bpin (1n), yielded only trace amounts of toluene (2a). Two key factors contribute to the absence of detectable protodeboronation products ofm-tolyl-Bpin (1n) in the GC-MS analysis: (1) adsorption of toluene by HKUST-1, which reduces its volatility and recovery during analysis;52–54(2)in situformation of a boron–alkoxide adduct, such as [tolylBpin(OEt)]−, which is not amenable to GC-MS detection due to its ionic and non-volatile nature.

The latter has been demonstrated by Fernández and co-workers,57who showed that –Bpin species can readily form Lewis acid–base adducts with alkoxide anions generatedin situfrom the combination of carbonate bases and alcohols. These adducts are typically non-volatile and thus remain undetected under standard GC-MS conditions.

Lloyd-Jones and co-workers have previously reported that the protodeboronation of electron-rich aryl boronic acids proceedsviaa tetra-coordinate organoboronate intermediate formed through coordination with hydroxide.58This is followed by a rate-limiting proton transfer from a water molecule, resulting in C–B bond cleavage. Therefore, in our case (Table 3, entry 14), the sluggish reactivity ofm-tolyl-Bpin is likely halted at the stage of a stable boron–alkoxide adduct, which is undetectable by GC-MS.

To verify this, we conducted a control experiment in whichm-tolyl-Bpin was treated with K2CO3in an ethanol/water (1 : 1) mixture and stirred at 75 °C for 1.5 hours in the absence of the HKUST-1 catalyst. Under these conditions, and using a stoichiometric amount of mesitylene as an internal standard, neither the starting material nor the protodeboronation product was detected by GC-MS. It is also important to note that electron-rich aryl boronates generally exhibit greater resistance to protodeboronation than their electron-deficient counterparts. In a subsequent study,59the same group investigated electron-deficient aryl boronates, such as 2,6-difluorophenyl derivatives, and found that Bpin esters undergo the slowest protodeboronation among various boronate esters, including those derived from catechol, ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 2-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, neopentylglycol, and 2,4-dimethylpentan-2,4-diol. Thus, the protodeboronation of aryl-Bpin derivatives is generally more difficult than that of their corresponding boronic acid (–B(OH)2) analogues.

We propose that this protodeboronation reaction proceedsviaa bimetallic pathway (Scheme 3).43,53,60Initially, oxidation of complex A with oxygen generates Cu(iii) species, which then react with Ar–B(OH)2, H2O, and K2CO3to form intermediate B. This is followed by reductive elimination of the binuclear Cu(iii) complex, producing the protodeboronated product and regenerating the Cu(ii) catalyst in the presence of H2O, thereby sustaining the catalytic cycle.

We evaluated the recyclability of both HKUST-1 and CuBDC, as these MOFs function as heterogeneous catalysts and can be reused for subsequent reaction runs.43,53Interestingly, in a control reaction using 4-tert-butylphenylboronic acid (Fig. 1), both MOFs exhibited significant structural changes while still remaining recoverable from the reaction system. Fig. S3.1 shows that after use, HKUST-1 undergoes structural changes as indicated by the amorphous XRD pattern. In addition, the XRD pattern of CuBDC in Fig. S3.2 also shows structural changes after use and shows the characteristic peak of CuO. Nevertheless, the catalyst maintains a high protodeboronation yield for three consecutive runs, indicating that even the structural changed of the catalyst remains a viable copper source for catalysis.

To further investigate this, we conducted atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis on the reaction mixture to assess potential copper leaching (see S4 SI). The analysis detected 0.081 ppm of copper, corresponding to only 0.0024% of the initial copper content, confirming that the MOF structure underwent structural changes, releasing a minimal amount of copper into the reaction medium. Nevertheless, the catalyst remained catalytically active for protodeboronation.

Structural changes of MOFs under basic conditions have been previously reported by Yuanet al.who observed that MOFs composed of high-valency metal ions and carboxylate-based ligands are particularly susceptible to degradation in alkaline environments.61This instability arises from the low pKaof carboxylic acids, which, despite forming strong coordination bonds with high-valency metal ions, render these MOFs highly stable in acidic conditions but less so in basic media. In contrast, MOFs with high pKaligands, such as azolate-based ligands paired with low-valency metal ions, are better suited for alkaline environments.

In summary, copper-based metal–organic frameworks (Cu-MOFs), including HKUST-1 and CuBDC, exhibit exceptional catalytic efficiency in the protodeboronation of arylboronic acids. Under optimized conditions with K2CO3as a base and an O2atmosphere, product yields reached up to 98% for HKUST-1 and 95% for CuBDC. Substrate variations revealed that steric and electronic effects significantly influence reaction outcomes. Larger substrates generally achieved higher conversions compared to smaller ones, likely due to the adsorption of smaller protodeboronation products within the porous frameworks of HKUST-1 and CuBDC. Both catalysts demonstrated promising recyclability over three cycles, even though structural changes in basic environments occurred. These findings highlight the potential of Cu-MOFs as versatile and efficient catalysts for protodeboronation, expanding their applications in sustainable catalysis.
