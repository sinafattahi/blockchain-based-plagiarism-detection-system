Six novel stilbene fluorescent whitening agents bearing aminoethyl methacrylate groups were synthesized. Their molecular orbital energy levels, thermal stability, dyeing performance, and surface-finishing efficacy on cotton fibers were systematically characterized. The resulting compounds6a-fexhibited high thermal decomposition temperatures and low orbital energy differences, contributing to exceptional whitening and surface finishing effects on pure cotton. Treated fibers achieved a whiteness value of 127.49—a 50.81 unit increase over untreated cotton. The yellow/blue index decreased by 10.82, confirming significant whitening and color enhancement. Moreover, fiber surfaces displayed improved smoothness, indicating effective finishing. Among these, Compound6ademonstrated optimal performance and emerges as a promising multifunctional material for simultaneous high efficiency whitening and surface finishing.

Fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) enhance substrate whiteness by absorbing short wavelength invisible ultraviolet light and emitting long wavelength visible blue light1–4. Owing to their high efficacy and low cost5, FWAs are extensively utilized in diverse fields including textiles, plastics, papermaking, inks, coatings, fluorescent probes, and organic transistors6–14, significantly improving color performance in industrial applications15. Among these, stilbene FWAs representing 60% of the global FWA market and 80% of production are particularly favored for their high performance and straightforward synthesis. However, these agents exhibit critical limitations: susceptibility to cis-trans isomerization, inherent monofunctionality, and lack of intrinsic multifunctional performance.

Cotton fiber, a natural plant cellulose, offers significant advantages including biodegradability, antistatic properties, antimicrobial resistance, and skin compatibility. Fabrics woven from cotton exhibit superior moisture absorption and breathability, enhancing wearer comfort and driving strong market preference. However, prolonged sunlight exposure induces photodegradation16,17: absorbed short-wavelength light triggers photooxidation, damaging fiber molecular structure and compromising surface smoothness. While comfort remains essential, consumers increasingly demand wrinkle-resistant aesthetics. Native cotton fabrics suffer from low strength, high wrinkling propensity, and deformation susceptibility. Critically, repeated laundering with alkaline detergents degrades inherent elasticity and smoothness18,19, causing irreversible hardening and dimensional instability. To address these limitations, conventional processing employs physical or chemical whitening20,21, followed by softening treatments22,23to enhance flexibility, color vibrancy, and surface compliance.

Carboxylic acid is a commonly used surface finishing agent in the textile industry. It can undergo esterification or cross-linking with hydroxyl groups in fiber molecules, forming a network structure and a hydrophobic oil film on the fabric surface, effectively preventing significant displacement or deformation of cellulose molecules under external forces, thereby enhancing their flexibility and acting as a softener24–27. However, traditional solutions are very cumbersome and time-consuming, and there is an urgent need to develop functional materials that integrate whitening and surface finishing. Stilbene FWAs are a type of continuous conjugated system with multiple aromatic rings, which can enhance their application performance by changing the substituents on the parent skeleton. They are widely used for whitening and coloring cotton textiles28–32. Aminoethyl methacrylate is often grafted onto gel for protein adsorption33, used as a carrier to synthesize N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer34, and prepared thermal responsive nano gel for drug delivery system35.

2-Aminoethyl methacrylate molecule has a linear rigid structure and hydrophobic ester groups, which can effectively hinder the isomerization of stilbene FWAs, enhance their trans monomer stability, and form a flexible oil film on the matrix material, thereby acting as soft finishing agent. Meanwhile, grafting amino acids into stilbene matrix can interact with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and also soften cotton textiles. In this work, stilbene FWAs6a-fcontaining aminoethyl methacrylate groups were synthesized, and their thermal stability, whitening effect, surface finishing effect were investigated. This study aims to screen multifunctional stilbene FWAs optimized for cotton fibers, thereby advancing the development of next-generation functional textiles through integrated theoretical and technical frameworks.

Stilbene FWAs6a-fbearing aminoethyl methacrylate groups were synthesized from 4,4’-diaminostilbene-2,2’-disulphonic acid, 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine, 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride, and amino alcohols and amino acidsviaa three-step condensation sequence with 85–93% yield. Synthetic routes, UV spectral data, and yields are provided in Scheme1and Table1.

Density functional theory calculations were performed on the molecular structure of the target products, and the RB3LYP density functional method with the 6-31G (d) basis set for optimization. Figure1presents the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of compounds6a-f. Frontier molecular orbital analysis reveals HOMO electron density primarily localized on the triazine ring, benzene rings, and the central stilbene C = C bond. LUMO spatial distribution closely mirrors the HOMO, indicating consistent electronic delocalization across the π-conjugated framework. The size order of the HOMO-LUMO orbital gap (EL-EH) of compounds is6b>6e>6d>6c>6a>6f. A smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap facilitates electronic transitions, enhancing molecular reactivity while reducing stability. Computational results reveal compounds6aand6fexhibit narrow energy gaps with 3.911 and 3.677 eV, respectively, promoting facile electron transfer. This heightened reactivity enables covalent bonding with cotton fibers and other substrates, resulting in superior dyeing performance.

Solution of compounds6a-fwith a concentration of 2 × 10− 5g/mL was prepared using ultrapure water, and recorded the UV absorption data using a UV visible spectrophotometer. As shown in Fig.2, compounds6a-fexhibited strong UV absorption peaks in the range of 300–420 nm, with maximum trans absorption located at 346, 348 and 350 nm, respectively. Among these, compounds6a,6b,6d, and6fdisplayed maximum trans absorption peaks at 348 nm. The maximum trans absorption peak of compound6ccontaining two electron withdrawing carboxyl groups in its molecule was located at 350 nm, with a red shift of 2 nm. Due to the increase in carbon chain length, compound6egrafted with aminobutyric acid exhibited a blue shift of 2 nm in its UV absorption peak, with the maximum trans absorption peak located at 346 nm. Stilbene FWAs exhibit both cis and trans configurations, with the trans-isomer serving as the fluorescent active species. Compounds6a-fshow no detectable cis absorption peaks, indicating effective suppression of isomerization. This is attributed to steric hindrance from the rigid methacrylate-aminoethyl substituents, which stabilize the trans-conformation. Consequently, these FWAs maintain stable fluorescent trans-monomers and demonstrate exceptional whitening persistence.

Fluorescent materials should have excellent thermal stability and be suitable for the heat treatment process. The thermal stability of compounds6a-fwas evaluated using a thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10℃/min within the temperature range of 30–600℃. As shown in Figs.3and4, the weight loss curves of compounds6aand6c,6e, and6fbefore 192 and 254℃ were relatively flat. Compounds6band6dwere functionalized with amino acetic acid and amino propionic acid group. Due to the short carbon chain, the structural stability was poor, and the sample lost slightly more weight before 254℃. Compound6a, due to the grafting of diethanolamine group exhibited a decrease in heat stability after 192℃, resulting in molecular decomposition and loss of significant weight. Compounds6c,6e, and6funderwent a gentle weight loss period and only began to increase in weight loss after 254℃. Overall, the thermal stability of compounds6b-fgrafted with amino acid group was higher than that of compound6agrafted with diethanolamine. The experimental results indicated that compounds6a-fhad good thermal stability and were suitable for the thermal processing of fibers.

Solvent properties critically influence FWA molecular conformation and photophysical behavior. FWAs are often added to different industrial products, and different product systems have different solvent requirements. Testing the UV absorption performance of FWAs in different solvents can help determine their applicability in actual products. Compounds6a-fwere prepared into solution with concentration of 2 × 10− 5g/mL using methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol (IPA), and acetonitrile (ACN), and UV absorption data were recorded for testing. As shown in Fig.5, the difference in solvent polarity showed significant impact on the absorption intensity and peak position. The UV absorption intensity of compounds6a-fincreased with the increase of solvent polarity, following the order MeOH > EtOH > IPA > ACN. Especially isopropanol had obvious impact on the UV absorption properties of compounds6a-f. Compound6agrafted with diethanolamine exhibited the greatest blue shift in UV absorption wavelength, with the absorption peak located at 342 nm. Compounds6b-fwere grafted with carboxyl groups of different carbon chain lengths and quantities, resulting in significant differences in their absorption peak positions and intensities. Compound6cgrafted with iminodiacetic acid contained two strongly electron withdrawing carboxyl groups in its molecular structure, resulting in a significant red shift of its maximum absorption peak wavelength, located at 356 nm. Compounds6eand6fshowed longer carbon chain amino acids grafted onto their molecules, resulting in a blue shift in their absorption wavelength, with the maximum absorption peak appearing at 348 nm. Experimental results demonstrated that the UV absorption performance of compounds6a-fwas not only related to the polarity of the solvent, but also to the properties of the grafting groups in the molecule, especially with strong UV absorption in methanol.

As quantified in Table2, cotton fibers treated with compounds6a-fachieved exceptional whitening and chromatic enhancement versus untreated controls. When the dyeing concentration of compounds6aand6bwas 0.2%, the whiteness of cotton fibers increased from 76.68 to 119.98 and 98.13, and the b* value decreased from 3.14 to -6.01 and − 1.31. When the concentration of6aand6bincreased to 0.6%, the whiteness of cotton fibers reached 127.49 and 103.93, respectively. Compared with the untreated sample, the whiteness significantly increased by 50.71 and 27.25, and the b* value decreased by 10.82 and 5.75, respectively, achieving the best whitening and color enhancement effect. As the concentration further increases, the whiteness gradually decreases, the b* value increases, and the dyeing effect weakens. This is mainly due to the uneven distribution of FWAs on the surface of cotton fibers at excessively high concentrations, which increases light scattering and affects the whitening and color enhancement effect. At low concentrations, compounds6dand6eexhibited excellent whitening effects, but their concentration dependence was minimal. When the dyeing concentration was 0.1%, the whiteness of cotton fibers significantly increased to 102.03 and 104.17. However, when the concentration increased to 0.5%, the whiteness of the treated cotton fibers were 103.59 and 106.03, respectively. The whiteness values only increased by 1.55 and 1.85, and the improvement was not significant. This is because the reactivity of6dand6ewith fiber groups is low, and the dye absorption rate is also low, which is consistent with theoretical calculations. Compared to others, compound6chad the worst dyeing and whitening effect. When the staining concentration was 0.2%, the whiteness value of the treated sample was 85.80. When the concentration was 0.6%, the whiteness value only increased by 5.38. This is mainly due to the presence of four electron withdrawing carboxyl groups in the molecule, which weakens its fluorescence activity. Among the series, compound6aemerged as the optimal FWA, exhibiting excellent reactivity and staining effect on fiber molecules. At 0.1% application concentration,6aachieved a whiteness value of 116.88 on cotton fibers. When optimized to its ideal concentration (0.6%), the whiteness increased by 50.81 and the b* value decreased by 10.82 versus untreated controls. The synthesized stilbene FWAs contain multiple functional groups, have good water solubility, and are also suitable for high-end fields such as fluorescent probes, anti-counterfeiting printing, dye laser materials, etc.

Whiteness and chromaticity indices of cotton fibers dyed with compounds6a-f.

Chromaticity indices are measured by L*, a*, and b* values. The brightness index L* represents the color brightness coordinate, where L* of 0 indicates all black and L* of 100 indicates pure white. The chromaticity indices a* and b* represent chromaticity coordinates, where a* > 0 indicates reddish tint and a* < 0 indicates greenish tint; b* > 0 indicates yellowish tint, while b* < 0 indicates bluish tint.

To further evaluate the dyeing performance of stilbene FWAs6a-f, cotton fibers treated with 0.6% dyeing solutions were analyzed for fluorescent reflectance using a box-type ultraviolet analyzer under 365 nm UV light. As shown in Figs.6(a)-(f), cotton fibers treated with compounds6a-fall exhibited bright fluorescence, demonstrating their excellent fluorescent properties. Specifically, fibers treated with compounds6a,6e, and6f(Figs.6a, e, f) displayed particularly strong and uniform fluorescence, with6ashowing the greatest intensity-consistent with the whiteness test results. In contrast, fibers treated with compound6c(Fig.6c) showed weaker fluorescence, suggesting reduced deposition of the whitening agent on the fiber surface and diminished fluorescence performance due to the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups. Further analysis revealed that the four carboxyl groups in6csignificantly improved its water solubility, which consequently reduced its adsorption on cotton fibers. Despite this variation, all treated fabrics exhibited pronounced fluorescence, demonstrating that stilbene FWAs6a-feffectively functioned as FWAs for cotton substrates.

The finishing agent forms a continuous oily film on fabric surfaces by reducing fiber surface tension, improving elasticity, and decreasing deformation rebound. This enhances wrinkle resistance while preserving cotton fibers’ structural integrity. Additionally, it improves color stability and yields softer, smoother fabric hand feel. The stilbene FWAs6a-fgrafted with acrylic ester and carboxyl groups have potential surface finishing and anti wrinkle repair effects on cotton fibers. Cotton fibers treated with 0.6% dye concentration of compounds6a-eand naturally dried were analyzed for morphological changes using scanning electron microscopy and compared with untreated samples. As shown in Figs.7(b)-(f), the surfaces of cotton fibers treated with compounds6a-ewas smoother and flatter, and the wrinkled areas were effectively repaired. In contrast, untreated fibers (Fig.7a) display characteristic surface roughness, prominent cracking, and severe wrinkling-morphological features associated with increased susceptibility to deformation during mechanical stress. Comparative analysis revealed that compound6ainduced superior morphological restoration of cotton fiber surfaces, attributable to enhanced fiber interaction and formation of a continuous protective film. This effect is evidenced by Fig.7b, which shows significantly reduced surface defects compared to untreated fibers (Fig.7a). Experimental results validated that stilbene FWAs6a-fgrafted with methyl methacrylate amino ethyl ester groups showed excellent whitening and surface finishing effects on cotton fibers, and were potential high-performance multifunctional optical materials.

To develop multifunctional FWAs with combined whitening and surface-finishing properties, we designed and synthesized a series of novel stilbene derivatives6a-fincorporating aminoethyl methacrylate functional groups. Structural characterization of these compounds was performed using ¹H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Their optical properties were evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopy, while thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) assessed thermal stability. All synthesized compounds demonstrated significant whitening and surface-modification effects on cotton fibers. Notably, compound6aexhibited superior performance as a bifunctional agent, showing exceptional fluorescence whitening efficiency along with excellent surface-finishing capabilities. These results suggest that6arepresents a promising high-performance additive for textile applications, combining optical brightening and fiber protection in a single molecular architecture.

Then the mixture continued to react for 2 h at 0–5℃. The reaction mixture was heated to 30℃, slowly added an aqueous solution (4 mL) containing 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (1.28 mmol), and small amount of antioxidant sodium sulfite. Then the reaction mixture was heated to 40–45℃, maintained the pH at 6–7 with saturated sodium carbonate, and continued to react for 6 h. The aqueous solution (5 mL) containing amino alcohol or amino acid (1.28 mmol) was dropped into the reaction mixture, raising the temperature to 90–95℃, maintaining the pH at 8–9 with saturated sodium carbonate, and continuing the reaction for 8 h. The three-step reaction process was tracked using thin-layer chromatography, with isopropanol: acetonitrile: ammonia solution = 5:2:3 as the developing agent (V/V). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the pH was adjusted to 3–4 with dilute hydrochloric acid (10%). An appropriate amount of sodium chloride was added, stirred, and filtered. The filter cake was washed successively with ice water and ethanol to obtain aminoethyl methacrylate functionalized stilbene FWAs6a-f, light yellow solid with yield of 85–93%.

Dye solutions with concentrations of 0.10%, 0.20%, 0.30%, 0.40%, 0.50%, 0.60%, and 0.70% of compounds6a-fwere prepared and the bath ratio was 1:50. Cotton fibers were placed in a dyeing bucket and dyed at 20℃, and the dyeing solution was heated by a rate of 2℃/min until the temperature reached 50℃, and then continued to dye for 15 min at this temperature. The stained sample was taken out, washed three times with cold distilled water, dried it naturally at room temperature, and tested for whiteness and chromaticity index.

The whiteness value (CIE) and chromaticity index of untreated and dyed pure cotton fiber samples were investigated using a multifunctional whiteness meter with a D65 light source and a viewing angle of 10°.
