This study aimed to explore the relationship between the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI, a composite indicator of albumin and lymphocyte count reflecting nutritional and immune status) and inflammatory cytokines in predicting infections among liver failure patients, and to construct a predictive model based on these indicators.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 163 patients with liver failure admitted to our hospital between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were categorized into an Infection group and a Non-infection group based on the presence of concurrent infections. Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Indicators with significant differences were evaluated for collinearity. Non-collinear factors were selected for a logistic regression model to identify infection predictors. Statistically significant variables were used to create a risk prediction nomogram using R software, with internal validation performed.

Statistically Significant differences (P< 0.05) were observed between the two groups in terms of C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI, a novel inflammatory biomarker), PNI, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). No collinearity was detected1 (VIF ≤ 10,tolerance ≥ 0.1). Logistic regression analysis identified CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, and APACHE II as risk factors for infection (OR > 1,P< 0.05), while PNI was a protective factor (OR < 1,P< 0.05). These five variables were incorporated into a nomogram-based predictive model. The model demonstrated excellent performance, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.927–0.993), indicating high predictive accuracy.

CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, PNI, and APACHE II scores are independent predictors of infection in liver failure patients. These indicators can be used to identify high-risk populations, providing a theoretical basis for implementing appropriate clinical interventions.

Liver failure is a severe end-stage liver condition resulting from various etiologies such as viral infections, alcohol abuse, or drug-induced damage. It significantly impairs essential hepatic functions, including synthesis, excretion, and biotransformation. Common symptoms include coagulation disorders, jaundice, hepatorenal syndrome, and ascites [1]. Previous studies [2] have shown that liver failure advances quickly, presents intricate pathologies, and carries a significant mortality risk. In addition, patients with liver failure often suffer from malnutrition and immunosuppression, increasing their susceptibility to infections [3]. Infection is a frequent and serious complication in patients with liver failure and is a major contributor to poor short-term prognosis. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of liver failure with concurrent infection can significantly improve patient survival rates [4,5]. Therefore, establishing an effective predictive model to identify the risk of infection at an early stage is of considerable clinical importance and research value.

The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a clinical tool that reflects both the nutritional and immune status of patients. First proposed by Onodera et al. in 1984, PNI was initially designed to assess the relationship between baseline nutritional status and postoperative complications in 200 malnourished gastrointestinal cancer patients. It is calculated based on serum albumin levels and total peripheral lymphocyte count [6–8]. According to Ding P et al. [9], PNI was originally used to evaluate the nutritional and immune status of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. In recent years, the application of PNI has gradually expanded. As a tool for nutritional assessment and a prognostic indicator for infection, it has been increasingly applied in clinical practice. Inflammatory cytokines also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver failure. They are deeply involved in the occurrence, progression, and tissue damage associated with liver failure, particularly during bacterial infections. Hassan et al. [10] noted that cytokines production is a critical step in the inflammatory response. As liver failure progresses, a large number of cytokines are released into the circulation, leading to the endothelial dysfunction and promoting the migration of neutrophils and monocytes. These immune cells, once activated, release proteases and cytotoxic mediators, further exacerbating tissue damage and contributing to severe infections.

Currently, most predictive models for concurrent infection in patients with liver failure rely solely on clinical indicators. However, their predictive performance remains suboptimal. Studies on the application of PNI and inflammatory markers in predicting concurrent infection in liver failure patients are relatively limited. Based on this, this study conducted a retrospective analysis of liver failure patients in our hospital to propose a novel predictive model based on PNI and inflammatory cytokines. This model aimed to provide new evidence and methods for the early diagnosis and treatment of concurrent infection in liver failure patients, improve patient outcomes, and offer new approaches and perspectives for predicting concurrent infection in patients with other types of liver diseases.

This retrospective study included 163 patients with liver failure who received treatment at our hospital from January 2020 to December 2023. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital. All procedures adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.

(1) Diagnosed and staged with liver failure according to the diagnostic criteria outlined in theGuidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Failureissued by the Chinese Society of Hepatology [11]; (2) Had complete clinical data; (3) Aged > 18 years; (4) Had no concurrent neurological diseases or cognitive impairments; (5) Development of new-onset infections during hospitalization.

Clinical data of patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were collected through the hospital information management system. All enrolled patients had complete clinical and laboratory data with no missing values. For variables with partial missingness, complete case analysis (CCA) was used for statistical analysis. Patients’ age and gender, smoking history (defined as consumption of more than one cigarette per day for over one year or cessation within the past year), drinking history (defined as intake of more than one standard drink per day for over one year or cessation within the past year; one standard drink equates to 45 mL of spirits, 360 mL of beer, or 120 mL of wine), diagnosis of hyperlipidemia (based on theJapan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Hyperlipidemia in Japanese Adults[12]), diagnosis of hypertension (based on theJapanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for Self-monitoring of Blood Pressure at Home (Second Edition)[13], diagnosis of diabetes (diagnosed according to theApplication of the Chinese Expert Consensus on Diabetes Classification in Clinical Practice[14]), use of corticosteroids (yes/no), long-term use of antibiotics (yes/no), etiology of liver failure (Hepatitis B/alcoholic), medical setting (Intensive Care Unit [ICU]/non-ICU), type of liver failure (Acute Liver Failure/Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure).

On the examination day, fasting venous blood samples (3 mL) were collected from all patients. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the serum. White blood cell count (WBC) and platelet (PLT) count were measured using an automated hematology analyzer (D5-CRP, Shenzhen Dymind Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) with corresponding reagents. Serum albumin levels and peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were assessed using an automated biochemical analyzer (BK-200, Shandong Biobase Biotech Co., Ltd.). The PNI was calculated as: PNI = Serum Albumin (g/L) + 5 × Peripheral Lymphocyte Count (×10⁹/L).

The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured using an Olympus AU640 automated biochemical analyzer.

On the examination day, 3 mL of fasting venous blood was collected from each patient. The blood was clotted naturally at room temperature for 10–20 min, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The serum was then separated and stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to measure levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), Neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts were also determined. The Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI) was calculated as: SIRI = (Neutrophil Count × Monocyte Count) / Lymphocyte Count.

The research team assessed patients using the APACHE II scoring system [15]. This system comprises three components. Acute Physiology Score (APS): 12 physiological parameters were evaluated, including temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and blood gas analysis results. Scores were assigned to each parameter based on its deviation from normal values. Age: Scores were allocated according to the patient’s age, with higher scores given to older patients. Chronic Health Status: Scores were assigned based on the presence of severe chronic organ failure or immunosuppression. The total APACHE II score ranged from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.

The diagnosis of infection was based on the following criteria: ① Presence of infection-related clinical symptoms, such as fever (>38℃), cough, sputum production, respiratory failure, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, intra-abdominal hypertension, diarrhea, frequent urination, urgency, or dysuria. ② Positive blood culture or isolation of pathogenic organisms from bodily fluids or secretions (e.g., sputum, ascites, urine). ③ Chest X-ray or CT showing newly developed or progressive infiltrates or consolidation; routine analysis of body fluids such as urine sediment or ascites indicating a WBC > 10 × 10⁹/L or < 4 × 10⁹/L. A diagnosis of concurrent infection was made when all cases met at least two clinical criteria (e.g., fever + radiological evidence) and one microbiological criterion (e.g., positive culture).

Data was collected regarding the incidence of infections among patients, followed by a comparative analysis of clinical data between the Infection and Non-infection groups. Variables with statistically significant differences in univariate analysis were further tested for collinearity. Variables without collinearity were included in multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent infection risk factors. These variables were then used to construct a nomogram for predicting infection risk.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of continuous variables. Data with a normal distribution were expressed as () and compared using the t-test, while non-normally distributed data were expressed as M (Q1, Q2), and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as n and compared using the χ² test.P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Among the 163 included patients, the missing rate for key variables was less than 5%. Missing values were handled using multiple imputation (MI), and consistency between the imputed and original data distributions was verified. No patients were excluded due to missing key variables. Univariate analysis was used to identify variables with significant differences (P< 0.05), and continuous variables were checked for multicollinearity using variance inflation factor (VIF ≤ 10, tolerance ≥ 0.1) before being included in the logistic regression model. Logistic regression was then used to analyze factors associated with infection. Stepwise or penalized regression methods were not employed to avoid overreliance on statistical significance at the expense of clinical relevance. Variables that were statistically significant in the regression analysis were selected as predictors for the nomogram, which was constructed using R language version x64 4.1.3 and relevant external packages. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated via bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations) to internally validate the risk prediction model.

Among the 163 liver failure patients, 43 (26.38%) developed infections and were categorized into the Infection group, while 120 (73.62%) did not and were placed in the Non-infection group. Significant differences emerged between the two groups in CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, PNI, and APACHE II scores (Z= 5.161, 5.069,t= 6.343, 6.079, 6.655, respectively;P< 0.05, Table1).

Note:WBC = white blood cell count; PLT = platelet count; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; ALT = alanine aminotransferase; CRP = C-reactive protein; sTREM-1 = soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1; SIRI = systemic inflammatory response index; PNI = prognostic nutritional index; APACHE II score = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), as appropriate. Thet-test was used for normally distributed variables, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed variables.

The occurrence of infection in liver failure patients was set as the dependent variable (0 = no infection, 1 = infection), while the observed values of CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, PNI, and APACHE II scores were set as independent variables. Collinearity diagnostics indicated no evidence of multicollinearity (VIF ≤ 10, Tolerance ≥ 0.1), supporting the inclusion of all five variables in the logistic regression model (Table2).

Note:CRP = C-reactive protein; sTREM-1 = soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1; SIRI = systemic inflammatory response index; PNI = prognostic nutritional index; APACHE II score = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, and APACHE II scores as risk factors for infection in liver failure patients(OR= 1.114、1.132、13.762、1.259, 95%CI= 1.071–1.159、1.080–1.186、4.923–38.472、1.155–1.372, allP<0.05). Conversely, PNI was identified as a protective factor (OR= 0.843, 95%CI= 0.789 ∼ 0.902,P<0.05, Table3).

Note:CRP = C-reactive protein; sTREM-1 = soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1; SIRI = systemic inflammatory response index; PNI = prognostic nutritional index; APACHE II score = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score.

Based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, five independent factors—CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, PNI, and APACHE II scores—were identified as predictors. These variables were incorporated into a nomogram to provide a visual and individualized assessment of the likelihood of short-term adverse outcomes in patients. The total score, obtained by summing the points assigned to each variable, corresponds to the scale at the bottom of the nomogram, as illustrated in Fig.1.

To assess the predictive accuracy of our model, internal validation was performed by plotting the ROC curve. The analysis yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.960, with a 95% CI ranging from 0.927 to 0.993. The nomogram-based prediction model demonstrated good discriminatory ability for infection in patients with liver failure and showed high consistency with the actual risk, as shown in Fig.2.

In China, liver failure predominantly manifests as acute-on-chronic (subacute) liver failure and chronic liver failure. This condition is severe, with numerous complications, treatment challenges, and high mortality rates. The incidence predominantly affects males, with the majority of cases occurring in young and middle-aged adults. Infection is a significant contributor to the elevated mortality in liver failure patients. Early and accurate prediction of infection is crucial for timely intervention and improved prognosis. Studies have shown that CRP is a type of acute-phase protein in plasma that rises sharply when the body encounters infection or tissue damage. It activates the complement system and enhances the phagocytic activity of phagocytes, thereby playing a regulatory role in clearing pathogens invading the body, as well as removing damaged, necrotic, or apoptotic tissue cells. sTREM-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of neutrophils, mature monocytes, and macrophages. SIRI is a vital evaluation indicator for the occurrence and development of inflammatory responses in the body. This process is triggered by both infectious and non-infectious factors. These stimuli activate the host immune system, leading to the release of humoral and cellular mediators and ultimately inducing excessive inflammation. All of these are important evaluation indicators for the occurrence and development of inflammatory responses in the body [15–18](16–18). Based on the statistical results of this study, it was observed that the levels of CRP, sTREM-1, and SIRI in the Infection group were significantly higher than those in the Non-infection group. All three indicators were identified as risk factors for infection in liver failure patients (OR > 1,P< 0.05). Analysis revealed that CRP, sTREM-1, and SIRI are all involved in the initiation and progression of the host immune response. Hypoalbuminemia prolongs the half-life of CRP, an acute-phase protein whose synthesis depends on hepatocellular function. In liver failure, impaired hepatocyte synthesis leads to abnormal CRP levels. Elevated CRP, upon binding to the complement system, activates phagocytes and promotes monocyte chemotaxis, thereby exacerbating immune and inflammatory responses. This process not only aggravates liver injury but also inhibits hepatocyte regeneration and complement activation, contributing to hepatocyte death in liver failure patients and weakening the host’s anti-infective defense mechanisms, ultimately increasing the risk of infection [19]. As a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors, sTREM-1 is upregulated in liver failure patients, where intestinal microbial translocation activates the expression of STREM-1 on monocytes. During the inflammatory response, sTREM-1 is released into the bloodstream. Its abnormal elevation promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines—such as IL-1β and TNF-α—by activating receptors on neutrophils and monocytes as well as via the TLR4 signaling pathway. Particularly, excessive activation of neutrophils and monocytes may result in tissue injury and immune dysfunction, triggering an exaggerated inflammatory response. This in turn disrupts intestinal barrier function, increases the risk of bacterial translocation, and ultimately elevates infection risk and severity. These findings are consistent with the views of Sinha S et al. [20]. Furthermore, according to Gavriilidis P et al. [21], the SIRI, which integrates neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, reflects multiple aspects of the inflammatory response and provides a more comprehensive assessment of the systemic inflammatory status. In patients with liver failure, the body exhibits a hypersensitive inflammatory state, characterized by massive release of complement components and inflammatory mediators, resulting in a cascading inflammatory response that exacerbates hepatic injury and leads to elevated SIRI levels. An increased SIRI indicates a strong inflammatory response and bone marrow overactivation, while lymphopenia suggests adaptive immune suppression. Together, these phenomena lead to impaired immune surveillance and immune imbalance, thereby increasing the risk of infection in patients with liver failure. These findings suggest that hepatic synthetic dysfunction and gut–liver axis dysregulation are core driving factors. Along with inflammatory dysregulation, they form a closely interrelated vicious cycle of “inflammation–immunity–metabolism.” Therefore, monitoring inflammatory markers and implementing targeted interventions are crucial for improving clinical outcomes.

PNI, first introduced by Onodera et al., which also called the “Onodera Index”, directly reflects serum albumin levels and lymphocyte count, and is an essential parameter for assessing nutritional status and predicting prognosis. It was initially used to evaluate nutrition and immune states in gastrointestinal surgery patients. Recently, it has become a prognostic indicator for gastrointestinal cancers, gynecological tumors, and lung cancer. PNI is also used in non-cancer conditions such as fractures, heart failure, and cerebral infarction [22]. This study showed significant differences in PNI between the Infection and Non-infection groups. PNI was found to be a protective factor against infection in liver failure patients (OR < 1,P< 0.05). These findings are consistent with Zhang X et al. [23], the association may be due to the nutritional deficiencies common in liver failure patients. According to Peng YC et al. [24], disruptions in nutritional metabolism are closely linked to prognosis. These disruptions involve complex interactions with the immune system.

PNI incorporates both serum albumin levels and lymphocyte count, thus reflecting both nutritional and inflammatory status. It serves as an effective indicator for evaluating nutritional condition. A decreased PNI suggests reduced protein levels and lymphocyte count. Lower albumin impairs the synthesis of complement components C3 and C4, weakening opsonization, phagocytosis, and overall immune function. Lymphopenia may lead to Th1/Th2 imbalance and reduced pathogen clearance, resulting in decreased cytokine secretion and systemic inflammatory responses triggered by oxidative stress. This may upregulate TLR4 expression on hepatocytes, promote endotoxin translocation into the portal vein, inhibit the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), weaken bacterial capture, increase plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and exacerbate intestinal barrier dysfunction. Moreover, serum albumin is synthesized by the liver and serves as a reliable indicator of the body’s nutritional status. Hypoalbuminemia can compromise systemic immune function and promote the spread of inflammation. By enhancing protein catabolism, it disrupts the balance between protein degradation and synthesis, thereby impairing the body’s ability to eliminate pathogens. The phagocytic activity of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils is also suppressed, weakening the host’s immune defense. Consequently, bacteria and their products in the gut are more likely to translocate into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of infection, aligned with the findings of Lee YF et al. [25]. Thus, patients with lower PNI may face a higher risk of infection due to weakened immunity. Improving nutritional status and increasing PNI are essential for preventing and managing infections in liver failure patients.

The APACHE II scoring system was first introduced in 1985. It includes acute physiological scores (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate), age scores, and chronic health scores. It is widely used to assess disease severity, guide treatment, evaluate outcomes, control quality, and allocate resources to critically ill patients. Higher scores indicate more severe illness, poorer prognosis, and higher mortality risk. APACHE II also predicts expected mortality rates, aiding in prognosis [26]. This study found significantly higher APACHE II scores in the Infection group compared to the Non-infection group. APACHE II was identified as a risk factor for infection (OR > 1,P< 0.05). The score incorporates multiple immunity-related parameters. Liver failure patients often experience immune dysfunction. High APACHE II scores suggest abnormal WBC and a higher likelihood of infection. The APACHE II score includes indicators for organ dysfunction, with the liver playing a key role in clearing bacteria and toxins. The liver contains many Kupffer cells that phagocytize and eliminate bacteria, viruses, cellular debris, and other foreign substances from the bloodstream. It is also the main site for drug metabolism. Through enzymatic reactions, such as those in the cytochrome P450 system, the liver converts fat-soluble toxins into water-soluble substances that are easier to excrete. An abnormally high APACHE II score suggests severe liver dysfunction and higher overall disease severity. This also indicates an increased risk of infection in patients [27,28]. Boyacı Dundar N et al. [29] stated that the APACHE II score is widely used to assess the condition of patients in intensive care units. Patients with higher scores are more prone to infections, which supports the findings of this study.

The nomogram is an intuitive and effective predictive tool that plays a significant role in medical research and clinical practice by enhancing the interpretability and clinical applicability of prediction models. Previous studies have demonstrated that predictive models constructed using the PNI, inflammatory markers, and the SIRI integrate both nutritional and inflammatory dimensions, thus more comprehensively reflecting the pathological characteristics of immune-metabolic imbalance. These models have shown significantly higher AUC values compared to traditional models [30,31]. This indicates that innovatively combining PNI, inflammatory marker models, and SIRI to develop a prediction model for infection risk in patients with liver failure holds considerable clinical value. In this study, the nomogram allows visualization of infection risk in liver failure patients, with the levels of each indicator corresponding to changes in predicted probability. Meanwhile, the ROC curve serves as a graphical tool for evaluating the performance of classification models. By plotting ROC curves and calculating AUC values, this study assessed the predictive accuracy of each indicator. The results showed an AUC of 0.960 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.927–0.993, indicating a high degree of consistency between the predicted risk and actual clinical outcomes.

This prediction system, which integrates PNI and inflammatory cytokines, provides a multidimensional reflection of the immune-inflammatory balance, elucidating the unique immune microenvironment of liver failure. Compared with traditional infection markers, it enables earlier identification of subclinical infection risk, offering a more organ-specific and time-sensitive evaluation tool and a new approach for precision infection control in liver failure patients.

① In the order-entry interface, we propose integrating an intelligent trigger mechanism and designing a structured data entry template that tags key variables. Upon ordering specific tests, the system will automatically retrieve relevant parameters and generate a risk assessment pop-up window.

② At diagnostic and treatment checkpoints, the system will guide the clinical workflow as follows: patient consultation → data entry → automatic generation of a risk curve → interpretation of results (with green/yellow/red alerts) → generation of treatment decision trees, thereby supporting clinicians in diagnosis and therapeutic planning and improving clinical efficiency.

Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. First, due to its retrospective design, the data were not collected specifically for research purposes, which may have resulted in missing or incomplete data. Certain variables, such as corticosteroid dosage and prior infection history, were not fully documented, potentially affecting the reliability of the study conclusions. Additionally, the retrospective nature precludes the establishment of causal relationships and limits control over confounding factors, allowing only the observation of associations between variables. However, we attempted to minimize confounding bias by comprehensively collecting clinical information and performing collinearity analyses. Second, sTREM-1 measurement currently relies on ELISA technology, which is not yet widely implemented in clinical laboratories. Nevertheless, point-of-care testing (POCT) technology has enabled rapid bedside detection of sTREM-1. It is recommended that sTREM-1 be incorporated into routine monitoring protocols for patients with liver failure in the future. Third, the diagnostic criteria for infection in this study combined microbiological evidence with empirical clinical judgment, which may have introduced misclassification bias. For example, culture-negative but clinically suspected infections may have been missed, while empirical antibiotic use could have led to false-positive diagnoses. Future studies could improve diagnostic specificity by incorporating molecular diagnostic methods (e.g., PCR) or dynamic biomarker monitoring (e.g., procalcitonin).

Moreover, the nomogram prediction model proposed in this study has not been externally validated, and its generalizability remains uncertain. It should be emphasized that the model is intended as a clinical aid rather than a definitive diagnostic tool, and clinical decision-making should still be individualized based on the specific patient context.

This study was also limited by a small sample size and single-center design, which may reduce the generalizability of the findings to broader populations. Small sample sizes increase the risk of discrepancies between sample statistics and population parameters, and findings may be influenced by local practices or environmental factors.

Although internal validation using the bootstrap method yielded a high AUC value (0.960), the lack of external validation or cross-validation (e.g., k-fold validation) remains a key limitation. To address this, future research should consider multi-center, prospective studies with larger and stratified samples across different etiologies of liver failure. Establishing standardized operating procedures, open-source code repositories, and stratified sampling frameworks will facilitate standardized variable definitions and enable adaptive calibration of model parameters. Inclusion of representative populations from rural/urban regions and different economic zones would further enhance the model’s robustness and improve the statistical power for assessing the predictive value of each parameter.

In summary, several factors influence the risk of infection in patients with liver failure, including CRP, sTREM-1, SIRI, PNI, and APACHE II scores. A risk prediction model based on these indicators can help identify high-risk patients for targeted preventive interventions. This provides a valuable reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving patient management and outcomes.
