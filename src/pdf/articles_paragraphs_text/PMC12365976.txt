Curcumin is a well-known anticancer agent used for many malignancies; however, its low bioavailability and solubility limit its use in clinical applications. To enhance its efficacy, we synthesized a novel curcumin-benzoquinone analog, JWB1 (3), and evaluated its anticancer potential against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in vitro. We designed JWB1 (3) and structurally identified it using NMR, FTIR, MS, and UV–Vis techniques. The MTT assay was used to evaluate JWB1 (3) cytotoxicity in the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HUVEC cell lines. Flow cytometry was used to examine apoptotic activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Global DNA methylation was measured using an ELISA kit. Docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations revealed potential JWB1 (3) interactions with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). JWB1 (3) showed selective cytotoxicity towards MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50: 2.94 μg/mL, SI: 23.5 in 24 h), with minimal effects on HUVECs. Treatment with 10 μg/mL JWB1 (3) increased global DNA methylation levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (from 0.87% to 1.92%) more than in MCF-7 cells. The apoptosis assay showed that JWB1 (3) significantly induced MDA-MB-231 cells in the early apoptosis phase (early apoptosis: 45.65% vs. 2.95% in the controls). Furthermore, post-treatment, cancer cells showed a notable decrease in ROS levels. Supported by 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking investigations also showed a stable 3D structure and intercalation of JWB1 (3) with DNA. These findings imply that JWB1 (3) has notable anticancer potential against TNBC by inducing apoptosis, epigenetic modification, and DNA interaction.

Our study aims to give a new perspective on curcumin derivatives with the synthesis of a curcumin-benzoquinone analog, examine the results of the novel synthesized molecule's effect on the most aggressive type of breast cancer cell as a potential anticancer drug candidate, and observe the molecule's DNA global methylation effect. We also hypothesised that JWB1 (3) could be evaluated as a potential anticancer drug.

Curcumin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). JWB1 (3) was designed, synthesised, and patented by the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office (TR 2020 22,499 B). The original curcumin-benzoquinone analog,4-(2,4,5-trichloro-3,6-dioxocyclohexa-1,4-dien-1-yl)-1,7-bis(4-O-2,4,5-trichloro-3,6-dioxocyclohexa-1,4-dien-1-yl-5-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-diheptene-3,5-dioneJWB1 (3), was obtained from the reaction of curcumin (1) and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro benzoquinone (2) acetone (15 mL) /sodium carbonate (1.5 g), according to standard procedures. Orange-coloured curcumin (1 g) was placed in a 100 mL round-bottom reaction flask, and 20 mL of acetone was added. After dissolving curcumin in acetone, yellow-colored 2,3,5,6-Tetrachlorobenzoquinone (1.33 g) was added to the reaction flask at a reaction stoichiometry of 1:2. The reaction mixture was agitated at 37 °C with a magnetic stirrer. After five minutes, the orange mixture in the reaction flask turned a dark red colour. After 1 h, the novel curcumin-benzoquinone analog product JWB1 (3) was detected, and the reaction was terminated. The product was extracted using chloroform, and the resulting organic layer was dehydrated using sodium sulfate and filtered. The chloroform solvent was recovered in the evaporator, and the presence of a single pure product was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) under a UV lamp.

The 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay was performed to evaluate the inhibition of cell growth.33MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HUVEC cells were seeded (3 × 105 cells/well) and incubated with JWB1 (3) analog at increasing concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μg/mL) for 24,48 and 72 h. MTT (5 mg/mL, Sigma, USA) was added as 0.1 mg/mL per well, and after incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the supernatants were removed. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, USA) was added to 100 μL /well and shaken at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Untreated cells served as a negative control, and cells treated with 0.1% DMSO were used as a positive control. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Epoch, USA).

Cell line samples were extracted using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Purity and concentration measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer. DNA samples were stored at −20 °C until methylation analysis.

The manufacturer's handbook states that global DNA methylation was evaluated using a 5-mC DNA ELISA Kit (Zymo Research, USA) on DNA extracted from cell lines. A standard curve was generated using negative and positive controls provided by the kit. The percentage of 5-methylated cytosine (5-mC) in each sample was determined using the y-intercept and slope obtained by logarithmically graphing the absorbance values of the seven internal DNA control samples with known 5-mC quantities (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100%).34DNA from untreated cells (HUVEC, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) was used as the negative control.

Cell death was detected by labelling the cells with Annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC) (V-FITC) and the PI Apoptosis Kit (ApopNexin FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit, Millipore). Control and cancer cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. MDA-MB231 cells were treated with 2 μg/mL of JWB1 (3) for 48 h. After incubation, washing was performed to remove the culture medium. After washing, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were dissolved in 1 mL of PBS. Untreated control cells (negative controls) and JWB1 (3)-treated cells were stained with 5 mL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 mL of PI dye and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Annexin V binding buffer (400 μL) was added, and the samples were immediately analysed using a Beckman Coulter Navios device. The results were placed on ready-made templates in the form of histograms. Data were recorded using the Kaluza analysis program. Viable cells were analysed as the percentages of different cell stages: early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis. The assay was conducted in triplicate.

Intracellular ROS was identified using the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma-Aldrich D6883). Fluorescence signals emanating from DCFDH-DA were measured using flow cytometry. DCFH-DA, a compound rapidly diffusing through the cell membrane, is enzymatically degraded by esterases within the cell.35DCFH-DA (10 μM) was added to 2 × 105mL of cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Untreated cells were used as negative controls. DCFH-DA-only stained cells were used as internal gating controls.

The fluorescence values were read in the template prepared by applying specific compensation processes in a Beckman Coulter Navios system. The data were recorded in triplicate using the Kaluza analysis program.

The NMR structure of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in complex with an intercalator was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB: 108D). The protein structure was generated using the Protein Preparation program from Schrödinger (v2021–4, Schrödinger, Inc., New York). Subsequently, the system was minimised using an OPLS4 force field.

JWB1 (3) was constructed in 3D and prepared using the LigPrep tool of Schrödinger. Subsequently, compound JWB1 (3) was docked into the dsDNA structure using the Glide docking tool of the Schrödinger program with SP settings. The binding pocket was defined as all the base pairs within 5 Å of the reference intercalator. Three poses with the highest scores were obtained and minimised using the prime tool and MM-GBSA force field. To achieve this objective, the ligand and all base pairs within a distance of 5 Å were not restricted. Compounds that exhibited binding interactions, including hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions, and showed shape and polarity complementarity were chosen for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The stability of compound JWB1 (3) docked pose with dsDNA was investigated by MD simulations using the Desmond tool of Schrödinger. The complex was enclosed within an orthorhombic container, ensuring a minimum distance of 10 Å between the complex and container boundaries. Subsequently, the container was filled with Tip5P water molecules, and a solution containing 0.15 M NaCl. The concentrations of Na + and Cl − were modified to establish a system with a neutral charge. Subsequently, all large atoms were confined, and the system underwent a 100 picoseconds minimization using the OPLS4 force field. Ultimately, the system underwent a simulation lasting 100 ns, following isothermal conditions using the Nose-Hoover chain method with a relaxation time of 1 ps. Additionally, the simulation was conducted under isobaric settings using the Martyna-Tobial-Klein method, with a relaxation time of 2 ps and isotropic coupling. No restrictions were applied during the simulation. The images were stored at intervals of 100 ps.

All assays were performed in triplicates. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). For the MTT cell viability assay, Excel and GraphPad Prism 7 were used to calculate the IC50values. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the differences between the treatment groups and controls. For DNA methylation percentages, one-way ANOVA was used to compare treatment groups to the untreated control, with post hoc Dunnett’s test to determine significance. For apoptosis and ROS assays, data were analysed using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test comparing the JWB1 (3) treated and control groups. Differences were considered statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.05.

We assessed the viability of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HUVEC using the MTT assay after treatment with various concentrations of JWB1 (3) (1–500 μg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. No cytotoxic effect of JWB1 (3) was observed in the control (HUVEC) cell line between (0–50 μg/mL) at 24 h (Fig. 3A). JWB1 (3) exhibited concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects, with MDA-MB-231 cells being the most sensitive. At 10 μg/mL, the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells decreased to ~40% at 48 h and ~ 35% at 72 h, while HUVEC retained >85% viability at both time points, yielding a selectivity index (SI) > 2.5 (Fig. 3BandC). At higher concentrations (250–500 μg/mL), significant toxicity was observed across all cell lines; however, MDA-MB-231 cells consistently exhibited the lowest viability. These results suggest selective cytotoxicity of JWB1 (3) against TNBC cells at intermediate concentration and early time points.

In addition to the cytotoxic potential of curcumin, we performed MTT assays in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HUVEC cell lines in which curcumin exhibited a stronger effect at higher concentrations (Fig. S6). To assess the cytotoxic potential of curcumin, we conducted MTT assays on the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HUVEC cell lines. The results demonstrated a significant concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability, with curcumin exerting markedly stronger effects at higher concentrations.

Table 2. shows the IC50and Selectivity index (SI) values of JWB1 (3) for both cell lines after 24, 48, and 72 h. JWB1 (3) showed better cytotoxicity on both cancerous cells than normal cells, with the highest selective index of 23.5 in MDA-MB-231/MCF10A cells at 24 h. This selectivity sharply decreased over time, with SI values of 4.74 at 48 h and 3.69 at 72 h, reflecting a time-dependent reduction in selectivity. A similar trend was observed for MCF-7 cells, with SI values reducing from 7.71 (24 h) to 2.68 (48 h) and 1.17 (72 h). These results demonstrate that JWB1 (3) shows maximum selectivity at 24 h. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the cancer and control cells at all time points (P< 0.05), with the most pronounced fold difference at 24 h.

When comparing the cytotoxic effects of JWB1 (3) and curcumin, it was evident that JWB1 (3) exhibited superior selectivity towards MDA-MB-231 cells (Table 2andTable S1). The IC50of JWB1 (3) for MDA-MB-231 cells was lower than that of curcumin, indicating a stronger effect on TNBC cell viability. Additionally, the SI of JWB1 (3) in MDA-MB-231 cells was higher than that of curcumin, further supporting its potential as a targeted anticancer agent. These findings highlight the potential advantage of JWB1 (3) over curcumin in TNBC therapy, warranting further investigation of its molecular targets and signaling pathways.

Different JWB1 (3) concentrations were applied to the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HUVEC cell lines for 24 h (Fig. 4). In our global DNA methylation analysis by application of 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL of JWB1 (3) molecule to MDA-MB-231 cell lines, 5-mC global methylation levels were 0.873%, 1.799%, and 1.921%, respectively. In HUVEC, the global DNA methylation percentage of untreated control cells was 2,001%. Although, the methylation percentages were relatively low, the concentration-dependent increase observed in MDA-MB-231 cells suggests potential epigenetic modulation by JWB1 (3). Notably, treatment with 10 μg/mL resulted in methylation levels similar to those observed in healthy HUVEC. These preliminary findings are consistent with previous reports, indicating that even modest increases in global methylation may contribute to genome stabilisation and reduced malignancy risk. However, the precise biological significance of these small percentage differences remains unclear.

Apoptosis and cell membrane integrity were assessed using flow cytometry and the FITC Annexin V/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit. Using single laser multi-parameter flow cytometry, live cells that are thinning towards necrosis or apoptosis can be distinguished by Annexin (FITC) / PI (PE) dyes (Fig. 5). A significant difference was found in the percentages of late apoptotic and early apoptotic stages between JWB1-treated MDA-MB-231 cells and control cells (untreated MDA-MB-231). Early and late apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells in the control group were 2.95% and 3.55%, respectively. In contrast, a remarkable increase in early and late apoptosis in MDA-MD-231 cells treated with JWB1 (3) was observed at 45.65% and 5.96%, respectively. Therefore, JWB1 (3)-treated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a significant apoptotic effect compared to control cells.

Dot plots are divided into four quadrants representing the percentages of viable, early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells.

The highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) band gaps are fundamental concepts in the field of molecular orbital theory. The HOMO–LUMO bandgap provides valuable insights into the electronic structure and behavior of molecules, enabling prediction of their reactivity, stability, and various physical properties. The stable 3D structure and HOMO-LUMO distributions of JWB1 (3) are depicted in (Fig. 7A–C). The chemical parameters of the gas phase calculated using the HF/6–31 + Gdp method are listed inTable 3.

The interactions between compound JWB1 (3) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were investigated using docking experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, the dsDNA structure in a complex with an intercalator was used (RCSB PDB code: 108D) to investigate whether the analogs under investigation could intercalate with dsDNA. The docked pose of the ligand’s 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene moiety was intercalated with the base pairs, forming π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions. In addition, a hydrogen bond with electrostatic interaction was present between the dsDNA and the carbonyl and chlorine groups of the ligand (Fig. 8AandB).

F) the RMSD of the ligand’s 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene fragment (heavy atoms).

Subsequently, the docked pose was simulated for 100 ns and the ligand pose was changed (Fig. 5B). The ligand’s 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene moiety was still intercalated with the base pairs, forming π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5C). However, the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions were not preserved. The RMSD value of the DNA was approximately 1.1 Å (Fig. 5D), while the RMSD of the ligand’s heavy atoms increased to approximately 3.4 Å (Fig. 5E). The RMSD value of the ligand’s 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene moiety is below 0.3 Å (Fig. 5F), indicating a stable interaction between this ligand region and dsDNA.

Curcumin analogs possess diverse bioactivities, including anticancer effects demonstrated in various cancer types such as colon, lung, and breast cancer.44For instance, the new indole analog of curcumin was reported as an anticancer agent for colon cancer.45BDMC, curcumin analog inhibited the cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma.46PAC, a novel curcumin analog, exhibited stronger anticancer features in breast cancer and was more efficient against ER-negative cells than ER-positive cells.47In the current study, we introduce for the first time a curcumin-benzoquinone analog, JWB1 (3). The high biological activity of benzoquinone and established properties of curcumin, the starting material, resulted in a curcumin-benzoquinone analog molecule, which showed promising results in breast cancer. This novel analog exhibited a strong and selective inhibitory effect against MDA-MB-231 (ER-) cells compared with MCF7 (ER+) and normal HUVEC. These results are promising because the MDA-MB-231 cells are chemoresistant.

Furthermore, the number of cancer-associated genes affected by the disruption of transcription through DNA hypermethylation is constantly growing.52Moreover, the DNA of breast cancer cells and other types of cancer also undergoes global hypomethylation, which is associated with increased genomic instability and metastatic potential.53,54Thus, altered global 5-mC DNA methylation levels are essential targets for cancer development and gene-specific promoter hypermethylation.55,56Global DNA methylation levels in MDA-MB-231 cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner in JWB1 treated cells (3). Simultaneously, the JWB1 (3) molecule increased global methylation in HUVECs. Large-scale studies have shown that increased global methylation reduces the risk of breast cancer.57Our results suggest that the JWB1 (3) molecule is a potential reprogramming of the TNBC epigenome. Such reversion towards normal methylation levels has been shown to downregulate oncogenes and repress repetitive elements, contributing to genome stabilization.58Thus, the dual modulation of oxidative stress and DNA methylation by JWB1 (3) supports its candidacy as a compound targeting two convergent vulnerabilities in TNBC biology. Although such modulations are promising, statements regarding preventive or chemopreventive activity remain speculative without further in vivo validation or gene-specific methylation data.

Previous studies have indicated that curcumin and its derivatives, whether used individually or in the form of metal complexes, can attach directly to DNA.59Molecular docking simulations indicated the potential binding of JWB1 (3) to the minor groove of dsDNA. However, these predictions remain preliminary with no direct biophysical validation. Thus, the DNA binding hypothesis should be interpreted cautiously until it is further supported by experimental evidence.

In this study, the newly synthesised curcumin-benzoquinone analog, JWB1 (3), showed a selective cytotoxic effect against TNBC cells, with apoptosis induction, ROS modulation, and global DNA methylation changes. Molecular modeling studies revealed the 3D structure and HOMO and LUMO distributions. However, the mechanism of action requires further validation, particularly regarding DNA interactions, epigenetic targets, and in vivo studies. Using Western blot and methylation-specific PCR in future studies, will help clarify molecular targets and enhance translational relevance.
