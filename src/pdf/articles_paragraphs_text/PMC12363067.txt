One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is an established bariatric procedure for managing obesity and related metabolic conditions. This study evaluated the impact of OAGB on weight loss, metabolic markers, and nutritional outcomes over one year, with specific focus on the percentage of small intestine bypassed.

In this prospective study, 42 patients (aged 29–65 years; BMI > 35 kg/m²) underwent OAGB with intraoperative measurement of total small bowel length to calculate bypass percentage. Patients were followed at six months and one year. Clinical and biochemical parameters—including BMI, HbA1c, lipid profile, transferrin, malnutrition, and steatorrhea—were assessed. Generalized estimating equations and Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons were used (SPSS v24; significance level < 0.05).

The mean bypass percentage was 34.9 ± 4.7%. Mean BMI decreased significantly from 46.5 ± 7.9 kg/m² preoperatively to 29.0 ± 5.3 kg/m² at one year (P< 0.001). Higher bypass percentages were associated with greater BMI reduction. HbA1c decreased significantly (P< 0.001) but was not related to bypass percentage. HDL increased while LDL and triglycerides declined significantly over time (P< 0.05). Transferrin levels remained unchanged. The incidence of malnutrition increased (P< 0.001) and steatorrhea decreased (P< 0.05) at one year; neither was significantly associated with bypass percentage.

OAGB led to significant weight loss and metabolic improvements over one-year follow-up. Greater bypass percentage correlated with greater BMI reduction but did not affect glycemic or nutritional outcomes. Ongoing monitoring is recommended to manage potential nutritional risks.

One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has emerged as a widely adopted and effective bariatric procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2) and also diabetes offering advantages such as shorter operative times and favorable metabolic outcomes compared to traditional techniques [1–3]. A critical component of the OAGB procedure is the length of the biliopancreatic limb (BPL), which plays a pivotal role in determining both weight loss efficacy and the risk of nutritional deficiencies [4,5]. The ratio of the bypassed bowel length (BPL) to the total bowel length is a key consideration for optimizing weight loss and minimizing nutritional deficiencies [6,7].

While longer BPLs have been suggested to enhance weight loss outcomes, concerns remain regarding the potential for increased malabsorption and related complications, including micronutrient deficiencies and biliary reflux [8–10]. Despite these considerations, the optimal BPL length that balances maximal therapeutic benefit with minimal adverse effects has yet to be definitively established. Recent studies have investigated the impact of varying BPL lengths, commonly ranging from 150 to 250 cm, on clinical outcomes following OAGB [5]. Studies indicates that tailoring the BPL length according to preoperative BMI may optimize weight loss, with longer limbs potentially offering greater reductions in patients with higher baseline BMI [4,5,11]. Evidence reported a high level of BMI in patients with diabetes, which result in severity condition such as dyslipidemia, respiratory disorers, cardiovascular complication, and liver or kidney dysfunction [12–15], of which OAGB has been reported to be effective in improving glycaemic control and weight loss, with almost immediate resolution of diabetes [3].

However, medium- and long-term follow-up data suggest that shorter BPLs can achieve comparable excess weight loss and comorbidity resolution while reducing the incidence of malnutrition-related complications [16,17]. Studies indicate that OAGB leads to significant improvements in lipid metabolism, including increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides, which collectively contribute to a decreased cardiovascular risk profile [18,19]. OAGB consistently demonstrates a robust and sustained reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose levels, reflecting improved insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function [20,21]. Given the expanding use of OAGB worldwide, a comprehensive understanding of how BPL length influences both weight loss outcomes and nutritional status is essential for optimizing patient care. This study investigated the health outcomes through one-year follow-up of individuals underwent OAGB surgery considering the bypass percentage.

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 46 individuals who were candidates for OAGB surgery who were reffered to the Poursina Hospital, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran. A non-probability consecutive sampling method was employed, whereby all eligible patients undergoing OAGB surgery were enrolled progressively until the required sample size was achieved. The sample size was calculated based on a previous study by Khalaj et al. assuming a 95% confidence level and a precision (δ) of 2 [22]. All patients consented to participate in the study.

Individuals considered candidates for OAGB surgery in this study were those aged between 18 and 65 years with a BMI > 35 kg/m2, who had been evaluated and approved for bariatric surgery based on clinical guidelines. These patients did not present with contraindications such as active substance or alcohol abuse, severe psychiatric disorders, or eating disorders like bulimia nervosa. Additionally, individuals classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class IV [23], indicating a severe systemic disease posing a constant threat to life, or those with a total small bowel length of < 5 m were excluded from surgical candidacy. Demographical and clinical data of patients including age, gender, HbA1c, BMI, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, transferrin, malnutrition, and steatorrhea, were collected.

Malnutrition in this study was defined based on documented clinical criteria, including an unintentional weight loss of more than 10% of preoperative body weight within six months after surgery, or the presence of clinical signs of protein-energy malnutrition as assessed by the bariatric nutritionist during routine follow-up visits. Due to resource constraints, laboratory markers such as serum albumin were not uniformly measured for all participants.

All patients underwent OAGB based on a standardized surgical protocol. A longitudinal gastric pouch was created along the lesser curvature of the stomach, extending from the antrum to the angle of His, calibrated using a 36 French orogastric tube. Subsequently, a loop gastrojejunostomy was performed approximately 200 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. Before the anastomosis, the total length of the small intestine was measured from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve, and 200 cm of this length was designated as the BPL. The bypassed percentage refers to the ratio of the length of the bypassed small intestine to the total length of the small intestine. The total small intestine length is precisely measured intraoperatively by the surgeon from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve. This percentage-based approach allows for individual variation in total small bowel length and provides a more accurate and personalized estimate of the extent of bypass and related malabsorption compared to using a fixed bypass length alone. All patients were followed at two postoperative time points, six-months and one-year, corresponding with routine clinical visits.

Data was reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), median (interquartile range (IQR)), frequency, and percentages. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine the normality of the variables and ANOVA test was performed to evaluate and compare the variables. To investigate the associations, generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were utilized. Moreover, to make a more accurate comparison between different time points, pairwise comparison analysis with Bonferroni correction was performed. A significance level of 0.05 was set for all statistical tests using SPSS version 24.

The mean age of participants was 46.98 ± 9.33 years (range: 29–65 years); 80.4% (n= 37) were female and 19.6% (n= 9) were male. The mean bypass percentage was 34.91 ± 4.72% (range: 28.50–45.00%). Preoperatively, mean BMI was 46.47 ± 7.89 kg/m², HbA1c was 5.11 ± 0.55%, HDL was 49.93 ± 9.28 mg/dL, LDL was 113.30 ± 24.64 mg/dL, triglycerides were 104.00 ± 25.61 mg/dL, and transferrin was 248.56 ± 54.65 mg/dL (Table1). At baseline, 45.7% (n= 21) were classified with malnutrition, and 28.3% (n= 13) had steatorrhea (Table2).

BMI decreased from 46.47 ± 7.89 kg/m² preoperatively to 34.66 ± 6.03 at six months and to 29.04 ± 5.25 at one year (Fig.1A; Table1). The overall time effect for BMI was not significant (P= 0.502); however, the interaction between time and bypass percentage was significant (P= 0.027). Pairwise comparisons (Table1) showed significant decreases: preoperative vs. six months mean difference: 11.81 kg/m² (95% CI: 9.90–13.72,P< 0.001); preoperative vs. one year: 17.43 kg/m² (95% CI: 15.12–19.74,P< 0.001); six months vs. one year: 5.62 kg/m² (95% CI: 4.19–7.05,P< 0.001).

HbA1c decreased from 5.11 ± 0.55% preoperatively to 4.83 ± 0.59 at six months and 4.71 ± 0.59 at one year (Fig.1B; Table1). The time effect for HbA1c was significant (P< 0.001); the interaction with bypass percentage was not significant (P= 0.353). Pairwise comparisons (Table1) were: preoperative vs. six months mean difference: 0.286% (95% CI: 0.236–0.336,P< 0.001); preoperative vs. one year: 0.399% (95% CI: 0.346–0.452,P< 0.001); six months vs. one year: 0.113% (95% CI: 0.097–0.129,P< 0.001).

HDL increased from 49.93 ± 9.28 mg/dL preoperatively to 53.26 ± 9.55 at six months and 53.55 ± 9.59 at one year (Fig.1C; Table1). The time effect for HDL was significant (P= 0.006); the interaction was not significant (P= 0.747). Pairwise comparisons (Table1) were: preoperative vs. six months mean difference: 3.33 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.93–3.73,P< 0.001); preoperative vs. one year: 3.62 mg/dL (95% CI: 3.22–4.02,P< 0.001); six months vs. one year: 0.29 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.24–0.33,P< 0.001).

LDL decreased from 113.30 ± 24.64 mg/dL preoperatively to 110.48 ± 24.67 at six months and 110.16 ± 24.67 at one year (Fig.1D; Table1). The time effect was significant (P= 0.002); the interaction with bypass percentage was not significant (P= 0.798). Pairwise comparisons (Table1) were: preoperative vs. six months mean difference: 2.82 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.37–3.27,P< 0.001); preoperative vs. one year: 3.14 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.68–3.60,P< 0.001); six months vs. one year: 0.32 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.28–0.36,P< 0.001).

Triglycerides decreased from 104.00 ± 25.61 mg/dL preoperatively to 101.24 ± 25.72 at six months and 100.61 ± 25.69 at one year (Fig.1E; Table1). The time effect was significant (P= 0.003); the interaction was not significant (P= 0.947). Pairwise comparisons (Table1) were: preoperative vs. six months mean difference: 2.76 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.35–3.17,P< 0.001); preoperative vs. one year: 3.39 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.95–3.83,P< 0.001); six months vs. one year: 0.63 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.54–0.71,P< 0.001).

Transferrin levels remained stable: 248.56 ± 54.65 mg/dL preoperatively, 248.98 ± 55.23 at six months, and 249.22 ± 55.48 at one year (Fig.1F; Table1). The time effect was not significant (P= 0.676); the interaction was not significant (P= 0.595). Pairwise comparisons (Table1) showed no significant differences: preoperative vs. six months (P= 1.000); preoperative vs. one year (P= 0.567); six months vs. one year (P= 0.427).

Based on GEE models (Table2), malnutrition risk differed significantly over time. The odds were lower preoperatively than at one year (B=–0.217, SE = 0.061,P< 0.001), with no difference between six months and one year (B=–0.043, SE = 0.087,P= 0.616). The bypass percentage was not associated with malnutrition (P= 0.141).

Steatorrhea risk changed over time (Table2); it was higher preoperatively compared to one year (B = 1.285, SE = 0.306,P< 0.001) and higher at six months vs. one year (B = 0.704, SE = 0.343,P= 0.040). Bypass percentage was not significantly associated with steatorrhea (P= 0.764).

OAGB has emerged as a widely used bariatric procedure due to its technical simplicity and metabolic efficacy, with the length of the BPL being a critical factor influencing postoperative outcomes [5,8,24]. Our findings demonstrated that a higher percentage of bowel bypass, specifically within the 40–43% range, was significantly associated with greater reductions in BMI over time. This suggests that the extent of bypassed bowel plays a meaningful role in the magnitude of postoperative weight loss, supporting the idea that the biliopancreatic limb percentage can serve as a key interventional parameter for optimizing surgical outcomes.

In the current study, the trend of BMI changes over time has shown significant differences when considering the percentage of OAGB surgery, in which patients with higher bypass percentages experienced greater weight loss compared to others. The bypass percentage has played a role as an important confounding factor in the success rate of surgical weight reduction. Moreover, the interaction between time and bypass percentage significantly influenced BMI, which highlights the clinical value of adjusting bypass percentage.

A study by Bhandari et al. found that OAGB achieved significantly greater weight loss compared to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), with OAGB patients experiencing substantially higher total and excess weight loss. OAGB also demonstrated superior resolution of obesity-related comorbidities including diabetes, though this enhanced efficacy came with considerably higher rates of nutritional deficiencies such as anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia compared to RYGB patients [25]. Another study by Liagre et al. found that OAGB with a BPL of 150 cm achieved substantial and sustained weight loss in patients with severe obesity (BMI > 50 kg/m²), and patients maintaining significant total and excess weight loss at both two and five years post-surgery follow-up, suggesting OAGB as an effective primary bariatric intervention for treating severe obesity [26].

Our findings demonstrated a significant association between the extent of bypass performed and weight loss outcomes, whereby patients undergoing procedures with higher bypass percentages experienced superior weight reduction compared to those with lower bypass percentages, which indicated that bypass percentage functions as a significant confounding variable influencing the efficacy of surgical weight loss interventions. Current evidence demonstrates that extended BPL in OAGB enhances bile acid absorption capacity, correlating with improved weight reduction outcomes. This mechanism contributes to superior glycemic control in type 2 diabetes compared to sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with metabolic benefits becoming more pronounced as BPL length increases [19,27].

One of the most striking findings in our study was the consistent and significant decline in HbA1c levels across all follow-up intervals post-surgery, suggesting HbA1c is likely mediated by both substantial weight reduction and improvements in insulin sensitivity via altered gut hormone signaling. However, studies compared the effectiveness of different bariatric surgeries on HbA1c and found that OAGB consistently demonstrated superior or equivalent HbA1c outcomes compared to RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy, with studies showing OAGB achieved the highest type 2 diabetes remission rates at short and long-term follow-up periods, while other research found OAGB had significantly higher complete remission rates than RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy for target HbA1c levels without medication [28–30]. While some other studies demonstrated comparable remission rates between procedures, OAGB consistently performed at least as well as established bariatric surgeries in achieving target HbA1c levels and diabetes remission [30–32].

We observed that the HDL cholesterol levels exhibited a progressive increase postoperatively. This trend reflects improved metabolic health and is possibly driven by reductions in visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation [18]. In contrast, while LDL levels also declined significantly over the year, the magnitude of this reduction was less pronounced and appeared independent of the bypass percentage, which suggests that LDL modulation may be more strongly influenced by general metabolic shifts or gut microbiome alternation than by the BPL [33,34]. Our findings demonstrated that triglyceride levels followed a decreasing trend as well after OAGB, although the extent of reduction was moderate. A study by Bettini et al. reported that OAGB surgery resulted in significant improvement in triglyceride levels compared to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [18]. The lipid profile changes following OAGB surgery underscore the efficacy of OAGB in ameliorating cardiometabolic risk factors over a relatively short postoperative period [35].

In terms of nutritional status, the transferrin levels, an indirect marker of iron stores and protein status, remained relatively stable throughout the one-year follow-up among our study population, suggesting minimal disruption in iron homeostasis. However, this stability must be interpreted cautiously, as our study did not include more sensitive or specific iron indices (e.g., ferritin, iron saturation), and transferrin may not fully capture subclinical deficiencies or absorption issues [36]. A study by Jedamzik et al. illustrated that OAGB inevitably led to nutritional deficiencies, with every patient developing at least one deficiency during follow-up, necessitating comprehensive long-term nutritional monitoring and mandatory multivitamin supplementation, though patient compliance with specialized supplementation remained suboptimal despite the critical need for thorough nutritional management in bypass patients [37].

On the other hand, a more concerning trend emerged concerning malnutrition, which became significantly more prevalent at the one-year follow-up compared to the baseline in the current study that highlights the need for prolonged nutritional surveillance and proactive management, especially as malnutrition did not appear to be directly associated with bypass percentage [37,38]. It also suggests that postoperative nutritional decline may stem more from alterations in dietary intake, food tolerance, and nutrient absorption, regardless of limb length, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary care beyond surgical planning. A comparative study by Gentileschi et al. concluded that OAGB and RYGB showed no significant difference in malnutrition risk at six-months post-surgery follow-up, with both procedures demonstrating comparable nutritional status decline, contradicting previous assumptions that OAGB surgery resulted in higher malnutrition risk [38]. This discrepancy between results required further investigation by considering multiple confounding variables that may significantly influence malnutrition outcomes and contribute to the heterogeneous findings observed across different studies evaluating bariatric surgery procedures.

Moreover, diarrhea and steatorrhea represent major concerns following OAGB, particularly with BPL lengths exceeding 200 cm, necessitating precise intestinal measurement to optimize both metabolic outcomes and prevent malabsorption complications [19,39]. We observed that the rate of steatorrhea increased significantly by the one-year follow-up, further reinforcing the notion that malabsorption symptoms can intensify over time post-OAGB surgery. Our data showed a non-significant inverse trend between bypass percentage and steatorrhea incidence, which may reflect variability in individual gut adaptation, dietary patterns, study population, and follow-up. A study by Rossoni et al. reported that the absence of widespread diarrhea and predominance of constipation in long-term follow-up suggested that clinically significant fat malabsorption may be relatively uncommon following OAGB [19]. However, digestive complications following OAGB necessitate ongoing clinical assessment and follow-up, as these symptoms significantly impact patient well-being and overall health outcomes.

This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the relatively small sample size (n= 42) may limit the statistical power to detect subtle associations, particularly in subgroup analyses such as malnutrition and steatorrhea. Second, the single-center design and predominantly female population (80% female) may reduce the generalizability of the results to broader, more diverse populations. Third, the one-year follow-up period is insufficient to fully evaluate long-term outcomes such as sustained weight loss, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, bone health, or late complications like biliary reflux; longer-term follow-up studies of three to five years or more are warranted. Additionally, the study relied solely on transferrin as a marker of nutritional status, without measurements of other relevant micronutrients (e.g., iron, vitamin B12, folate, calcium, vitamin D), which limits the comprehensiveness of nutritional assessment. The absence of data on dietary intake, adherence to postoperative supplementation, and physical activity further restricts the interpretation of nutritional and metabolic outcomes. Lastly, the potential confounding effects of baseline patient characteristics, such as initial BMI and comorbidities, may influence the observed associations with bypass percentage, and were not fully controlled in this analysis. Future studies should address these limitations through larger, multi-center designs, extended follow-up, and more comprehensive data collection to better inform surgical planning and postoperative care.

This prospective study demonstrates that, over a one-year follow-up period, OAGB was associated with significant reductions in body mass index and improvements in glycemic control and lipid profiles among individuals with obesity. While malnutrition risk increased long-term, steatorrhea incidence decreased significantly after a one-year follow-up, supporting OAGB as an effective bariatric intervention with acceptable gastrointestinal tolerance (Fig.2).
