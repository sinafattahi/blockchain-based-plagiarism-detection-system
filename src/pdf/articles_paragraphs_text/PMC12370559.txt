As a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine derivative, remimazolam’s impact on postoperative neurocognitive recovery remains poorly characterized. Our research specifically evaluated its influence on postoperative delirium (POD) incidence compared with propofol in the geriatric surgical population.

A comprehensive literature search was performed across four electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 software; effect estimates were expressed as risk ratios (RR), standardized mean differences (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The overall quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

The meta-analysis incorporated five RCTs encompassing 1,368 patients. Pooled analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in POD incidence between the remimazolam and propofol groups (RR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.58–1.33;P= 0.53). However, remimazolam administration was associated with a significant reduction in hypotensive events (RR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34–0.90;P< 0.05). No between-group differences were detected in postoperative nausea and vomiting incidence.

The current meta-analysis provided evidence that perioperative remimazolam administration did not significantly increase the risk of POD in elderly surgical patients, while demonstrating clinically significant benefits in hemodynamic stability.

Postoperative delirium (POD) represents a critical neurocognitive complication affecting 15–50% of elderly surgical patients, associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased mortality, and long-term cognitive decline [1,2]. As global surgical volumes rise in aging populations, identifying modifiable risk factors for POD has become a priority in perioperative medicine [3]. Among iatrogenic contributors, anesthetic agents—particularly benzodiazepines—have drawn scrutiny due to their potential neuropharmacological interference. While traditional benzodiazepines like midazolam are implicated in delirium pathogenesis through γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor overactivation [4], the novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine remimazolam presents distinct pharmacokinetic properties that warrant reevaluation.

Remimazolam’s unique profile, characterized by rapid onset (1–2 min), short context-sensitive half-time (7–8 min), and organ-independent metabolism via tissue esterases [5,6], theoretically reduces cumulative sedation effects compared to conventional agents. Early-phase clinical trials suggested its potential to mitigate delirium through precise titration and minimized residual sedation [7]. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in elderly cohorts have yielded conflicting outcomes [8,9]. A 2025 multicenter RCT demonstrated comparable POD incidence between remimazolam and propofol [8], while a recent study demonstrated that remimazolam in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery has a minimal impact on postoperative melatonin and may reduce the incidence of POD [10]. This discrepancy may stem from heterogeneous patient stratification, variable sedation protocols, or differential sensitivity to GABAergic modulation in aging brains.

Current meta-analyses [11,12] had primarily focused on general patient populations encompassing all age groups. However, dedicated analyses specifically targeting the high-risk elderly population for POD are notably lacking. Therefore, this study exclusively included geriatric patients to clarify the effects of remimazolam on POD in this population.

This study meticulously adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our systematic review has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, carrying the unique identification code CRD42024542135.

Our team systematically searched on electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The search period was from the date of establishment until March 31, 2025, with no language restrictions. The search strategies were described in the supplementarydata.

Studies were selected based on the PICOS framework: (1) Population: geriatric surgical patients receiving general anesthesia; (2) Intervention: perioperative intravenous administration of remimazolam; (3) Comparator: propofol-based anesthesia regimens; (4) Outcomes: primary endpoint of postoperative delirium incidence, assessed using validated diagnostic tools (e.g., CAM, DSM-V); (5) Study design: peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials published in full text.

The following studies were excluded: (1) non-intravenous administration routes of remimazolam; (2) studies lacking standardized POD assessment or reporting; (3) preliminary reports including conference abstracts, letters, or ongoing trials without complete outcome data; (4) experimental studies involving healthy volunteers or non-surgical populations.

The literature screening process was conducted independently by two investigators using a standardized protocol. Initial deduplication was performed using EndNote X9 software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA), followed by a two-phase screening process. In the primary phase, titles and abstracts were evaluated against the predefined eligibility criteria. Subsequently, full-text articles of potentially relevant studies were rigorously assessed for final inclusion. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer.

Data extraction was performed independently using a piloted form, capturing: (1) study characteristics (first author, publication year, journal); (2) population parameters (sample size, age distribution, surgical type); (3) intervention details (remimazolam dosage, administration protocol); (4) comparator information (propofol regimen); and (5) outcome assessment methods. Extracted data underwent cross-verification to ensure accuracy, with a third reviewer adjudicating any inconsistencies. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, as diagnosed using validated instruments including but not limited to: Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), CAM for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Secondary outcomes encompassed: (1) hemodynamic stability, recorded intraoperative hypotensive and bradycardia occurrence; (2) postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence within 24 h post-anesthesia, and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) duration.

The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. The table indicating the risk of bias comprises selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. Trials were classified into three risk categories: high risk, unclear risk, and low risk. The level of evidence in these outcomes was determined through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. This, facilitated the categorization of certainty levels into four tiers: very low, low, moderate, or high, reflecting increasing degrees of confidence in the study’s findings.

All analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Outcomes were analyzed using risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean difference [SMD]with 95% confidence intervals (CI), with statistical significance set at α = 0.05. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic. Given the anticipated clinical and methodological variability across studies, a random-effects model was employed for all meta-analyses, regardless of observed heterogeneity levels. Predefined subgroup analyses were conducted based on different type of surgery. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of findings by sequentially excluding each study.

The systematic search identified 414 potentially relevant records from electronic databases using the predefined search strategy. Following initial screening, 393 records were excluded: 106 due to duplication and 287 based on title/abstract review against eligibility criteria. Full-text assessment was conducted for the remaining 21 articles, with 16 excluded for the following reasons: conference proceedings without peer-reviewed data (n= 2) [13,14], healthy volunteer studies (n= 3) [15–17], non-surgical population (n= 1) [18], and insufficient outcome reporting (n= 10) [19–28]. Five RCTs met al.l inclusion criteria and were included in the quantitative synthesis [8– [10,29,30]. The study selection process, including reasons for exclusion at each stage, is detailed in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig.1).

The publication years between 2023 and 2025, and the sample size was ranged from 100 to 728. Two of the included studies enrolled surgical patients aged ≥ 60 years [8,30], while the remaining three trials specifically targeted populations over 65 years [9,10,29]. The surgical specialties comprised orthopedic procedures, general surgeries (predominantly gastrointestinal interventions), and urological operations. Universal application of general anesthesia was documented across all investigations. Detailed information for included studies is presented in Table1.

All included trials adequately described randomization procedures. Two studies [10,29] did not explicitly report the use of allocation concealment, double-blinding, or assessor blinding; therefore, these items were rated as having an “unclear risk” of bias. No incomplete outcome data or selective reporting was identified in any of the included studies; therefore, these domains were judged to be at “low risk” of bias. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was strictly implemented in only one study [8], the “other bias” for other trials was determined to “unclear risk”. Figure2summarizes the risk of bias distribution.

All trials reported the incidence of POD. The forest plot indicated no significant difference between remimazolam and propofol groups (RR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.58, 1.33];P= 0.53, I2= 49%, Fig.3), with high heterogeneity. The stability of finding was confirmed through leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, with effect estimates remaining consistent across all iterations. Subgroup analyses were performed according to different type of surgery (orthopedic surgery vs. general and urological surgeries). The forest plots of subgroup analyses showed the similar results to the overall result (Supplementfigure).

Four trials evaluated hypotensive events, demonstrating a significantly reduced incidence in the remimazolam group compared to propofol (RR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34–0.90;P< 0.05, Fig.4). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I² = 85%). Bradycardia incidence was comparable between groups, as evidenced by two trials (RR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.63–1.06;P= 0.12), with no observed heterogeneity (I² = 0%) (Fig.5).

The incidence of PONV was assessed in three trials, revealing no significant.

intergroup difference (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.84–1.86;P= 0.28). The analysis demonstrated homogeneity across studies (I² = 0%) (Fig.6). PACU duration was evaluated in four trials, showing no statistically significant difference between remimazolam and propofol groups (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI: -1.27 to 1.26;P= 0.99, I² = 99%, Fig.7).

Evidence certainty was downgraded due to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 49% for POD, 85% for hypotension, 99% for PACU duration), so “inconsistency” was downgraded to “serious”. The quality of evidence was reported from moderate to high in this study. Table2shows the summary of the GRADE assessment.

Our meta-analysis reveals comparable POD incidence between remimazolam and propofol in elderly surgical patients, while demonstrating superior hemodynamic stability with remimazolam (reduced hypotensive events). No significant intergroup differences were observed in PONV incidence or PACU duration. The evidence quality was assessed as moderate to high using GRADE methodology.

Traditional view suggested that perioperative use of benzodiazepines was one of the important risk factors for developing POD [31,32]. A previous cohort study reported that lorazepam was an independent risk factor for daily transition to delirium [33]. Also, a multi-centre, population-based propensity score-matched cohort study pointed out that the odds of delirium were significantly higher with midazolam compared with propofol dominant sedation strategies [34]. Interesting, our study found that perioperative use of remimazolam did not increase the incidence of POD, which is consistent with previous studies [13,35]. In addition, two latest retrospective exploratory studies indicated that remimazolam reduced the incidence of POD in elderly patients [7,36]. The pharmacokinetics of remimazolam is linearly related to dosage, and are metabolized through tissue esterases without organ dependence, resulting in the conversion of inactive metabolites [37]. Therefore, compared to other benzodiazepines, remimazolam has the advantage of shorter duration of sedative effect and lower accumulation rate [38]. Our analysis revealed no statistically significant reduction in PACU duration among patients receiving remimazolam compared to those receiving propofol. Previous meta-analysis had showed that the use of remimazolam during procedural sedation could shorten recovery time by approximately 5 min [39]. In contrast, another study found a longer PACU stay in patients administered remimazolam [30]. It should be noted that our meta-analysis was limited by a small sample size, necessitating further research for definitive conclusions.

Another possible mechanism is related to the regulation of cortisol levels by remimazolam. Elevated cortisol levels during the perioperative period impaired cognitive function and lead to the occurrence of POD [40]. Remimazolam improved postoperative cognitive function by reducing intraoperative stress response and lowering cortisol level [41]. Furthermore, intraoperative hypotension was associated with an increased incidence of POD [42]. Remimazolam had a mild effect on hemodynamics, thus improving postoperative cognitive function [43].

Also, our meta-analysis found that remimazolam reduced the incidence of hypotension. Previous studies had the similar results [44,45]. The intraoperative hypotension highly related to the postoperative mortality [46]. The stability of hemodynamics depends on sufficient blood volume, which is regulated by the autonomic nervous system to regulate the distribution of volume, cardiac output, and perfusion pressure [47]. Anesthesia and surgery can damage the autonomic nervous control system, leading to a redistribution of vascular contents and resulting in hypotension [48,49]. Remimazolam is a high affinity ligand for benzodiazepine sites on GABAARs, exhibiting similar activity among GABAA receptor subtypes (α1β2γ2, α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2, α5β2γ2 subtypes), maintaining hemodynamic stability [50].

Some limitations should be recognized in our study. Firstly, despite conducting subgroup analyses on different outcome measures, there is still significant heterogeneity in the evaluation of POD among the included studies. Secondly, the sample size included in this study was relatively small, and further large sample high-quality clinical studies are required. Thirdly, due to insufficient data, we only evaluated the incidence of PONV regarding the adverse reaction of remimazolam, and further data is needed to confirm this. Fourth, the optimal dosage of remimazolam had not been further analyzed in this study.

Current evidence suggests that the usage of remimazolam during the perioperative period does not affect postoperative neurocognitive function and is beneficial for hemodynamic stability, making it a new option for sedatives in clinical practice.
