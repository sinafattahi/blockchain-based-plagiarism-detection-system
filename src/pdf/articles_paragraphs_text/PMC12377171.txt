Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt placement is an alternative treatment for hydrocephalus when ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement is not feasible. While shunt obstruction and infection are well-known complications, elevated systemic venous pressure is likely an underrecognized cause of dysfunction. Elevated right atrial pressure can reduce the pressure gradient for CSF drainage, leading to intracranial hypertension despite a mechanically functional shunt.

A 19-year-old female with a VA shunt developed refractory intracranial hypertension despite multiple valve adjustments and a mechanically functional shunt. Venography with pressure measurement revealed elevated systemic venous pressure, with jugular venous pressures elevated to 12–13 mm Hg. Shunt revision confirmed high outflow resistance at the atrial end (20 cm H2O = approximately 15 mm Hg), suggesting impaired CSF drainage due to elevated right atrial pressure. Nitroglycerin reduced intracranial pressure but was discontinued due to headache exacerbation. Subsequently, acetazolamide provided symptomatic relief.

Elevated systemic venous pressure can impair VA shunt function and cause intracranial hypertension. Preoperative central venous pressure measurement may help identify patients at risk. Nitroglycerin may serve as a diagnostic tool for VA shunt dysfunction related to elevated venous pressure. Awareness of increased systemic venous pressure as a factor in VA shunt dysfunction is warranted.

The evolving recognition of systemic venous pressure’s role in ICP regulation is particularly relevant for patients with ventriculoatrial (VA) shunts, because CSF is diverted directly into the right atrium. Unlike ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, which bypass the venous circulation entirely, VA shunts rely on a favorable pressure gradient between intracranial and right atrial pressure (RAP) for effective CSF drainage. When systemic venous pressure is elevated, CSF outflow can be impaired, leading to increased ICP despite an otherwise functional shunt system. We present a case of ICP elevation refractory to standard management in a patient with a VA shunt, in whom elevated systemic venous pressure, rather than primary shunt malfunction, contributed to impaired drainage and elevated ICP. We discuss diagnostic approaches, treatment strategies, and clinical implications regarding systemic venous pressure in evaluating VA shunt functionality.

A 19-year-old female with hydrocephalus secondary to an intracranial hemorrhage at birth initially presented during the neonatal period with areflexia. Because of progressive macrocephaly, a VP shunt was placed and remained functional until puberty. From adolescence onward, she experienced recurrent symptoms of elevated ICP, including headache, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Imaging during this period consistently showed no significant ventricular dilation, suggesting slit ventricle syndrome with reduced ventricular compliance. Invasive parenchymal ICP monitoring confirmed pathologically elevated ICP. Shunt revisions revealed multiple etiologies of dysfunction, including shunt disconnections, occlusions, and valve malfunctions. Ultimately, severe and persistent abdominal pain significantly impaired her quality of life, leading to conversion from a VP shunt to a VA shunt. This decision was individualized, driven by the severity and chronicity of the abdominal pain, despite this being an uncommon indication for VA shunt placement at our institution.

Nine months prior to the current admission, endovascular venography with venous pressure measurement was performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation for progressive headaches and vomiting and unsatisfactory ICP control. Invasive parenchymal ICP measurement revealed a mean nightly ICP of 21 mm Hg with frequent B-waves. MR venography (MRV) revealed near-normal venous anatomy, with a possible narrowing between the transverse and sigmoid sinus. To investigate this further, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed, which confirmed that the venous anatomy was within normal limits. Because of the complexity of the case and the lack of sustained improvement following multiple shunt revisions and valve adjustments, we proceeded with invasive venous pressure measurements. These revealed elevated venous pressures, with a jugular venous pressure of 12–13 mm Hg (Fig. 1). Given concerns that this was contributing to her pathology, nitroglycerin dermal patches (5 mg/24 hours) were trialed to reduce systemic venous pressure and improve CSF drainage. Pretreatment ICP was assessed using a parenchymal ICP monitor. The mean ICP before treatment was 8.1 mm Hg, although this value included upright periods, during which lower ICP is expected. Nighttime ICP, which better reflects supine baseline pressure, revealed elevated values around 20 mm Hg along with frequent B-waves. Following nitroglycerin administration, a time- and position-matched day ICP measurement showed that the mean ICP decreased to 4.2 mm Hg (Fig. 2). However, worsening headaches, likely due to intracranial vasodilation, led to discontinuation of nitroglycerin before nighttime ICP data collection.

MRV and DSA revealed no significant venous outflow obstruction. However, anatomical variations were observed, including a steep course of the internal cerebral veins merging into the straight sinus. The straight sinus divided into two channels draining separately into the right and left transverse sinuses. The right transverse sinus is slightly larger than the left and drains via the sigmoid sinus primarily into the internal jugular vein.A and B:Anteroposterior and lateral projections of a selective left vertebral artery injection.C and D:Anteroposterior and lateral projections of a selective right internal carotid artery run.E and F:Coronal and sagittal MRV reconstructions performed prior to DSA but revealing the same venous drainage pattern and anatomical variant.

The data illustrate a reduction in ICP following nitroglycerin treatment.

Following the nitroglycerin trial, the patient underwent a shunt revision in which her existing M Blue/SA 0/0-40 programmable valve was replaced with two Miethke SA-20 fixed-setting valves. Initially, she reported symptomatic improvement, but soon returned with worsening headaches and lethargy. She also experienced episodic vomiting, which she recognized from previous episodes of shunt dysfunction. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits. On admission, cranial CT revealed no evidence of shunt disconnection, and ventricular size remained unchanged compared with prior imaging. A shunt reservoir puncture confirmed a functioning ventricular drain and normal CSF composition. To further evaluate ICP dynamics, invasive parenchymal ICP monitoring was performed, revealing a mean daytime ICP of approximately 12 mm Hg and a mean nighttime ICP of 19 mm Hg with B-wave activity.

A repeat shunt revision was performed to assess for potential malfunction. Testing of shunt components demonstrated normal function, except for increased outflow pressure at the atrial catheter end, measured at 20 cm H2O (approximately 15 mm Hg). Echocardiography was conducted to assess possible cardiac contributors to venous congestions, revealing normal cardiac anatomy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%–60%, and no evidence of thrombi, tricuspid regurgitation, or pulmonary hypertension. Because of nocturnal symptoms, polysomnography was conducted and excluded obstructive sleep apnea as a contributing factor.9Additionally, the patient had no history of chronic corticosteroid use, further excluding potential systemic causes of venous hypertension. For an overview of the patient’s clinical trajectory, including key symptoms, investigations, and interventions, seeTable 1.

These findings reaffirmed that elevated systemic venous pressure impaired effective VA shunt drainage, resulting in increased ICP. Given the previously observed adverse effects of nitroglycerin, an alternative approach using acetazolamide was attempted, following a regimen similar to that used for IIH. The treatment has so far been effective, with the patient experiencing symptomatic improvement. No additional ICP measurements were obtained after the initiation of acetazolamide therapy.

The necessary informed consent was obtained in this study.

Nitroglycerin was used as a venous unloading strategy to reduce CVP and RAP, thereby improving VA shunt drainage.21,22Nitroglycerin can induce headaches due to intracranial vasodilation.23,24Therefore, it is not conventionally used for patients with a history of headaches. We hypothesized a different response in this case, as venous congestion was the primary cause of elevated ICP. A low-dose, slow-acting nitroglycerin regimen was chosen to minimize acute intracranial vasodilation, with the expectation that intracranial venodilation would occur immediately, whereas improved cerebral venous drainage would develop more gradually. The initial reduction in ICP after nitroglycerin administration supported the hypothesis that elevated RAP was impairing VA shunt function. However, treatment still resulted in significant headache exacerbation, likely due to intracranial vasodilation rather than an increase in ICP itself, limiting its treatment potential.25While systemic venous unloading strategies hold promise, further studies are needed to determine their role in ICP management and whether alternative dosages or venodilators could provide benefits without intolerable side effects. Given its side effects and potential loss of effectiveness over time, nitroglycerin may be more suitable as a diagnostic tool to assess the venous pressure–ICP relationship rather than as a long-term treatment option.

Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor commonly used in IIH, was subsequently administered and resulted in symptomatic improvement. Although its primary mechanism of action is not completely clear, acetazolamide likely reduces CSF production, contributing to the observed clinical benefit.19,26Additionally, it is thought to have a mild diuretic effect that may have led to a reduction in systemic venous pressure.19,26However, whether the symptom relief was primarily due to reduced CSF production or a reduction in systemic venous pressure remains unclear, since we did not obtain a repeat venous pressure measurement. Likewise, follow-up parenchymal ICP monitoring was not performed after initiating acetazolamide. Although such data would have helped clarify the mechanism of symptom relief, the patient’s stable condition did not warrant invasive procedures. Clinically, the observed improvement supports reduced CSF production or enhanced venous outflow as potential mechanisms, although this cannot be definitively confirmed.

Should the patient’s symptoms recur or fail to respond adequately to acetazolamide, additional medical and surgical options will be considered. Topiramate may be trialed as an alternative CSF-suppressing agent, particularly if a coexisting migrainous component is suspected. Diuretic therapy may also be introduced to target systemic venous pressure. If medical therapy proves inadequate, reevaluation of the distal drainage site will be considered. Although we generally avoid pleural shunts in our practice due to their complication profile,27they may be considered as a future option in this specific case. Given the significant impact of systemic venous pressure on VA shunt function, routine preoperative CVP measurement may identify patients at risk for shunt failure due to elevated RAP. This assessment would be particularly relevant in patients with known pulmonary or cardiac conditions, clinical signs suggestive of elevated venous pressures, or a long-standing history of VA shunt use where venous pressures may progressively increase.

Future studies systematically assessing the clinical utility of preoperative CVP measurements, especially among patient populations predisposed to elevated systemic venous pressure, could improve patient selection, reduce VA shunt failures, and enhance long-term clinical outcomes.

This case highlights that elevated RAP can significantly impair CSF drainage, even with a mechanically functional VA shunt. Although idiopathic in this patient, systemic causes of elevated venous pressure should be carefully evaluated in patients with unexplained intracranial hypertension following VA shunt placement. Preoperative measurement of CVP could help identify patients at risk. However, further research is required to confirm its clinical utility.

Nitroglycerin effectively reduced ICP via venous unloading; however, its therapeutic utility was limited by exacerbation of headaches. Despite this limitation, nitroglycerin’s ability to rapidly lower ICP in patients with elevated systemic venous pressure highlights its potential role as a diagnostic tool to identify treatment failure related to elevated venous pressures in VA shunt patients. Acetazolamide subsequently provided symptomatic relief, presumably by reducing CSF production and a mild diuretic effect, although the exact mechanism remains uncertain. Increased awareness of elevated systemic venous pressure as a factor in VA shunt dysfunction may help improve patient selection and management strategies.
