Ruthenium-bearing intermetallics (Ru-IMCs) featured with well-defined structures and variable compositions offer new opportunities to develop ammonia synthesis catalysts under mild conditions. However, their complex phase nature and the numerous controlling parameters pose major challenges for catalyst design and exploration. Herein, we demonstrate that a combination of machine learning (ML) and model mining techniques can effectively address these challenges. Based on the combination techniques, we generate a two-dimensional activity volcano plot with adsorption energies of N2and N, and identify the radius of atom coordinating to Ru as a key parameter. The well-designed Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2reaches as high as 8.18 mmol m−2h−1at 0.1 MPa and 400 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with N2-TPD and FT-IR studies reveal that Ru‒N interaction is controlled by thed-porbital hybridization between Ru and N. These findings underscore the importance of ML towards material design on exploring IMCs for ammonia synthesis.

Developing Ru-intermetallic catalysts for mild ammonia synthesis faces structural complexity. Here, machine learning identified Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, optimizing Ru–N bonding and orbital hybridization, enhancing catalytic activity under mild conditions.

Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important chemical intermediates for chemical and energy industries1–7. A primary challenge of ammonia synthesis is the breaking of the N ≡ N triple bond, which is one of the strongest bonds among diatomic molecules8–13. Therefore, the Cat–N interaction has been the central material design guidelines for ammonia synthesis catalysts14–22. Among the reported systems23–29, Ru-based catalysts have been intensively investigated because of the relatively optimized Ru–N bond strength, facilitating N2dissociation and NHxformation30–37. One of the successful examples includes the combination with counter elements to create electron-rich Ru and optimized the Ru–N bond strength34,37. In particular, alloying strategy can control its electronic properties, such as d-band center, so as Ru–N bond strength38,39. In addition, Ru sites of alloys and intermetallic compounds are characterized by robust structural and electronic stability, enabling longer catalytic cycles40,41. For example, Hosono et al.34. presented a series of Ru-containing intermetallics (Ru-IMCs), with LaRuSi electride standing out for superior stable performance in NH3synthesis. These findings have provided a new degree of freedom for catalysts design by allowing lattice Ru to participate in the catalytic cycle. However, the correlation between the electronic states of Ru within IMCs and their catalytic efficacy in ammonia synthesis remains elusive. Most importantly, the vast array of potential Ru-containing IMCs poses a significant challenge for material selection using only chemical intuition or the conventional trial and error method.

Machine learning (ML) techniques, with their robust ability to restructure information and support multidimensional features, are widely used in materials informatics42–44. These techniques significantly enhance the capacity to process and summarize large datasets, thereby accelerating catalyst discovery and optimization in various catalytic reactions45–50. Recently, ML has been employed to accelerate the discovery of A2BC2ternary electrides, which exhibit high catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis under mild conditions when loaded with Ru51. Even though the study successfully identified fundamental heuristics for the formation of new electrides, the connection between the materials screening and the catalyst performance within the explored parameter space remains unclear. Additionally, there appear to be very few studies that have employed ML for the development of ammonia synthesis catalysts, particularly those focusing on Ru-IMCs catalysts.

Herein, we developed a ML workflow to screen and predict highly active Ru-IMCs catalysts for ammonia synthesis. Utilizing 201 samples, we constructed a two-dimensional volcano plot, which is scaled by the adsorption energies of N2and N atoms, EN2and EN. In it, NdRu2was found as the potential having optimized parameters, which can be further optimized by Sc-doping. Indeed, the catalytic activity of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2reached as high as 8.18 mmol m−2h−1at 0.1 MPa and 400 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) combined with N2-TPD and FT-IR studies revealed that Ru‒N interaction was controlled by thed-porbital hybridization between Ru and N. Thus, Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, which exhibits larger electronic density of state near the Fermi level than Ru and NdRu2shows higher Ru‒N interaction and N2dissociation rates. These findings underscore the importance of ML and DFT combined material design on exploring Ru-IMCs for ammonia synthesis.

The workflow for designing efficient Ru-based intermetallic catalysts for ammonia synthesis was outlined in Fig.1, comprising three main components: materials theoretical prediction, experimental verification, and reaction mechanism analysis. Firstly, a foundational dataset containing 201 Ru-based binary intermetallics was curated from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) for ML models, which are listed in Supplementary Table1. Training of the models involved using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithms for regression predictive modeling. The regression model demonstrating the best performance was then leveraged to predict unexplored materials with promoted activity for ammonia synthesis. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis, an interpretable ML technique, was employed to identify the parameters for optimizing the nitrogen interaction, which was crucial as the adsorption energies of N2(EN2) and N atoms (EN) were pivotal activity indicators, playing a key role in the N2activation, and N atoms hydrogenation in the subsequent ammonia formation pathway (Supplementary Fig.1). To validate the predictions, materials preparations, structural characterization, and catalytic activity evaluations were conducted on the predicted Ru-IMCs materials. Finally, in-situ characterization and DFT calculations were employed to uncover insights into the reaction mechanism enhancing catalytic activities in ammonia synthesis.

The workflow includes stablishing a foundational dataset of Ru-based IMCs; utilizing machine learning to create an activity volcano plot dependent on ENand EN2for material screening; preparing Ru-IMCs and testing their ammonia synthesis performance; conducting DFT calculations and in-situ characterization to investigate the underlying mechanisms.

For ML of Ru-based binary intermetallics, each case was described using multidimensional vectors that considered both element-specific and chemical environment features of Ru active sites. Here, the composition of the IMCs is characterized by the normalized stoichiometric ratio of the elements present in the material (denoted as NSR). The chemical environment of the active sites is defined by the Miller indices (denoted as (h k l)), the total number of atoms in the sites (denoted as site atoms), and the Ru ratio of the sites (denoted as Ru ratio). Furthermore, the coordination specificity of the elements is determined by the variance in the first ionization energy in comparison to Ru (denoted as Δ(X-Ru)) and the radius of the coordinating elements (denoted asr(X)). Here, the selected features possessed high irrelevance in heat map depicted Fig.2a, indicating they independently represent an aspect of the atomic and electronic structure of the chemical system while being correlated and independent. To augment the prediction accuracy of ML, we evaluated the performance of multiple regression algorithms, including XGB, Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models (Fig.2b). The obtained adsorption energy data of EN2and ENwas randomly shuffled and divided, with 80% for the training model and the remaining 20% for test model (Fig.2c). The difference between the predicted and calculated values was defined as the error to assess the models’ performance. As depicted in the violin plot (Fig.2b), the XGB model displayed the most competitive prediction accuracy for error values and probability density for the adsorption energy of both N2and N atoms among the five models, with details of the predictions of different models displayed in Supplementary Figs.2–5. Additional evaluation metrics for model accuracy were summarized in Supplementary Tables2and3. Across all metrics, including MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and R² (R-square), the XGB model consistently demonstrated the best performance and can be utilized for the ML algorithms.

Next, a volcano plot was generated using the XGB model algorithm to evaluate the catalytic activity of various Ru-IMCs catalysts (Fig.2d). All predicted EN/EN2values for the Ru-IMC catalysts are listed in Supplementary Table1and Supplementary Fig.6. Considering the elementary steps of ammonia synthesis, the energy barriers of each step can be depicted by the adsorption energies of N2and N atoms. Subsequently, we calculated their adsorption energies on different surfaces of Ru-IMCs through high-throughput methods, represented by the gray square points in Fig.2d. To validate the accuracy of these data points, a selection of them was prepared, and their catalytic activities for ammonia synthesis were measured under conditions of 0.1 MPa and 400 °C. The reaction rates were determined for YRu2, LaRu2, and Ga3Ru, showing the order of Ga3Ru (N. D.) <LaRu2(0.25 mmol g−1h−1) < YRu2(0.57 mmol g−1h−1) (Supplementary Fig.7), aligning well with the trend observed in the volcano plot (Fig.2d). Additionally, in Fig.2d, the positions corresponding to Ru-IMCs represented by the blue circles were identified through ML screening, with NdRu2emerging as a promising candidate for ammonia synthesis due to its proximity to the apex of the volcano plot. Next, we obtained NdRu2pure phase through arc-melting and further tested its catalytic performance (Supplementary Fig.8). The ammonia production rate of NdRu2is as high as 0.86 mmol g−1h−1, surpassing that of YRu2, LaRu2, and Ga3Ru, which is in line with the predicted trend of the volcano plot, but it still does not quite reach the peak of the volcano plot (Fig.2d). Referring to Fig.2d, focusing on NdRu2, enhancing N2adsorption without altering the interaction of N atoms too much could bring us closer to the volcano plot’s apex. Typically, element doping serves as an effective method to tailor the properties of the host material, potentially modifying the surface adsorption strength of the reactant molecules. Nevertheless, in the absence of clear guidance, the options for doping can become overwhelming and arbitrary.

In order to uncover the underlying chemical patterns within the model and facilitate optimization, we utilized the SHAP value method to delve into the complex relationship between features and adsorption energies. A negative SHAP value for a feature indicates an enhancement on ENor EN2through the XGB model’s output. As illustrated in Fig.2e, instances of robust N atom adsorption tendencies were typically linked to high feature values of NSR and atoms, but low feature values ofr(X) and Ru ratio. Conversely, cases involving N2adsorption usually demonstrated elevated feature values of Δ(X-Ru) and Ru ratio, alongside lower feature values ofr(X). By combining the feature importance values outlined in Fig.2fand Supplementary Table4, replacing an element with a lowerr(X) at the Nd site could enhance N2adsorption while minimally impacting the strength of N atoms, thereby potentially enhancing the catalytic performance of NdRu2.

By using the arc-melting method, we successfully synthesized the Laves phase NdRu2. In this structure, Ru atoms occupy sites with a coordination number (CN) of 12, forming a Frank-Kasper polyhedron. The Nd atoms, on the other hand, have a CN of 16. This well-defined crystal structure and the combination of elements spanning the periodic table provide a unique opportunity to tune the properties of Ru by modifying the Nd site. Since Nd is a rare earth element, we use a light rare earth element, Sc as the doping element and designed a novel Sc-doped NdRu2intermetallic catalyst. Here we have optimized the molar ratio of Sc doping to be 12.5% (Supplementary Fig.9), that can be denoted as Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. Given a smaller radius of Sc (160 pm) compared to Nd (185 pm), the substitution of Nd atoms with Sc is expected to induce lattice contraction of NdRu2. As shown in Fig.3b, Rietveld refinement was conducted to precisely verify the expected lattice change observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Upon doping with Sc, the lattice parameters of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2are smaller than those of NdRu2(contracting from 7.613 Å to 7.573 Å), consistent with the structural relaxation predicted by our DFT calculations (Fig.3a). The Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) of Ru K-edge as depicted in Fig.3creveals a slight shift of the first nearest-coordination peaks in R space of NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. The curve fitting results of all three samples are listed in Supplementary Figs.10and11and Supplementary Tables5and6, which demonstrates that the specific Ru−Nd bond length decreases from 2.55 Å (NdRu2) to 2.48 Å (Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2), further confirming the lattice contraction induced by Sc incorporation.

The electronic structure of NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2was analyzed using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Illustrated in Fig.3d, the absorption pre-edge positions follow the sequence of Ru foil > Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2> NdRu2, indicating the negatively charged nature of the Ru species in both NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, with the electron density of Ru being slightly lower in Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2than that in NdRu2. Figure3e, fdepict the XPS Ru 3dspectra with respect to the binding energy of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2and NdRu2. The noticeable shifts of typical peaks to lower energy also indicate negatively charged feature of surface Ru sites, which is consistent with the XANES results. While the Nd 3dpeaks exhibit a significant shift to higher energy compared to Nd03d(Supplementary Fig.12). These findings suggest that Nd and Sc donate electrons while Ru accepts electrons in NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2systems. The enrichment of electrons on the surface Ru highlights the potential for promoting the back-donation of electrons to the antibondingπ-orbitals of adsorbed N2.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to investigate the microstructure of NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. The elemental distribution in Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2was assessed using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, depicted in the middle of Fig.3g, revealing the uniform dispersion of Nd, Sc, and Ru elements in Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2particle. On the right side of Fig.3g, a distinct lattice corresponding to the (3 1 1) index was evident, consistent with the Fourier transform pattern in the inset. Additional crystal plane orientations can be observed in Supplementary Fig.13. The interplanar spacings of NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2measured by TEM are summarized in Fig.3h. It is apparent that following Sc doping, all interplanar spacings demonstrate a contraction of 4.3–7.4%, aligning with theoretical calculations (Fig.3a), XRD patterns (Fig.3b), and EXAFS results (Fig.3c).

We successfully doped NdRu2by Sc with a smaller ion radius to create a new Ru-IMCs, Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, and sought to evaluate its performance in catalytic ammonia synthesis. In Fig.4a, the catalytic activity is depicted as a function of temperature over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, NdRu2, and Ru metal. The ammonia production rate of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2reached 2.77 mmol g−1h−1, which is 3 times higher than that of NdRu2(0.86 mmol g−1h−1) at 400 °C and 0.1 MPa, while pure Ru metal exhibited negligible activity. Note that the catalytic activity of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2surpasses that of other intermetallic catalysts investigated under similar reaction conditions, such as LaRuSi (1.76 mmol g−1h−1), LaCoSi (1.25 mmol g−1h−1), and YRu2(0.57 mmol g−1h−1) (Fig.4b). The activities of Ru/MgO and Ru/AC catalysts are also referenced as typical Ru-based catalysts; they exhibited lower activities for ammonia production, at 0.80 mmol g−1h−1and 0.77 mmol g−1h−1(Supplementary Fig.14), respectively, significantly less than that of the Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2catalyst. Despite having a relatively low surface area of only 0.34 m2g−1, Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2yields a remarkable reaction rate of 8.18 mmol m−2h−1when assessed by specific activity, positioning it as one of the most active binary Ru-based intermetallic catalysts (Fig.4band Supplementary Tables7and8).

In the earlier section on ML, we noted that the small radius of the coordinating atom in Ru-IMCs would notably improve their N2adsorption, thereby enhancing the activity of ammonia synthesis. Here, if we introduce the element Y with a slightly larger atomic radius (180 pm) than Sc and incorporate it into NdRu2at the same ratio, the resulting Y1/8Nd7/8Ru2catalyst displays a catalytic activity of 0.94 mmol g−1h−1for ammonia production (Supplementary Fig.15). This places it between Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2(2.77 mmol g−1h−1) and NdRu2(0.86 mmol g−1h−1), underscoring the significant impact of the doping atomic radius on enhancing the activity of NdRu2. The outstanding catalytic performance observed with small atomic radius element doping in NdRu2for ammonia synthesis aligns with the trend depicted in the volcano plot in Fig.2d, which emphasizes our methodology of utilizing the XGB algorithm for screening and optimizing Ru-IMCs catalysts for ammonia synthesis through ML as a reliable and effective approach.

The kinetics of ammonia synthesis over NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2catalysts were analyzed using the ammonia production rates (r) at different reaction temperatures. A series of Arrhenius plots were generated by plotting lnragainst 1/T. The slope of the Arrhenius plot allowed for the calculation of the apparent activation energy (Ea) for Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, resulting in a value of 38.7 kJ·mol−1(Fig.4c). This represents a reduction of approximately 30% compared to theEafor the undoped NdRu2catalysts (58.9 kJ·mol−1), providing evidence that Sc doping significantly enhances the ammonia synthesis reaction over NdRu2. The suppressedEais attributed to Sc doping, which improves the adsorption of N2, thereby reducing the energy barrier for N2dissociation on Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. This hypothesis is initially supported by the N2reaction orders, with the N2reaction order for undoped NdRu2being close to unity (α= 0.94). While, the N2reaction order was measured to be 0.77 over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2(Fig.4d), indicating higher efficiency of N2dissociation on Sc doped NdRu2. Compared to NdRu2, Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2not only exhibits a lower activation energy but also demonstrates a fundamental improvement in resistance to hydrogen poisoning. Figure4dillustrates the H2reaction orders, with the undoped NdRu2catalyst showing a negative value of −0.22, which demonstrates a strong hydrogen adsorption on its surface, named hydrogen poisoning effect. Conversely, the H2reaction order of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2is positive, reaching 0.79 (Fig.4d), indicating that hydrogen poisoning has been mitigated by Sc doping. This substantial difference results in markedly different catalytic performance under high-pressure conditions, where the reaction rate over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2shows an approximately linear response to pressure increase. This led to a fourfold increase to 9.03 mmol g−1h−1when the reaction pressure rose from 0.1 to 0.9 MPa (Fig.4e). Such enhancement of catalytic activity with pressure is not observed for NdRu2, as the catalytic performance remains independent of total pressure, probably attributed to the hydrogen poisoning effect over NdRu2. We further investigated the high-pressure responsiveness of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. As shown in Supplementary Fig.16, the reaction rate increased monotonically to 15.85 mmol g−1h−1at 2.0 MPa, indicating a positive pressure effect for Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2in ammonia synthesis. The exceptional stability of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2is evidenced by its sustained activity over 105 h at 400 °C under pressures of 0.1 MPa and 0.9 MPa, respectively (Fig.4f). XRD patterns show the lattice parameters of the used Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2sample are slightly larger than those of the fresh sample (increasing from 7.573 to 7.584 Å, Supplementary Figs.17and18), likely due to the incorporation of hydrogen, which will be discussed below. Repeatable ammonia synthesis activity was observed for different batches of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2over an 80-h period (Supplementary Fig.19).

To explore the origin of high performance of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, we conducted computational studies using first-principles calculations. Bader charge analysis indicates that the valence states of Ru in NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2are −0.66 and −0.61, respectively, signifying electron transfer from Nd and/or Sc to Ru in the lattice of these intermetallic compounds (Supplementary Table9), consistent with the experimental results in XANES and XPS (Fig.3d–f). It is important to note that the electronic structure analysis from the XANES and XPS results demonstrates that the electron density of Ru in Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2is lower than that in NdRu2(Fig.3d–f), yet N2activation is significantly enhanced over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2(Fig.4d). This observation contradicts the well-known assumption that increasing the electron density of Ru active sites would enhance electron back donation for N2dissociation and subsequently ammonia production.

Motivated by the aforementioned discrepancy, we conducted DFT calculations to elucidate the electronic structure of these catalysts. Figures5a–cdisplays the band structures of the Ru element in Ru, NdRu2, and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, in which the electron states near the Fermi level of both NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2are significantly higher than that of pure Ru. To discern the enhanced N2activation over NdRu2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, we calculated the projected density of states (pDOS), and the 3σand 2πorbitals of free N2contribute to the energy range of −4 to 0 eV, aligning well with the energy level of Rudorbitals (Fig.5d), and their overlap is most prominent over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2(Fig.5e), indicating a strong tendency for Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2to interact with N2. Additionally, the pDOS results of adsorbed N2reveal that thep-band of N splits into a bonding state and a small antibonding state (below and above the Fermi level, respectively), with the bonding orbitals of N2hybridizing with Rudorbitals at around −8 to −5 eV (Supplementary Fig.20). Notably, the electronic state at the bonding orbitals of N2-adsorbed Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2exhibits a more negatively shifted energy compared with NdRu2and Ru, indicating a more stabilized N2. The significant N2adsorption results in the weakening of the N ≡ N triple bond and a more pronounced elongation of the bond length over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2(Fig.5e), which is consistent with the prediction made by the SHAP value method in ML, suggesting that doping small-radius elements in Ru-IMCs would enhance N2adsorption.

The work function of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2on the crystal facet (001), the most stable surface, was calculated to be 2.95 eV (Supplementary Fig.21), indicating its high electron donation ability. With the high electronic states near the Fermi level, Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2is poised to facilitate electron injection into the adsorbed N2. Hence, the 3D electron density isosurface map illustrates a pronounced electron transfer from Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2to the adsorbed N2(Fig.5dinset, Supplementary Figs.22–24). The activated N2reaction pathway was further examined on the surfaces of Ru, NdRu2, and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. NdRu2demonstrates stronger N2adsorption compared to Ru, with adsorption energies of −0.94 eV versus −0.62 eV (Fig.5f). The addition of Sc enhances N2adsorption further, increasing it from −0.94 eV to −1.17 eV. This finding is in line with both the previously discussed reaction kinetics findings (Fig.4d) and theoretical calculation results (Fig.2d). The N2dissociation barrier over Ru, NdRu2, and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2was determined to be 1.79 eV (for Ru flat site), 1.32 eV (for Ru B5 site see in Supplementary Fig.25),1.15 eV, and 0.75 eV, respectively, which indicates that the adsorbed N2is more readily cleaved over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2.

Experimental studies were conducted using the calculation data provided to assess the validity of the proposed N2activation mechanism. As depicted in Fig.5g, N2desorption from Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2occurs at 501 °C, a higher temperature range than that from NdRu2(379 °C), while there is almost no desorption from pure Ru, which suggests that the nitrogen interaction strength over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2is significantly stronger, consistent with the calculated adsorption energies shown in Fig.5f. Quantification revealed 0.005 mmol of desorbed nitrogen, a value similar to the number of exposed Ru atoms (0.004 mmol) on the surface of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2catalyst (Supplementary Table10). This, along with the XPS observation of a strongN1speak (~398.4 eV) on the used catalyst that almost disappeared after Ar plasma etching (Supplementary Fig.26), supports the conclusion that the desorbed nitrogen originates primarily from surface species rather than from the bulk material of Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2. FT-IR results reveal broad peaks around 2300–2100 cm−1, attributed to the stretching vibrational mode of chemisorbed N2on Ru sites (Fig.5h). Due to N ≡ N stretching (νN2), the14N2-adsorbed NdRu2exhibits a broad band at 2222.6 cm−1. While,14N2-adsorbed Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2shows a broad band assignable to νN2at around 2191.9 cm−1(Fig.5h). The red-shift of the N2signal is clear evidence of a stronger electronic interaction between N2and Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, in which N2accepts more electrons and is more dissociative than that on NdRu2. For15N2adsorbed on Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, the adsorption band appears around 2118.4 cm−1(Fig.5h), consistent with the value estimated based on the isotope effect (2191.9 cm−1×14/15= 2117.6 cm−1), indicating the chemisorbed N2.

To determine the origin of the resistance to hydrogen poisoning over Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, we conducted an H2-TPD experiment to examine the thermal desorption of the used samples. As depicted in Fig.5i, the mass signal of H2is scarcely detected on NdRu2, whereas a prominent peak is observed at 171 °C on Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, indicating that the ability to incorporate hydrogen has been achieved through the substitution of Sc. The mole ratio of the hydrogen can be estimated to be 0.52 through mass quantification, denoted as Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2H0.52. DFT calculation results also reveal that the hydrogen-involving Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2structure is much more energetically favored than that of NdRu2, further confirming that H−can be trapped in Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2, which accounts for the high resistance to hydrogen poisoning issue.

In summary, we developed a ML workflow to predict highly active Ru-based intermetallic catalysts (Ru-IMCs) for NH3synthesis. A two-dimensional activity volcano plot was constructed by employing the adsorption energies of N2and N atoms as descriptors. Among the candidates evaluated, a novel Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2intermetallic catalyst achieved the highest activity ever reported for Ru-IMCs catalysts. Combining the experimental characterizations and theoretical studies, we found that Sc doping significantly enhances N2activation by augmenting the local electron state near the Fermi level of IMCs. Furthermore, Sc doping provides extra interstitial spaces in the lattice, granting Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2with an unexpected ability to resist hydrogen poisoning, leading to excellent catalytic stability and improved high-pressure performance.

All binary Ru-based intermetallics were collected from ICSD. The identification of adsorption sites on low Miller index surfaces of intermetallics were recognized by pymatgen package. 20% cases of the dataset were calculated the adsorption energy of nitrogen molecule and nitrogen atom through DFT for the model training and testing. The adsorption energy of other 80% were predicted through the selected model. Each case would be represented as a 6-dimension feature vector, and all dimensions were normalized to diminish the influence of different feature scales.

All of the structure relaxation and electronic structure calculations were performed using the DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package52.

The GGA + U method56was used since the local interactions of the f electrons in Nd, with the Coulomb parameterU= 4.8 eV and Hund’s exchangeJ= 0.6 eV57. The description of valence electrons was using plane wave basis kinetic energy cut-off value with 450 eV. All models were fully optimized until the energy and forces were converged to 1 × 10−5eV and 0.0257 eV Å−1, respectively. For cubic relaxion, Nd8Ru16and Sc1Nd7Ru16used a Gamma center mesh of 4 × 4 × 4.

For TS calculation, the parameters of CI-NEB58were kept the same as the structure relaxation. Five transition states were interpolated linearly between initial state and final state by VASPKIT package59.

NdRu2intermetallic was synthesized by arc-melting neodymium (99.9%, Adamas) and ruthenium (99.95%, Adamas) ingots with a molar ratio of 1:2. The resulting silver-gray ingot was annealed in an enclosed quartz tube for a duration of ten days at 1000 °C, followed by water cooling to room temperature. Subsequently, the prepared NdRu2was ground into powder within a glovebox. No additional treatment was performed before utilizing as a catalyst for ammonia synthesis test. Similarly, the intermetallics Sc1/8Nd7/8Ru2and Y1/8Nd7/8Ru2were synthesized like NdRu2with 1/8 Sc (99.9%, Adamas) or Y (99.9%, Adamas) replace Nd. YRu2was prepared from arc-melting with a stoichiometric mixture of Ru (99.95%, Adamas) and Y (99.9%, Adamas) without further treatment. Ga3Ru was obtained based on previous report60. Typically, the Ga (99.99%, Adamas) and Ru (99.95%, Adamas) with a molar ratio of 10:1 were mixed, and loaded into quartz ampoules, then sealed under vacuum. The mixture was heated to 800 °C with 3 °C min−1, kept at 800 °C for 24 h, and finally cooled to room temperature. Excess Ga metal was dissolved with 3 M HCl and washed with deionized water. Ru/MgO and Ru/AC were prepared using commercial MgO (99.9995%, Adamas) and active carbon (99.9995%, Adamas) as supports. MgO or AC and Ru3(CO)12(99.99%, Adamas) were mixed and then sealed in an evacuated silica tube and heated under a temperature programme of 0.5 °C min−1from room temperature to 250 °C, kept at 250 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. All the materials were commercially available without further purification.

The catalytic reactions were conducted in a fixed-bed flow system with a mix gas flow of H2:N2(3:1) at a flow rate of 60 ml min−1. In a typical test, 100 mg catalyst was loaded into the reactor in the glovebox and then pre-treated in a stream of above mix gas flow under 0.1 MPa using a temperature program of heating to 400 °C for 2 h and then holding at 400 °C for 2 h. The reaction was monitored under steady-state conditions of temperature (250–400 °C) with a flow rate of 60 ml min−1under 0.1–0.9 MPa. The produced ammonia was trapped in 5 mmol sulfuric acid solution and the amount of NH4+generated in the solution was determined using an ion chromatograph (Prominence, Shimadzu) equipped with a conductivity detector. Comparison of the catalyst performance was conducted under the same conditions.

The experimental active energy (Ea) was calculated based on Arrhenius plots like follows.

where k is the ammonia synthesis rates, which were less than 20% of that at equilibrium.

wherer,W,y0,q, and (1-m) represent the reaction rate of the ammonia synthesis, the catalyst weight, the mole fraction of NH3at the reactor outlet, the flow rate, and the reaction order with respect to NH3(γ). Finally, the α and β can be determined by plotting the logarithm ofrvs that of N2or H2partial pressure.

The X-ray absorption data at the Ru K-edge of the samples were recorded at room temperature in transmission mode using ion chambers at beam line BL14W1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. The station was operated with a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. During the measurement, the storage ring was operated at energy of 3.5 GeV and a current of 200 mA (top-up). The photon energy was calibrated with the first inflection point in Ru K-edge of Ru metal foil. X-ray absorption fine-structure spectra and X-ray absorption near edge structure were studied using the Athena and Artemis software packages61.
