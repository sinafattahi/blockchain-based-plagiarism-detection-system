Gastric atrophy (GA) is a pre-neoplastic condition leading to gastric cancer (GC). Early GA detection is critical for guiding surveillance and preventing advanced GC. Histology is the current gold standard for GA diagnosis, but is considered not cost-effective for routine screening in Western populations. Serological methods offer a potentially affordable alternative. Understanding GA prevalence, symptom impact, and optimal detection strategies in low-risk Western populations is essential before integrating GA screening into GC prevention programs.

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed GA prevalence in Northern and Western European populations. Key outcomes included GA prevalence (any topographical distribution in the stomach and corpus-specific), effects of symptomatology on prevalence, and differences between serological and histological prevalence.

Twenty-two cross-sectional studies (n= 62,520) were included; 13 used histology and 9 used serology. Overall GA prevalence of any topographical distribution was 13% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7–18%). Histology-based studies reported 21% (95% CI 11–30%) versus 5% (95% CI 3–7%) by serology.

Corpus-involving GA had a pooled prevalence of 6% (95% CI 4–9%), with histology detecting higher rates (10–15%) than serology (4–5%).

In symptomatic populations, GA prevalence rose to 47%, compared to 6–10% in asymptomatic groups. Corpus GA reached 20% in symptomatic patients versus 6–8% in asymptomatic ones.

GA, especially corpus-involving GA, is more prevalent in Western and Northern European populations than previously thought. These findings suggest that screening for GA in these populations may be a viable route to increasing early GC detection rates and improving outcomes.

Gastric atrophy (GA) is a pre-cancerous condition affecting the stomach [1]. It forms part of the inflammation–atrophy–metaplasia–dysplasia–carcinoma pathway known as the Correa cascade [2]. It is characterised by the loss of the normal glandular architecture of the stomach [3] and is most commonly caused byHelicobacter pylori-induced chronic gastritis [4].

Identifying patients with GA is a clinical priority both to guide surveillance and to intervene in preventing advanced gastric cancer (GC) [5]. Traditionally, GA was associated solely with the development of intestinal type gastric cancer (ITGC); however, recent evidence suggests it may also play a role in the pathogenesis of diffuse type gastric cancer (DTGC) [6]. Eradication ofHelicobacter pyloriin patients with GA has been shown to reverse GA and reduce the risk of progression to GC [7]. However, the eradication ofHelicobacter pyloriin patients with established intestinal metaplasia (IM) has not shown the same benefit, highlighting the importance of early detection of GA [8]. This has prompted a search for non-invasive techniques to screen populations to identify patients with GA and, thus, at risk of GC.

Pepsinogen I, the pepsinogen I:II ratio, gastrin-17, andHelicobacter pyloriantigen show high sensitivity and specificity for detecting GA in GC high-risk populations, particularly in Asia [9]. However, data on GA prevalence in lower-risk GC populations, such as those in Western and Northern Europe, are limited, thus impacting the design of diagnostic accuracy studies to assess serological-based GA diagnosis in these populations [10]. Existing studies suggest a prevalence of 10–18.5% [11], but more precise estimates are needed to guide cost-effective GC screening strategies. To address this gap, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to assess GA prevalence in these low-risk regions and inform future research and clinical guidelines.

This systematic review aims to synthesize for the first time all of the available evidence assessing the prevalence of GA in GC low-risk Western populations, specifically focused on Northern and Western European populations.

Outcomes of interest included the prevalence rate of GA regardless of topographical distribution in the stomach, the prevalence rate of GA affecting the corpus of the stomach, the effects of symptomatology on prevalence rates, and the differences in prevalence rates reported by histological assessment and serological assessment.

This is a systematic review of studies assessing the prevalence of GA in Northern and Western European populations. The reporting of this systematic review is in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [12]. This systematic review was registered prospectively with the PROSPERO database, registration number: CRD42024570311.

All studies addressing the prevalence rates of GA in Northern and Western European populations were considered for inclusion. Only studies available in the English language were assessed. Studies reporting the prevalence rates based on histological and serological diagnosis were considered. Bibliographic databases were searched from inception until January 2025.

This study defined Northern and Western European countries as those classified by the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN), which is part of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). By GLOBOCAN definitions, Northern and Western European countries include Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Greenland, Iceland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, the UK, and Ireland [13,14]. The Baltic states were excluded due to the recognition that the Baltic states are more closely aligned with those of Eastern European countries socioeconomically and so would share similar etiological factors and thus incidence and prevalence rates of GC [15,16].

Studies addressing the prevalence of GA in GC high-risk countries, those available only as abstracts where sufficient data could not be extracted, and those involving children were excluded. Studies describing the prevalence of GA in the setting of established GC were excluded as they would artificially raise the prevalence and are not representative of a general population-based prevalence of GA.

If a study included populations from both a suitable low-risk country and an unsuitable high-risk country, the data pertaining to the low-risk country were extracted for inclusion where possible.

A search strategy was developed in coordination with a medical librarian. The search string utilized keywords and MeSH terms for “prevalence” and “gastric atrophy” or “atrophic gastritis.” This strategy was chosen to keep the search sufficiently broad to capture all relevant studies. The search string was applied to the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. All databases were searched from inception with no language restriction until January 2025.

Two authors independently extracted the required data from the eligible studies using a predetermined data extraction form. Any conflicts in the extracted data were resolved by consensus. The data extracted included the authors, year of publication, study design, number of patients, patient demographics, and the prevalence of GA.

Two of the authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each of the included studies using the AXIS tool for assessing cross-sectional studies [18,19].

This systematic review’s outcome of interest was the prevalence rate of GA in Western and Northern European populations. Prevalence rates were converted to proportions to allow for meta-analysis between suitable studies. The effect size was expressed as a proportional prevalence rate with the standard error (SE) calculated using the equation SE = √p(1-p)/n where p is the sample proportion (prevalence proportion) and n is the sample size. Meta-analysis was performed using the Meta-Essentials software package [20].Pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

After applying the search string to the respective bibliographic databases, 6341 articles were identified. Following the identification and removal of duplicate studies/papers, 4073 articles remained. Following a screening of the titles and abstracts of these articles, 4051 were excluded as they did not meet the aforementioned inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight full articles were sought for review. Following a full review of these articles, 6 were excluded as they concerned high-risk populations and not the populations of interest for this study. This resulted in 22 unique studies being suitable for inclusion in qualitative and quantitative review. The PRISMA flow chart is depicted in Fig.1.

Tables1and2outline the characteristics of the included studies. The final 22 included studies were published between 1985 and 2021 [21–42]. Finland was the country of origin of most of the studies, numbering 8 in total [21–24,26,28,36,39], followed by Sweden (n= 4) [32,33,38,40], Germany (n= 3) [25,41,42], the Netherlands (n= 3) [29,35,37], the UK (n= 2) [27,30], and France (n= 2) [31,34]. All of the included studies were cross-sectional in nature, with the majority being prospective [23–26,28–32,34,35,37–42] and only five being retrospective [21,22,27,33,36]. The 22 included studies involved a total of 62,520 patients, with 44,571 males and 12,090 females, with a mean age across the studies of 58. Notably, three studies did not give a breakdown of the male-to-female ratio [33,39,42], and four did not give a breakdown of age [24,26,29,33].

GA was diagnosed using the gold standard of histological assessment of biopsies taken by endoscopy in 13 of the included studies [21,23,26,27,30–32,34,36–38,41,42] and via serological assessment alone in 9 studies [22,24,25,28,29,33,35,39,40]. There was heterogeneity among the studies in terms of which histological reporting system was used to report GA and which serological markers and cutoff values thereof were used in the serological-based studies (Table1). A number of studies used a combination of histological and serological assessments; however, where this occurred, the histological result was taken as the true value of GA prevalence.

The topographical distribution of GA was not consistently reported across all studies. Sixteen studies reported the prevalence of Corpus GA, which is considered the higher risk form of GA, as distinct from distal or antral predominant GA [22–24,26–28,30–36] [40] [41] [42]. Table2outlines the prevalence of GA, regardless of topographical distribution, and of Corpus GA where reported. The proportional prevalence rates are also reported for each study.

Two authors independently appraised each included study for risk of bias using the AXIS tool specifically designed for the critical appraisal of cross-sectional studies [19]. All of the included studies were deemed to be of low risk of bias, with the exception of the five studies, which were performed retrospectively [21,22,27,33,36]. These five studies were deemed to be of moderate risk of bias.

A funnel plot analysis was conducted for the meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of GA regardless of topographical distribution in the stomach and for the meta-analysis of the prevalence of GA affecting the corpus of the stomach (Appendices 1 and 2). Both funnel plots displayed asymmetry, being skewed to the right, suggesting publication bias. The adjusted combined effect size was closer to zero in both, suggesting the reported pooled effects may be overestimated due to missing negative or null results.

All of the included studies reported on the prevalence of GA; however, the precise topographical distribution was not always reported. Figure2a depicts the meta-analysis of the prevalence of GA regardless of topographical distribution in the stomach. The pooled effect size for this meta-analysis was 0.13 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.07 to 0.18, which was statistically significant,P-value < 0.00. Significant heterogeneity was found in the included studies with an I2value of 99%.

Figure2b displays a subgroup analysis of the prevalence of GA regardless of topographical distribution in the stomach, with subgroups divided depending on the method of analysis, namely histological assessment or serological assessment. The histological assessment subgroup, comprised of 13 studies, had an overall effect size of 0.21 with a 95% CI between 0.11 and 0.3, which was statistically significant,P-value < 0.00. This subgroup had significant heterogeneity, with an I2of 99%. The overall effect size for the serological group, which comprised nine studies, was 0.05, with a 95% CI between 0.03 and 0.07, which was statistically significant,P-value < 0.00. This subgroup had significant heterogeneity, with an I2of 93%.

Figure3a depicts the meta-analysis of the prevalence of GA affecting the Corpus; 16 of the included studies reported on this finding [22–24,26–28,30–36,40–42]. The overall effect size was 0.06 with a 95% CI between 0.04 and 0.09, which was statistically significant,P-value < 0.00. There was significant heterogeneity between the included studies, with an I2of 93%.

Figure3b depicts the subgroup analysis of the previously mentioned meta-analysis, with subgroups divided based on the assessment methods, namely histological assessment or serological assessment. Ten of the included studies assessed the prevalence of corpus GA using histological assessment of biopsies; the pooled effect size for this subgroup was 0.1 with a 95% CI between 0.05 and 0.15, which was statistically significant,P-value < 0.00. There was significant heterogeneity in this subgroup, I2of 94%.

Serological assessment was used to assess the prevalence of corpus GA in six of the included studies. The pooled effect size for this subgroup was 0.04 with a 95% CI between 0.03 and 0.05, which was statistically significant,P-value < 0.00. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies in this subgroup, I2of 89%.

Figure4a depicts the meta-analysis of the prevalence of GA of any topographical distribution with a subclassification stratified by symptomatology. Symptomatic cohorts were defined as patients presenting for testing (either via gastroscopy with biopsy or via serological assessment) to investigate upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as dyspepsia and reflux. Asymptomatic cohorts were taken to be patients tested as part of a screening study, and so by definition were asymptomatic. All of the included studies reported on these variables; however, Sipponen et al. [21] was excluded from this meta-analysis as this study assessed a mixed cohort of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, with 41% of the asymptomatic patients being first-degree relatives of GC patients and so being at higher risk of GC and thus higher risk of GC precursor lesions by default. On subgroup analysis, six studies assessed the prevalence of GA regardless of topographical distribution in symptomatic patients [22,23,30,31,34,41], yielding an effect size of 0.27 with a 95% CI from 0.06 to 0.47, which was statistically significant with aP-value of 0.00. This subgroup had significant heterogeneity with an I2value of 99%.

The prevalence of GA, regardless of topographical distribution, was assessed in asymptomatic cohorts in 15 of the included studies [24–29,32,33,35–40,42]. The pooled effect size for this subgroup was 0.06 with a 95% CI between 0.03 and 0.1, which was statistically significant with aP-value of 0.00. There was significant heterogeneity within this subgroup, I2value of 95%.

Figure4b depicts the meta-analysis for the prevalence of corpus predominant GA with a subgroup analysis stratified into symptomatic and asymptomatic. Of the included studies, 16 reported on the prevalence of GA affecting the corpus, with a subgrouping by symptoms. The symptomatic subgroup comprised six studies [22,23,30,31,34,41] with a pooled effect size of 0.1 with a 95% CI between 0.00 and 0.2, which was statistically significant,P-value 0.00. This subgroup had significant heterogeneity, with an I2value of 95%.

The asymptomatic subgroup comprised ten studies with a pooled effect size of 0.06 with a 95% CI between 0.03 and 0.08, which was statistically significant,P-value 0.00. There was significant heterogeneity within this subgroup, I2value of 90%.

This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to comprehensively assess the prevalence of GA in Western and Northern European populations. The study aimed to evaluate four key areas: the overall prevalence of GA regardless of topographical distribution in the stomach; the prevalence of GA involving the gastric corpus, which carries a higher risk of progression to GC; differences in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; and the impact of detection method, histology versus serology, on reported prevalence rates.

A total of 22 studies were included, encompassing 62,520 patients with a mean age of 58. Some studies did not report complete demographic information [24,26,29,33,39,42]. The overall pooled prevalence of GA, regardless of its location in the stomach, was 13%, with a 95% CI of 7% to 18% (Fig.2a). When broken down by detection method, studies reporting histology reported a prevalence of 21% (CI 11–30%), compared to just 5% (CI 3–7%) in studies using serology (Fig.2b). This suggests that the true prevalence of GA in Western and Northern European populations may be as high as 30% when using the gold standard of histological diagnosis, significantly higher than previously reported estimates [11]. The subgroup analysis discrepancy between detection methods highlights a potential underestimation of GA prevalence in studies relying solely on serological testing, although the heterogeneity in cutoff values for the serological markers used in the studies warrants caution in interpreting these results.

In terms of corpus-involving GA, which is considered more clinically significant due to its association with increased risk of GC [1], the pooled prevalence across 16 studies was 6% (CI 4–9%) (Fig.3a). Again, prevalence was notably higher in histological assessments (10–15%) compared to serological assessments (4–5%) (Fig.3b). These findings reinforce the concern that serological studies may underreport true disease prevalence. Again, a limitation of our study was the heterogeneity in the cutoff values used by the included studies for the serological diagnosis of GA. Again, this warrants caution when interpreting these results.

When comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts, significant differences emerged. Among symptomatic individuals, the prevalence of GA (regardless of location in the stomach) reached up to 47%, based on data from six studies (Fig.4a). In contrast, 15 studies assessing asymptomatic populations reported lower prevalence rates ranging from 6 to 10%. Similarly, corpus-involving GA was found in up to 20% of symptomatic patients, compared to 6% to 8% in asymptomatic groups (Fig.4b). These findings suggest that symptoms may be an important indicator of underlying atrophic changes. This also has implications for screening programs, which by definition will be assessing asymptomatic populations. These findings also stress the importance of lesion recognition for endoscopists performing gastroscopies, as GA appears to be very prevalent in patients reporting upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Early detection of GA in this cohort may be seen as a form of opportunistic screening.

The implications of these findings are substantial. The higher-than-expected prevalence of GA, particularly corpus involvement, raises important questions about current screening and surveillance strategies in these Northern and Western European countries. While historically GC screening programs in these populations were considered uneconomical due to the relatively low GC prevalence, these updated figures support the need to revisit such programs, which could target early detection of GA as a means to detect GC at an earlier and more treatable stage. Moreover, the data underline the importance of further research into the progression of distal GA to extensive (corpus-involving) GA, as well as the timeline of such progression [43].

This study has several limitations, most notably the significant heterogeneity observed across analyses. To explore potential sources, we conducted a meta-regression using the Meta-Essentials package, examining moderators including publication year, sample size, study design (retrospective vs. prospective), and assessment method (histological vs. serological) (Appendix 3).

Results showed that effect sizes declined slightly but significantly over time (β =  − 0.005, 95% CI [− 0.009, − 0.001],P= 0.020) and with larger sample sizes (β=  − 0.00001, 95% CI [− 0.00002, − 0.000001],P= 0.030), suggesting smaller, older studies may overestimate effects. Prospective designs were associated with lower (though non-significant) effect sizes compared to retrospective ones (β=  − 0.05,P= 0.090). Histological assessment yielded slightly higher effect sizes (β=  + 0.04,P= 0.048), while serological assessment was linked to slightly lower values (β=  − 0.03,P= 0.060).

The observed trends may reflect improved rigour and reduced publication bias in newer, larger studies. Future research should therefore aim to use larger sample sizes to minimize overestimation and increase statistical power, favor prospective designs to minimize bias, and employ histological assessments when feasible, as these tend to yield more valid effect size estimates. By adopting these approaches, the reliability and generalizability of findings in this field can be enhanced.

There was also considerable heterogeneity among the included studies in terms of histological classifications and serological biomarkers used. Pepsinogen I, a key biomarker for corpus atrophy, had widely varying cutoff values across studies, from < 17 to < 150 µg/L. While the inclusion of serological studies could be seen as a limitation of this study, it was crucial to highlight the contrast between diagnostic methods, especially as reliance on serological assessments continues to grow. Our analysis suggests that such reliance may lead to underreporting of the true prevalence of GA and corpus GA in particular. We were unable to control for significant risk factors, such as smoking,H. pyloristatus and family history, for both GA and GC across the studies, which again was evidenced by the high I2values reported. As reported in Appendices 1 and 2, funnel plot analysis also suggested a risk of publication bias, which highlights the need for further well-designed studies, controlled for relevant risk factors, to be conducted.

This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the prevalence of GA in Western and Northern European populations. Unlike the study by Mulder et al. [11], we included studies that assessed prevalence using serological testing. This method is gaining popularity, and we considered it important to evaluate the differences in prevalence rates reported through serological versus histological assessment.

This study demonstrates that the prevalence of GA, both overall and specifically involving the corpus, may be higher than previously reported in Northern and Western European populations. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about the epidemiology of GA in these regions and suggest that current estimates may underestimate the true burden of disease, particularly when serological methods are used. Given the potential increased prevalence, especially of the higher-risk corpus involvement, these results warrant renewed consideration of targeted screening and surveillance programs aimed at identifying GC precursors at an earlier, more treatable stage. Introducing such measures in selected populations could have important implications for improving long-term outcomes in GC through earlier detection and intervention.

Funnel plot analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of GA regardless of topographical distribution in the stomach. Asymmetry was noted, suggesting publication bias. Adjusted combined effect size is closer to zero, which suggests the reported pooled effect may be overestimated due to missing negative or null results. Egger’s regression test indicated the intercept was significantly different from zero (intercept = 6.50, 95% CI: 2.19–10.82,P= 0.005), indicating the presence of small-study effects. This finding supports the visual asymmetry observed in the funnel plot.

Funnel plot analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of GA affecting the corpus of the stomach. Asymmetry was noted, suggesting publication bias. Adjusted combined effect size is closer to zero, which suggests the reported pooled effect may be overestimated due to missing negative or null results. Egger’s test for funnel plot asymmetry indicated a non-significant trend toward publication bias (intercept = 2.22,P= 0.081). While not statistically significant at the conventional level, this finding, combined with visual funnel plot asymmetry and trim-and-fill results, suggests possible small-study effects or publication bias.

Meta-regression results for listed moderators. Meta-regression analyses revealed several factors influencing reported effect sizes. Effect sizes showed a slight but significant decline over time (β=  − 0.005, 95% CI [− 0.009, − 0.001],P= 0.020), indicating that more recent studies tend to report smaller effects. Similarly, larger sample sizes were associated with reduced effect sizes (β=  − 0.00001, 95% CI [− 0.00002, − 0.000001],P= 0.030), suggesting that smaller studies may overestimate effects. Although not statistically significant, prospective study designs tended to report lower effect sizes compared to retrospective designs (β=  − 0.05, 95% CI [− 0.10, 0.01],P= 0.090). Studies employing histological assessment reported slightly higher effect sizes (β=  + 0.04, 95% CI [0.00, 0.08],P= 0.048), while serological assessment was associated with marginally lower effect sizes (β=  − 0.03, 95% CI [− 0.06, 0.00],P= 0.060).
