Such utterances reveal hidden or prereflective meanings that can serve as research data.
The term ‘refer’ denotes expressions of experience that support experiential and knowledge-based interpretation of one’s own or others’ preconceptions.
An informant may recount experiences and refer to emotional states or situations.
A person’s explicit expressions can illuminate shared understanding within the larger whole.
Through these expressions, interviewers can challenge assumptions and deepen insight via dialogue.
Gadamer holds that quotations never reach a final interpretation and always remain open to new meanings.
The topics raised are expressed at a particular moment but originate earlier and persist over time.
Temporality thus matters, as experiences shift and repeated interviews help capture these changes.
Without attention to context and temporal meaning, participants risk becoming anonymous and generic.
A paper describing debriefing practices and ethical considerations in lifeworld interviews from the PhD study was later published.
In our analysis, the categories ‘address’, ‘talk’, and ‘refer’ were integrated to maximise the value of dialogue content related to sensitive themes.
These three categories provide the foundation for coding meaning units tied to the research aims.
Briefings and debriefings were used to prepare participants and follow up on their experiences.
Shared ground rules were established, including respecting others’ views, allowing equal speaking time, and maintaining confidentiality.
Autonomy was reinforced by reminding participants of their right to skip questions, pause, or discontinue participation.
We also clarified that no responses were right or wrong regarding their experiences.
Before collecting data, we prepared tailored questions for both individual and group interviews, as the latter involved interaction among several participants.
Participation in such a focus group carries unique risks, as informants may be asked to speak about sensitive personal issues in front of others, potentially triggering emotional responses.
Safeguards can be applied to conduct FGIs ethically, including managing group dynamics and protecting participants from harm.
Experience binds to one’s entire life and introduces a sense of unfolding journey.
We created a qualitative research methodology, along with analytic and presentational methods, grounded in a hermeneutic view of language.
This methodology is paired with a situational lens that examines what informants address, talk about, and refer to in interviews.
Experience is presented as the epistemic foundation for knowledge that goes beyond the purely subjective, making it vital in humanistic health research.
Every experience cited in research stems from a person’s ongoing life and simultaneously reflects the whole of that life.
To experience something is to undergo events that leave enduring significance.
An ontological view of qualitative research fosters a humanising engagement with others and is rooted in genuine dialogical encounter.
In hermeneutic methodology, primary analytic material consists of transcript excerpts interpreted in context through circular hermeneutic reasoning.
Sensitive issues—such as sexuality, maternal mental health difficulties, body dissatisfaction, shame, or perceived failure around obesity—may be essential for exploring delicate subjective experiences.
The unit offered a lifestyle intervention delivered by an interdisciplinary team that included physiotherapists and nurses.
The PhD study sought to generate and interpret interview material on particularly sensitive themes and drew on Kathleen Galvin and Les Todres’ caring theory of well-being and suffering.
This theory is humanistic and person-centred, grounded in a lifeworld orientation and shaped by the ontological work of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, H-G Gadamer, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s modern view of the body.
The next phase centres on what the informant is discussing, determining what they find most meaningful, and examining how these topics relate to their past, present, and future circumstances.
The final phase directs attention to how the informant describes concrete experiences and how these relate to what is discussed and the way it is expressed.
We propose an ontological approach to hermeneutic data collection and a three-step analytical process that enhances the transparency of hermeneutic interpretation.
