Photoinduced transformation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) can occur in aquatic environment and could lead to the formation of transformation products (TPs) of greater concern than the parent compounds. For such, the fate of epoxiconazole, hymecromone, and coumarin in water was investigated by simulating photoinduced abiotic transformations to assess the toxicity of their TPs and which CEC may be of greatest concern.

Heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2and direct photolysis of selected CECs were exploited to simulate their TPs. The TPs were assessed by means of HPLC coupled with an Orbitrap MS analyser in ESI positive mode, while their toxicity was evaluated through aVibrio fischeribioluminescence assay, and ECOSAR tool.

The formation of numerous TPs via different photoinduced pathways was noticed (27 for epoxiconazole, 6 for coumarin, and 8 for hymecromone, some of which are in the form of structural isomers). Toxicity assessment viaV. fischeriassay showed that, unlike coumarin species, epoxiconazole transformation proceeds through the formation of toxic compounds. By means of ECOSAR software, the formation of predominant more noxious TPs of epoxiconazole was proved than the parent compound for both acute and chronic toxicities. Instead, most TPs of coumarin and hymecromone generally exhibited “harmful” and “toxic” levels of acute and chronic toxicities.

A probable structural identification was assigned to the monitored TPs via HPLC‐HRMS to recognize the several transformation pathways, of which the hydroxylation reaction was predominant, and which compound may be more hazardous in the aquatic system due to its TPs. Epoxiconazole transformation brought to potentially toxic TPs, whereas photoinduced degradation of coumarin and hymecromone resulted in less hazardous TPs. The most significant aspect of this work is the ability of this overall approach to identify the formation of photoinduced TPs that are potentially more toxic than the original CEC.

Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) enter in the aquatic system through many sources, especially wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, and agriculture [1,2,3]. Despite their low concentration in water, CECs are potential sources of pollution [4]. Indeed, once introduced into the aquatic system, CECs are subjected to transport phenomena, leading to bioconcentration and bioaccumulation, as well as degradation processes [5]. As the range of possible pollutants to be monitored is expanding to include their transformation products (TPs), a comprehensive study about CECs transformation is multifaceted. Besides, TPs may provide a greater environmental risk than their parent species [5,6]. Among degradation processes that CECs can undergo in surface waters, photoinduced reactions play a crucial role [7,8]. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is among the advanced oxidation processes that allow not only achieving an efficient CECs removal but can also enable the laboratory‐based simulation of CECs photoinduced degradation [9,10,11]. Due to the interaction of the photocatalyst with light, reactive species are produced such as electrons, holes, and•OH radicals, which can transform CECs [12,13].

Within this framework, we investigated the photoinduced transformation of three CECs, which were selected for this study after a sampling campaign performed on lakes and river waters. Indeed, the presence of epoxiconazole and hymecromone was monitored in several samples of surface water of the Po River and Lake Orta in Italy between August and October 2020. The photodegradation of coumarin, the basic structural unit of hymecromone, was studied as well to deeply investigate the hymecromone TPs. In addition, coumarin itself may be an important plant biomarker unrelated to synthetic drugs.

Epoxiconazole (Figure1A) is a fungicide with a high environmental and human health concern due to its widespread use in agricultural field. In accordance with the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, this fungicide has been listed by the European Union as a category 2 carcinogen and having a category 1A or 1B reproductive toxicity [14]. Moreover, epoxiconazole may inhibit some enzymes of cytochrome P450, thus acting as an endocrine disruptor for nontarget organisms [15]. Finally, the extended use of epoxiconazole raises environmental concerns owing to its persistence and its presence in aquatic effluents [16,17,18]. Therefore, conazole fungicides have been added to the Candidate List based on the persistence, bioaccumulative, and toxic criteria [18]. Furthermore, we studied coumarin (Figure1B) with its derivative, hymecromone (Figure1C, 7‐hydroxy‐4‐methylcoumarin), both detected in a sampling campaign performed in rivers and effluent waters between August and October 2020. Hymecromone is used for its medicinal potentials and as a building block for the synthesis of some insecticides [18]. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Canada Domestic Substances List classified hymecromone as non‐bioaccumulative, non‐intrinsically toxic to aquatic organisms, and nonpersistent [19]. However, their photoinduced fate in water has not been documented in the literature yet, and no information is available about their TPs, resulting in an incentive for their further study.

Chemical structures of epoxiconazole (A), coumarin (B), and hymecromone (C).

Therefore, their monitoring and the characterization of their TPs structures are the purpose of this work. Liquid chromatography (LC) is the most effective technique, as well as the high‐resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for the characterization of TPs through multiple‐stage analyses. The recognition of abiotic transformation pathways of epoxiconazole and the two coumarin species in the euphotic zone of surface waters is possible by means of MSnacquisition [11,20,21]. As mentioned above, the abiotic transformation may lead to the formation of more toxic TPs than their parent compound. Thus, the ecotoxicological impact of the analytes and their TPs was assessed by using the marine bacteriumVibrio fischeriand in silico by means of ECOSAR software.

Epoxiconazole (≥ 99%), coumarin (≥ 99.9%), and formic acid (EMSURE ACS, Reag. Ph Eur, purity 98%–100%) were purchased from Merck Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy), while hymecromone (≥ 99%) from European Pharmacopoeia Reference. Titanium dioxide P25 (TiO2) was exploited as photocatalyst. Acetonitrile (HiPerSolv CHROMANORM, purity ≥ 99.9%) was purchased from VWR Chemicals, Milan, Italy. Syringe filters (Millex LCR) in hydrophilic PTFE with a porosity of 0.45 μm from Merck Millipore were used after photocatalytic tests. All the materials were used without additional purification. All solutions were prepared in ultrapure water, produced by a Milli‐Q system (Evoqua, Pittsburg, USA). For the toxicity assessment, freeze‐dried bacteriaV. fischeri, reconstitution solution, diluent (2% NaCl), and an adjustment solution (nontoxic 22% NaCl) were used and obtained from Azur (Milan, Italy).

whereCtis the concentration of analyte at time t,C0is the initial concentration, and k is the rate constant.

The evaluation of the photostability of the compounds and the formation of their TPs was performed under direct photolytic conditions or under heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO2P25 as photocatalyst.

For direct photolysis experiments, 5 mL of the solution of the analyte was subjected to light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation of the analytes was performed in the aforementioned cells filled with 5 mL of CEC's solution and 400 ppm of TiO2suspension in a ratio of 1:1, put under UV‐A light irradiation for different times. A Philips Cleo 6 × 15‐W TL‐D Actinic BL lamp with maximum emission wavelength at 365 nm was used a light source. Irradiation times were chosen from 5 min to 2 h. After irradiation, the entire content of each cell was filtered through a 0.45‐mm filter and analyzed by HPLC‐HRMS. The degraded samples of epoxiconazole were freeze‐dried before HPLC‐HRMS analysis by using a CoolSafe 55/100 (Montepaone SRL, Turin, Italy). The freeze‐dried product was dissolved in a mixture of 70:30 (v/v) of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water.

The CECs removal and the identification of their TPs were followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). A Thermo Scientific (Milan, Italy) UltiMate 3000 Basic Automated System chromatograph coupled with a Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid high resolution mass analyser via a H‐ESI (Electrospray Ionisation) type ion source was used. The chromatographic separation was achieved by using a C18 Phenomenex (Bologna, Italy) Luna column (15‐cm length × 2‐mm diameter), consisting of particles with a diameter of 3 μm and pore sizes of 100 Å and thermostated at 40°C. The method involved an injection volume of 20 μL and a flow rate of the mobile phase of 0.200 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% formic acid in water (eluent A) and acetonitrile (eluent B). Gradient separation ramp started with 5% B and increased up to 100% B in 30 min.

The mobile phase was transferred to ESI ion source by using nitrogen both as sheath and auxiliary gas. Source parameters were set as follows: sheath gas 35 arb (arbitrary unit), auxiliary gas 21 arb, capillary voltage 4.0 kV, and capillary temperature 275°C. Full mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode in them/zrange between 100 and 700 for epoxiconazole and between 50 and 500 for hymecromone and coumarin, with a resolution of 50 k. MSnspectra were acquired in the range between ion trap cut‐off and precursor ionm/zvalues. Precursor ions were focused on a window of 5m/zfor epoxiconazole, which is a chlorinated species, and 3m/zfor hymecromone and coumarin.

For structural elucidation of TPs, we used the Xcalibur 4.0 (version 4.0.27.13, Thermo Scientific) software data based on mass accuracy (< 5 ppm) and RDB (ring double bond) index. Accuratem/zvalues and isotopic abundance in full mass scan chromatogram were used to identify elemental composition, whereas MSnfragmentation was used to hypothesize structural modifications. We followed the Shymanski rules to assign the identification level for the recognized TPs [22]. Therefore, it was possible to characterize several TPs through MSnacquisition and recognize the probable abiotic transformation pathways, which could occur in the euphotic zone of the surface water. The annotation and the characterization of TPs were carried out on the solutions spiked with TiO2and irradiated for 15 min, when the maximum of their production occurred. The TPs were characterized by assessing their evolution kinetics, chromatography behaviour, accurate mass, and MSnspectra. For each compound, the information derived from MS2and MS3was compared with the fragmentation pathways of the parent substances to assign the tentative structures for most of the TPs.

The acute toxicity of epoxiconazole, hymecromone, and coumarin and their TPs was assessed according to theV. fischeribioluminescence assay [2]. A Microtox Model 500 toxicity analyser (Milan, Italy) was used to monitor changes in the natural emission of the luminescent bacteria by means of the ECOSAR model v2.0. Samples were evaluated in a medium containing 2% NaCl and the degree of bioluminescence inhibition of the marine bacteriumV. fischeriwas recorded after 5, 15, and 30 min of incubation at 15°C [23].

ECOSAR (Ecological Structure Activity Relationships) software v2.2 was used for in silico toxicity prediction of the three analytes and their TPs for three organisms (fish, daphnid, and green algae). The predicted acute and chronic toxicities of TPs were computed by drawing the TP chemical structure or inserting Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. ECOSAR provides values of toxicity according to four levels: a range from 0.0 to 1.0 indicates high toxicity, from 1 to 10 denotes toxicity, from 10 to 100 suggests harmful impacts, and values over 100 are classified as nontoxic [24].

The photoinduced removal of the investigated CECs (epoxiconazole, coumarin, and hymecromone) was assessed, and their abatement profiles are reported in Figure2, while the calculated rate constants (k) are collected in Table1. Direct photolysis promoted a tiny degradation of the three CECs within 60 min of irradiation and around 20% of analytes disappeared. After the addition of TiO2, epoxiconazole exhibited a half‐life time (t½) of 15 min, while for coumarin species was 5 min.

Degradation kinetics parameters of CECs under different photoinduced degradation conditions.

To identify and characterize the chemical structures of the TPs formed from the three CECs after the photoinduced process, the MSnfragmentation pathway for the three parent compounds was comprehensively investigated. The TPs structural characterization was accomplished by comparing the parent compound MSnspectra with TPs fragmentation pathways.

Considering epoxiconazole, the MS2spectrum evidenced several product ions (TableS1) (FigureS1), and the proposed fragmentation pathways are shown in Figure3. In particular, two structurally‐diagnostic product ions of epoxiconazole were identified: the base peak at 121.0446m/z, formed through the loss of a methyl‐1,2,4‐triazole and chlorobenzene, and the acylium ion bound to the chlorophenyl moiety at 138.9944m/z. The signal at 312.0705m/zwas recognized as a result of the loss of an H2O molecule from the epoxiconazole protonated molecular ion. The epoxy ring could also be involved in several fragmentations. For instance, the abundant C7H6ClO+ion (141.0101m/z) was produced and could generate the product ion at 113.0150m/zdue to the loss of CO in MS3. In addition, the epoxy ring opening led to the formation of C10H9N3F+at 190.0777m/zdue to the neutral loss of chlorobenzaldehyde with the subsequent formation of a double bond. Moreover, the 1,2,4‐triazole ring of epoxiconazole broke with the loss of a HCN molecule, as the peak at 303.0702m/zconfirmed with a low abundance. The main fragmentation pathway was the elimination of the 1,2,4‐triazole to produce the C15H11OClF+ion at 261.0483m/z. However, due to its nature of secondary carbocation, C15H11OClF+ion shows a low abundance (1%, TableS1), and the MS2characteristic peaks at 138.9944m/z, 123.0240m/z, and 121.0447m/zwere identified from its MS3spectra assessment.

The MS spectra of coumarin and hymecromone showed the protonated ions at 147.0442m/zand 177.0545m/z, respectively (FigureS2). As shown in TableS2, and illustrated in Figure3, both coumarin and hymecromone mostly underwent the neutral losses of CO and CO2. Indeed, the loss of CO2from coumarin led to the base peak at 103.0549m/z, while the tropylium ion (C7H7+) was formed from the loss of two molecules of CO (Figure4A). As a coumarin derivative, the fragmentation pathway of hymecromone exhibited some similarities with the coumarin one, as shown in the Figure4B. The MS2spectrum of hymecromone displayed two characteristic signals of coumarin, 103.0547m/zand 91.0547m/z, despite their low abundance. The typical losses of CO and CO2from hymecromone produced the peaks at 149.0601m/zand 133.0653m/z, respectively. As MS3study confirmed (TableS2), hymecromone fragments underwent subsequent losses of CO. Finally, the product ion at 131.0496m/zwas formed by formic acid loss.

MSnfragmentation pathways for coumarin (A) and hymecromone (B).

The identification of unknown TPs was performed through the comparison of HPLC/ESI‐HRMS chromatograms before and after 15 min of photocatalytic degradation. Most of the photoinduced TPs of the investigated CECs were detected in the form of structural isomers, due to the non‐selectivity of•OH radicals [18], involved in the heterogeneous photocatalysis process. The accurate mass for all TPs, and thus their corresponding empirical formulae, was established and through an in‐depth analysis of MS2and MS3spectra. Therefore, a probable structure (Level 2 of identification confidence) was assigned to most of TPs, while tentative structural candidates were ascribed especially to the hydroxylated TPs due to insufficient information for one exact structure (Level 3 of identification confidence) [22].

Twenty‐seven TPs were detected during the photoinduced transformation of epoxiconazole. FigureS3depicts their chromatographic profiles, which allowed to evaluate their temporal profiles (FigureS4). As can be seen from FigureS4, most of TPs achieved their maximum concentration in 15 min of irradiation and disappeared in 1 or 2 h, suggesting their production through different concomitant pathways. The overall TPs are presented below based on the process involved in their formation. Moreover, no new different TPs were found from direct photolysis experiments.

The photocatalytic degradation of epoxiconazole showed the formation of numerous hydroxylated derivatives.

Four monohydroxylated species originated from protonated molecules were detected at 346.0756m/z(346‐A, B, C, and D, TableS3). The presence of the isotopic peak at M + 2m/z(348.0722 m/z) confirmed that the chlorophenyl portion was still present after the transformation process (FigureS5). Figure5illustrated the main fragmentations of monohydroxy‐epoxiconazole isomers. All 346 isomers shared some fragmentations with the parent molecule, like the loss of the triazole ring (277.0433m/z). Thus, the triazole ring was supposed not involved in the hydroxylation. Moreover, in the MS2spectra of 346‐B, 346‐C, and 346‐D, a peak at 290.0386m/zwas the indication of the fragmentation involving 1,2,4‐triazole. The absence of this signal in MS2spectrum of 346‐A suggested the effective monohydroxylation on epoxiconazole C1 carbon (Figure1A). The characteristic peak at 141.0101m/zpresent in 346‐A and 346‐D MS2spectra indicated that the chlorophenol portion was not involved in hydroxylation, as confirmed by the acylium ion at 138.9944m/z. MS2investigation on 346‐B and 346‐C, showing 123.0239m/zand 121.0447m/z, indicated that fluorophenyl ring was not hydroxylated. Thus, the chlorophenyl ring of 346‐B and 346‐C products was subjected to hydroxylation, as their MS2peaks at 157.0052m/z, corresponded to hydroxylated chlorophenylmethyl ion, and at 190.0779m/zfrom the complementary neutral loss of hydroxychlorophenylmethanol.

Key fragmentation pathways for epoxiconazole monohydroxy TPs 346‐A, B, C, and D.

The photoinduced transformation of epoxiconazole further occurred via dihydroxylation, as indicated by the three isomers at 362.0702m/z(362‐A, B, and C, TableS3). Some MSnions were common to those of the parent epoxiconazole fragmentation. In 362‐A MS2spectrum, the base peak at 138.9945m/zand the peak at 234.0428m/zimplied the absence of OH groups on the chlorophenyl moiety, as well as in 362‐B due to the peak at 141.0101m/z. Moreover, MS3study on 362‐A fragment ion 293.0377m/zconfirmed the dihydroxylation on fluorophenyl moiety (Figure6). For 362‐B, the low abundant but diagnostic fragment at 250.0376m/zwas produced by the neutral loss of hydroxyfluorophenol, indicating the monohydroxylation of fluorophenyl ring. The product ion at 125.0398m/zimplied that chlorophenyl ring was not hydroxylated. Therefore, the second OH group should be on C1 (Figure6). On the contrary, for 362‐C, the fluorophenyl portion was not involved in hydroxylation, as confirmed by the presence of 123.0241m/z. The distinctive peak of 362‐C at 154.9892m/zsuggested that the chlorinated aromatic ring was involved in the hydroxylation reaction (Figure6).

Key fragmentation pathways for epoxiconazole TPs at 362.0702m/z.

Besides, five isomers at 378.0652m/zwere detected as a result of the trihydroxylation (TableS3). The MS2peaks formed by the fragmentation of 378‐A at 154.9892m/zand 157.0059m/zsuggested a monohydroxylation of the chlorophenyl ring, as well as of the fluorophenyl one due to 165.0344m/z. Thus, 378‐A was the product of a trihydroxylation reaction on C1 and both aromatic systems (Figure7). Some 378‐B product ions were common with 378‐A MS2fragmentation, suggesting the introduction of two OH groups on both aromatic rings. Indeed, the diagnostic ion at 141.0344m/zindicated the dihydroxylation of fluorophenyl moiety and the monohydroxylation of the chlorophenyl. As far as MS2of 378‐C and 378‐D is concerned, the fragment ions at 123.0239m/zand 121.0447m/zimplied that no OH groups are bonded to fluorophenyl ring. The characteristic signal at 160.9997m/zof 378‐C suggested a trihydroxylation on the chlorinated ring of epoxiconazole. The isomers 378‐D and 378‐E showed similar MS2fragmentation. However, the loss of triazole ring from 378‐D (product ion at 309.0320m/z) excluded 1,2,4‐triazole OH substitution, unlike in the case of 378‐E. In Figure7, the chemical structures of epoxiconazole trihydroxylated TPs are proposed.

Some TPs were formed through oxidative or reductive defluorination, as shown in Figure8.

Proposed structures for dehalogenated epoxiconazole TPs.

As can be seen in TableS4, two isomers corresponding to the peaks at 328.0850m/z(328‐A, B) were detected with similar MS2fragmentations. The diagnostic product ion of 328‐A at 310.0738m/zwas formed by the loss of an H2O molecule. Since H2O loss from an aromatic ring is unlikely, the presence of this ion suggested that 328‐A was produced through reductive dehalogenation together with a potential hydroxylation on C1 (FigureS6). The signals at 259.0515m/zand 231.0569m/zin MS2spectrum of 328‐A confirmed its structure, according to the mechanism proposed in FigureS6. Instead, the absence of these diagnostic product ions in the spectrum of 328‐B MS2was indicative of oxidative defluorination.

Three isomers were detected at 344.0806m/z(344‐A, B, and C, TableS4) well‐matched with the hydroxylation of the defluorinated TPs. The fragment ion of 344‐A at 154.9892m/zsuggested a hydroxylation on chlorophenyl ring, further confirmed by the product ions at 216.0763m/z, 188.0814m/z, and 119.0490m/z(FigureS7). The 344‐B product ions in common with the 328‐A MS2fragmentation suggest that the dehalogenated aromatic ring was not involved in the hydroxylation (TableS4). The loss of an H2O molecule from 344‐B, producing the ion at 326.0677m/z, suggested the C1‐hydroxylation, further confirmed by the loss of 1,2,4‐triazole. For 344‐C isomer, the hydroxylation involved the defluorinated aromatic ring, coherent with the fragment ion at 141.0100m/z.

Ten TPs were identified following epoxiconazole cleavage with the detachment of the chlorophenyl or fluorophenyl moieties. The MS2spectrum of the TP at 206.0728m/zwas characterized by the absence of the typical Cl isotopic pattern. Therefore, TP 206 was formed by the loss of chlorotoluene due to epoxy ring opening with the formation of a ketone. MS2product ions at 179.0612m/z(loss of HCN molecule) and 137.0397m/z(loss of 1,2,4‐triazole), and the MS3fragmentation of 179.0612m/zconfirmed the chemical structure (TableS5) with the formation of this intermediate via epoxiconazole cleavage (FigureS8).

Moreover, TP 206 underwent subsequent transformation pathways. Indeed, four derivatives formed from TP 206 have been monitored (Figure9). Oxidative defluorination of 206 TP produced the TP detectable at 204.0771m/z. The MS2product ions of TP 204 at 135.0440m/zand 107.0493m/zconfirmed its formation pathway, involving the defluorination of TP 206 followed by the hydroxylation (TableS5).

Summary of the TPs of epoxiconazole with their production pathways. (A) hydroxylation; (B) defluorination; (C) loss of chlorotoluene; (D) loss of fluorobenzene.

Two isomers at 220.0718m/zformed via hydroxylation of TP 204 were identified. As shown in TableS5, the MS2peak at 123.0439m/zand 95.0491m/zfor 220‐A suggested that the aromatic ring was not involved in hydroxylation. The loss of the triazole ring producing the fragment ion at 151.0387m/zproved that the OH group is bonded to C1 of TP 220‐A. In contrast, 220‐B presents two OH groups on the aromatic ring, one resulting from oxidative dehalogenation and the other one from hydroxylation, as suggested by its diagnostic product ion at 111.0440m/z.

Finally, TP 206 underwent monohydroxylation, with the formation of two isobaric species at 222.0672m/zand dihydroxylation (238.0627m/z, see TableS5). 222‐B was produced by monohydroxylation on the aromatic ring as inferred by the base peak at 139.0188m/zand its product ion at 111.0241m/z. On the contrary, the OH group in 222‐A was bonded to C1, as revealed by its product ions at 153.0347m/z(loss of 1,2,4‐triazole) and 123.0241m/z. TP 206 was also dihydroxylated, as shown by the TP at 238.0627m/z. The effective dihydroxylation of TP 206 was confirmed in the mass spectrum of TP 238 by the presence of the fragment ion at 169.0293m/zand the loss of C3H3ON3, which gave a product ion at 141.0345m/z. No isomers of TP 238 were identified, suggesting that coelution may have occurred.

Epoxiconazole degradation then led to the cleavage of the fluorinated moiety, as proved by the formation of the TP at 236.0583m/z, still presenting the typical isotopic pattern of chlorine (FigureS9and TableS5). It shares several fragmentations with the parent compound, such as the triazole loss (69.0323m/z) and the product ion at 138.9944m/z.

Lastly, two isomers at 252.0540m/zformed through monohydroxylation of TP 236 were detected. The aromatic ring of 252‐A was not involved in the hydroxylation, as confirmed by the fragment ions at 138.9944m/z, 137.0151m/z, and 113.0153m/z. In the case of 252‐A, the base peak at 183.0204m/zdue to the loss of 1,2,4‐triazole revealed the OH group C1‐position. In contrast, the diagnostic peaks of 252‐B MS spectrum at 154.9888m/zand 110.0348m/zproved the monohydroxylation had occurred on the chlorophenyl moiety.

Loss of fluorobenzene (path D) with subsequent hydroxylation.

The photoinduced degradation of coumarin proceeded through the formation of six TPs, while in the case of hymecromone, eight TPs were detected. In the photolytic degradation of hymecromone, a new TP was identified at 209.0441m/z. This hymecromone derivative was not detected after the photocatalytic experiment probably due to its rapid transformation. FiguresS10andS11show the chromatographic profiles of TPs of coumarin and hymecromone, while their temporal evolution profiles are reported in FiguresS12andS13. Most of the coumarin and hymecromone TPs were easily formed after 5 min of irradiation and they disappeared within 2 h. The empirical formulas of the identified TPs of coumarin and hymecromone are collected in TablesS6andS7, respectively. A tentative structure (Level 3 of identification confidence) was assigned to (poly)hydroxylated TPs and their derivatives, while the chemical structures of the other TPs, coumarin and hymecromone were assessed with a Level 2 of identification confidence [22].

Coumarin and hymecromone photocatalytic degradation produced species originating [MH]+ions, which differed from the parent molecule by 15.9948 and 31.9898 u, well‐matched with mono‐ and dihydroxylation.

The photocatalyzed process mainly formed the monohydroxylated derivatives of both coumarin and hymecromone. Three isomers of monohydroxylated coumarin (163‐A, B, and C, TableS6) were detected at 163.0386m/z, while two isomers at 193.0482m/zresulted from the monohydroxylation of hymecromone (193‐A and B, TableS7).

The overall fragmentation scheme of monohydroxylated TPs of coumarin is reported in Figure10. The three monohydroxylated TPs (163 A, B, and C) displayed the same fragmentation pathways, so preventing the possibility to univocally locate the OH group. The two MS2ions at 119.0492m/zand 91.0543m/zwere formed by the loss of a molecule of CO2and by the joint losses of CO and CO2, respectively. The loss of a molecule of CO from the isomers of TP 163 produced the ion at 135.0442m/z, which by MS3fragmentation underwent a second loss of CO, providing the signal at 107.0492m/z(TableS6).

MSnfragmentation pathways of mono‐hydroxylated products of coumarin.

The MSnfragmentations of the two isomers of monohydroxylated product of hymecromone (193‐A and B) are provided in TableS7and illustrated in Figure11. Both isomers generating ions at 193m/zfragmented into the product ion at 103.0548m/z, which was identified in MS2spectrum of parent hymecromone as well (TableS2). The formation of the product ions of TP 193‐A at 165.0546m/z, 137.0604m/z, and 123.0441m/zallowed to place the hydroxyl group on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, named C3 (Figure11). The ion at 165.0546m/zin the MS2spectrum of 193‐A due to the CO loss was a carbocation stabilized by resonance thanks to the sharing of the oxygen electron pairs. Additionally, MS3fragmentation of 165.0546m/zformed the ion at 147.0441m/z, which was also present in the MS2spectrum of 193‐A due to the direct loss of a formic acid molecule (FigureS14). As the mechanism reported in FigureS15shows, the peak at 123.0441m/zwas produced by the loss of propiolic acid from 193‐A, while the loss of two molecules of CO with subsequent lactone opening produced the ion at 137.0604m/z. Finally, the fragmentation of 193‐A only produced the product ion at 131.0498m/z(FigureS15), a signal already observed in the MS2of hymecromone, confirming the monohydroxylation on C3. The absence of these diagnostic MSnions in MS spectra of TP 193‐B is well‐matched with the monohydroxylation on the aromatic ring (Figure11). 193‐B lost a molecule of formic acid (147.0441m/z) followed by the loss of a CO molecule in MS3experiment providing the product ion at 119.0492m/zconfirming the OH location (FigureS16).

MSnfragmentation pathways for isomers A and B of monohydroxylated products of hymecromone.

Two species, 179‐A and B, were identified and attributed to dihydroxylated intermediates of coumarin (179.0336m/zand 179.0333m/z, respectively) (TableS6). Their MS2spectra presented the product ion at 135.0441m/zproduced by the loss of CO2. Moreover, the mass difference of 15.9948 u, compared to the fragment ion at 119.0496m/zof coumarin, confirmed the position of the hydroxyl group (Figure12).

MSnfragmentation pathways for isomers A and B of dihydroxylated products of coumarin.

In the MS2spectrum of 179‐A, several diagnostic product ions were identified. Firstly, the radical ion at 150.0313m/zwas formed by the loss of a formyl radical (FigureS17). Another radical loss led to the formation of the peak at 122.00363m/z, whose molecular formula agreed with the presence of two oxygen atoms, one deriving from lactone ring opening and the other one due to hydroxylation (FigureS17). These ions suggested that for 179‐A, a hydroxylation occurred on the aromatic ring, and the second one on the C3‐C4 double bond. Furthermore, the simultaneous loss of CO2and H2O with the subsequent formation of the peak at 117.0337m/z, observed in 179‐A MS2spectrum only, confirmed the hydroxylation of the pyran ring (FigureS18). Finally, the CO2and CO losses from 179‐A originated in a hydroxy‐tropylium ion at 107.0491m/z(FigureS18) in agreement with the proposed structure. The peak at 135.0441m/zwas detected in MS2spectra of both 179‐A and 179‐B TPs, but with significantly different intensity (TableS6). Indeed, it was the base peak of 179‐A due to its high resonance stability, while the lower abundance of the same signal in 179‐B MS2study was the consequence of a vinyl carbocation structure. The absence of the diagnostic product ions, like hydroxy‐tropylium ion in 179‐B MSninvestigation, supported the hypothesis of the dihydroxylation on the coumarin aromatic ring.

The dihydroxylated product of hymecromone was detected only in the direct photolysis experiment, resulting in the formation of an ion at 209.0441m/z. As shown in TableS7, the peak at 165.0544m/zmatched the hydroxylated fragment ion of hymecromone at 133.0653m/z. The diagnostic signal at 191.0336m/zwas produced by H2O loss, suggesting that one of the two hydroxyl groups was not bonded to the aromatic ring. Lastly, the loss of C2H4O2confirmed the monohydroxylation on the hymecromone aromatic ring. However, the acquired information is not specific enough to determine the position of the second hydroxylation.

The photocatalytic degradation of both coumarin and hymecromone was found to involve oxidation processes occurring simultaneously with the opening of the lactone ring.

A coumarin TP was detected at 181.0493m/z(TableS6). Its MSnfragments were common to monohydroxycoumarin fragmentation, such as the hydroxytropylium ion. Therefore, it was hypothesized that TP 181 was formed through the monohydroxylated coumarin lactone opening. The loss of formic acid producing the peak at 135.0439m/zconfirmed this structural identification.

Two isobaric species were identified at 153.0541m/z(TableS7). The formation of the diagnostic product ion at 111.0442m/zdue to ketene loss suggested the successful oxidation after the lactone ring opening of hymecromone and a simultaneous molecule cleavage. The proposed chemical structures of 153‐A and 153‐B with their fragment ions are shown in Figure13.

MSnfragmentation pathways for hymecromone TPs 153‐A and 153‐B.

The photoinduced transformation of hymecromone involved demethylation and a probable simultaneous reduction. Demethylation process led to the formation of the isomer 163‐C of monohydroxycoumarin, as the same retention time and coherence of MSnstudy demonstrated (TableS7). Therefore, the TP 163‐C can be identified as 7‐monohydroxycoumarin. As can be seen in TableS7, coumarin was detected as a TP of hymecromone demethylation with the parallel reduction of its phenolic ring. Finally, demethylation together with the reduction of the C3 = C4 double bond gave rise to a TP at 165.0543m/z. Its base peak at 119.0493m/z, produced by formic acid loss, was diagnostic for the structure attribution (TablesS6andS2).

Based on the appearance/disappearance profiles of TPs and their hypothesized structures, the photoinduced transformation processes of coumarin and hymecromone could proceed through several concomitant pathways, collected in Figure14. For both compounds, the initial pathway involved a hydroxylation with the formation of mono‐ and dihydroxy derivatives (path A). Coumarin also underwent oxidative processes following the opening of the lactone ring (path B).

Summary of the TPs of coumarin and hymecromone with their formation pathways. (A) hydroxylation; (B) oxidative reaction following lactone ring opening; (C) demethylation; (D) demethylation with reductive reaction; (E) oxidative reaction with loss of a molecule portion.

In the case of hymecromone, demethylation reactions (path C) and reductive processes (path D) could occur. A final hymecromone transformation process consisted of an oxidation reaction together with the opening of the lactone ring and the consequent loss of a portion of the molecule with the formation of two isobaric structures (path E).

The potential acute toxicity of studied CECs and their TPs was evaluated following theV. fischeriassessment, monitoring the inhibition on the luminescent bacteria emission over time. Epoxiconazole is a harmless compound with an EC50value greater than 20 mg/L, while coumarin and hymecromone showed EC50of 10 and 0.84 mg/L, respectively. The percentage of inhibition effect on the bacteria bioluminescence by the samples resulting from the photocatalytic degradation is plotted as a function of UV‐A light irradiation time in Figure15. The percentage of inhibition by epoxiconazole TPs reached a value of 70% after 15 min of photocatalytic treatment, together with the maximum formation of intermediates, so implying that the epoxiconazole transformation involved the production of toxic compounds. Conversely, a significant decrease in the toxicity of coumarin TPs was measured as the photocatalytic degradation proceeded, whereas hymecromone TPs still exhibited toxicity after 2 h of treatment.

Toxicity assessed for coumarin, hymecromone, and epoxiconazole as a function of photocatalytic process time followingVibrio fischeriassay.

In detail, as can be seen in Figure15, the change in toxicity of epoxiconazole samples followed a similar trend to the profiles of appearance/disappearance of epoxiconazole's TPs (FigureS4). Indeed, the toxicity evaluated at time 0 corresponds to inhibition effect of epoxiconazole, while the toxicity increased as the concentrations of its TPs increased, as shown in FigureS4. After 5 min of irradiation, the increase in toxicity was caused by the formation of mono‐ and dihydroxylated products (346 and 362), the TPs formed via defluorination (328) and the loss of chlorotoluene (206) and the TPs formed by TP 206 (204, 252, 222‐A, and 238). After 10 min of photocatalytic treatment, the toxicity increased due to the contribution of the trihydroxylated products (378). Instead, after 15 min, the toxicity corresponded to the maximum formation of epoxiconazole's TPs, as mentioned above, but the contribution of isomers 220 and 344 and TPs 222‐B and 236 can be also considered. At 30 min, the toxicity was found to be high due to the maximum formation of TP 220‐A and with the contribution of TPs 206, 204, and 252‐B, whose concentrations were high as well. Although the toxicity profile decreased afterwards due to the progressive disappearance of most of the epoxiconazole TPs, after 120 min of photocatalytic treatment about 60% of inhibition effect could be partially explained by the persistent presence of TPs 206 and 204, and the probable contribution of smaller secondary TPs not detected in our experimental conditions.

Multiple species evaluation is essential to assess the toxicity of pollutants and their TPs during the photocatalytic treatment. Since the identified TPs are not commercially available, the ECOSAR program was employed as an alternative to estimate their aquatic toxicity toward fish, daphnid, and green algae. This tool allows the prediction of both acute and chronic toxicities by comparing the structural properties of substances to those of chemicals with established aquatic toxicity profiles. As a result, ECOSAR is widely applied for predicting the toxicity of compounds encountered in water treatment processes, considering the worst possible scenario [25]. The predicted values of acute and chronic toxicities of epoxiconazole, coumarin, hymecromone, and their TPs are reported in Tables2and3.

Predicted acute and chronic toxicities of epoxiconazole and its TPs.

Predicted acute and chronic toxicities of coumarin and hymecromone and their TPs.

Epoxiconazole exhibited a high acute toxicity and very high chronic toxicity in all trophic levels (Table2). As established fromV. fischeriassay, the epoxiconazole transformation involved the production of more toxic compounds than the parent one. In particular, the higher toxicity values were assessed for the epoxiconazole TPs formed via (poly)hydroxylation. As can be seen in Table2, all TPs, except for a few molecules, showed high chronic toxicity to fish, while no TPs were found to be chronically harmless to daphnid and green algae species. All (poly)hydroxylated epoxiconazole presented acute toxicity ranging from “harmful” to “very toxic” levels, as well as defluorinated TPs. Instead, the compounds produced via the epoxiconazole cleavage (except 237) exhibited either lower acute toxicity or harmless behaviour, especially towards fish.

Coumarin and its derivative hymecromone, were assessed as harmful (acute toxicity), while their chronic toxicity was ranged from “harmful” to “toxic” levels (Table3). Overall, the acute toxicity of coumarin TPs was slightly higher than coumarin, but the only compound showing high acute toxicity is 178‐A towards fish, while the TP 180 was harmless towards fish and daphnids and the monohydroxylated coumarin (162‐A, B, and C) towards green algae. The same trend was assessed for the chronic toxicity. The hymecromone TPs showed an acute toxicity ranging from “harmless” to “harmful” levels towards fish and daphnids and “toxic” towards green algae (Table3). The acute toxicity of the demethylated hymecromone (164 and 162) was assessed as innocuous for green algae but the chronic toxicity proved TPs toxic.

Photolysis under simulated solar radiation showed that all three species did not undergo complete degradation under UV‐A photolysis in the time window studied, whereas the heterogeneous photocatalytic process allowed significant disappearance of the analytes. By means of HPLC‐HRMS, probable or tentative structures were assigned to the TPs formed during the photocatalytic treatment of the studied compounds. The photoinduced transformation involved the hydroxylation as main photodegradative process. Epoxiconazole also underwent dehalogenation and breakage of the molecule. Coumarin compounds were affected by lactone ring opening followed by oxidation, while for hymecromone, demethylation was another preferred degradation pathway.

This study showed that the structural identification of abiotic transformation by‐products is crucial to expand the range of pollutant detection in surface waters in the future, especially in view of the risk assessment. It has to be underlined that, especially in case of epoxiconazole, its transformation proceeds through the formation of more hazardous compounds.
