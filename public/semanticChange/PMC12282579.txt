Retrosynthetic strategies are intimately tied to the tools and methods available at the time of their conception.
Recent methodological advancements in both radical and biocatalytic reactions have created numerous possibilities for new and unconventional disconnections.
Thus, it comes as no surprise that their applications in multi-step syntheses have allowed many complex molecules to be built in ingenious ways.
This review summarizes recent case studies wherein radical-based and enzymatic transformations are combined strategically in multi-step sequences to achieve efficient total syntheses of complex natural products.
This review highlights recent case studies of natural product synthesis wherein enzymatic and radical-based transformations are strategically used in combination to achieve efficient synthesis.
The one-electron nature of radical reactions offers unique modes of reactivity for building complex molecules that are otherwise unavailable with two-electron processes.
Spurred by the invention of new technologies in photoredox catalysis,1modern electrochemistry,2metal-catalyzed cross-coupling3and hydrogen atom transfer4—which offer milder reaction conditions and better functional group compatibility than “classical” radical reactions—the field of radical chemistry has witnessed a major renaissance in recent years.5In addition to these advantages, modern radical chemistry also allows for the use of unconventional functional groups such as carboxylic acids6and alkenes4as viable radical precursors, opening the door for profoundly different bond disconnections during synthesis planning.
In the same vein, biocatalytic retrosynthesis7has recently emerged as an enabling paradigm in chemical synthesis, owing to the unique selectivity profile of enzymatic reactions and the ever-increasing ability to modulate the activity and selectivity of enzymes with directed evolution and protein engineering.
The transformative effects of this paradigm are manifest in the recent discoveries of new enzymes for site-selective oxidations,8the advent of new-to-nature biocatalytic reactions9and several high-profile reports10on the use of enzymatic cascades in the preparation of drug molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Recently, various research groups have managed to capitalize on the unique features of biocatalytic and radical retrosynthetic logic and strategically combine them to achieve efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex natural products.
Generally speaking, these cases can be divided into two categories: (1) using enzymatic cyclization to construct the core architecture of the target natural product, followed by radical-based chemical reactions to functionalize the core, or (2) using radical-based C–C bond formations to generate the core architecture of the target natural product, which is done in combination with enzymatic tailoring, usually oxidation, to install the requisite functional groups.
Coincidentally, it should be noted there has been a heavy emphasis on applying these two chemoenzymatic approaches to terpenoid natural products.
This review will be organized according to the two aforementioned categories.
Additionally, we will present at the end several examples that involve non-terpenoid targets such as fatty acids and alkaloids.
Terpenoids are chemically and structurally diverse hydrocarbon-based natural products that arise from two 5-carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).11Initial head-to-tail coupling of IPP and DMAPP yields linear, achiral C5nisoprenoid diphosphates (n= 1, 2, 3,etc.
), which undergo various modes of cyclization by terpene cyclases to deliver products interesting three-dimensional architectures.
Among the terpene cyclases,12class I terpenoid cyclases, such as bacterial pentalenene synthase, utilize a trinuclear metal cluster to activate pyrophosphorylated substrates, whereas class II terpenoid cyclases, such as SHCs, employ an active site side chain to protonate alkenes or epoxides for cyclization initiation.
Nature uses two pathways to generate the isoprenoid diphosphate precursors: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway13and (ii) the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway.14The mevalonate pathway begins with the conversion of acetyl CoA to acetoacetyl CoA, followed by an aldol coupling with another acetyl CoA molecule to generate (3S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA.
Subsequent reduction affords (R)-mevalonate, which undergoes a series of reactions to provide isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).
The MEP pathway, sometimes referred to as the deoxyxylulose phosphate (DXP) pathway was only discovered in 1993, and is less well-studied relative to the MVA counterpart.
The pathway starts with the union of pyruvate andd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to produce DXP, which undergoes rearrangement in the presence of DXP reductase to provide 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate.
Phosphorylation of this intermediate and reduction forms IPP.
Finally, isomerization of IPP to DMAPP takes place in the presence of IPP isomerase, which becomes the starting point for further oligomerization to generate longer C5ncyclization precursors, such as geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (C15) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20).
Several chemoenzymatic approaches to complex terpenoids featuring the use of terpene cyclases have recently been reported.
The overall strategy is to employ a terpene cyclase for initial construction of the carbocyclic skeleton, followed by chemical tailorings to deliver the final terpenoid target(s).
From a step economy perspective, the advantage here is obvious as the desired carbocyclic skeleton can be obtained in just one step.
However, many of these enzymatic pathways, especially when carried outin vivo, are not efficient enough to generate sufficient materials to support a multi-step synthesis campaign.
For this reason, it is often necessary to perform additional metabolic engineering on the bacterial and fungal host, typically to enhance precursor supply for the enzymatic cyclization.
To date, engineering of the MVA pathway has been more widely explored for this purpose than that of the MEP/DXP pathway.
In recent years, several groups have taken advantage of the ability to readily access various terpene skeletons with terpene cyclases and used it in combination with modern radical reactions for efficient chemoenzymatic syntheses of complex terpenoids.
First isolated in 1972, the sesquiterpene artemisinin (1) is a widely-used small molecule for the treatment of malaria.15In fact, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now the standard treatment worldwide for malaria caused byPlasmodiumspecies.
The semi-synthetic artemisinin project was established in 2014 to improve the supply of artemisinin and lower its production cost through a two-stage approach involving microbial production of artemisinic acid (2), followed by its chemical conversion to artemisinin.16This project was highly successful and is often cited as an important milestone in metabolic engineering in the past two decades.
In 2006,17Keasling and coworkers engineered aS.
cerevisiaestrain that is equipped with an engineered MVA pathway, an amorphadiene synthase, and the P450 CYP71AV1 fromA.
annuato produce 2 with a titer of 100 mg L−1(Fig. 1).
In this pathway, amorpha-4,11-diene (3) is produced by the synthase and gets converted by the P450 to 2.
Subsequent work by Paddon and coworkers18successfully doubled the titer production of 2 by overexpressing every enzyme in the MVA pathway up to ERG20 in an engineeredS.cerevisiae.
This achievement was complemented by optimization of the fermentation process to improve the titer further to >40 g L−1.
In 2013,19Newman and coworkers reported that optimization of the oxidation of 3 to 2 could lead to a high-level production of 2 (25 g L−1) by yeast fermentation.
Specifically, the researchers lowered the expression ofAaCPR, which presumably affected the stoichiometry of CYP71AV1:AaCPR interaction, and introduced several auxiliary proteins such as cytochrome B5.
Prior work in P450 biochemistry has suggested that the P450:CPR stoichiometry is important for optimal oxidation efficiency.
Conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin has been widely studied and has even been conducted on process scale.20In the sequence, theexomethylene is first reduced, and the acid is converted to either the ester or the mixed anhydride (e.g., 5), which was then subjected to a Schenck ene/rearrangement cascade with1O2—which has been proposed to proceedviaradical mechanism—to furnish artemisinin.
This last step has been studied extensively on process scale due to the need to develop special photochemical setups.
For example, Sanofi has introduced a semibatch process with a recirculation loop while carefully choosing the reactor materials the identity of the photon source for optimal quantum photonic yield.
Englerin A (7) is a plant sesquiterpenoid with potent nanomolar cytotoxicity against renal cancer cells,21which was later rationalized by its ability to activate the calcium channels TRPC4 and TRPC5.22In light of its potent bioactivity and unusual structure, more than 20 total and formal syntheses of 7 have been reported to date.
In 2020, Liu, Christmann and coworkers23develop a concise synthesis of 7 by relying on the heterologous production of guaia-6,10(14)-diene (8) inS.
cerevisiae, followed by further chemical manipulations (Fig. 2A).
Christmann, Dickschat and coworkers previously discovered STC524as a class II sesquiterpene cyclase that converts FPP to 8.
Due to the low isolation yields (4%) of the system, they tested additional sesquiterpene cyclases from filamentous fungi for guaia-6,10(14)-diene production in anE.
colistrain that has been manipulated to overproduce FPP.
The screening resulted in a slightly improved production of 8 at up to 62.3 mg L−1withE.
colimutant G5, which contains the cyclase FgJ02895.
Aiming at a more practical production, they further engineered the enzymes in the MVA pathway by CRISPR/Cas9 system in S.cerevisiae, and the titer of 8 was further increased to 0.8 g L−1in 5 L fed-batch fermentation of S.cerevisiaeYL06.
Under Shenvi's conditions for hydrogen atom transfer-based olefin isomerization,258 was converted to diene 9, which was then subjected to a regio- and diastereoselective Sharpless dihydroxylation.
The secondary alcohol was selectively acylated in the presence of acid chloride 11 and the remaining alkene was epoxidized with DMDO.In situtreatment of the epoxide with AcOH induced further cyclization to provide the core scaffold of englerin A. Introduction of the cinnamyl ester and removal of the TBDPS group completed the semisynthesis of 7.
The Xiang group has also developed an alternative approach (Fig. 2B) to heterologously produce guaia-6,10(14)-diene (8),26which usedE.
colias the heterologous host.
Specifically, the researchers employed a two-plasmid system wherein the MVA pathway was incorporated in the vector pACYCDuet-T1-B1 while the FPP synthase (FPPS) ERG20 and the sesquiterpene synthase STC5 were encoded in the vector pETDuet-ERG20-STC5.
This system delivered 8 with a titer of 119.4 mg L−1.
While the terpene starting point is identical to that of Liuet al., the Xiang group developed an alternative sequence to convert it to 7.
Firstly,mCPBA was used to selectively epoxidize the trisubstituted olefin.Exo-to-endoisomerization of the remaining alkene was achieved under MHAT-based conditions, which was followed by dihydroxylation and transannular cyclization in the presence of HCl to afford 17.
Two sequential esterifications and deprotection of the PMB protecting group completed their synthesis of englerin A.
Using a similar heterologous expression system, the Xiang group has also reported a two-stage synthesis of (+)-schisanwilsonene A (20,Fig. 2C).27Firstly, introduction of the terpene cyclase IDS28in place of STC5 led to the accumulation of (+)-isodauc-8-en-11-ol (21) with a titer of 1.16 g L−1.
Under MHAT conditions for alkene isomerization, 21 was converted to 22 in 23% yield.
Allylic oxidation of 22 with SeO2andtBuOOH completed the synthesis of 20.
Eleutherobin (23) is a coral diterpene that possesses the ability to interfere with tubulin polymerization dynamics.29In light of its cytotoxicity, a number of synthetic studies have been performed to prepare eleutherobin and its unnatural derivatives.
While these studies have generated valuable structure–activity relationship insights,30they generally employed lengthy sequences with low synthetic efficiency and overall yield.
In 2022,31Schmidt and co-workers discovered coral terpene cyclases that produce the general eunicellane skeleton of eleutherobin and cembrene, providing an initial foothold for future synthetic biology approach to produce these diterpenoids.
Their effort began with the sequencing and analysis of the metatranscriptome ofE.
caribaeorum, the soft coral producer of eleutherobin.
While BLAST analysis did not identify any putative terpene cyclase, the use of hidden Markov model search recognized eight putative terpene cyclases.
The authors further observed the colocalization of a terpene cyclase gene (called EcTPS1) with a P450-encoding gene and an acyltransferase-encoding gene in a biosynthetic gene cluster, which is consistent with the likely steps in eleutherobin biosynthesis.
To lend support to this hypothesis, EcTPS1 was heterologously expressed inE.
coliand was found to produce convert GGPP to the known eunicellane32klysimplexin R (24).
Scaled-up fermentation of EcTPS1 reaction afforded klysimplexin R (24) with an average titer of 77 mg L−1, which was used as a starting point for the divergent synthesis of additional coral diterpenoids (Fig. 3).33The C6–C7 alkene was selectively epoxidized with DMDO to produce a single diastereomer (25), which was found to have identical spectral data but opposite stereoconfiguration to solenopodin C. The same reaction converted 26 to a product (27) that displayed identical spectral data but opposite stereoconfiguration to klysimplexin Q. Under acidic conditions, 25 underwent transannular cyclization to provide two products with the gersemiane skeleton (28 and 29).
Alternatively, sequential dihydroxylation of the C6–C7 alkene and TFDO-mediated epoxidation of the C2–C3 alkene afforded epoxide 31, which was treated with PTSA to induce transannular etherification to form 32.
Under MHAT conditions,25klysimplexin R could also be transformed to three products.
Two of these products have the germiane skeleton, and the last one (33) is a regioisomer of eunicellol A. Finally, 24 was found to undergo1O2ene reaction at the C6–C7 alkene to form two alcohol diastereomers, 34 and 35, after reduction with PPh3.
In contrast to class I terpene cyclases, class II terpene cyclases, use an aspartic acid side chain as a Brønsted acid to protonate alkenes or epoxides to initiate cyclization.
Responsible for the conversion of squalene to hopene and hopanol, squalene hopene cyclases (SHC) are among the most-studied class II cyclases.34Over the years, the Hauer group were able to harness this cyclization mode for non-native polyene cyclization through enzymatic Brønsted acid catalysis.35Several engineered variants of an SHC fromAlicyclobacillus acidocaldarius(AacSHC) are able to accept alkenes, epoxides and carbonyls to form a diverse range of polycyclic ring systems.36More recently, Xiang and co-workers were able to capitalize on the promiscuity ofAacSHC in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of (+)-isoagatholactone (36), (+)-spongian-16-one (37) and 3-deoxychevalone A (38,Fig. 4).37The synthesis began with enzymatic polyene cyclization of geranylgeraniol (39) with wild-typeAacSHC, which was previously reported to proceed in 12% yield.
In the authors’ hands, the desired compound 40 was indeed obtained, but several side products were also detected, namely hydrated products 41 and 42, and the alkene isomer 43.
At this stage, the authors performedin silicodocking to identify several active site residues as candidates for directed evolution, which eventually led to variant 215G2.
Containing mutations M132R, A224V and I432T, 215G2 catalyzed the formation of 40 with 34% isolated yield at 0.01 mol% enzyme loading.
Allylic oxidation on 40, followed by treatment with Fetizon's reagent produced (+)-isoagatholactone (36), which was converted to (+)-spongian-16-one (37)viahydrogenation of 36 in the presence of RANEY® nickel.
Finally, 42 was oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde (45), which was coupled with 46 in a formal [3+3] reaction to deliver pyrone 48.
Hydrogenation of 48 with Shenvi's conditions38proceeded with excellent chemo- and diastereoselectivity to complete the synthesis of 3-deoxychevalone A (38).
Earlier this year (2025), the Li and Dong groups reported a collaborative effort to synthesize several meroterpenoids through divergent cross-coupling from simple drimane precursors (Fig. 5), such as drimenol (49) or albicanol (50).39The premise of the approach is to enlist the use of terpene synthases to generate the drimane precursors, which would contain suitable chemical handles for subsequent cross-couplings.
Similar to some of the previous case studies, the authors needed to come up with an approach to optimize the titer yield for the drimane precursors.
Having previously developed a PhoN-IPK system40to boost the 5-carbon precursor supply for terpene synthases, the authors applied this system in combination with the drimenol synthase SsDMS.
Unfortunately, this approach only resulted in a titer yield of 15 mg L−1.
To address this issue, the authors employed a two-pronged optimization strategy.
Firstly, SsDMS was artificially fused with a nudix hydrolase to enhance the hydrolysis of the diphosphate group from the initial terpene cyclization intermediate.
This fusion strategy was found to improve the product titer to 68–111 mg L−1, depending on the identity of the linker used.41As PhoN catalyzes reversible phosphorylation and hydrolysis reactions on dimethylallylalcohol/isopentenol, a rational engineering approach was pursued to boost the forward phosphorylation reaction under the hypothesis that introducing positive charges in the active site vicinity will improve interactions with the phosphate group.
This approach was complemented with an alignment-based mutagenesis and the combined efforts identified three mutations, E122R, T157K and R160K, which led to a titer yield of 398 mg L−1.
Replacement of SsDMS with the albicanol synthase AncC42allowed for an efficient production of albicanol (50) at a comparable titer.
Most notably, a maximum titer of 3.5 g L−1of albicanol could be achieved by conducting the biotransformation in a bioreactor with exogenous feeding of isopentenol.
The albicanol so produced was used as a starting point for divergent cross-couplings, specifically with nickel catalysis under Weix's conditions,43which are known to proceed through single electron pathways.
Thus, conversion of 50 to the corresponding iodide (51) under Appel conditions, was followed by cross-couplings with the appropriate aryl iodide partners (52–54).
Straightforward functional group manipulations completed the chemoenzymatic syntheses ofent-chromazonarol (59), mycoleptodiscin A (61) and pelorol (63).
One of the hallmarks of natural product biosynthesis is the involvement of various oxygenases in scaffold tailoring.
While the resulting hydroxylation patterns may hold the key for potent biological activities, they also present additional structural complexity and potential chemoselectivity problems for chemical synthesis.
Given the wealth of natural oxygenases, a number of research groups have begun to look for enzymatic solutions to address this challenge.
While Nature has evolved a wide range of enzyme (super)families for oxidative chemistry, the two major superfamilies that have seen widespread use in organic synthesis are the P450s44and the non-heme iron dioxygenases (NHDs).45Though the two superfamilies use entirely different cofactors and rely on disparate mechanisms for dioxygen activation (Fig. 6), they share one common feature, that is the generation of a highly reactive Fe(iv)–oxo species for oxidative chemistry.
This species is capable of performing a wide range of transformations, including C–H hydroxylation, desaturation, biaryl coupling and epoxidation, usually with high levels of site-, stereo- and chemoselectivity, which present a strategic advance in the context of complex molecule synthesis.
To date, several strategies have been developed to realize the intended enzymatic oxidations, including transcriptomic analyses to discover new oxygenases, repurposing and engineering of known oxygenases from the native biosynthetic pathways, or screening of known promiscuous oxygenases such as P450BM3 variants.46In turn, the oxidation precursors could be obtained either commercially or through chemical or biological synthesis (i.e.heterologous expression).
Several research groups have recently taken advantage of the unique features of enzymatic oxidations and use them in combination with modern radical reactions for skeletal construction or modification to achieve efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex natural products.
An engineered P450BM3 variant, II-H8, was reported by Fasan and co-workers to catalyze a regio- and stereoselective C3 hydroxylation of sclareolide (64) in 83% yield, though the reaction was performed under dilute conditions (50 mg scalein vitroreaction with 1 mM substrate concentration).50Using this report as a starting point, the Renata group examined other P450BM3-based catalysts for the same reaction on sclareolide, but ran their screen on a larger scale at higher substrate concentration (5 mM).51A small alanine-scanning library was generated from a P450BM3 variant called 1857, which led to the discovery of a key mutation V328A for improved C3 hydroxylation activity.
On gram scale reaction, oxidation of 64 with lysates ofE.
coliexpressing 1857 V328A (also called “BM3 MERO1”) provided 60–70% isolated yield of the desired product (65,Fig. 7A).
Several routine steps converted 65 to aldehyde 66 or 67, which was coupled with various aromatic fragments in a formal [3+3] annulation (Fig. 5B).
Under Shenvi's MHAT conditions,38hydrogenation of the [3+3] adducts proceeded with excellent stereo- and chemoselectivity to complete the synthesis of five different α-pyrone meroterpenoids.
The Renata group further extended this blueprint to the synthesis of several oxidized meroditerpenoids from sclareol (78,Fig. 7B).
Firstly, sclareol was converted to acid 79 through a five-step route featuring a radical-based intramolecular Giese addition52and lactone opening.
All of the intermediates in this sequence were tested for hydroxylation with the aforementioned alanine-scanning library, which led to the discovery that 79 could be efficiently oxidized at its C3 carbon by variant MERO1 L75A, proceeding with 62% isolated yield on gram scale.
The carboxylic acid moiety of 80 was used as a chemical handle to generate further structural complexity and complete the synthesis of four meroditerpenoid targets.
Conversion of 80 to the corresponding iodide (82) set the stage for subsequent nickel cross coupling,53which delivered taondiol (85) and chevalone A (86) after routine deprotections.
Alternatively, diene 87, obtainedviaelimination of 82, was subjected to a formal [3+2] coupling54to furnish decaturin E (88) and stypodiol.
Having developed a scalable biocatalytic platform for selective C3 oxidation of sclareolide and related molecules, the Renata group in 2022 reported a convergent chemoenzymatic synthesis of deoxygedunin and gedunin (89),55two limonoids that have been reported to inhibit HSP90 and display antimalarial and neuroprotective properties (Fig. 8).
With synthetic modularity in mind, the researchers conceived a fragment coupling with enone 91 for the synthesis, which could be obtained from sclareolide through MeLi addition, Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, C8–OH dehydration, ozonolysis and acetate elimination.
Screening of a small panel of P450BM3 library revealed that variant MERO1 L437A was able to oxidize 91 at its C3 carbon with minimal side product arising from alkene epoxidation.
Towards iodide 93, furfury alcohol (94) was combined with isoprene monoxide (95) under Krische's hydrogen auto-transfer conditions,56which constructed the key C13 quaternary center with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity.
Acrylation of the secondary alcohol was followed by ring-closing metathesis to provide the corresponding unsaturated lactone.
Finally, routine conversion of the primary alcohol to iodide generated 93.
Fragments 92 and 93 were coupled under Luche's conditions,57and the resulting product was subjected to Wittig olefination with MePPh3Br.
After DMP oxidation of the C3–OH and allylic oxidation at C7, an MHAT-based Giese coupling52furnished the tetracyclic framework of gedunin.
Functional group manipulations consisting of Saegusa oxidation and acetylation at C7 completed the synthesis of deoxygedunin, which was converted to gedunin (89) through epoxidation withmCPBA.
Contemporaneous to the case study outline in Section 2.6, the Xiang group developed a chemoenzymatic approach to drimane meroterpenoids (Fig. 9) that combines heterologous production of drimenol, enzymatic hydroxylation and radical cross-couplings.58Using the authors’ aforementioned system for introducing the MVA pathway inE.
coli, the product titers of four drimenol synthases59were investigated.
Among the four, DrtB demonstrated the highest activity, displaying a titer of 1.5 g L−1for the production of 49.
Further metabolic engineering of the pathway improved the titer to 2.1 g L−1, providing ample material supply of 49 for the chemoenzymatic synthesis.
Oxidation of 49 was initially investigated with P450BM3 F87A, which was capable of forming the desired C3 hydroxylated compound (99) as the main product.
Further engineering led to variant P450BM3 L75A F87I, which delivered the desired product in 68% isolated yield on preparative scale.
Appel reaction on 49 provided the corresponding primary bromide (101), which was subjected to radical cross-couplings60with a variety of aryl iodide partners.
Similar to the approach outlined in Section 2.6, this route eventually completed the synthesis ofent-chromazonarol (59), 8-epi-puupehenol (110), pelorol (63) and mycoleptodiscin A (61). The same cross-coupling sequence could also be applied for the synthesis of hongoquercin B (111)via112, which was prepared from 99 through a four-step sequence.
Nickel-mediated cross-coupling of 112 and 113 was followed by MOM deprotection, pyran formation and ester hydrolysis to generate 115.
The phenolic alcohol was then introducedviapalladium-catalyzed C–H oxidation using Yu's protocol.61It should be noted that the authors resorted to this sequence as attempts to effect cross-coupling with the fully-elaborated aryl fragment was unsuccessful.
With the general core structure constructed, three additional steps completed the synthesis of hongoquercin B (111).
The fusicoccanes are fungal diterpenoids bearing a characteristic 5/8/5-tricyclic ring system.62Within the family, cotylenin A and fusicoccin A are often regarded as the flagship members, as they were one of the firsts to be discovered and were noted to act as modulators of 14-3-3 protein–protein interactions.63More recently, additional family members that contain rearranged tricyclic skeletons have also been isolated, but their biological activities have not been profiled in detail.
The Renata group sought to develop a modular chemoenzymatic strategy to target a wide range of family members, including those with rearranged skeletons.64Their design involves the chemical synthesis of a minimally oxidized 5/8/5-tricyclic intermediate, which would then be subjected to a series of chemoenzymatic oxidations.
One of the key oxidations in the design hinges on prior biosynthetic studies by Dairi and Oikawa,65which identified the involvement of the NHDs BscD and Bsc9 in the C3 oxidation of compound 117 (Fig. 10).
It was known that the reaction is accompanied by the formation of an unwanted shunt product (119) and at the outset, the researchers proposed that this issue could be addressable to additional screening and enzyme engineering.
Through a similar directed evolution campaign, mutations L110A and Y112R on MoBsc9 were discovered to improve the chemoselectivity of reaction with alcohol 129 (Fig. 11), delivering brassicicene I (130) in 64% isolated yield on 130 mg scale.
Brassicicene I was further found to undergo selective C13 hydroxylation with P450BM3 variant MERO1 L75A in 78% yield.
On the other hand, palladium-catalyzed allylic oxidation69formed the enone product, completing the synthesis of brassicicene A (131), which was converted to brassicicene R (132) through routine Rubottom oxidation.
The allylic alcohol from MERO1 L75A oxidation could be dehydrated to the resulting cyclopentadiene (134), which was then subjected to1O2Diels–Alder and Kornblum–Delamare rearrangement to afford brassicicene L (136). Towards the rearranged fusicoccanes, a partially protected derivative of brassicicene R (137) was submitted to a chemoselective Wagner–Meerwein shift in the presence of Tf2O and pyridine.
After silyl ether deprotection, brassicicene K (138) was obtained.70Selective hydrogenation of theexomethylene of 138 generated brassicicene C (139), which was reduced with DIBAL reduction to afford brassicicene H (140). Alternatively, 141 could also be subjected to Mukaiyama hydroperoxidation71and deprotection to deliver brassicicene J (142), or Mukaiyama hydration and deprotection to provide brassicicene F (143). In total ten fusiccocane natural products were prepared using this chemoenzymatic approach.
Podophyllotoxin (144) is an aryltetralin lignan that can serve as a highly potent microtubule depolymerizing agent.72This property has led to semisynthetic efforts to optimize the anticancer properties of the molecule, culminating in the invention of two derivatives, etoposide and teniposide, as chemotherapy agents.
In 2019,73the Renata group reported an asymmetric chemoenzymatic approach to podophyllotoxin and additional aryltetralin lignans by drawing inspiration from a prior biosynthetic study by Lau and Sattely (Fig. 12A),74which suggested the involvement of a late-stage oxidative cyclization from yatein (145) by an NHD, 2-ODD-PH, in the biogenesis of podophyllotoxin.
The general blueprint of their approach is to develop a concise chemical access to yatein, and subject it to chemoenzymatic redox adjustments to arrive at podophyllotoxin.
Towards yatein, the authors enlisted the use of oxidative enolate coupling methodology developed by Baran,75which presumably proceeds through single electron oxidation, followed by radical–radical coupling.
Thus, 147 and 148 were enolized with LDA and treatedin situwith a CuIIsalt to furnish the desired dicarbonyl product.
Selective monoreduction with LiBH4and equilibration of the initial diastereomeric mixture with DBU generated yatein as a single diastereomer in 51% overall yield.
Oxidative cyclization in the presence of 2-ODD-PH generated the desired tetracycle in 95% yield.
Finally, benzylic oxidation of 146 with CrO3and 3,5-dimethylpyrazole, followed by ketone reduction withl-selectride completed the synthesis of podophyllotoxin.
In this work, the authors also conducted a systematic substrate–activity relationship profiling of 2-ODD-PH, which resulted in the synthesis of five additional aryltetralin lignans, including the natural products polygamain (149), morelensin (150), austrobailignan 1 (151) and hernandin (152). It should be noted that the Fuchs and Kroutil group76contemporaneously reported a complementary approach to podophyllotoxin by combining a biocatalytic kinetic resolution of a dibenzylbutyrolactone precursor and oxidative cyclization with 2-ODD-PH.
Toward the above goal, the authors explored two sequences to prepare the target bicycle (Fig. 12B).
Firstly,meso-diol 153 was desymmetrized through lipase-mediated esterification,80and then subjected to a Johnson–Claisen rearrangement and lactonization.
This sequence was eventually abandoned in favor of an alternative one that commenced from a cheaper starting material, cyclobutanone 157.
Enzymatic Baeyer–Villiger81of 157 in the presence of CHMOrhodo1and Opt13 for NADPH regeneration afforded lactones 156 and 158 in 95% and 97% ee respectively.
Remarkably, this reaction could be conducted at 83 mM substrate concentration, affording >100 g of 156 throughout the synthetic campaign.
After extensive optimization, 156 could be converted to the desired bromohydrin diastereomer 159, which set the stage for the key radical cross-coupling.
Initial foray into this reaction led to significant formation of an undesired epoxide byproduct, in addition to the desired product 161.
This issue was solved by the addition of trimethylsilylimidazole forin situalcohol protection.
With this modification, the desired cross-coupling proceeded smoothly either with one equivalent of pyridine or 0.15 equivalent of a bidentate bipyridine ligand.
A range of vinyl and aryl bromides were found to be suitable coupling partners, affording at least 60% yield.
Starting from cross-coupling product 161, two uneventful steps, namely lactone reduction and aldehyde homologation, led to prostaglandin F2α(163). Using a similar sequence, additional prostaglandins, such as bimatoprost, fluprostenol, cloprostenol and lantanoprost, were prepared.
As a testament to the robustness of the route, each of these molecules was obtained in more than 1 g quantity.
Piperidine is one of the most common heterocycles found in clinically-approved drugs and pharmaceutical leads.
Especially valuable in this area are chiral piperidines that contain multiple substitutions.
A recent survey suggests that di- and trisubstituted piperidines cumulatively make up for approximately 71% of piperidine-based drugs.82The ubiquity of multisubstituted piperidines has spurred the development of various methods for their construction.
Chronic inflammation and sustained immune activation ultimately lead to demyelination, axonal damage, and neurodegeneration that define PPMS.
The figure illustrates EBV’s role in triggering and maintaining CNS-focused autoimmunity that contributes to PPMS progression.
Recent evidence indicates that in PPMS, B-cell–driven immune responses inside the CNS can continue even without active EBV infection in the bloodstream.
This challenges the previous assumption that PPMS inflammation depends entirely on peripheral EBV-related immunity.
While EBV-infected B cells and CD8+ T cells initiate autoimmunity, ongoing immune activation in the CNS may become self-sufficient.
These findings imply that EBV not only triggers early disease mechanisms but may also sustain long-term progression in PPMS.
Therefore, targeting EBV-infected B cells or modulating CD8+ T-cell activity in the CNS may have therapeutic value across disease stages.
Despite recognizing mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate toxicity, and neuronal energy failure as major drivers of progression in MS, attempts to therapeutically target these pathways have produced limited success.
The MS-SMART phase II trial tested amiloride, fluoxetine, and riluzole in SPMS but found no meaningful impact on brain atrophy or clinical decline.
These outcomes highlight the difficulty of slowing neurodegeneration in progressive MS and suggest that single-agent therapies may be inadequate.
