We established a reliable high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet detector (HPLC‐UV) method to simultaneously quantify and compare four indicator components in Kunlun Chrysanthemum (Coreopsis tinctoriaNutt.), Jiajin Chrysanthemum (C.tinctoriaNutt.) and Chrysanthemum buds (C.tinctoriaNutt.).
We also aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of them in vitro.
We showed that chlorogenic acid, 3,5‐Odicaffeoylquinic acid, and Quercitrin concentrations were highest in Jiajin Chrysanthemum; Luteolin was highest in Chrysanthemum buds, and the four components were at an intermediate level in Kunlun Chrysanthemum.
Antioxidant activity demonstrated IC50values for DPPH free radical scavenging of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Snow Chrysanthemum buds of 1.20, 1.33, and 2.41 mg/mL, respectively.
The IC50values for ABTS radical scavenging were 2.53, 2.43, and 3.38 mg/mL, respectively.
It showed differences in the four active ingredients of Snow Chrysanthemums from different origins and harvesting times.
This HPLC‐UV method accurately and rapidly determined the four active ingredients in Snow Chrysanthemums simultaneously, which may provide a quality control reference for Snow Chrysanthemums.
Future studies exploring specific differences in cultivation, climate, harvesting, and drying of Snow Chrysanthemums to optimize its chemical composition would assist in developing its potential as a natural plant resource in health care.
Snow Chrysanthemum is a plant, native to North America, which is widely planted in the Kunlun Mountains of Hotan, China, at an altitude of over 3000 m. The flowering period is short, from June to August each year, and the Snow Chrysanthemum blooms only once.
The head‐shaped inflorescence of Snow Chrysanthemum is called “Kunlun Chrysanthemum” and has been used as a folk herb by Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China for hundreds of years (Jing et al.2016; Wang et al.2015).
In 2010, Kunlun Chrysanthemum was introduced to the Jiajin Mountain area of Sichuan, which has a similar altitude and planting environment to the Kunlun Mountain area of Hetan.
The harvested flower heads are called “Jiajin Chrysanthemum”.
The Snow Chrysanthemums sold at local markets have two harvesting periods: the full flowering period and the bud period.
Kunlun Chrysanthemum and Jiajin Chrysanthemum are both harvested during the full flowering period when the petals are completely spread out, while Chrysanthemum buds are harvested during the bud stage when the petals have broken through the bracts but have not yet extended (Figure1).

According to the “Illustrated Catalogue of Chinese Zhuang Medicine”, the two‐color golden chicken Chrysanthemum is able to clear heat and dampness toxins, and is mainly used for treating redness, swelling, pain, ulcers, and toxins (Zhu and Dai2020).
Although Snow Chrysanthemum does not belong to the category of tea, it can be drunk as tea and its magical color, aroma, and taste compare well to various precious tea leaves, delighting tea lovers.
A few chrysanthemums in the water bloom in the cup, gradually darkening, like a dynamic painting; with a fragrant smell, sweetness in the mouth, immediately and as an aftertaste, with a lingering fragrance on the lips and teeth.
It is beneficial in clearing and nourishing the liver, improving vision, nourishing yin, beautifying and nourishing the skin, moisturizing the intestines and promoting bowel movements.
Compared with ordinary chrysanthemums, Snow Chrysanthemums have higher medicinal value, with isolation and extraction of flavonoids, phenolic acids, polysaccharides, saponins, and other substances.
Flavonoids, including quercetin and luteolin, have multiple biological activities, including antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, antibacterial, anti‐tumor, lipid‐lowering, and hypoglycemic effects (Dias et al.2012; Jiang, Le, Liu, et al.2016; Jiang, Le, Zhai, et al.2016; Li et al.2014; Xie et al.2009; Yang et al.2014).
Phenolic acid substances, including chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid A (3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid), have antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities (Jiang et al.2018).
The main active ingredients in Snow Chrysanthemum are flavonoids and polyphenols (Tian et al.2018; Zhang et al.2016), but their content is known to vary depending on significant differences in growth altitude, planting environment, and cultivation measures in different regions, relating to differences in climate, soil composition, sunshine duration, and agricultural technology.
Therefore, even the same variety of Snow Chrysanthemum, from different regions, may show variation in chemical composition and pharmacological effects, medicinal value, and health benefits.
The timing of harvesting of Snow Chrysanthemums, as for other medicinal plants, may decisively affect efficacy, but also consumer acceptance and the market value of the product.
Determining the optimal harvesting period is therefore one of the key steps in ensuring the quality of medicinal materials; usually requiring comprehensive consideration of the plant's growth cycle, climatic conditions, and the accumulation pattern of active ingredients.
Using scientific methods to determine the optimal harvesting time maximizes the content of the effective ingredients, thereby improving the overall quality and efficacy of medicinal plant materials.
The aim of this study was to develop an advanced method for simultaneous determination of four key active ingredients (including chlorogenic acid, 3,5‐O‐dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercitrin, and luteolin) in Snow Chrysanthemum using HPLC‐UV.
Precise quantitative analysis and comparison of these four important components in Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds aim to provide a scientific basis for the differences in active ingredients in these different forms of Snow Chrysanthemums, laying a solid foundation for further exploring the pharmacological effects and potential applications in food and medicine.
We aimed to determine the antioxidant activity of Kunlun Chrysanthemum, Jiajin Chrysanthemum, and Chrysanthemum buds to provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for the scientific therapeutic application of Snow Chrysanthemums.

The theoretical plate number of the chromatographic column is above 80,000, and the tailing factor is 1.01.
DPPH free radicals are widely used for in vitro antioxidant evaluation; antioxidant capacity was evaluated by measuring the ability of the sample to scavenge DPPH free radicals.
Five milligrams of DPPH was accurately weighed, diluted to a volume of 250 mL with 75% ethanol solution, and stored in the dark for future use.
Two milliliters of test Solution II was accurately measured containing different mass concentrations; 2 mL of DPPH was added, shaken thoroughly, and reacted at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.

The absorbance measured using 75% ethanol instead of DPPH solution was A2.
The absorbance measured using 75% ethanol instead of Snow Chrysanthemum extract was A0.
Each sample was measured three times, and the average was taken to calculate the clearance percentage.
The positive control was the commonly used vitamin C (VC) solution.
An appropriate amount of VC was accurately weighed, and a solution containing 2.0 mg VC per mL was prepared with 75% ethanol and diluted to obtain positive control solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL (Song et al.2016).
whereA0represents the absorbance of the blank group (DPPH solution without the antioxidant sample);A1is the absorbance of the sample group (DPPH solution with the antioxidant sample); andA2is the absorbance of the control group (sample solution without DPPH solution).
The ABTS free radical scavenging ability method is commonly used to determine antioxidant capacity of food, drug, health product, and cosmetic samples.
Measuring the absorbance changes before and after the reaction between the sample and ABTS free radicals allows the antioxidant capacity of the sample to be calculated.
A measured volume of ABTS solution (7 mmol/L) containing potassium persulfate solution (140 mmol/L) was left at room temperature in the dark overnight to prepare ABTS stock solution.
The ABTS working solution was diluted using anhydrous ethanol to obtain an absorbance value of 0.70 ± 0.002 at 30°C and 734 nm wavelength; 3.9 mL of ABTS working solution was mixed with 0.1 mL of test Solution II, shaken thoroughly for 10 s, and allowed to stand for 6 min for reaction.
The absorbance was measured at 734 nm.
Each sample was tested three times, and the average value was taken to calculate the clearance percentage.
The positive control was VC solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL, prepared as above (Qiu et al.2015).
whereA0represents the absorbance of the blank group, andA1is the absorbance of the sample to be tested.
The IC50(half maximal inhibitory concentration) was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of the compounds; calculated as the compound concentration required to achieve 50% clearance of free radicals in the DPPH and ABTS assays.
The data are presented in the form of mean ± standard deviation.
SPSS 19.0 one‐way ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons, with a significance level ofp< 0.05.
The linearity of the detector response was determined according to the calibration chart.
Study standard solutions for linear testing were prepared from reserve solutions with a gradient of six concentrations.
Regression analysis was employed to evaluate the linearity of the analysis method.
In the regression equation Y = aX + b, “X” corresponds to the concentration of the standard solution (mg/mL), “Y” corresponds to the peak area, “a” is the slope of the line, and “b” is the intercept of the line on the y‐axis.
Calibration curves were constructed with correlation coefficients (r2) exceeding 0.9996 for all four reference standards, indicating an excellent relationship between peak area and the concentration of the four indicator components over the concentration range.
In HPLC analysis, the limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest detectable amount of analyte above the baseline noise level (usually signal to noise ratio [S/N] = 3), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) is defined as the lowest reproducible amount of analyte above the baseline noise level (usually S/N = 10 or higher) (Wang et al.2008).
Standard solutions were diluted with 70% methanol to obtain the appropriate concentrations.
In this study, the injection volume was 10 μL, and the LOD and LOQ of the four indicator components were 0.001–0.003 mg/mL and 0.002–0.012 mg/mL, respectively (Table2).

To outline an ontological method for hermeneutic data analysis that highlights the need to grasp patients’ experiences through careful qualitative exploration.
We use existential lifeworld caring theory together with hermeneutic ontology to shape the situational dialogue, guide data collection, and support empirical applications.
Our method follows three consecutive analytic phases designed to faithfully present patients’ perspectives on their lived realities.
These three phases recognise that comprehending a patient’s experience depends on the themes they raise in dialogue and the manner in which they articulate them.
The next stage shifts attention to the content of what they describe, discerning what they find most meaningful and examining its ties to past, present, and future circumstances.
The final stage concentrates on the way the informant points to concrete experiences and how these connect to the issues raised and the manner of their expression.
We introduce an ontological model for hermeneutic data gathering paired with a three-step analytic strategy that increases the transparency of interpretation.
