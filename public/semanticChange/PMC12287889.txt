Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), small‐bodied New World primates that share similar sensory processing pathways with human beings, have gained great interests.
Their small body size allows imaging of brain activity with high spatial resolution and on a whole‐brain scale using ultrahigh‐field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners.
However, the strong magnetic field and the small size of the hand and forearm pose challenges in delivering tactile stimulation during fMRI experiments.
In the present study, we developed an MR‐compatible tactile dual‐point stimulator to provide high‐precision mechanical stimulation for exploring somatosensory processing in small‐bodied animals.
The study population consisted of a water phantom and three male common marmosets.
Cerebral blood volume (CBV) weighted fMRI data were obtained with a gradient echo (GE), echo‐planar imaging (EPI) sequence at 7T scanner.
The output performance of the device was tested by a pressure sensor.
The MR compatibility of the device was verified by measuring the temporal signal‐to‐noise ratio (tSNR) of a water phantom.
To test the effectiveness of tactile stimulation, we conducted block designed tactile stimulation experiments on marmosets.
A one‐way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for comparing the tSNR results.
We performed one‐samplet‐tests to investigate the negative response of the forearm and hand stimulation with a threshold oft> 1.96 (p< 0.05).
Performance tests revealed that mechanical stimulation (averaged force: 31.69 g) was applied with a delay of 12 ms. Phantom experiments confirmed that there was no significant difference in the tSNR among three (10 Hz, 1 Hz, and no‐stimulus) conditions (F(2, 798) = 0.71,p= 0.49).
The CBV activity results showed that the stimulator successfully elicited hand and forearm somatosensory activations in primary somatosensory areas.
These results indicated that the device is well suited for small‐bodied animal somatosensory studies.
A dual‐point stimulator was developed to deliver precise tactile stimulation for somatosensory studies in small‐bodied animals like marmosets.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed its effectiveness in eliciting hand and forearm activations in primary somatosensory areas, confirming its suitability for somatosensory studies at ultrahigh‐field MRI.
The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) plays a complex role in processing tactile sensory information through both feedforward and feedback mechanisms [1,2,3,4,5].
Researchers often use animal models to study these functions because the sensory information processing pathways are similar to those of humans [6].
Additionally, cross‐species comparisons could provide new insights into understanding human brain functions [7].
Small‐bodied animals have great advantages in tactile sensory research because their small body sizes are suitable for imaging brain activity with high spatial resolution and on a whole‐brain scale using ultrahigh‐field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners.
The common marmoset is a small‐bodied New World primate and has gained increasing interest as an animal model for investigating primate‐specific sensorimotor neural systems [8,9].
Marmosets have several advantages for research, including their small size, rapid maturation, and high reproductive rates [10,11,12,13].
Additionally, their small lissencephalic brain simplifies the study of cortical functions and structures.
The use of UHF MRI scanners has recently enabled the precise investigation of somatosensory perception in marmosets [14,15,16,17].
However, the small size of their hands and forearms introduces challenges for delivering tactile stimulation in the MRI environment.
Identifying somatosensory representations in S1 is crucial for understanding how the brain processes tactile information.
S1 is the initial cortical site for processing tactile information [18,19].
In marmosets, S1 can be subdivided into areas 3a, 3b, 1, and possibly area 2 [13,20].
Similar to humans and other nonhuman primates, S1 of marmosets contains a topographic representation of the body [21,22,23].
Notably, the hand has a distinct somatotopic representation in S1.
Recent research has indicated that the hand area of S1 is also involved in high‐level somatosensory processing, such as spatiotemporal integration of tactile inputs [19,24].
UHF MRI technology enables the recording of marmoset brain activity with high spatial resolution and can provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying tactile perception in S1.
To fully exploit this high resolution and achieve precise mapping between brain activity and sensory input, the stimulator needs to prompt tactile‐related brain activity with precise timing and target specific body parts, such as the hand and forearm.
Mechanical stimulation actuated by a motor [19,24,25,26] has been shown to enable the examination of tactile sensation with high temporal and spatial precision in monkeys.
However, the use of motors is restricted in the MRI scanner environment.
Currently, only electrical and pneumatic stimulation methods have been used to explore brain responses to somatosensory stimulation in marmosets via MRI experiments [27,28,29,30].
Electrical pulse stimulation applied to the bilateral wrists has been used to measure blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) hemodynamic response function (HRF) characteristics [29].
Even though electrical stimulation has high temporal precision, whether it can accurately represent real somatosensory sensations from skin deformation is debatable as electric stimulation could not generate skin deformation, which was believed as the main part to generate tactile sensation [31].
Pneumatic stimulation, which uses devices such as the Galileo tactile stimulator (Galileo Tactile Stimulator; Brainbox Ltd., Cardiff, United Kingdom), has also been employed to map the face, arm, and leg in awake marmosets [30].
However, the temporal precision of pneumatic tactile stimulation decreases as the tubing length increases.
In addition, due to the small body size of marmosets and the limited space inside the MRI scanner, the puffed air may inadvertently be delivered to unintended areas.
Therefore, existing stimulation devices are insufficient for accurately exploring brain activity related to somatosensory perception in marmosets.
In addition to pneumatic and electrical stimulation, piezoelectric actuators have been employed to provide tactile stimulation to explore human tactile perception in fMRI experiments.
Two types of piezoelectric ceramic actuators have been used.
One actuator has high‐frequency vibration [32,33,34]; however, its large surface area compared with the size of marmosets' hand limits its application in marmoset experiments.
The other type of piezoelectric stimulation device uses a piezoelectric bimorph actuator [35].
In the previous work, we developed a tactile stimulation device based on this technology for mapping population receptive fields in the human S1 [36].
The device was developed to provide tactile stimulation to humans in a 3T scanner and has more space for the linear reciprocating motion of the carbon fiber stimulation string and a larger skin surface to fix the stimulation fiber.
The actuation mechanism of this device has great potential for providing mechanical tactile stimulation to assess somatosensory processing in marmosets in combination with UHF MRI technology.
However, the limited body areas of the animal restrict the use of the device since the stimulation string can be placed only along the scanner axis, and marmosets' forearm needs to also be positioned along this axis.
The parallel placement of the target stimulation area and the actuator's output direction introduces a new challenge, necessitating a mechanism to convert the direction of the applied force from parallel to vertical for effective delivery of tactile stimulation.
In this work, we developed a two‐channel MR‐compatible tactile stimulation device capable of delivering stable stimuli with high temporal and spatial precision for recording brain activity in anesthetized marmosets.
Building on our original device, we designed a unique double‐rocker unit to deliver mechanical stimulation to the hand and forearm of marmosets in a small‐bore UHF MRI scanner.
First, we tested the output performance of the device to ensure that it did not interfere with the fMRI results.
Next, we conducted fMRI experiments with marmosets to determine whether the stimulation provided by the device activated the somatosensory cortex.
The DPS was designed to provide two‐channel tactile stimulation to the hand and forearm of marmosets during the fMRI experiments.
Each channel independently generated mechanical stimulation, creating a skin indentation to elicit tactile‐related brain activity in marmosets.
To meet these requirements, the DPS was manufactured using MR‐compatible materials.
It consisted of a dual point rocker execution unit (Figure1b) and a piezoelectric actuator unit (Figure1c).
During the experiment, the rockers of the execution unit were pressed against the skin to generate mechanical tactile stimulation.
The mechanical stimulations generated by the piezoelectric actuator unit were transmitted to the execution unit through 1.3‐m fiberglass strings.
The piezoelectric actuated unit was driven and controlled by a control unit (Figure1d) placed outside the scanner room.
The control signal was transmitted via 10‐m MR compatible cables, with the shielding layer of the cable grounded.
An overview of the DPS and its arrangement in the fMRI experiment is shown in Figure1a,e.

The orange frame shows the arrangement of the dual‐point rocker execution unit placed inside the MR scan bore.
For actuating two‐channel rockers of the execution unit, we developed a piezoelectric actuator unit, which is shown in Figure2b.
We chose piezo bimorphs, which are MR‐compatible actuators [35,36], as the driving source for the system.
Since the piezo bimorphs generate sound noise during operation, we built two additional identical bimorph sets to operate during the no‐stimulation periods of the experiment, providing background sound noise.
The device contained four independent channels: two channels were connected to the execution unit to provide mechanical stimulation, whereas the other two channels remained disconnected from the execution unit to provide voice control functions.
In the previous design [36], the horizontal‐placed paired piezoelectric bimorph actuator exhibited stable displacement (2.64 mm) over a wide range of vibration frequencies (1–30 Hz).
This output performance demonstrated its potential to drive the dual‐point rocker–slider execution unit.
To better realize the stimulation process, we set four piezoelectric bimorphs in one channel (Figure2d).
Instead of selecting the push part in the reciprocating motion of the actuator as the percussive stimulation, we selected the pull part as the stimulation motion in this case because the pull motion exhibited much better mechanical performance in wire transmission than the push motion.
Additionally, to further decrease the impact of the noise generated by the actuators on the MRI signals, we accommodated the two sets of actuator parts in a fixation box covered with copper foil.
The voice control actuator was positioned behind the device actuator inside the house of the piezoelectric actuator unit.

The DPREU was designed to fulfill two functions: (1) deliver and amplify mechanical stimulation to the hand and forearm of marmosets at predetermined locations and (2) stabilize marmosets' hand and forearm to ensure the stability and reproducibility of the fMRI experiment.
The size and components of the DPREU are shown in Figure2a.
In accordance with the forearm and hand size of marmosets, we chose M2 nylon screws (diameter of 2 mm) as the stimulation points.
The distance between the two stimulation parts was set to 25 mm to ensure that the stimulation locations were the palm and forearm.
To maintain the same output performance of the two channels, the sizes of the rocker–slider mechanisms of these two channels were identical.
Figure2cshows the size of the two rockers containing the DPREU.
The string pulled by the piezoelectric actuator was set to pull the rocker1 at the tail, whereas the middle part of rocker1 was set to pull rocker2.
This design amplified the output force.
Specifically, we designed a rocker2 with a 90° angle to convert the horizontal force into a vertical stimulation force.
This design overcame the limitation of the piezo bimorph actuator, which could only generate force in a single direction.
To improve motion stability, we selected a carbon fiber bar with a 3‐mm diameter and cut it to the required length to serve as the transmission axis.
The motion principle of the double‐rocker mechanism is shown in Figure3.
To ensure that the stimulation process was visible during the experiment, we designed two check windows at the front of the DPREU.
Two bars were connected to the transmission axes of the two channels, accordingly, and moved in sync with the fiberglass string.
Using an MR‐compatible camera, we could observe the stimulation process by monitoring the performance of the bars through the check window.

The fixation function was achieved using two parts: the band part and the housing fixation part.
The two bands were affixed to the housing of the DPREU to secure marmosets' hand and forearm to the stimulation locations.
A curved plate with a height of 1 mm and a width of 6 mm was positioned at the hand position to ensure direct contact between the marmoset palm and the stimulation point.
To ensure that marmosets remained in a relatively comfortable position during the experiment, we designed a housing fixation part to secure the DPREU at a 45° angle with the horizontal panel.
To maintain the stability of the entire system, the housing fixator was clipped onto the scanner bore.
Figure1dshows the composition of the control unit.
The process of all stimulus presentations was controlled by the PsychoPy system.
The system was triggered by a custom‐made mouse trigger box; this box was responsible for responding to the TTL signal from the MRI scanner.
Since the four‐channel piezo bimorphs were driven by high‐voltage signals, we chose a relay module to actuate the DPREU.
The on and off situations of these four channel relays on the relay module were independently controlled by 4 I/O ports.
The output frequency precision of stimulation was attained by the “millis()” function on the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino Uno communicated with the PC and received the channel selection signal using the serial port communication.
To better assess the output performance of the DPS, the output forces at l, 5, and 10 Hz were measured.
To test the stimulus performance delivered to marmosets, a plate containing a thin‐film pressure sensor (ViaGasaFamido, RP‐C‐MK01X pressure sensor) was affixed to the upper surface of the DPREU housing to record the output force.
Real‐time force data were sent to the PC via a serial port at a baud rate of 9600.
Since the pressure sensor could not capture force changes and output delays at the millisecond level, we constructed a recording circuit using the same film pressure sensor (DF9‐16) to determine the temporal precision of the DPS.
This sensor was attached to the upper surface of the housing, as shown in Figure4a.
The VOUTsignal from the R0(100 KΩ) resistor was recorded using an oscilloscope (RIGOL DS1000Z) during the output process across three vibrational frequencies.

The MR compatibility of the device was verified by measuring the temporal signal‐to‐noise ratio (tSNR) of a water phantom (Figure5a) using the same MRI scanner used in the marmoset experiment.
The tSNR measurement was performed with a 7T/20‐cm bore magnet (Bruker‐Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA).
A saddle coil with an inner diameter of 86 mm was used as a transmit coil, and the MR signal was acquired from one loop coil (Takashima Seisakusho Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
One slice placed at the center of the phantom was scanned to calculate the tSNR.
The image of the phantom, which is shown in Figure5b, is derived from a single‐shot gradient echo‐planar imaging (GE‐EPI) sequence (FOV, 60 × 50 mm2; matrix, 72 × 64; slice thickness, 1 mm; voxel size, 0.833 × 0.781 × 1.0 mm3; acquisition bandwidth, 250 kHz; TE, 10 ms; TR, 2000 ms; flip angle, 60°).
The tSNRs were separately assessed at low‐frequency (1 Hz), high‐frequency (10 Hz), and no‐stimulus conditions.
These three stimulation conditions were presented in a repeated sequence of 1‐min‐long blocks: 10 Hz (1 min)—1 Hz (1 min) )—no stimulus (1 min), repeated three times for a total duration of 9 min.
The tSNRs under the three conditions were extracted from a region of interest (ROI) (16 × 16 = 256 pixels) placed at the center of the phantom for statistical analysis to determine the effect of the device's operation on image quality.
A one‐way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for comparing the tSNR of the three conditions.

All experiments were approved by the experimental animal committee.
Three adult male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; Marmoset #1: aged 7 years; body weight 340–360 g; Marmoset #2: aged 2 years; body weight 373–393 g; Marmoset #3: aged 4 years; body weight 372–392 g) were used.
All interventions and animal care procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal experiments and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
On the day of the experiment, initial sedation was induced by a small dose of ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.4 mg/kg), and anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane (2.5%), which was inhaled via a facemask.
After the marmoset received cannulation into the leg vein, anesthesia was switched to a constant intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (5 μg/kg/h) and 0.5% isoflurane.
A dose of 20 mg/kg of 30‐nm ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles (Molday ION [MION], Biophysics Assay Laboratory Inc., USA) was injected 30 min before the start of the fMRI scan.
With high‐dose MION, fMRI scans have focused mainly on the CBV reaction.
Lower concentrations of isoflurane may cause the marmoset to begin waking, indicated by an increased respiratory rate and visible bodily movements.
When these signs were observed, the isoflurane concentration was immediately increased to maintain sedation.
We stimulated the right forearm and hand with our device to investigate whether our device could elicit somatosensory‐related brain activity in the marmoset during anesthesia.
Marmoset #1 joined 30‐second‐on (30s‐on) and 10‐second‐on (10s‐on) block paradigms over 2 days (Figure6).
