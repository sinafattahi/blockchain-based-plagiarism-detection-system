Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are biomolecules with applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and nutraceutical industries.
However, traditional GAG sources, such as animal tissues and marine organisms, present imminent challenges, including structural heterogeneity, contamination risk, and geographical sourcing limitations.
This review explores the potential of the eggshell matrix, an abundant yet underutilized by‐product of the egg industry, as a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative source of GAG production.
This review examined the composition of the eggshell matrix, highlighting its rich content of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and other valuable GAGs, coupled with their extraction and purification techniques.
The advantages of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs, including their consistent molecular properties, lower allergenicity, and alignment with circular economy principles, are also discussed.
Additionally, this review highlights the industrial scalability of eggshell matrix valorization and its potential to mitigate environmental waste while meeting global GAG demand.
The eggshell matrix shows promise for GAG production, with hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate already identified, but more work is needed to improve extraction efficiency, broaden industrial uses, and ensure commercial success.
This represents the broad areas of process optimization, technological integration, and comprehensive economic evaluation.
By addressing current challenges and future research directions, this review underscores the transformative potential of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs for advancing sustainable biomaterial production.
An Overview of Glycosaminoglycans Recovery Techniques and Their Diverse Applications.
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a family of linear, negatively charged polysaccharides found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of most cell types [1,2,3].
GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharide units, typically an amino sugar (N‐acetylglucosamine [GlcNAc] orN‐acetylgalactosamine [GalNAc]) and uronic acid (glucuronic or iduronic acid [IdoA]) [4], that are often sulfated at various positions, conferring significant anionic character [5].
The arrangements of these structural features contribute to the diversity and biological specificity of GAGs [6,7], enabling their key participation in cell signaling, tissue hydration, wound healing, and inflammation regulation [8].
Currently, the commercial production of GAGs such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate (CS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) relies heavily on animal‐derived tissues, including intestinal mucosa, bovine trachea, rooster combs, and marine cartilage [5,9,10].
These sources raise significant concerns related to sustainability, ethical considerations, zoonotic risks, and supply chain stability.
While non‐animal alternatives like microbial fermentation and recombinant biosynthesis are being explored [11,12], their large‐scale operationalization remains hindered by high cost, limited scalability, and regulatory challenges.
These limitations highlight the need for novel, sustainable sources.
Given this, the eggshell matrix, comprising the mineralized or calcified shell and the organic fibrous membrane, has emerged as a promising yet underutilized bioresource for GAG extraction.
The eggshell matrix comes as a by‐product of the egg industry, which is generated in large quantities globally and often ends up in landfills, contributing to environmental pollution [13].
Meanwhile, both the eggshell and its membrane are rich in bioactive macromolecules, including collagen, glycoproteins, and GAGs, presenting them as sustainable and cost‐effective substrates for biorefinery approaches [14,15].
Despite the recent increase in attention, the potential of eggshell matrix as a viable and scalable source of GAGs has not been comprehensively explored.
The lack of a unified understanding of extraction methods, structure–function relationships, and potential broader industrial applications characterizes the key barriers to valorizing this bioresource.
The existing literature, in most aspects, focuses on the compositional analysis of eggshell membranes (ESMs) or the general recycling of eggshell waste.
Few studies comprehensively integrate the biochemical, technological, applications, and scalability feasibility of the sustainable recovery of GAGs from eggshell matrix.
Furthermore, a holistic comparison of the eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs with conventional sources in terms of purity, abundance, sustainability potential, and structural heterogeneity is lacking.
This review aims to comprehensively assess the potential for upcycling eggshell matrix for sustainable GAG production, critically analyzing the current sources, challenges, and opportunities.
It seeks to bridge the gap between eggshell waste management and high‐value biomolecule recovery.
The review contributes to the field by identifying and synthesizing recent advances in GAG extraction from eggshell matrix, comparing the structural and functional characteristics of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs with those from traditional sources, and highlighting the scalability potential of sustainable production of GAGs from eggshell matrix.
With the efforts to redefine eggshell matrix as a valuable raw material, this study presents a sustainable approach to eggshell matrix recycling and utilization, minimizing environmental impact, and strengthening the efficiency and resilience of GAG supply chains.
Each GAG exhibits distinct structural and chemical features that dictate its unique biological, physiological, and functional role.
Descriptions of the chemical structures of commonly known GAGs, including hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS), heparin, and keratan sulfate (KS), are provided herein.
HA is composed of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N‐acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), linked by β(1,4)‐GlcA and β(1,3)‐GlcNAc bonds, and is the only known non‐sulfated GAG [7].
Found in the ECM, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus, HA is essential for tissue hydration, cell signaling, joint lubrication, wound healing, and the regulation of cell migration [16].
CS, on the other hand, consists of repeating disaccharide units of GalNAc and GlcA, connected via β(1, 3) and β(1, 4) glycosidic bonds.
CS plays crucial roles in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, signaling, and neuronal growth [17].
DS shares similarities with CS but is distinguished by the conversion of GlcA residues to IdoA by DS epimerases [18,19].
This modification enables DS to serve as a neuritogenic molecule, influencing axonal growth and central nervous system regeneration [10].
DS also exhibits a flexible structure that facilitates interactions with growth factors, aiding in coagulation and wound healing regulation [20].
HS consists of disaccharide units of GlcA/IdoA and glucosamine (GlcN) with fewer sulfate groups than heparin [21].
Variations in epimerization, acetylation, and sulfation patterns confer structural diversity to HS [22].
HS interacts with cytokines, such as IL‐6, modulating immune responses and inflammation [23].
Heparin (H) is highly sulfated and composed of α‐glycosidic linkages and disaccharide repeats of GlcN joined with GlcA or IdoA.
GlcN residues contain sulfamide linkages and can be N‐acetylated, N‐sulfated, or O‐sulfated on C‐6 of GlcN, O‐sulfated on C‐3 of the hexosamine, and C‐2 of GlcA.
Its sulfamide linkages and extensive sulfation make it an excellent anticoagulant and lipid‐clearing agent [24].
KS is characterized by repeating disaccharide units where galactose (Gal) is linked β1–4 to GlcNAc.
Unlike other GAGs, KS lacks uronic acid but may include other monosaccharides, such as mannose, fucose, sialic acid, or GalNAc.
KS exists in two forms: KS‐I, which is linked to proteins via GlcNAc‐asparaginyl bonds and is predominantly found in the cornea, contributing to transparency and structural integrity, and KS‐II, which is linked to serine or threonine via GlcNAc, mainly present in cartilage tissue [25].
In general, KS plays a significant role in neural processes due to its interactive capabilities with various extracellular components [26].
The MW and polydispersity of GAGs vary widely depending on their source, influencing their functionality and processing complexity.
High‐MW GAGs are known to promote cell adhesion and proliferation by interacting efficiently with cell surface receptors [27].
But they often require intensive purification, complicating their production [5].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as HA from rooster combs and CS from bovine cartilage, typically have high MWs (80 kDa to several MDa) with moderate polydispersity due to natural biosynthetic control.
For example, optimized enzymatic treatment of cattle nasal cartilage yielded CS with an MW of 89.21 kDa [27].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as CS from shark cartilage or DS from fish skin, typically exhibit lower MWs (10–500 kDa) and higher polydispersity [28], likely due to enzymatic degradation during extraction [29,30,31].
In contrast, eggshell matrix GAGs are generally isolated using a mixture of chemical and enzymatic procedures that contribute to preserving their integrity, resulting in reduced polydispersity.
Microbial GAGs, such as HA fromStreptococcus zooepidemicusprovide tunable MWs and low polydispersity, making them suitable for biomedical applications [32,33].
In contrast, eggshell matrix GAGs exhibit narrower and more uniform weight (20–40 kDa), a result of well‐regulated biomineralization.
This size range has been associated with enhanced solubility, improved diffusivity, and more consistent interaction profiles with biological targets, distinguishing it from the more heterogeneous behavior of high‐MW GAGs.
These properties contribute to predictable bioactivity and are particularly advantageous for biomedical and industrial applications.

This size range has been associated with enhanced solubility, improved diffusivity, and more consistent interaction profiles with biological targets, distinguishing it from the more heterogeneous behavior of high‐MW GAGs.
These properties contribute to predictable bioactivity and are particularly advantageous in precision‐demanding biomedical and industrial applications [13,14,34].
Charge density, defined by the concentration of negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate groups, is a critical factor influencing GAG functionality [35].
A higher charge density enhances the GAG‐protein binding affinity, increasing viscosity and improving joint lubrication [36,37].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as heparin from the porcine intestine, exhibit high charge densities owing to extensive sulfation, which enhances biological activities, such as anticoagulation [38].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as fucoidan from brown algae, exhibit high charge densities and unique sulfation patterns that impart antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties [39,40].
Microbial‐derived GAGs, such as HA, typically have a lower charge density due to the absence of sulfate groups, resulting in high solubility and biocompatibility [41].
Eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs exhibit low to intermediate charge densities, with sulfated GAGs contributing to bioactivity.
Their sulfate groups are more uniformly distributed than the clustered patterns in mammalian GAGs, offering consistent physical properties and controlled drug delivery applications.
Predominantly, 4‐O‐sulfated eggshell GAGs influence chain flexibility and molecular interactions, making them promising candidates for tailored biomedical applications.
The solubility of GAGs is influenced by their sources and by their structural characteristics.
Highly soluble GAGs enhance biological activity through effective interactions with proteins and growth factors, while stable GAGs retain functionality over time [42].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as HA and CS, are highly water‐soluble due to their hydrophilic and charged structures, but are prone to enzymatic degradation in vivo [43].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as carrageenan from red algae, combine high solubility and stability, making them suitable for food and pharmaceutical use [44,45].
Microbial‐derived GAGs, such as HA, offer excellent solubility and enhanced stability, particularly when chemically modified [46,47].
Eggshell‐derived GAGs also show favorable solubility and stability under neutral to slightly alkaline conditions.
Their sulfated nature imparts resistance to enzymatic breakdown, positioning them as promising alternatives for biomedical and industrial applications [48].
In addition, eggshell matrix GAGs have been studied in both their purified form and as components of composite biomaterials.
However, recent research emphasizes their integration into composite biomaterials such as hydrogels, films, and biopolymer blends [49,50], where consistent weight and bioactivity help enhance mechanical performance [51].
The rheological properties of GAGs are crucial for their application in biomaterials and tissue engineering [52].
Animal‐derived GAGs, such as HA, exhibit unique viscoelastic properties, making them ideal lubricants and hydrogels [53].
Marine‐derived GAGs, such as alginate from brown algae, also demonstrate high viscosity and gel‐forming abilities, which are utilized in wound healing and drug delivery [54,55].
Microbial‐derived GAGs, such as HA, can be engineered to achieve specific rheological properties, including shear‐thinning behavior, which is beneficial for injectable hydrogels [56].
Eggshell‐derived GAGs show promise for forming hydrogels with moderate viscosity and elasticity, which are suitable for use in regenerative medicine and drug delivery [57].
For instance, a hybrid tissue scaffold hydrogel containing 10% eggshell particles exhibited a 47% improvement in mechanical properties compared to a neat hydrogel scaffold [58].
Another study incorporated 4 w/v% ESM into gellan gum (GG) to create a composite hydrogel, enhancing its degradability, biocompatibility, and anti‐swelling properties while facilitating cell proliferation without significant cytotoxicity [59].
These findings highlight the potential of eggshell‐derived GAGs for advanced biomedical applications.
The superiority of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs is attributed to their uniform MWs, easy handling and purification requirements, predictable processing behavior, and balanced charge density with uniform 4‐O‐sulfation, offering enhanced chain flexibility and controlled bioactivity over the irregular sulfation patterns of animal‐ and microbial‐derived GAGs.
Eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs also exhibit high solubility and stability, making them highly resistant to enzymatic degradation and functionally stable under physiological conditions.
Rheological superiority enables the fabrication of hydrogels with tunable viscosities and elasticities.
Figure1shows the comparative advantages of eggshell matrix‐derived GAGs over their conventional counterparts.
Comparative analysis of the physical properties of glycosaminoglycans and potential functional applications across different sources.
The production of GAGs faces substantial setbacks because of their inherent structural heterogeneity.
Variations in MW, sulfation patterns, and biological activity present complications in production processes and impact therapeutic efficacy [60].
GAGs exist in diverse chain lengths, from short oligosaccharides to long polysaccharides [12], with random chain breakages during extraction and processing contributing to their heterogeneity.
This variation directly influences their biology, as different MWs can lead to distinct therapeutic effects [61].
For instance, high‐molecular‐weight HA oligosaccharides are known to be effective in drug delivery and cancer therapy.
Sulfation patterns vary depending on the source of the tissue, species, and physiological conditions, contributing to a significant degree of complexity [62].
These patterns are critical for biological activities, such as protein binding, as observed in heparin, where a specific saccharide sequence is essential for antithrombin binding [63].
However, ensuring sulfation consistency remains a major challenge.
Current analytical methods have proven ineffective in fully characterizing these variations, presenting hurdles in terms of quality control, regulatory compliance, and product consistency [64].
Current GAG sources, especially those of animal origin, exhibit substantial structural variability, posing challenges in manufacturing, research, and clinical applications.
Traditional sources of GAGs, such as animal tissues and bacteria, pose significant biological and chemical contamination risks.
Animal‐derived GAGs may harbor pathogenic microorganisms, prions (especially from bovine sources), and residual cellular components that can trigger immune responses [46].
Bacterial‐derived GAGs often contain endotoxins from bacterial cell walls, which can induce severe inflammatory reactions even at low concentrations [65].
The chemical contamination profile of GAGs, including heavy metals, pesticides, and residual antibodies from husbandry practices, further complicates the extraction and purification processes, affecting GAG quality and end‐use performance [66,67].
This hinders the purity requirements of nutraceuticals and cosmetic products, highlighting the need for safer alternative sources.
In addition to structural heterogeneity and contamination risks, seasonal and geographical variations pose significant production challenges, particularly for marine‐derived GAGs.
The biochemical profile of marine‐derived GAGs is influenced by the life cycle of the source organisms, including breeding seasons, growth phases, and molting periods [7].
Extreme weather conditions, such as storms, temperature shifts, and ice coverage, further disrupt harvesting and accessibility to marine resources [68].
Geographical factors also play a crucial role in the differences in temperature and salinity that affect the molecular properties of GAGs from coastal and deep‐water sources [28,69].
For example, polysaccharides fromGracilaria chouaeexhibit variations in total sugar and anhydrogalactose content across five regions, which directly affect their gel properties [70].
Furthermore, the negative impact of water pollution on ecosystem health has a subsequent negative effect on the purity of the extracted GAGs.
The environmental and ethical implications of sourcing conventional GAGs raise significant sustainability concerns.
Marine sources, particularly shark cartilage for CS extraction, face critical sustainability issues due to overfishing, with some shark populations declining sharply in heavily fished regions [71].
Destructive harvesting methods, such as bottom trawling, exacerbate ecological damage by destabilizing coral reefs and benthic ecosystems [72,73].
On land, intensive livestock farming, a primary source of GAG raw materials, generates 64% of ammonia emissions, contributing to acid rain and biodiversity loss [74].
Additionally, livestock farming produces significant amounts of greenhouse gases, such as CO2and CH4which accelerate climate change [75].
The GAG industry also generates substantial waste, with bovine slaughter producing 275 kg/ton and pig slaughter producing 2.3 kg/ton of solids [76].
These environmental and waste management challenges, coupled with the overexploitation of marine and livestock resources threaten raw material availability and supply chain stability.
The presence of allergenic proteins in GAG production poses significant challenges in manufacturing and public health.
Crustacean shells, a common GAG source contain heat‐resistant allergenic proteins such as tropomyosin, arginine kinase, and myosin light chain, which persist even after thermal processing [77].
Although GAGs are not allergenic, extraction and purification processes often fail to completely remove these proteins, risking the contamination of the final product [78].
This is particularly concerning for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, where GAG‐based products such as CS and GlcN are widely used.
Current processing techniques are insufficient to eliminate crustacean allergens, making dietary avoidance the safest practice [79,80].
To address these challenges, eggshells and ESMs have emerged as promising, allergen‐free alternatives.
These sources not only provide a safer and higher‐quality profile but also align with sustainable production practices, reducing the reliance on traditional crustacean‐derived GAGs.
Furthermore, in the United States, the European Union, and Canada jurisdictions, the presence of any detectable crustacean protein, such as tropomyosin, must be declared on product packaging [81,82].
Although universally defined thresholds for allowable allergen levels are lacking, regulatory authorities require manufacturers to adhere to stringent purification protocols including validated protein testing, to ensure product safety and consumer protection [77,83].
Given this, certain standardized and reliable methods have been developed to detect residual allergenic proteins in crustacean‐derived products, including GAGs.
Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been the most widely adopted technique due to its high sensitivity and specificity for crustacean allergens, which offer high sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 1 ppm [84].
Rapid on‐site detection can be performed using lateral flow immunoassays, which detect crustacean proteins at concentrations around 1 μg/g [85].
For confirmatory and multiplex analysis, liquid chromatography tandem‐mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offer highly sensitive detection of crustacean DNA or tropomyosin‐derived peptides, with quantification reported as low as 1.6 ppm [86] and 0.1 ppm [87], respectively.
These standardized detection techniques enable manufacturers to monitor residual allergen thresholds in final GAG preparation, ensuring regulatory compliance and protection of public health.
Owing to their structural and biochemical diversity, GAGs have been used in various therapeutic applications, drug delivery systems, and biomedical interventions [88].
Their polyanionic features enable the formation of stable drug‐carrier complexes, thereby enhancing drug delivery efficiency.
For instance, heparin‐conjugated liposomes have shown excellent potential in cancer therapy, exhibiting enhanced drug‐targeted delivery precision and pharmacokinetics [89,90].
A chitosan‐heparin‐coated liposome (400 nm, −31 mV) has proven effective for cancer drug delivery [91], while disulfide cross‐linked heparin‐chitosan‐lipoic acid nanocarriers have demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity and tumor‐targeting capabilities, particularly in skin cancer [90].
In tissue engineering, HA‐based scaffolds exhibit superior biocompatibility and cell adhesion, facilitating chondrocyte proliferation for cartilage regeneration [92].
Additionally, HA accelerates wound healing, with clinical studies indicating 40%–60% faster wound closure rates due to improved fibroblast migration and collagen synthesis.
Gel‐based proteomics has revolutionized seed protein studies by revealing proteins associated with stress tolerance, pathogen resistance, and nutrient efficiency.
Prof. Chittaranjan Kole, a prominent plant geneticist, has substantially influenced crop improvement through his contributions to genomics and molecular breeding.
His work has promoted the integration of advanced molecular approaches to improve agricultural productivity and address food security issues.
Building on such foundational research, this review provides an in-depth analysis of how gel electrophoresis supports crop proteomics, particularly in seed protein studies.
By examining the development of proteomic technologies—especially two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)—this review demonstrates how modern proteomics has broadened our knowledge of seed proteins and their agricultural applications.
As the demand grows for sustainable, high-yielding crops, understanding seed protein composition and activity becomes increasingly critical for developing resilient varieties.
Ultimately, this review highlights the transformative role of protein markers in modern crop improvement and their potential to advance agricultural sustainability and global food security.
