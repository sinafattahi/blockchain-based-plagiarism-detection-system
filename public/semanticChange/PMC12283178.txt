While people with lived experience (PLE) are increasingly included in health professions education, their role in simulation often remains limited to narrative sharing.
This initiative explored how involving PLE throughout the design and delivery of a pharmacy simulation on PrEP (a preventive HIV treatment) and sexual and gender diversity shaped students' learning about inclusive, person‐centred communication in consultations involving stigma and marginalisation.
A PrEP‐related simulation involving a non‐binary patient was integrated into a third‐year pharmacy course.
Sessions took place in a fully equipped lab replicating a community pharmacy, with 10 stations and professional actors as standardised patients.
Six PLE informed learning objectives, scenario design and debriefing.
One PLE trained the actors, observed simulations and participated in debriefings.
Their involvement supported inclusive, person‐centred communication around sexuality, gender diversity and HIV prevention.
A mixed‐methods design assessed impact.
Survey responses (n= 109) indicated increased confidence in PrEP‐related care and strong appreciation for PLE's presence.
Most students had little personal and professional exposure to PrEP, and 93% agreed the PLE enriched their learning.
Interviews (n= 14) highlighted how PLE involvement helped demystify stigmatised topics, fostered self‐reflection and emphasised the value of lived experience.
Students noted enhanced realism and psychological safety.
Involving PLE throughout simulation—from codesign to debriefing—helped reduce stigma, promote inclusive communication and enhance scenario authenticity.
Students felt better prepared for consultations involving PrEP or sexual and gender diversity.
This approach may help amplify the patient's voice in health education and could be adapted to other sensitive or stigmatised health topics.
Simulation‐based education provides health professions students' opportunities to develop clinical skills in a safe, realistic environment.
Integrating patients' voices into healthcare education is gaining momentum, shifting from passive to active partnerships that offer valuable [1,2], practice‐based insights.
In simulation‐based education, involving people with lived experience (PLE) has been linked to improved communication and positive attitudes toward stigmatised populations [3,4,5].
Yet their contributions often remain limited to narrative sharing or portraying patients, leaving much untapped potential [4,6,7].
Inclusive, respectful communication is vital for high‐quality care, especially when addressing sensitive topics or working with stigmatised populations.
Many health professionals feel unprepared to discuss issues like sexuality or gender diversity, which can undermine trust and contribute to health disparities among LGBTQ+ populations [8,9,10].
Pharmacists, for example, play a key role in HIV prevention through PrEP consultations but often report gaps in knowledge, confidence or appropriate language.
Engaging directly with PLE during training simulations may help address these challenges [11].
‘Inclusive, respectful communication is vital for high‐quality care, especially when addressing sensitive topics or working with stigmatized populations’.
‐ LGBTQ+: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning and others: An umbrella term referring to people from sexual and gender diversity.
‐ Non‐binary person: A person whose gender identity falls outside the male–female binary.
‐ PLE: People with lived experience: People who bring firsthand knowledge of a health‐related issue through personal experience, rather than professional training.
‐ PrEP: Preexposure prophylaxis: A preventive HIV treatment taken by HIV‐negative individuals to reduce the risk of infection.
The activity took place in February 2024 during a mandatory third‐year course in a 4‐year pharmacy programme in Québec, Canada, which offers limited but growing opportunities to engage with PLE.
By then, students had received some training in communication and professionalism, as well as PrEP and HIV treatment, completed about 15 simulations and done 11 weeks of community internships.
The simulations took place in a fully equipped lab replicating a community pharmacy, with 10 stations and professional actors as standardised patients.
Students, in groups of 30 and subgroups of three, participated as pharmacists or observers.
Sessions lasted 90 to 105 min, including debriefing.
A clinical simulation activity codeveloped and co‐delivered with PLE, featuring actors as simulated patients, to support inclusive, person‐centred communication skills.
Six PLEs were interviewed to inform the scenario design, learning objectives and simulation debriefing, based on their experiences with PrEP access and stigma.
Four later helped revise the script and validate patient profiles to ensure accuracy and reduce stigma.
One PLE, selected for their communication skills and experience leading workshops on sexual and gender diversity, played a larger role.
In addition to preparing actors, they observed simulations and contributed to debriefings.
They also met with the instructor after each session to adjust the approach if necessary.
‐ All received guidance on feedback expectations, such as confirming the scenario's realism, validating actors' scripts, and providing input on how they would express themselves in a PrEP consultation (e.g., concerns, questions, adverse effects).
‐ One was trained by the course instructor on simulation‐based teaching principles, including session flow, debriefing, question formulation, student expectations, and psychological safety.
‐ All received a $50 CAD (approx.£29 GBP) prepaid card.
‐ One received additional compensation at the faculty's speaker rate (CAD $202/hour, ~£109 GBP) for participating in simulation sessions.
Students were informed that the simulation was codeveloped with PLE and that one of them would be present during the session.
This mixed‐methods study used a sequential explanatory design to assess the simulation's impact on students' learning.
The project was approved by our university ethics committee, and written consent was obtained for both phases.
All data were anonymized and handled securely.
Immediately after the simulation and debriefing, students completed a brief online survey assessing their role (pharmacist or observer), prior PrEP experience and perceptions of the simulation.
The 10‐item Likert‐type questionnaire was reviewed by experts, pilot‐tested and is presented in Table1, along with response data.
Means (M) and standard deviations (SD) of participants' responses to the simulation with PLE on the appreciation scale (N= 109).
1, totally agree; 2, partially agree; 3, neutral; 4, partially disagree; 5, totally disagree.
Of 142 eligible students, 109 responded (77%).
Most had no personal (0%) and little professional (8%) experience with PrEP.
After the simulation, 83% strongly agreed it improved their awareness of PrEP‐related issues, and 93% credited the PLE's presence.
A Wilcoxon test showed significantly increased confidence in providing PrEP services postsimulation (p< 0.001).
To complement the survey data, 14 students participated in individual (n= 3, ∼25 min) or small group (n= 2, ∼50 min) semistructured interviews conducted outside class time.
Interviews were transcribed and analysed inductively using thematic analysis [12] to explore learning outcomes following the simulation and factors shaping the effectiveness of PLE integration for inclusive, person‐centred communication.
The design of the simulation helped students demystify PrEP and gain familiarity with sexual and gender diversity.
Direct engagement with a PLE, coupled with insights shared by instructors from other PLEs during debriefing, deepened their understanding of stigmatised identities, helping them confront biases, reduce discomfort with non‐binary individuals and increase confidence in addressing these topics.
It also simplified the perceived complexity of providing PrEP, making students feel more credible when serving LGBTQ+ patients.
Students highlighted how the presence of a PLE, combined with PLE‐trained actors, made the simulation more authentic than traditional role‐playing.
This setup encouraged them to move beyond pharmacological aspects, engage more meaningfully with patients and reflect on their language and behaviour.
By confronting discomfort in real time, students identified actions to improve their approach and adapt to real‐world scenarios.
Interacting with a PLE enhanced participants' recognition of lived experience as expertise, deepening their understanding of patient realities and bridging theoretical knowledge with a more inclusive, bidirectional approach to care.
Participants emphasised that PLE's communication skills and ability to create a safe environment were key to maximising learning.
Students highlighted clarity, empathy and facilitation skills as key attributes of effective PLE.
These qualities fostered reassurance, encouraged engagement and allowed questions without fear of mistakes, normalising uncertainty and reducing apprehension.
Participants noted that the impact of a PLE could be particularly strong when simulations addressed sensitive or stigmatised topics, such as mental health, substance use, higher body weight, abortion and emergency contraception.
These themes often created barriers to engagement, which the PLE could help to demystify.
The chosen scenario, which involved asking intimate questions about sexuality with patients outside sexual and gender norms, directly addressed these challenges.
Participants recognised the value of the PLE's presence, but due to logistical constraints, only a few teams received direct observation and personalised feedback.
Many expressed a desire for more PLE involvement during the simulation.
This educational innovation builds on prior work linking PLE involvement in simulation‐based education to improved communication and more inclusive attitudes toward stigmatised populations [3,4,5].
While many initiatives limit PLE to narrative roles [4,6,7], our approach demonstrates the value of engaging them throughout the process—from defining objectives and codesigning scenarios to training actors, observing simulations and contributing to debriefings.
Multiple PLE helped identify stigmatising content, refine clinical language and ensure the scenario reflected real‐world experiences.
The presence of a well‐prepared PLE during sessions also added emotional realism and relational depth.
Students described the activity as particularly memorable and useful in preparing them for sensitive consultations.
These outcomes echo findings that authentic clinical scenarios and psychological safety are key to effective simulation learning [13,14,15].
Two takeaways for educators stand out.
First, PLE should be carefully selected and supported to contribute meaningfully.
Second, simulation design should maximise opportunities for students to receive personalised feedback from PLE—whether through rotating facilitators or structured debriefs.
Interestingly, the impact extended beyond learners.
Instructors reported that PLE insights revealed blind spots in their teaching and prompted critical reflection.
The lead PLE also described the experience as empowering and reparative—an opportunity to help future professionals avoid the dismissive care they received when accessing PrEP.
This model illustrates how sustained partnerships with PLE can amplify the patient's voice in simulation and enhance person‐centred learning.
Future work should explore how such approaches translate into practice and promote equity in care delivery.
‘This model illustrates how sustained partnerships with PLE can amplify the patient's voice in simulation and enhance person‐centered learning’.
‐ Engaging PLE throughout simulation—from design to debrief—may enhance authenticity, reveal bias and support inclusive, person‐centred learning.
‐ Students felt better prepared to address sensitive topics like PrEP among LGBTQ+ populations following the activity.
‐ To maximise impact, PLE should be well supported and involved in structured feedback for all learners; this model may be adapted to other contexts involving stigma or marginalisation.
A total of 1,962 upregulated genes and 642 downregulated genes were identified.  
DNA damage response, mitotic cell cycle, and chromosome organization were revealed by molecular complex detection analyses as significant biological processes associated with upregulated genes.  
Cellular response to growth factor stimulus, response to growth factor, and blood vessel development were, in contrast, significant biological processes related to downregulated genes.  
Significant changes in the distribution of immune cells and differential expression of immune checkpoints associated with PAH were indicated by immune infiltration analysis.  
From the CTD, 58 isorhamnetin targets were extracted, and among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), DEGs related to ferroptosis, and isorhamnetin targets, 1 interacting gene, NFE2L2, was identified.  
Strong affinities were demonstrated by isorhamnetin with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors and transcription factors (ATM and ZNF24) associated with VEGFs, as well as with the ferroptosis protein NFE2L2.  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by downstream molecular signaling pathway abnormalities, including DNA damage, immune dysregulation, VEGF signaling deficiency, and the ferroptosis process.  
The core pathophysiological mechanisms of PAH may be represented by these.  
Ferroptosis-related genes, such as NFE2L2 and TF (ATM, ZNF24) associated with VEGFs, contribute to the mechanisms mentioned above and are potential therapeutic targets.  
For the treatment of PAH, isorhamnetin is a promising candidate compound.  
The survival rate of PAH patients, confirmed for the first time, is approximately 60% over a 3-year period.  
Pulmonary artery hypertension is often referred to as the “cancer” of the cardiovascular system.  
Consequently, exploring the fundamental pathological pathways, identifying therapeutic targets, and screening potential chemical candidates for PAH are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.  
The mechanisms of PAH have been extensively studied in recent years; however, preventive methods and therapeutic targets have not yet been fully identified.  
Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death that differs from necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy.  
It is primarily induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, leading to mitochondrial contraction, rupture of the mitochondrial membrane, cellular respiratory dysfunction, energy metabolism deficiency, and DNA damage.  
Previous studies have demonstrated that factors such as oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation influence pulmonary vascular remodeling, and all of these share molecular characteristics with the ferroptosis process.  
Additionally, the activation of ferroptosis signaling has been found to coincide with the onset of idiopathic PAH.  
Ferroptosis is not only associated with heart and lung diseases, such as myocardial infarction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also plays a role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH.  
However, the precise role of ferroptosis in the pathological mechanisms of PAH remains unclear.  
In recent years, approximately 4000 plant-derived flavonoid compounds have been identified, many possessing a variety of medicinal properties.  
Isorhamnoin is a specific class of flavonoid compounds primarily extracted from the fruits of “Hippophae rhamnoides” and the leaves of “Ginkgo biloba L.”  
Isorhamnoin exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and has the ability to protect vascular endothelial cells.
OHC activity-evoked electromotility is reduced by the resulting hyperpolarization and is implicated in cochlear gain control, attention, and protection against acoustic trauma.  
For markers of GABA and GABA synthesis, MOC neurons also label.  
GABAB autoreceptor (GABABR) activation on MOC terminals to reduce ACh release has been demonstrated, confirming important negative feedback roles.  
Including the mechanisms of GABA release from MOC axons, whether GABA diffuses from MOC axons to other postsynaptic cells, and the location and function of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), the full complement of GABAergic activity in the cochlea is not currently understood.  
We used optical neurotransmitter detection, immunohistochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that in addition to presynaptic GABAB autoreceptor activation, onto type II SGN afferent dendrites MOC efferent terminals release GABA with postsynaptic activity mediated by GABAARs.  
Including providing feedback to the brain about MOC and OHC activity, developmental regulation of cochlear innervation, or fine-tuning of OHC activity, this synapse may have roles.  
Between cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and type I spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) afferents, precise encoding of sound is mediated by powerful ribbon synapses.  
Via prestin-mediated electromotility (1–4), contributions of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are thought to occur via amplification of basilar membrane responses to frequency-specific sounds.  
Onto type II SGNs via glutamatergic synapses (5–11), OHCs also send information to the cochlear nucleus (CN).  
Compared to those between IHCs and type I SGNs (12,13), synapses between OHCs and type II SGNs that have been measured in young animals are relatively weak.  
The higher sound thresholds and likely poor frequency tuning in type II SGN responses compared to type I SGN responses are thought to be underlain by these synaptic differences.  
In responses to cochlear damage (14–16), type II SGNs are also implicated.  
From the superior olivary complex (SOC) in the ventral brainstem, the IHC and OHC regions also receive efferent innervation.  
In the SOC, lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons innervate peripheral processes of type I SGNs, while first onto IHCs (17–20) MOC neurons form a transient developmental synapse, then onto OHCs [Warr and Guinan (21), reviewed in Guinan (22)] they form large cholinergic synapses.  
By alpha9/alpha10 nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) that have a high calcium permeability, the OHC response to acetylcholine (ACh) release from MOC neurons is mediated.  
Gating SK or BK potassium channels results from calcium influx, causing a larger, longer-lasting efflux of potassium [reviewed in Fuchs and Lauer (23)].  
Hyperpolarization, which reduces OHC electromotility and thus reduces OHC-mediated contributions to the “cochlear amplifier” (24–29), is the net effect of MOC activity on OHCs.  
Shifting the operating point of the cochlea between louder and softer sounds to allow cochlear responses to salient sounds, protection of the cochlea against noise-evoked trauma, and auditory attention (30–39) are functions implicated in MOC inhibition of OHC activity.  
Including between MOC efferent neurons and OHCs and between OHCs and type II SGNs in the outer spiral bundle (OSB), the canonical cochlear circuitry described above is accompanied by additional synaptic connections described in histological and ultrastructural studies.  
Dendro-dendritic synapses between type II SGN dendrites, reciprocal synapses between OHCs and type II dendrites, synapses from the type II SGNs onto Hensen’s supporting cells, synaptic contacts between Deiters’ cells and afferent or efferent neurons, and direct synapses between MOC efferent neurons and type II SGN afferent neurons in the OSB (40–47) are included in these putative synapses.  
MOC efferent neuron synapses onto type I SGNs in the inner spiral bundle (ISB) (46) were also detected by more recent work.  
The developmental innervation patterns, neurotransmitter-mediated signaling, and ultimate function of these unique synaptic contacts, despite supporting anatomical evidence, have not been well characterized.  
Histological studies in multiple species, in addition to ultrastructural analyses, suggest that in olivocochlear efferents the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized.  
For the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and for GABA itself [reviewed in Kitcher et al. (48)], MOC efferent terminals have been shown to stain in particular.  
To MOC axon terminals as well as type I and II SGN somata and peripheral terminals (49,50), metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABABRs) have been localized.  
To OHCs (51,52) and type I and II SGNs (52), several subunits of ionotropic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) have also been localized.  
At MOC axon terminals where GABA release activates presynaptic autoreceptors to decrease ACh release onto OHCs and developing IHCs (49), GABABR function has been demonstrated at the single-cell level.  
While there are reports that OHC electromotility is affected by GABA, others suggest [reviewed in Kitcher et al. (48)] no direct action of GABA on OHCs.  
Hearing deficits and aberrant neuronal innervation (52) are exhibited by GABAAR knockout mice at the organismal level.  
The localization of GABAARs on MOC somata in the brainstem, however, confounds interpretation of these studies as systemic gene knockouts are likely also impacting central MOC function (53).  
Thus, the role of GABA in the cochlea is incompletely understood.  
Including whether GABA diffuses from efferent terminals in response to neuronal activity, and whether GABAARs function at synapses between MOC neurons and other cells, the present study seeks to understand aspects of GABA signaling in the cochlea that remain unclear.  
To establish GABA diffusion from MOC terminals to postsynaptic GABAARs in the cochlea, patch-clamp electrophysiology was combined with immunolabeling and optical detection of GABA.  
Throughout the study, participants on average reported moderate levels of menstrual pain and impairment of physical functioning and average levels of loneliness.  
Between all variables in the unadjusted model except for time one pain and loneliness (Time‐3), we observed significant bivariate correlations.  
Iron released from damaged oligodendrocytes further contributes to degeneration by generating free radicals that intensify oxidative stress.
This oxidative burden deepens neural injury and reflects the tight interaction between inflammation and cellular damage in MS.
Abnormal ion channel redistribution increases neuronal energy demands, but mitochondrial failure prevents meeting these needs, worsening injury and impairing signaling.
Glutamate excitotoxicity adds another layer of damage by causing excessive neuronal activation and calcium influx that triggers destructive cellular pathways.
The combined influence of immune-mediated and degenerative mechanisms drives the progressive neurological decline seen in MS.
B cells, CD8+ T cells, microglia, and astrocytes fuel inflammation, while mitochondrial damage, iron release, and glutamate toxicity produce direct neuronal harm.
Understanding these intersecting pathways highlights potential therapeutic targets aimed at reducing inflammation and protecting neurons.
