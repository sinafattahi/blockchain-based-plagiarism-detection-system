However, a few gene members, including theTtCBL1,TtCBL4,TtCBL5,TtCBL18, andTtCBL21, were predicted to hold only a single EF‐hand calcium‐binding structure.
The expression of various numbers of single EF‐hand‐containingTtCBLmembers suggested variation in affinity to calcium binding through this gene family and perhaps modification of its current regulatory role.
Notably, allTtCBLs shared high conservation of the EF‐hand motifs, underlining their role in specificity related to calcium signaling.
Further, the spatial distribution of these motifs within the different groups showed partial support for subcellular localization patterns and a role for specific stress.
For instance, some features in EF‐hand arrangement were noticed for proteins from Group 3, with both cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations, which might be responsible for the cross‐compartmental signal transduction.
Homology modeling of the 3D structures of the 23 TtCBL proteins indicated group‐specific changes in their structural features (Figure5).
All TtCBL proteins shared a common architecture corresponding to their established role as calcium sensors, characterized by a core structure that contains conserved EF‐hand calcium‐binding motifs.
These motifs were located at strategic positions for effective coordination with calcium ions, necessary in signal transduction.

Ligand‐binding regions (pocket sites) are marked in red on the structure.
The grouping of proteins is based on the results of phylogeny.
Phylogenetic groups were structurally diverse, mainly in EF‐hand motif arrangements and overall binding pocket configurations.
Overall, proteins within Groups 3 and 4 shared closely related structural features, which implied similar functional properties.
However, TtCBLs from Groups 1 and 2 displayed individual conformations that might refer to their specialized functions during calcium‐mediated signaling pathways.
A detailed analysis of the ligand‐binding pockets across the TtCBLs indicated differences in their size, shape, and composition, which are crucial for interaction specificity.
Among such amino acids, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, valine, and isoleucine are the most abundant (Figure6a).
Such amino acids often participate in important interactions that stabilize the interaction with ligands and are thus important for signal fidelity during abiotic stress responses.
Occurrence of amino acids located within the binding sites ofTriticum turgidumCBL (TtCBL) proteins (a).
The phosphorylation regions in TtCBLs for serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues across phylogenetic groups (b).
The spatial arrangements of the ligand‐binding pockets also vary between groups.
For instance, proteins of Group 3, associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, usually contain more expanded binding pockets that can potentially accommodate a wider spectrum of interaction partners.
At the same time, members of Group 1 contain more compact pockets and fit well with the predicted mitochondrial and chloroplastic localization while carrying specialized signaling functions.
Phosphorylation, a critical posttranslational modification, was predicted in all 23 TtCBL proteins to understand their regulatory roles in signal transduction pathways.
Using NetPhos 3.1, potential phosphorylation sites at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues were identified, which have been reported to be pivotal in protein activation and signaling under abiotic stresses.
Most of the targeted sites were found to belong to serine residues; the others corresponded to threonine and tyrosine in that order.
Most interestingly, TtCBL13 showed a profoundly greater number of phosphorylation events, as indicated on serine and threonine residues that were distributed along its sequence.
TtCBL1 in the third phylogenetic group is only phosphorylated at serine and threonine.
This might have therefore shown that it possesses some rigid regulatory role and has not much flexibility in its functioning compared with the other members of its group.
In other TtCBLs, phosphorylation is predicted in all three amino acids (Figure6b).
The distribution of phosphorylation sites differed among the phylogenetic groups.
Proteins in Groups 3 and 4 had the highest density of phosphorylation sites, consistent with their established roles in dynamic and stress‐responsive signaling pathways.
A more specialized signaling function was represented by a smaller number of phosphorylation sites within Group 1 proteins, the majority of which are localized in organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria.
The promoter ofTtCBLgenes was examined to identify the known regulatory elements, and based on their role, they were divided into three categories related to hormones, stress, and light and growth (Figure7).
In stress‐related elements, MYB motifs that respond to stress are the most abundant (Figure7a).
Among the stress response elements, two CREs, W‐box, and MBS, which are related to drought stress, were identified.
W‐boxcis‐element inTtCBL4in the second group and MBScis‐element inTtCBL13in the third group are more frequent.
Overall, CREs related to phytohormones were more abundantly distributed in the promoter ofTtCBLgenes (Figure7b).
It was found that the most CREs were related to hormones, among which the elements responsive to ABA and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) were the most frequent (Figure7c).
The high abundance of ABA‐ and drought‐related motifs, along with the presence of stress‐specific elements, underlines further the importance ofTtCBLgenes in mediating abiotic stress responses.
Furthermore, the multitude of CREs related to hormonal and environmental signaling pathways suggested thatTtCBLs function as integrators of multiple signals, which allow durum wheat to adapt to complex conditions of stress.

We further analyzed the RNA‐seq data to explore the expression patterns ofTtCBLgenes under abiotic stresses, including cold stress at 5°C and increased temperature at +2°C (Figure8).
This clearly showed that the transcriptional activities ofTtCBLgenes have changed significantly under abiotic stresses, indicating their stress‐responsive roles.
Among the upregulated genes in cold stress response,TtCBL10demonstrated very high induction due to cold stress, which could indicate that this gene has a potential role in the calcium‐mediated mechanism for cold adaptation.
A very high decrease in the level of theTtCBL6transcript suggested that it was little involved or negatively controlled in the cold stress condition.
Among upregulated genes in increased temperature response,TtCBL13showed the highest expression under high‐temperature treatment and thus may play a significant role in heat stress tolerance.
The downregulated genes includeTtCBL2, which was highly downregulated, indicating a contrasting regulatory role in the case of heat stress compared to cold conditions.
These expression patterns indicate functional diversity among theTtCBLgenes and suggest that some members may contribute more to the temperature stress response.

Expression analysis ofTtCBLsin root tissues subjected to drought stress and ABA treatment showed differential temporal regulation (Figure9).
Expression ofTtCBL2andTtCBL10was significantly induced within 1 h of stress atp< 0.05, which continued to be upregulated until 72 h. Application of ABA increased their expression at all tested points, which shows the involvement of ABA in the enhancement of drought responsiveness.TtCBL12transcript was significantly enhanced 24 h after the drought stress treatment.
Application of ABA further enhanced its transcription at 24 and 72 h after drought stress (p< 0.05), suggesting it may contribute to ABA‐mediated stress adaptation.
The expression ofTtCBL19gene was induced at 24 and 72 h after drought stress.
This gene further showed increased expression with ABA treatment under all conditions, indicating that it may be involved in long‐term stress responses.

D1, D24, and D72 are shown the drought stress after 1, 24 and 72 h, respectively.
The asterisk above each column indicates a significant difference (p‐value < 0.05) with the control.
The expression ofTtCBLgenes in shoot tissues was dynamically regulated, as opposed to root tissues (Figure9).TtCBL2gene was induced by short‐term drought treatment at 1 and 24 h and was strongly downregulated after 72 h (p< 0.05); its expression was induced by the ABA treatment under a control condition but then reduced at 24 and 72 h of drought stress, suggesting a tissue‐specific control.TtCBL12expression was significantly enhanced only after 72 h of drought stress and did not respond effectively to ABA application, indicating its late response in the shoot tissues.TtCBL19gene demonstrated complex expression patterns, with highly transcribed conditions at 1 and 24 h after drought stress; by 72 h it decreased.
ABA application highly enhanced its expressions after drought stress, with massive accumulations 1 and 72 h after drought stress (p< 0.05).
The interaction network showed that there is a strong connection between signal transduction and phosphorylation pathways and TtCBL (Figure10).
For example, CIPKs involved in signal transduction pathways dependent on cytosolic calcium changes showed the highest number of interactions with TtCBLs.
In addition, a strong interaction was observed between TtCBLs and potassium transporters such as HAK5, SOS1, and AKT1.
These results show that TtCBLs are involved in the response to salinity and drought stress.
Besides, GO enrichment analysis was performed to determine the biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular component terms significantly linked with the TtCBL network nodes (TableS4).
The molecular function terms, including protein serine/threonine kinase activity, ion/calcium/ATP binding, and catalytic activity, were significantly linked with the TtCBL network.
The cellular component terms, such as vacuole, cytoplasm, and cellular anatomical entity, were significantly enriched.
In addition, several biological process terms, including signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, calcium‐mediated signaling, and potassium ion transmembrane transporter, were strongly linked with the TtCBL network.
The interaction network revealed that TtCBLs cooperate in ion binding and signal transduction with other key stress response factors.

The significant gene ontology (GO) terms are provided in TableS4.
The CBLs are pivotal calcium sensors that decode calcium signals into adaptive physiological and developmental responses in plants (Jiang et al.,2020; Sanyal et al.,2020; Tang et al.,2020; Tong et al.,2021).
In this context, durum wheat has emerged as a nutritionally rich, stress‐resilient crop of global significance (Maccaferri et al.,2019).
Drought severely affects durum wheat by reducing the height of the plant, number of tillers, leaf area, and chlorophyll content, all of which are essential factors in growth and photosynthesis.
It also lowers grain yield and the number of grains per spike, ultimately compromising productivity.
These factors make it difficult to cultivate wheat in regions with low water availability.
Some durum genotypes are less affected by increased water content and have better photosynthetic efficiency during stress.
This difference is helpful in breeding programs (De Santis et al.,2021; Pour‐Aboughadareh et al.,2020).
These observations emphasize the power of choosing a set of characteristics to breed drought‐resistant varieties in support of food security and sustainable agriculture in areas prone to drought.
A total of 23TtCBLgenes identified in durum wheat underscore both the evolutionary conservation and functional complexity of this gene family.
In contrast to the 10CBLgenes reported in diploid species such as A.thalianaandO.
sativa(Kanwar et al.,2014; Kolukisaoglu et al.,2004), polyploid crops like durum and bread wheat possess largerCBLgene families, suggesting expansion associated with increased functional demand for stress adaptation.
For instance, bread wheat contains 24CBLs across its A, B, and D sub‐genomes (T. Sun et al.,2015), while diploid barley (H. vulgare) and rice harbor only 10CBLs each (Jiang et al.,2020).
Interestingly, comparative evolutionary analysis suggests that the number ofCBLgenes is not directly correlated with genome size across species (Mohanta et al.,2015).
Comprehensive in silico analyses were executed on the members of theTtCBLgene family.
The analysis of their phylogeny indicated that these TtCBLs were to fall into four phylogenetic clusters.
Gene duplication has generally been considered one of the major sources of genetic novelty that may give rise to new genes, which subsequently evolve to fulfill new functions useful for crop improvement (Du et al.,2023).
Segmental duplication events have been considered one of the major driving forces for evolutionary expansions of theTtCBLgene family in durum wheat.
However, analysis of the Ka/Ks ratio indicates that duplicatedTtCBLshave undergone negative selection.
It has previously been demonstrated that proteins of theCBLfamily are localized in diverse cellular regions such as cytoplasm, nucleus, plasma membrane, and vacuole (Sanyal et al.,2015).
However, for durum wheat, our predictions indicate that TtCBL proteins localize mainly to the cytosol, chloroplast, nucleus, and mitochondria.
This difference in localization could be due to species‐specific functional diversification or adaptation toward different signaling environments in plant cells.
Localization is regulated by several factors like pI, structural motifs, and signaling peptides (Kiraga et al.,2007; Tokmakov et al.,2021).
For example, it has been found that cytoplasmic proteins showed distinct clustering at pI5.0–6.0 (Schwartz et al.,2001).
Several studies suggested that discrete pKa values for various amino acids may underlie pImultimodality in various proteomes (Garcia‐Moreno,2009; Kozlowski,2021; Wu et al.,2006).
Future studies can study pIdynamics under different cellular states, for example, under stressed conditions, to further elucidate these interactions.
To study theTtCBLgenes, we figured out where the exons and introns are based on the genetic information from durum wheat.TtCBLgenes have exons that range from seven to nine.
AmongTtCBLgenes, the most common structure has eight exons.
Furthermore, in 15 different grass species, the majority ofCBLgenes contain seven introns (Jiang et al.,2020).
A unique feature of CBLs is that their first EF‐hand domain contains 14 amino acids, whereas in other Ca2+sensors, this domain contains only 12 amino acids (Beckmann et al.,2016).
The proteins exhibited a fluctuation in the number of EF‐hand domains, with counts ranging from one to six (Day et al.,2002).
Investigation of TtCBL peptide sequences showed that most of the CBL proteins inT.turgidumcontained two EF‐hand domains.
The conserved structural features and domain organization of the TtCBLs point toward their evolutionary importance concerning calcium‐mediated stress signaling.
Differences in the arrangements of EF‐hand motifs, exon–intron structures, and the structural features of the ligand‐binding pocket suggest that the TtCBLs are fine‐tuned toward the mediation of stress‐specific responses, including drought and salinity tolerance.
The GRAVY index quantifies protein hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity based on amino acid sequences, taking into account protein charge and size, with scores ranging from negative to positive (Kyte & Doolittle,1982; Rafique & Nasrullah,2020).
The positive score indicates hydrophobicity, and the most hydrophobic proteins are intrinsic plasma membrane proteins (Rafique & Nasrullah,2020; Rustagi et al.,2023).
Proteins with negative values of GRAVY are highly hydrophilic, and this renders them more soluble in aqueous solutions.
Such hydrophilicity is crucial to their biological activity and interactions (Dunker et al.,2001; Jault et al.,2013; Polańska et al.,2024; H. Wang et al.,2021).
The GRAVY index for protein hydrophobicity revealed that the majority of TtCBLs are hydrophilic, and such a property could contribute toward increasing their aqueous cellular environment solubility and interaction propensity (Kyte & Doolittle,1982; Rafique & Nasrullah,2020).
This resonates with LEA proteins, which have a strong hydrophilic tendency and are responsible for drought stress tolerance due to their protective roles (Li et al.,2018).
Phosphorylation, one of the key posttranslational modifications, mediates plant stress responses by regulating signaling pathways, such as those of the CBL‐CIPK module (Song et al.,2022;Zhang et al.,2025).
Differential phosphorylation capacities among TtCBL proteins are revealed by our analysis, with TtCBL13 holding the top position, indicating that they have a key function in stress signal transmission.
The patterns indicate a complex mechanism for stress adaptation in durum wheat based on calcium.
TtCBLpromoters containcis‐regulatory factors such as ABA‐responsive motifs (ABRE), MeJA‐response motifs (TGACG‐motif), salicylic acid, auxin, and gibberellin (GA).
What deserves particular mention are the MYB and W‐box abundant motifs, which point to their possible contribution toward abiotic stress responses.
For example, the promoters ofTtCBL2andTtCBL10showed a lot of elements that respond to stress and hormones, suggesting they are involved in how plants deal with drought and ABA signaling.
Under drought and high‐salinity stress conditions, plants have two pathways: ABA‐independent and ABA‐dependent.
ABA‐dependent pathways induce the expression of stress‐response genes by activating the AREB/ABF transcription factors.
In contrast, the ABA‐independent pathways involved in stress‐related transcription factors, including MYB, MYC, NAC, and WRKY, bind tocis‐elements associated with stress response genes and ABA, leading to stress‐related protein expression.(Singh & Laxmi,2015).
These proteins include various functional classes, including osmoprotectants (e.g., LEA proteins), antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD, APX, CAT), and other stress‐responsive factors like chaperones, dehydrins, and ion transporters (Kaur et al.,2014; Szlachtowska & Rurek,2023; Vaseva et al.,2012).
CBLs regulate ABA‐dependent and ABA‐independent ABA‐signaling pathways during drought stress by interacting with CIPKs (Kaya et al.,2024; Ma et al.,2020).
For instance, the CBL1/9‐CIPK1 module inArabidopsisdownregulates drought stress through phosphorylation of the PYLs ABA receptor (You et al.,2023).
The combined effects of drought stress and ABA‐induced expression patterns ofTtCBLs show thatTtCBLs may play different roles at different times, in different tissues, and through different pathways to help plants adapt to stress.
These results also reflect the functional diversities ofTtCBLs in drought signaling and their potential to engineer enhanced drought tolerance in plants.
Both root and shoot tissues consistently documented the induction ofTtCBL2under drought stress.
TheTtCBL2gene's induction, synergistically brought about by ABA in the roots, underlines its important role in the ABA‐dependent signaling network responsible for drought responses (Figure11).
StrongTtCBL2activation shortly after drought stress starts indicates that it plays an early role in how shoots respond to stress.
The gene may function in ABA‐dependent and ABA‐independent pathways; such dual regulation underlines its versatility in responding to stress.
It is therefore considered a good candidate for genetic engineering in the improvement of drought tolerance, as its activity in early responses to stress and sustained signaling has been confirmed.
Predicted roles ofTriticum turgidumCBL (TtCBL) genes in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways based on tissue‐specific expression profiles under drought and ABA treatments.
TtCBL10is mainly expressed in the roots and is significantly induced under drought stress.
Moreover, ABA treatment further enhanced this drought‐induced induction, firmly positioning it as a contributor to root‐specific ABA‐dependent pathways.
The evidence suggests that the strong influence of ABA on transcription in the present study assigns the gene to the group of ABA‐dependent genes and underlines its critical importance for root‐mediated drought responses.
TtCBL12shows late but prominent upregulation, especially in roots, and increases even more when ABA is applied to them (Figure11).TtCBL19is expressed in a complicated way, showing higher levels of transcription in both roots and shoots, particularly during extended drought stress.TtCBL19is complexly expressed, showing a transcriptional increase in roots and shoots, especially under prolonged drought stress.TtCBL19is likely an integrator of signals emanating from ABA‐dependent and ABA‐independent pathways; hence, it serves as a cross‐talk hub in calcium signaling.
Its responsiveness to both ABA and drought stress in different tissues raises its potential for broad‐spectrum stress tolerance.
The patterns ofTtCBL2,TtCBL10,TtCBL12, andTtCBL19in different tissues and over time during drought and ABA treatment show that they work together in a system that includes both ABA‐dependent and independent pathways, suggesting they could be specifically improved for better drought tolerance.
Despite these findings, the present work heavily depends on in silico predictions and transcriptional profiling.
To confirm howTtCBLs help wheat adapt to salt and heat stress, future studies will need to include gene knockout/overexpression and interaction tests with the CIPKs.
Future studies on salt and heat stress would help confirm howTtCBLs can be used to create wheat varieties that can handle multiple stresses.
To outline an ontological approach to hermeneutic data analysis that stresses the need to grasp patients' experiences through careful qualitative exploration.
We use existential lifeworld caring theory together with hermeneutic ontology to shape situational dialogue, guide data gathering, and inform empirical research practice.
This method is organised into three successive analytic phases designed to faithfully convey patients' views of their lifeworld experiences and conditions.
These three phases show that grasping a patient’s experiences depends on the themes they raise in dialogue and the manner in which they articulate them.
The next phase centres on what the informant is discussing, determining what they find most meaningful, and examining how these topics relate to their past, present, and future circumstances.
The final phase directs attention to how the informant describes concrete experiences and how these relate to what is discussed and the way it is expressed.
We propose an ontological approach to hermeneutic data collection and a three-step analytical process that enhances the transparency of hermeneutic interpretation.
