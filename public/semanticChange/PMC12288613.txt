The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in animals, particularly the spread of multidrug‐resistant Enterobacterales, poses a significant zoonotic and public health risk.
The aim of this study was to investigate extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL), carbapenem and colistin resistance among Enterobacterales in faecal swabs of dairy cattle.
A total of 400 samples were cultured on Mac Conkey screening media for ESBL, carbapenem and colistin resistance.
The grown Enterobacterales were identified by MALDI‐TOF‐MS, followed by ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime resistance and double disk synergy.
ESBL resistance genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing.
Bacteria grown on colistin screening media were investigated for colistin resistance by EUCAST microbroth dilution method.
A total of 89 (22.25%) of the bacteria grown from 400 samples were identified as potential ESBL‐producing Enterobacterales members.
A number of 53 (59.5%) of them were identified as ESBLblaCTX‐Mas a result of PCR, and 10 of them were identified asblaCTX‐M‐15/28/36/66as a result of sequencing.
None of the samples cultured on carbapenem medium grew.
A total of 18 samples grown in colistin medium were found to be colistin sensitive by broth microdilution.
Genotypes were not included in the study.
All isolated bacteria were identified asEscherichia coli.
In this study,blaCTX‐M‐15and its derivatives, which are common in humans, were also found to be the predominant ESBL type in animals.
Monitoring resistance in animals together with resistance in human infections may provide more important data on the spread of resistance.
This study reveals the presence ofblaCTX‐M‐type ESBL‐producingE.
coliin dairy cattle in Turkey, highlighting the zoonotic potential of antimicrobial resistance.
No carbapenem or colistin resistance was detected.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious global threat to both human and animal health.
Resistant bacteria relevant to human health can emerge in farm animals; therefore, active surveillance in food‐producing animals is also essential.
The impact of AMR observed in animals used for food production on public health is being addressed globally through the One Health approach (Lin et al.2022).
The European Food Safety Association (EFSA) has recognized foodborne AMR as a ‘biohazard’ (EFSA2012).
Members of Enterobacterales are widely abundant in nature.
They are responsible for 80% of the diseases caused by Gram‐negative rods such as gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, meningitis, endotoxic shock and sepsis (Murray et al.2016).
β‐Lactam group antibiotics are the most widely used antibiotic group due to their high selective toxicity, broad spectrum, low side effects, use in all age groups and high distribution in body fluids.
β‐Lactam group antibiotics are also widely used in the treatment of animal infections (Dağlar and Öngüt2012).
Colistin is an antimicrobial agent effective against multidrug‐resistant Gram‐negative bacteria (Donnenberg2016).
In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified colistin as a critically important drug for microbial therapy (WHO2016).
Carbapenem‐resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are a group of Gram‐negative bacteria that have become resistant to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics that are last‐line therapy for many serious infections (Jin et al.2018).
CRE can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities.
However, it is increasingly becoming more abundant in environments and among recently hospitalized or non‐hospitalized people and farm animals (Tuhamize and Bazira2024).
The emergence of CRE in these various settings has raised concerns about the rapid spread of these multidrug‐resistant pathogens (Zaidi et al.2023).
The one‐medicine approach is of particular importance for microbiology as a unifying discipline linking health between humans, animals and the environment.
Given that more than 60% of infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of an infectious agent from animals, the use of a systematic single‐medicine approach has great potential to reduce global health threats from infectious diseases (Atlas et al.2010).
Within this scope of single‐medicine approach, in our study, we aimed to investigate extended‐spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL), carbapenem and colistin‐resistant bacteria belonging to the Enterobacterales order in the faecal microbiota of cattle, which pose a threat to public health, and to determine phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles for the resistant strains.
We think that our study will provide an important cross section of the current resistance situation in farm animals by evaluating ESBL carbapenem and colistin resistance analysis.
Samples were collected from various farms in Istanbul and Izmir.
A total of 400 samples were included in the study.
Samples taken from faecal swabs of fattening animals were placed in Carry‐Blair transport medium.
They were kept at 2–8°C and studied within 24 h (Nagata et al.2019).
A total of 400 lactating cows from various commercial dairy farms located in the Marmara Region of Türkiye were included in the study.
All animals enrolled in the study were of the Holstein‐Friesian breed and were raised under standard commercial dairy farming conditions, including regular milking and routine veterinary supervision.
The cows were in mid‐lactation and ranged in age from 3 to 8 years.
At the time of the study, all animals were clinically healthy and actively involved in commercial milk production.
According to farm records, none of the animals had received antibiotic treatment within the 3 months prior to the study, minimizing the potential influence of recent antimicrobial exposure on the results.
Samples were incubated in Mac Conkey Agar (Biolab, Hungary) screening medium containing 1 µg/mL ceftriaxone and Mac Conkey Agar screening medium containing 2 µg/mL colistin sulphate at 37°C for 18–24 h. After incubation, colonies grown on Mac Conkey Agar screening medium containing 1 µg/mL ceftriaxone were identified as potential producing Enterobacterales members, whereas bacteria grown on Mac Conkey screening medium containing 2 µg/mL colistin were identified as potential colistin‐resistant Enterobacterales members (Sow et al.2024; Anyanwu et al.2021; M'Zali et al.2000).
All isolated bacteria were identified by MALDI‐TOF MS (Bruker, Germany).
For phenotypic determination of ESBL resistance, the following steps were followed: Double Disk Synergy method was performed on Mueller Hinton agar (HiMedia, India) medium using Ceftriaxone (30 µg/mL Bioanalyse, TR), Ceftazidime (30 µg/mL Bioanalyse, TR), Cefotaxime (30 µg/mL Bioanalyse, TR) and Amoxicillin–Clavulanic acid (30 µg/mL Bioanalyse, TR) disks (M'Zali et al.2000).
After incubation at 37°C for 18–24 h, resistant strains were determined according to EUCAST standards (EUCAST2024).
For phenotypic determination of colistin resistance, the following steps were followed: Colonies grown on colistin screening medium were studied as potential colistin‐resistant colonies by broth microdilution method according to EUCAST standards.
In addition, antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method using colistin (10 µg/mL Bioanalyse, TR) disks.
It was planned to confirm the carbapenem resistance of Enterobacterales member bacteria grown in the carbapenem screening test with meropenem (30 µg/mL Bioanalyse, TR) disk and to carbapenemase by CIM (Carbapenem Inactivation Method) and genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method when found positive.
All strains were transferred to 1 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 10% glycerol tryptic soy broth (HiMedia, India) and stored at −20°C.
Stock strains were removed from −20°C and brought to room temperature.
They were inoculated on Mueller Hinton agar medium and incubated at 37°C for 18–24 h. The strains were inoculated on biochemical identification media and chromogenic agar (Chromagar UTI HiMedia, India) to confirm that stocks do not contain any contamination.
ESBL‐resistantEscherichia colistrains were analysed by PCR to detectblaCTX‐M‐encoding genes.BlaCTX‐Mresistance gene was studied because it is the most common, virulent and highly antibiotic‐resistant group (D'Andrea et al.2013; Clermont et al.2008).
16s rRNA was also used as an internal control to exclude false negative results due to PCR inhibition, and negative controls were included in each PCR setup to exclude false positive results due to cross‐contamination.
Amplifications were performed using primers listed in Table1(Chen et al.2004; Kuskucu et al.2016).
Sanger sequence analysis was performed among selected ESBL‐resistant bacteria.
Sanger Sequence Analysis: ForblaCTX‐Mgene region research; PCR products were purified with ExoSAP‐IT (Thermo Scientific, USA) as the first step.
In the second step, ‘Big Dye reaction mix’ (Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for ‘cycle sequencing’.
Finally, column formation and purification were performed with Sephadex (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, Missouri, United States).
The purified PCR products were loaded into a genetic analyser (ABI 3130GA).
The results were compared with NCBI.
A total of 10blaCTX‐Misolates with similar resistance profiles were selected from each farm and sequenced.
Of the 400 samples grown on screening medium, 89 (22.25%) were identified as potentially ESBL‐resistant Enterobacterales.
Of the 400 samples cultured on colistin screening medium, 18 (4.5%) were identified as potentially colistin resistant.
None of the samples cultured on carbapenem screening medium grew.
All bacteria grown on ESBL and colistin screening media were identified asE.
Antibiotic susceptibilities of ESBL‐suspected strains were determined by Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method, and ESBL production was phenotypically confirmed by double disk synergy method.
All strains were resistant to Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime and Cefotaxime.
Phenotypic colistin confirmation was performed by broth microdilution method on 18 potentially colistin‐resistantE.
colistrains isolated.
All strains were found to be susceptible below colistin MIC ≤ 2 µg/mL.
Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method revealed that all isolates had colistin zone diameter >15 mm.
As all isolates were found to be colistin sensitive, they were not included in the genotypic study.
β‐Lactamase genes carried by the 89 strains found to produce ESBLblaCTX‐Mwere analysed.
It was observed that 53 (59.5%) of the samples carried theblaCTXMgene.

ESBLblaCTX‐Mresistance genes were identified by Sanger sequencing of 10 selectedblaCTX‐Mpositive samples.
Accordingly, two of these genes were identified asblaCTX‐M‐15, 4as blaCTX‐M‐28, 3 asblaCTX‐M‐36and 1 asblaCTXM‐66.
All identified resistance genes are inblaCTX‐Mgroup 1.
In our study, ESBL‐resistantE.
coliwas isolated from 89 (22.25%) of 400 faecal swabs collected from fattening animals.
Of the isolated strains, 53 (59.5%) hadblaCTX‐Mgene.
DNA sequence analysis of 10 selectedblaCTX‐Mstrainsrevealed that2 of them had blaCTX‐M‐15,4 had blaCTX‐M‐28, 2 hadblaCTX‐M‐36,and 2 had blaCTX‐M‐66gene type.
All identified resistance genes were inblaCTX‐Mgroup 1.
The clinically importantblaCTX‐M‐15origin was detected in both Marmara and Aegean regions.
In addition, no colistin‐ and carbapenem‐resistant Enterobacterales member bacteria were found in any of the 400 swab samples.
When the studies conducted were examined, it was observed that the rates of ESBL bacteria in livestock increased every year.
EspeciallyblaCTX‐Mgene has been observed to spread rapidly in the world (Doerr et al.2023).
In our study,E.
coliwas isolated from the faeces of dairy cattle.E.
coliis an important Gram‐negative bacterium that typically resides harmlessly in the intestinal tract of animals; however, it has the capacity to rapidly acquire antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer.
This ability contributes to the emergence of multidrug‐resistant strains, which significantly complicates infection treatment and clinical management (Narwal et al.2025).
According to the WHO Antimicrobial Consumption (AMC) Network Working Group, Turkey ranks first among OECD (Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development) countries in terms of human antibiotic consumption, with 35.7 DID (Defined Daily Dose per 1000 inhabitants per day) (T:C sağlık bakanlığı 2024).
Although data on antibiotic use in food‐producing animals in Turkey are quite limited, the country ranks among the top in Europe with a reported usage of 69 mg/PCU (Population Correction Unit).
In comparison, this figure is 69.9 mg/PCU in Germany, 25.7 mg/PCU in the United Kingdom and 2.1 mg/PCU in Norway (European Medicines Agency2022).
In a study conducted in China in 2020 in bovine mastitis,blaCTX‐M‐28andblaCTX‐M‐66genes were isolated (Shafiq et al.2021).
In addition, in a study conducted in China in 2012,blaCTX‐M‐28andblaCTX‐M‐36genes were isolated inE.
coliof human and swine origin.
These studies are similar to our study (Tian et al.2012).
According to a study conducted in Bavaria, Germany in 2022, 27 (22.5%) of 120 faecal samples from cattle on a farm were found to be ESBL resistant.
It was reported that 26 (96.2%) of the ESBL‐resistant strains had theblaCTX‐M(CTX‐M‐1andCTX‐M‐15) gene.
It was observed that this study had a very similar resistance rate with our study (Homeier‐Bachmann et al.2022).
In a comprehensive study conducted in Canada, France and Germany in 2019 from various host types (clinical human, healthy and sick animals, meat and wastewater),blaCTX‐Mresistance genes were found to beblaCTX‐M‐1/14/15genes.
Although the differences with theblaCTX‐Mgene types in our study are explained by geographical differences, the similarities inblaCTX‐Mgene types are also similar to our study (Zamudio et al.2024).
According to a multicentre surveillance study conducted in Europe in 2021, 31% of 99 (3.3%) ESBL‐resistantE.
colistrains isolated from 2993 samples of cattle, chicken and pig faeces in various slaughterhouses were found to have theblaCTX‐M(CTX‐M‐1/‐2/‐14/‐15 gene.
When compared with our study, it was observed that the rate ofblaCTX‐Mgene was quite similar.
The spread of theblaCTX‐M‐15gene was similar.
The differences in ESBL resistance gene types and rates can be explained by geographical location and clonal spread (Ewers et al.2021).
Studies on ESBL types and prevalence in bovine livestock are limited in our country.
Our team was the first to study ESBL resistance in livestock in the veterinary field in our country (Kucukbasmacı2008).
In our 2008 study,blaTEMandbla SHVwere prevalent, whereas in our current study,blaCTX‐Mwas prevalent.
