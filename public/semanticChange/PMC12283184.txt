Clinical reasoning skills are essential to medical practice.
Team‐based learning (TBL) using key‐feature questions provides students an opportunity to explicitly practice clinical reasoning skills with peers.
Understanding student experiences with this learning strategy may provide insights into optimizing learning experiences that foster clinical reasoning in preparation for the care of future patients.
A descriptive qualitative design explored third‐year medical students' experiences of a clinical reasoning‐focused virtual TBL session.
Six focus groups involving 26 third‐year medical students were conducted; audio recordings were transcribed verbatim.
Themes were generated from analysed codes, drawing connections between common thoughts, processes and conditions experienced by participants.
Data were verified, upholding principles of qualitative rigour to assure methodological credibility, transferability, confirmability and reflexivity.
Data analysis revealed five themes: (a)self‐confidence, including enabling and deterring factors and peer calibration; (b)co‐learning with peers, with students identifying knowledge gaps and gaining experience establishing consensus; (c)trust, as related to sense and position of authority; (d)clinical reasoning strategiesarticulated by students and integrating peer feedback; and (e)clinical application, as a parallel to real‐life patients involving choosing wisely and commitment to decisions.
Students' perspectives on the clinical reasoning process were greatly impacted by clinical experience, including lack thereof.
Their peer‐to‐peer experience highlights the power of social learning and trusting relationships on students' professional identity formation.
How students translate learning from the classroom to authentic clinical encounters requires further study.
Clinical reasoning is critical to the practice of medicine [1], involving both thinking through problems and decision‐making.
It can be broadly defined as the process that clinicians use to arrive at an initial or working diagnosis, through synthesis and interpretation of information gathered from history, physical examination and initial investigations [2], although a universal definition is not established [3,4,5].
In practice, clinical reasoning is nuanced [6,7], an iterative process, with component refinement and hypothesis stratification that occur with acquisition of new information [3], and takes into account factors including context and previous experience or expertise [4].
The learning of clinical reasoning is often assumed to take place during clinical rotations, by caring for patients and observing mentors [8].
Given its complexity, teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning and associated decision‐making have been challenging areas to research.
The learning of clinical reasoning is often assumed to take place during clinical rotations, by caring for patients and observing mentors.
Key‐feature questions (KFQs) are one strategy for assessing clinical reasoning; these questions focus on key features, or significant steps in problem resolution, and may involve a difficult aspect of the problem or steps in which students are most likely to make errors [9,10].
KFQs were included in the Medical Council of Canada's Qualifying Examination Part 1 from 1992 to 2024.
Previous literature demonstrates KFQs to be reliable and valid in measuring the construct of clinical reasoning [11].
Considering the foundational importance of supporting learner growth in the development of clinical reasoning, a formative team‐based learning (TBL) session focusing on these skills has been incorporated within the paediatric clerkship at our institution since 2017; its development and outcomes have been previously described by our team [12].
TBL is an active learning strategy that is learner centred and instructor directed, shown to improve both factual and conceptual knowledge, both of which are required as students develop clinical reasoning [13].
Clinical case discussions are also an effective means of fostering clinical reasoning skills in undergraduate medical students [14].
Our previous observational study demonstrated TBL using KFQs correlated with other summative clerkship assessments and improved clinical reasoning performance after group learning [12].
Whereby think‐aloud activities are established strategies to study human thought processes [15], understanding the student experience of group discussion in TBL and the interplay with their individual clinical reasoning processes remains a gap.
Better understanding the experience of novice students co‐navigating formative clinical reasoning activities may help educators develop deliberate educational strategies.
TBL group discussions among students, where students articulate their clinical reasoning and decision‐making processes to their peers to reach group consensus, provide a unique opportunity to explore their thought processes.
This study builds on the findings of our previous validity evidence [12], shifting focus to the examination of group discussions from the lens of the student.
Our research question was as follows: What do team‐based learning discussions between paediatric clerkship students reveal about their clinical decision‐making thought processes?
The primary objective was to explore paediatric clerkship students' experiences of a KFQ‐based TBL session and its perceived impact on their development of clinical reasoning.
The secondary objective was to explore what factors students describe as influencing their clinical reasoning.
Better understanding the experience of novice students co‐navigating formative clinical reasoning activities may help educators develop deliberate educational strategies.
The MD program at our Canadian institution is structured with 2 years of preclinical learning, followed by 2 years of clerkship experiences.
During clerkships, students encounter patients in various clinical settings, where learning and application of clinical reasoning are presumed to take place.
The paediatric clerkship is an 8‐week mandatory clinical rotation during the third year of the MD program, among other core rotations (family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, surgery and obstetrics/gynaecology).
During the paediatric clerkship, students' clinical experiences include inpatients, outpatients, emergency department shifts and newborn care.
One day per week is dedicated to teaching sessions supplementing students' clinical learning; these involve classroom‐based clinically focused teaching and small group sessions for simulation, procedural skills, reflective practice and evidence‐based medicine.
When this study was conducted, all classroom sessions, including TBL sessions, were held online because of the COVID‐19 pandemic.
Procedural skills, simulation sessions and direct patient care clinical experiences remained in person.
Our modified TBL session that employs KFQs to focus on clinical reasoning aspects of cases is included within this weekly curriculum, as previously described [12].
The TBL session occurs once per rotation and involves six clinical scenarios, each with two to four associated KFQs to focus on clinical decision‐making (see Appendix1for scenario blueprint).
Students first work through the cases independently during an Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT), committing to their decision‐making and responses.
This is followed by completion of a Group Readiness Assurance Test (GRAT) using the same six scenarios in small groups of four to five students, requiring group consensus.
Finally, a facilitated discussion (KLF and JLF) takes place, articulating the key features of each item and discussing the rationale and reasoning for correct responses, along with discussion points regarding alternate or incorrect responses.
This provides real‐time feedback to students and provides an opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification.
Facilitators also highlight relevant content‐specific information for students' learning.
The structure, timing and flow of our 2‐h session are depicted in Figure1.

A descriptive qualitative design was used to explore processes during TBL discussions among paediatric clerkship students.
Given the exploratory nature of this research, our goal was to understand the core social processes and decision‐making related to the phenomena being studied [15].
Descriptive accounts of the participants and their lived experiences allowed for an in‐depth exploration of the participants' perspectives related to clinical reasoning.
A descriptive qualitative design was used to explore processes during TBL discussions among paediatric clerkship students to understand the core social processes and decision‐making.
A total of six focus groups were conducted using theoretical sampling.
Twenty‐six students were recruited in their third‐year clerkship at a large research‐intensive university completing their paediatric rotation in the 2021–2022 academic year, beginning in September 2021.
Depending on their third‐year rotation sequence, students' prior clinical experiences varied at the time of participation in this study.
The TBL session is a mandatory teaching session during the paediatric clerkship; all students were required to participate in the session, but participation in this research study was voluntary.
Before the session, students were informed of and invited to participate in focus groups; these took place 1–2 weeks after the TBL session.
Focus groups were conducted over Zoom, involved four to five participants each and lasted approximately 60 min.
The research team did not have access to TBL group lists; therefore, overlap between focus group participants and TBL group members was possible.
Focus groups were led by research team members (N.M.
who intentionally were not involved with session teaching or facilitation to encourage honesty [16].
The focus group guide (Appendix2) was developed based on concepts related to clinical reasoning and peer teaching, as described in the literature.
Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed.
This study was approved by the University's Research Ethics Board (Pro00111295).
The transcripts of the focus groups were completed using automated transcription services and verified for accuracy (N.M.
), then analysed by the four members of the research team (three clinicians and one qualitative expert).
The analysis utilized an iterative process where data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously [17].
Through coding, we identified key conceptual areas and themes.
Initially, open coding was used to break down the data into discrete segments to identify, describe and categorize the common themes throughout the transcriptions.
These codes were then analysed to draw connections between the common thoughts, processes and conditions that were experienced by the medical students.
Results were analysed and re‐analysed until no new codes were identified and saturation was achieved [17].
Our team consists of two clinician educators, a senior paediatric resident physician and a qualitative researcher.
We acknowledge our lived experiences, particularly as related to our interpretation and analysis of this work.
To ensure trustworthiness, we verified interpretations using the following strategies: (a) regular meetings to discuss emergent findings; (b) recording (‘memo’‐ing) our reactions to the data, noting ideas related to findings; (c) upholding principles of qualitative rigour to assure methodological credibility, transferability and confirmability; and (d) throughout this study, the authors engaged in reflexivity to critically examine their own assumptions and ensure that their interpretations remain as objective as possible, striving to authentically represent the voices and experiences of the participants.
This was critical in minimizing researcher predisposed biases and ensuring that the findings were authentically represented [18].
From our analysis, five themes emerged from the data as related to our study objectives: self‐confidence, co‐learning with peers, trust, clinical reasoning strategies and clinical application.
Each theme consisted of two to four related subthemes.
These are outlined in Table1along with exemplar quotes sampled from different participants and focus groups, capturing the essence of each theme.

Students describeself‐confidenceas central to their experiences in the TBL session.
They described bothenablers to self‐confidence, such as making a commitment and external validation, anddeterrents to self‐confidence, including second guessing, self‐doubt, feeling exposed and discomfort with uncertainty.
I think you can feel a bit exposed when you are asked to share your clinical opinions on cases that can feel kind of real, because you are being asked to make real decisions.
And so, when you are in this group setting, being asked to share your thoughts … … it can just make you question your abilities as a medical student, and whether or not you are actually going to be able to make it as a physician.
It's also comforting, knowing that, like, there's students around you who are kind of feeling the same, but at the same time, you still have to share your thoughts, and you still have to … justify why you feel a certain way.
And that can be very intimidating(Focus Group 1, Participant 1).
Calibration with peershad the impact of being both an enabler and a deterrent to self‐confidence.
Calibration refers to students seeing how confident they feel compared to their peers, the knowledge and experience they may have with respect to their peers and reflecting on how far off they feel from normative performance.
Participants expressed how the IRAT requires commitment to an answer, requiring them to trust their own knowledge and clinical reasoning.
Learning how their colleagues answered questions during GRAT discussions enabled participants to calibrate with their peers, which could either positively or negatively impact their self‐confidence.
Students spoke of how this provided external validation that they were correct and led to an increased self‐confidence.
However, when there were discrepant answers among the group members, this could create a breakdown in self‐confidence, causing self‐doubt and second guessing of their knowledge.
I would say that I did not really have the confidence until the review at the end.
And then I was like, okay, that's what I thought individually.
And then this is what we thought as a group, and then this is what the answer is actually supposed to be.
And I was like, oh, I should have been more confident or not so confident, depending on different questions.
(Focus Group 1, Participant 4).
Unique aspects ofco‐learning with peersand the impact on their own personal learning and growth were described by our student participants.
Co‐learning reflects the learning that takes place by working through cases alongside their peers and encompasses the social dynamics of the group learning process.
In consideration of their limited clinical experiences, TBL provided students the opportunity toidentify knowledge gapsand enabled them to learn from others.
I find these group discussions a great way to kind of check where everyone's at.
And if there is a deficiency on my part, I find it's very motivational to study more or read more upon certain subjects.
So, in that kind of [way], I can gauge where everyone else is at.
I think that's one aspect I really like.
(Focus Group 3, Participant 2).
These benefits were described as positive aspects of the session, as was gainingexperience in establishing consensus, a skill deemed important for future clinical practice.
The experience of navigating cases with peers was unique as a motivating driver for reflection, calibration and learning from the strengths of other group members.
So, it's more about learning how to, you know, work with one another and come to a conclusion like a consensus rather than figuring out who's right and who's wrong.
(Focus Group 4, Participant 1).
The importance oftrustin others was described by students, where both asense of authorityand someone'sposition of authoritywould increase students' trust in the knowledge, experiences and opinions of others.
Participants spoke of the hierarchy in medicine, noting that hearing something from a staff or resident physician increased their trust of that clinical knowledge, as compared to a peer.
If they are a staff and they said they think it's this, well, then I am probably going to go with what they think or if it's a resident, and they have obviously been seeing a lot more of these cases than I have(Focus Group 5, Participant 2).
The sense of authority that a peer embodied when sharing their answer or reasoning, such as another student giving an opinion on the correct response, also impacted the trust.
When student's felt that their peer answering the question was confident and knew what they were speaking about, they were more likely to be influenced by that person's opinion.
Tone of voice definitely helps someone who comes in guns blazing and is like, this is this, we need to order this, this and this, and this, then obviously, people are gonna be like, oh, that sounds that sounds really right.
(Focus Group 1, Participant 3).
Students described theirclinical reasoning strategiesas they worked through the cases both alone and within the group.
They were able to describe established strategies involved in clinical reasoning, even if not labelled as such; these included articulating aproblem representationas they worked through the cases, highlighting thepertinent positives and negatives.
On a practical level, my approach to the cases was like highlighting the pertinent positives and negatives within the stem And then I found there was like a few key pertinent positives that really led me in one direction versus another.
(Focus Group 6, Participant 1).
They describe usingillness scripts, recalling key clinical information from their knowledge base that fit with the signs, symptoms and investigations provided in the cases.
When I'm just skimming through a prompt, I look for things like age, sex, and then the buzzword presentations and try to come up with differentials in the mind and kind of center how I gather my information based on that differential that's forming in my head.
(Focus Group 3, Participant 2).
The TBL experience also enabled participants to integratefeedback from peers, learning how others approached a case and which strategies their peers used.
This allowed them to increase their own knowledge base and add to their scripts both in consideration of alternate diagnoses and in identification of discriminating features among diagnoses.
It's nice to bounce off ideas, and then also ask for clarification as to why did you think this way rather than this way?
And it's nice, just to get that immediate feedback right away(Focus Group 4, Participant 1).
Lastly, how students related their experiences from the TBL session to ‘real life’ medicine was reflected in their comments related toclinical application.
Being able to relate their decisions and commitment to a limited number of responses reflectedchoosing wisely, where students had to prioritize and justify decisions, recognizing that resources in authentic clinical settings are not unlimited.
I think it's harder to pick investigations.
I think it's influenced more by things like choosing wisely.
Like, because in real life you like, Is this too invasive for the patient?
Those kinds of things where it's like a diagnosis, I feel like I either know it or I do not most of the time.
But especially when you are thinking of it as if this was my real patient, then it gets kind of more confusing about how far to go with investigations.
(Focus Group 3, Participant 1).
Further, students discussed the use of cases as a parallel to real life where they needed to make acommitment to decisions.
This was a source of discomfort for some students, although they recognized the importance and relevance to patient care.
This kind of testing format made you, forced you to choose and pick specific things as opposed to being like, oh, I would consider this.
But like, in this situation, you had to make a decision and commit to very specific diagnoses, and not just like, the broad strokes, so it was uncomfortable, but I think relevant.
(Focus Group 1, Participant 2).
Over one academic year at our institution, paediatric clerkship students shared what happens during a dedicated clinical decision‐making TBL experience that helps, hones or hinders their clinical reasoning skills.
The experience of navigating the cases and KFQs with peers was a unique driver for reflection and calibration for our focus group participants.
Our TBL session involved clinical cases developed to create authentic examples of core paediatric clinical presentations; these served as the foundation for students' rich discussions, which revealed their clinical reasoning processes.
Whether equipped with the semantic qualifiers and frameworks or not, clerkship students articulated elements of the clinical reasoning diagnostic process, specifically when it comes to analytical thinking processes [2].
Students described their thought processes and approach to the cases, with hypothesis generation as they identified pertinent key information to search and select for the most likely diagnosis or script selection.
Interestingly, heuristics, or rapid non‐analytic processing [2], were not described by our participants, which may be due to being relatively novice.
Students with more perceived knowledge, experience or confidence were, however, noted to instill more sway in group decision‐making.
Further, students who provided unique contextual experiences, having seen a real patient with a similar presentation, were seen by peers as having more expertise and therefore were perceived as more trustworthy, particularly if they could describe what a staff or resident taught them from the authentic patient encounter.
In the ORATORIO study with 732 PPMS patients, ocrelizumab reduced confirmed disability worsening by about 24% at 12 weeks and 25% at 24 weeks.
Long-term follow-up demonstrated persistent benefits, including lower progression to wheelchair dependence.
Additional retrospective data indicate that patients under 65 also benefit, suggesting usefulness in broader populations.
MRI studies confirm that ocrelizumab rapidly decreases new enhancing T1 and expanding T2 lesions.
Meta-analyses similarly show fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions with ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a.
Other trials report up to an 89% reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions by week 24, reflecting strong suppression of radiological disease activity.
Collectively, these findings establish ocrelizumab as an effective therapy that reduces disability progression and MRI activity in PPMS.
