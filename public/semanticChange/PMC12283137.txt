Current melanoma treatment results in adverse effects, prompting the use of phytochemicals as adjuvant therapy to reduce the reliance on synthetic drugs and combat drug resistance.
This study investigated the in vitro effect of (3‐(4‐Dimethylamino‐naphthelen‐1‐ylmethylene)‐1, 3‐hydroindol‐2‐one) (MAZ‐51) and zingerone, a ginger derivative, on melanoma cell proliferation in B16‐F10 melanoma and HaCaT human keratinocyte cell lines.
The cells were treated with MAZ‐51 (0.002–0.005 mg/mL) and zingerone (0.5–2 mg/mL) at 24, 48 and 72 h, as well as combined treatment (at IC50at 48 and 72 h), to determine cell numbers using a crystal violet assay, which was also utilised to investigate the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) co‐treated medium on cell numbers.
Morphological changes were examined using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and polarisation optical density inferential contrast (PlasDIC) and cell cycle progression using flow cytometry.
The B16‐F10 half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 0.05428, 0.03162 and 0.01204 mg/mL for MAZ‐51 at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively, and 27.9, 2.199 and 1.219 mg/mL for zingerone at 24, 48 and 72 h respectively.
Both compounds reduced cell numbers at 48 and 72 h (p< 0.05) and co‐treatment with VEGF exhibited a decrease in cell numbers.
Morphological analysis revealed characteristics of cell death, and flow cytometry analysis exhibited a mitotic block.
Our findings demonstrate that individual treatment exhibited significant antiproliferative effects on melanoma cells.
However, the combination treatment resulted in a combination index (CI) that is greater than one at IC50and IC25, indicating antagonism.
Therefore, future studies should consider the individual effects of the compounds on melanoma proliferation.
Cancer initiation and progression is a multifaceted process that transforms normal cells into malignant cells [1].
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), more than 18.1 million new cases and 9.5 million cancer‐related deaths were recorded in 2020 [2].
In addition, the IARC estimates that an additional 29.5 million new cases and 16.4 million cancer‐related deaths will be recorded by 2040 [2].
South Africa recorded approximately 108 168 new cases and 56 802 cancer‐related deaths in 2020.
Prostate, lung, colon‐rectum cancer, and Kaposi sarcoma are the most prevalent types of cancers among South African males, whereas breast, cervical‐uterine, colorectum, and lung cancers are prominent in South African females [2].
Melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer, is derived from the neoplastic transformation of melanocytes and is classified into four subgroups, namely: superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo, and acral lentiginous melanoma [3].
Despite accounting for less than 1% of skin cancer cases, melanoma is responsible for 90% of skin cancer‐related deaths due to its high metastatic potential [3].
In contrast to normal cells, which respond to exogenous stimuli to regulate growth and metastasis, tumour cells, through the accumulation of genetic mutations, become insensitive to these anti‐mitogenic signals, allowing them to evade the apoptotic and repair mechanisms [4].
To establish a metastatic niche, tumour cells, along with tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs) and stromal cells, secrete various regulatory factors such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that promote a favourable environment for melanoma growth by stimulating the proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), prompting lymphangiogenesis [3,5].
Lymphangiogenesis, the sprouting of lymphatic vasculature from pre‐existing vessels, is primarily driven by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR‐3) and its ligands (VEGF‐C and D) [5,6].
Activation of the VEGFR‐3 signalling pathway stimulates LEC proliferation and lymphatic vessel remodelling, creating a metastatic route to lymph nodes and secondary locations.
The elevated expression of the VEGFR‐3/VEGF‐C axis is a key prognostic factor in multiple cancers, including melanoma, colorectal, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer [3].
Therefore, targeting this signalling pathway is a potential therapeutic approach for melanoma growth and progression.
Inhibiting the VEGFR‐3 pathway by disrupting the binding of VEGF‐C/D to their receptor may combat lymphangiogenic metastasis and proliferation [5].
(3‐(4‐dimethylaminonaphthelen‐1‐ylmethylene)‐1,3‐dihydroindol‐2‐one) MAZ‐51, an indolinone‐based synthetic molecule, prevents receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity of VEGFR‐3 [3,7].
By hindering VEGF‐C induced activation of VEGFR‐3, MAZ‐51 impedes receptor phosphorylation and activation of downstream signalling pathways and thus inhibits lymphangiogenesis and proliferation [3].
A significant challenge in modern cancer treatment strategies is the development of unintended side‐effects due to traditional cancer drugs, which are cytotoxic to both cancerous and noncancerous cells, leading to common side‐effects such as alopecia, neutropenia, neurological disorders, vomiting, nausea, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections [8,9].
Additionally, combination therapy often involves using multiple chemotherapeutic agents to target different signalling pathways.
However, this approach can lead to multidrug resistance, potentially promoting tumour growth and proliferation [3].
Additionally, metabolites of anti‐cancer drugs are excreted in wastewater systems, posing an environmental burden [3].
Given the challenges associated with the use of pharmacological agents in the management of cancer, there is a need to align effective cancer treatment with environmental sustainability by exploring alternative treatment strategies.
In light of the accumulating evidence against the use of synthetic drugs due to their unintended side effects, high costs, limited specificity, and toxicity, medicinal plants and their phytochemicals have gained significant attention as alternative potential chemotherapeutic agents [3,10].
Phytochemicals possess antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti‐inflammatory properties, making them promising alternative therapeutics [11].
Their low cost, increased accessibility, and limited side effects enhance their suitability compared to synthetic drugs [12].
The antiproliferative properties of phytochemicals are attributed to their ability to modulate signalling pathways, promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, inactivate carcinogens, inhibit proliferation, and regulate the immune system [11,13].
Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a medicinal plant that possesses pharmacological properties and elicits its therapeutic effects as a result of its phytochemicals, namely: 6‐gingerol, 6‐shogal and zingerone [14].
Zingerone (4‐(4‐hydroxy3‐methoxyphenyl)‐2‐butanone), a bioactive phytochemical compound derived from ginger, exhibits pharmacological properties such as anti‐inflammatory, antidiabetic, antidiarrhoeic, anticancer and antispasmodic properties [3].
Although limited studies have investigated the effect of zingerone on melanoma cells, its chemotherapeutic properties have been observed in malignancies such as prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian and colorectal cancer, where it was shown to exhibit antiproliferative properties by inducing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting angiogenesis [3,15,16].
Although phytochemicals show promising results as chemotherapeutic agents, their clinical use is limited due to their low bioavailability and the high dose required to achieve significant beneficial effects [3,17,18].
However, combining phytochemicals with conventional cytotoxic drugs has gained significant attention.
This approach has the potential to reduce the synthetic drug dose, improve drug bioavailability, limit drug resistance and maximise the synergistic effects of phytochemicals with synthetic drugs to inhibit cancer growth and proliferation [3,19].
To our knowledge, limited studies have investigated the effect of combining MAZ‐51 and zingerone on melanoma proliferation.
Additionally, these compounds target distinct mechanistic pathways.
Therefore, it is beneficial to explore the impact of combination treatment with both compounds to inhibit tumour cell proliferation, as melanoma utilises multiple signalling pathways to promote proliferation and survival and is known to evade attempts to inhibit one signalling pathway by activating another [20].
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the individual and combined effects of MAZ‐51 and zingerone on melanoma cell proliferation using a cell survival assay, microscopy and flow cytometry to identify cell cycle changes.
Ethics approval for this study was granted by the University of Pretoria's Faculty of Health Science Research Ethics Committee (Ethics committee number: 192/2022).
B16‐F10 melanoma, a highly metastatic cell line, expresses the receptors CXCR4 and VEGFR‐3 and was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL‐6475).
It is a murine cell line produced as the 10th serial passage subclone of the B16 parent tumour line in the C57BL/6J mice strain [21].
The HaCaT cell line is a non‐tumourigenic monoclonal human keratinocyte cell line that is derived from an adult human skin.
The cell line exhibits a partially to fully differentiated phenotype.
The cell line was purchased from CELLONEX, South Africa and served as a control cell line [22].
The B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells were utilised from passages 2–12 and passages 45–55, respectively.
MAZ‐51 and zingerone were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a final concentration of less than 0.1% (w/v).
Serial dilutions were made by adding ddH2O to the compounds.
Control samples were treated with a vehicle control of 0.01% DMSO (v/v).
An additional control sample at 0.6% DMSO (v/v) and a medium control sample were included following the calculation of the maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) to account for the increased DMSO concentration for zingerone at IC50values.
However, nonsignificant differences were recorded between the controls; therefore, 0.01% DMSO was used as the standard control.
The concentration ranges utilised in this study were selected from previous literature and were further optimised to yield optimal results for this study [15,23].
Cells were treated with MAZ‐51 (0.002–0.005 mg/mL), zingerone (0.5–2 mg/mL) and nocodazole (NOC) at 0.004 mg/mL for 24, 48 and 72 h. Nocodazole served as a positive control, as it is known to result in a G2/M mitotic phase block [24].
Following the determination of the IC50values, subsequent experimental assays were performed at 48 and 72 h due to nonsignificant data observed at 24 h. Cells were treated with IC50values of MAZ‐51, zingerone, and a combination of MAZ‐51 and zingerone.
The cells were grown in T25 or T75cm2culture flasks and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Whitehead Scientific, Brackenfell, Cape Town, South Africa), supplemented with 10% heat‐inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to form complete culture medium (CCM).
Cells were then stored in a humidified Forma Scientific water‐jacketed incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Cell growth was monitored daily, with CCM changes taking place every 2–3 days.
After reaching 70%–90% confluency, the B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells were sub‐cultured by removing the medium, gently washed twice with 3 mL of 1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and a dissociation agent, namely TrypLE Express phenol red, and 5% trypsin was utilised to aid B16‐F10 and HaCaT cell detachment respectively.
This was followed by incubation for 3–5 min.
Thereafter, 5 mL of CCM was added to the cell suspension to inactivate the TrypLE Express phenol red and 5% trypsin.
The cell suspension was transferred to a 15 mL tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 1429 ×g.
Following centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, followed by resuspension with 1 mL of CCM.
B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells were seeded at a volume of 0.09 mL and concentrations of 5 × 104cells/mL (5 × 103cells/well) and 10 × 104cells/mL (9 × 103cells/well) respectively in 96‐well plates and allowed to attach overnight.
Cells were treated with the compounds: zingerone (0.5–2 mg/mL), MAZ‐51 (0.002–0.005 mg/mL) and NOC, a positive control, at 0.004 mg/mL, followed by incubation for 24, 48 and 72 h. Following incubation, termination was aided by the addition of 200 μL of 1% glutaraldehyde dissolved in ddH2O to the 96 well plates.
The plates were incubated for 30 min followed by the removal of glutaraldehyde.
Crystal violet, 100 μL of 0.1% solution, was dissolved in ddH2O and added to stain the plates for 30 min at room temperature (RT) followed by rinsing of the plates under running water.
The plate was left to dry overnight followed by the addition of 100 μL of 10% acetic acid dissolved in ddH2O to solubilise the crystal violet dye.
The absorbance was read at 630 nm using a spectrophotometer ELx800 Universal Microplate Reader (Bio‐Tek Instruments Inc.) The results were reported as a percentage of cell viability against the vehicle control group.
The following combination index (CI) formula was utilised to determine whether the combination treatment of MAZ‐51 and zingerone resulted in a synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effect.
A CI that is greater than, less than, or equal to one indicates an antagonistic, synergistic, or additive effect respectively [25].
where CA,xis the concentration of compound A at which a cytotoxic effect is observed and ICAis the IC50of compound A. CB,xis the concentration of compound B at which a cytotoxic effect is observed and ICBis the IC50of compound B. If the CI is equal to 1, there is an additive effect; if the CI is above 1, there is an antagonistic effect; and if CI is below 1, there is a synergistic effect [25].
The cells were seeded on heat‐sterilised coverslips in a 24‐well plate at a volume of 0.45 mL and concentrations of 10 × 104cells/mL (4.5 × 104cells/well) and 20 × 104cells/mL (9 × 104cells/well) for the B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells respectively and were left to attach overnight.
Following overnight incubation, cells were exposed to the different compounds: NOC, MAZ‐51, zingerone and a combination of MAZ‐51 and zingerone at the calculated B16‐F10 IC50values for 48 and 72 h. For PlasDIC, images were taken using the Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert CFL40 Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany).
Following PlasDIC, the CCM was removed, and the cells were fixed with Bouin's fixative for an hour.
Bouin's fixative was removed, and 70% ethanol was added to the coverslips for 20 min at RT.
Coverslips were then rinsed for 2 min with tap water followed by the addition of Mayer's haematoxylin for 20 min and rinsing under tap water for 2 min.
Coverslips were treated with 70% ethanol followed by the addition of 1% eosin dissolved in ddH2O for 5 min.
The eosin was removed, and the coverslips were dehydrated twice with increasing concentrations of ethanol at 70%, 96% and 100% followed by the addition of xylene.
Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with resin and were left to dry.
Zeiss Axiovert MRc microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to acquire images at 100 × magnification with immersion oil.
B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells were seeded in a 24‐well plate at a volume of 0.45 mL and concentrations of 10 × 104cells/mL (4.5 × 104cells/well) and 20 × 104cells/mL (9 × 104cells/well) respectively, and allowed to attach overnight.
Cells were treated with NOC, zingerone, MAZ‐51, and a combination of zingerone and MAZ‐51 at the B16‐F10 IC50values for 48 and 72 h, followed by trypsinisation and resuspension in 1 mL of CCM.
The cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1429 × g, followed by resuspension of the pellet with 200 μL ice‐cold PBS.
The cells were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded.
Cells were treated with 70% methanol that was added in a drop‐wise manner and stored at −20°C before analysis took place.
Prior to analysis, cells were pelleted by centrifuging them for 5 min at 1429 ×g.
The supernatant was removed, followed by washing the cells in a 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS solution.
Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS that contains propidium iodide (PI) (40 μg/mL), 100 μg/mL RNase A and 0.1% triton‐X, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2for 45 min.
An FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Johannesburg, South Africa) was used for cell analysis.
Distribution of the cell cycle was calculated using Kaluza C software (version 1.2.1) by allocating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content per cell to sub‐G1, G1, S and G2/M phases.
B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells were seeded at a volume of 0.09 mL and concentrations of 5 × 104cells/mL (5 × 103cells/well) and 10 x 104cells/mL (9 × 103cells/well) respectively, in a 96‐well plate.
Cells were exposed to MAZ‐51, zingerone, and a combination of MAZ‐51 and zingerone at the B16‐F10 IC50.
Cells were further exposed to either 20 or 60 ng/mL of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Sigma‐Aldrich, Kempton Park, South Africa) for the stipulated time period of 48–72 h. Additional control samples were included, either exposed to VEGF or not exposed to VEGF at 20 or 60 ng/mL.
Crystal violet analysis was then carried out in the same manner as explained in Section2.5.1.
Each experiment was performed with three technical and three biological repeats for all cell lines and was tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
Data obtained from quantitative experiments are represented by the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and statistically analysed using the one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
The Bonferroni test was used as a post hoc test for all pairwise analyses andp≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1 was utilised for statistical analysis.
The effects of the compounds MAZ‐51 and zingerone at concentration ranges of 0.002–0.005 and 0.5–2 mg/mL, respectively were evaluated on the B16‐F10 melanoma and HaCaT human keratinocyte cell lines for viability for 24, 48 and 72 h.
Zingerone‐treated B16‐F10 cells significantly decreased cell numbers from concentrations of 1.5–2 and 0.5–2 mg/mL for 48 and 72 h, respectively (p< 0.05; Figure1A) whereas HaCaT cells displayed a significant decrease in cell numbers at concentrations of 1–2 mg/mL at 24, 48, and 72 h (p< 0.05; Figure1C).
A significant decrease in cell numbers was also observed in MAZ‐51 treated B16‐F10 cells from 0.004 and 0.005 mg/mL at 72 h (p< 0.05; Figure1B).
However, a nonsignificant decrease was observed in MAZ‐51 treated HaCaT cells at 24, 48, and 72 h (Figure1D).

*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001, ****p< 0.0001 indicates significance in comparison to the control.
Graphs were designed using GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1.
The positive control, NOC, induced a significant decrease in cell numbers in the B16‐F10 cells at 48 and 72 h (p< 0.01; Figure1A) whereas a significant decrease at 24, 48, and 72 h was observed in the HaCaT cells (p< 0.05; Figure1C,D).
The IC50determined by linear regression for zingerone was 27.9, 2.199 and 1.219 mg/mL at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively.
The IC50for MAZ‐51 was 0.05428, 0.03162 and 0.01204 mg/mL at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively (Table1).
Due to the non‐statistical decrease in cell numbers observed at 24 h, subsequent experimental assays were conducted at 48 and 72 h. The IC50values resulted in lower percentage cell numbers in the B16‐F10 cell lines in comparison to the HaCaT cells at 48 h (Figure2).
However, at 72 h treatment with zingerone at IC50and a combination of MAZ‐51 and zingerone was more potent in the control cell lines compared to the B16‐F10 cell lines (Figure2).
The combination treatments at IC50resulted in a CI of 2 for both 48 and 72 h (Figure3).

A CI > 1 indicates antagonism between the two compounds.
The CI was calculated using the B16‐F10 melanoma cell's IC50.
Graph was designed using GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1.
Due to the significant reduction in cell numbers observed in zingerone‐treated HaCaT cells at IC50values, the effects of zingerone at IC25values (1.0995 mg/mL for 48 h and 0.60695 mg/mL for 72 h) were further investigated.
This study also examined the combined treatment of MAZ‐51 at IC50and zingerone at IC25concentrations in the B16‐F10 and HaCaT cells.
In comparison to the IC50values, zingerone at IC25values resulted in higher percentage cell numbers at both cell lines at 48 and 72 h (p< 0.05; Table2).
In addition, combination treatment also resulted in an increase in the percentage cell numbers (p< 0.05; Table2) and CI of 1.5 for 48 and 72 h (Figure3).

Note:The confidence intervals are indicated in the brackets.
*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001, ****p< 0.0001 indicates significance in comparison to the control.
This study calculated the CI for MAZ‐51 and zingerone by utilising the concentrations at which the compounds inhibited 50% cell growth, which is tabulated on page 10 Table1.
Zingerone's IC25values are tabulated in Table2.
CI at 48 h = 0.03162 mg/mL/0.03162 mg/mL + 2.199 mg/mL/2.199 mg/mL = 2.
CI at 72 h = 0.01204 mg/mL 0.01204 mg/mL + 1.219 mg/mL/1.219 mg/mL = 2.
CI at 48 h = 0.03162 mg/mL/0.03162 mg/mL + 1.0995 mg/mL/2.199 mg/mL = 1.5.
CI at 72 h = 0.01204 mg/mL/0.01204 mg/mL + 0.6095 mg/mL/1.219 mg/mL = 1.5.
In PlasDIC micrographs, B16‐F10 melanoma cells treated with zingerone at IC50values at 48 and 72 h exhibited apoptotic bodies and protrusions (Figures4and5).
Samples treated with MAZ‐51 exhibited a decrease in density and cell rounding (Figures4and5).
Combination treatment at IC50with MAZ‐51 and zingerone resulted in apoptotic bodies and protrusions (Figures4and5).
NOC‐treated samples revealed cell debris, cell swelling, and a decrease in density (Figures4and5).
Consequently, tailored treatments targeting neurodegeneration and remyelination may be especially important for PPMS.
Microglia significantly contribute to PPMS by producing inflammatory cytokines such as IL1, IL6, and TNF-α upon activation.
Activated microglia also generate ROS and nitric oxide, promoting oxidative stress and neuronal injury.
Their chronic activation is believed to drive ongoing inflammation and structural deterioration in the brain.
Astrocyte activation likewise worsens MS by releasing cytokines and chemokines that recruit additional immune cells to the CNS.
This influx disrupts the blood–brain barrier and amplifies inflammation, creating a hostile environment for neurons.
Advances in TSPO-PET imaging have enabled clearer visualization of persistent inflammation in progressive MS.
Despite its established effectiveness in RRMS, fingolimod did not significantly slow disability progression in PPMS compared with placebo.
The primary endpoint—confirmed disability progression at three months—showed no meaningful difference between treatment groups (hazard ratio 0.95; p=0.544).
Although some anti-inflammatory effects were observed, fingolimod did not substantially affect brain volume loss in PPMS participants.
This suggests that the biological drivers of brain atrophy in PPMS differ from those in RRMS, where fingolimod performs more strongly.
The safety results in INFORMS matched earlier RRMS studies, with adverse events including lymphopenia and bradycardia but similar infection rates across groups.
Overall, the INFORMS findings indicate that fingolimod, despite its benefits in RRMS, has limited therapeutic impact in PPMS.
