Ubiquitin conjugating E2 enzymes are a set of ~40 proteins that play a central role in the ubiquitination cascade.
They transfer ubiquitin from an E1 enzyme to substrates with the help of an E3 enzyme.
The members of the E2 family share structural similarity in their conserved UBC fold.
This complicates an assessment of the specificity of E2-E3 interactions.
We identified a nanobody that binds to the ‘backside’ region of Ube2G2, an E2 involved in ER protein quality control.
This binding does not affect ubiquitin loading but shows varying degrees of inhibition on E3-mediated ubiquitination, in the order HRD1 > CHIP >> TRC8.
A naturally occurring segment that binds Ube2G2’s backside, referred to as G2BR (Ube2G2 BindingRegion), shows a similar inhibitory effect depending on the identity of the interacting E3.
The G2BR in the Ube2G2-cognate E3 Gp78 enhances Ube2G2’s activity, but its deletion results in a similar inhibition upon addition of the nanobody.
Occupation of a single binding site on an E2 can thus affect its interactions with different E3s.
E2 conjugating enzymes act as intermediaries in ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that determines the fate of its target protein.
This can range from proteasomal degradation to altering its interaction network or cellular location1–3.
Ubiquitination involves the conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub), a 76-residue protein, to a target via a cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, typically on lysine residues1–3.
Ub itself has seven lysine residues, enabling the formation of chains of diverse topologies with different functional outcomes, depending on linkage types2,3.
The E1 or Ub-activating enzyme loads a Ub onto its active site cysteine in an ATP-dependent manner to yield Ub attached to the E1 in a thioester bond.
Ub is then transferred to an E2 enzyme, and with the help of an E3 ligase to the substrate’s lysine(s)2,3.
If the E3 is of the RING (Really Interesting New Gene) or U-box domain family, the E2 directly transfers Ub to the substrate.
For HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) or RBR (RING in Between RING) family E3s, Ub is first transferred to the E3 in thioester linkage and then to the substrate.
While E3 ligases generally control substrate specificity and Ub linkage types, RING family E3s rely on E2 enzymes to determine Ub linkage types (e.g., K48, K63, K11) and facilitate Ub transfer, with E3s acting as scaffolds to bring E2 and the substrate together1–3.
Humans have approximately 2 E1s, ~40 E2s and >600 E3s4–6.
The central question of how a few dozen E2s discriminate between hundreds of E3s, and possibly thousands of substrates remains unresolved.
The structural similarities among E2s, all of which share a conserved UBC domain and differ by terminal extensions or insertions, adds to the puzzle1,4,7.
E2s may manage complex protein-protein interactions by conformational changes upon binding diverse partners, although pinpointing specific sites of interaction on these small 15–20 kDa E2 proteins is challenging.
The backside region of E2s, thus named because of its position opposite the catalytic site, lacks direct interactions with E1 or E3 proteins (Fig.1)1.
Nonetheless, this backside region plays a crucial role in allosteric, non-covalent regulatory effects.
These can lead to inhibition8,9or activation10–13, depending on the particular E2 and its interacting partners1,8–10.
Here we use nanobodies to explore whether backside binding can lead to both activating and inhibitory outcomes on one and the same E2.
Nanobodies are of course distinct from cellular E2-interacting proteins, but have the advantage of binding to a specific, defined epitope.
Structures of E2 conjugating enzymes involved in ubiquitination are shown with their respective PDB IDs.
Ube2G2 is depicted with the conserved E1, E3, backside region, acidic loop, and active site cysteine along with both termini.
Note the conserved fold among most of the members of the E2 family.
*Indicates the two catalytically inactive E2s.
Nanobodies (or VHHs) are recombinantly expressed antibody fragments derived from the variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies present in camelids14,15.
They retain the specificity and affinity of conventional antibodies, but offer advantages such as high stability, ease of bacterial production, and efficient tissue penetration due to their small size ( ~ 15 kDa)14,15.
Nanobodies can stabilize proteins in specific conformations, as best studied for GPCRs16.
We have previously identified a nanobody that targets Ube2J1, which allosterically regulates the activity of Ube2J1 near a site that is phosphorylated upon cellular activation17.
Ube2G2 is an E2 also involved in protein quality control at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
It catalyzes the transfer of Ub in K48-Ub linkage and targets misfolded proteins for degradation18.
Ube2G2 functions in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway together with E3 ligases that include Gp78/AMFR (Glycoprotein 78/ Autocrine motility factor receptor)19–21, HRD1 (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation)22, TRC8/RNF139 (Translocation in renal carcinoma chromosome 8 gene/Ring finger protein 139)23,24, and MARCH623,25.
Each of these E3s focuses on distinct substrates26.
Ube2G2 is also essential for degrading Class I HLA molecules in cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a means of evading recognition by cytotoxic T cells27.
Although specific examples of Ube2G2’s role in ERAD and the discovery of the E3 TRC8 were obtained by dissecting the mechanism of action of the CMV-encoded proteins US2 and US11, which target Class I HLA molecules for proteasomal degradation27, the nuances of Ube2G2’s interactions with different E3s remain unclear.
Ube2G2 is tethered to the ER through interaction with ancient ubiquitous protein 1 (AUP1), a protein also involved in ERAD and in the regulation of lipid metabolism28–30.
This interaction involves a G2BR (Ube2G2 BindingRegion) segment that binds to Ube2G2’s backside.
A G2BR is also present in the E3 Gp78, thought to enhance Ube2G2’s activity through allosteric effects31,32, although inhibitory consequences of the G2BR-Ube2G2 interaction have also been reported28.
Using a nanobody that binds to the backside of Ube2G2, we report that occupation of the backside region does not significantly alter the ability of Ube2G2 to engage in thioester formation, but differentially reduces its E2-dependent ubiquitination of substrates through E3 ligase interaction (Table1).
The ‘CUE-G2BR’ of AUP1 and the isolated G2BR segments of AUP1 and Gp78 all show a similar inhibitory trend (Table1).
This nanobody-based approach shows how a particular structural feature on Ube2G2 can affect its conformation and function.
To generate a nanobody against human Ube2G2, we immunized an alpaca with purified recombinant Ube2G2 and constructed a nanobody phage display library.
This library was then screened by panning on immobilized Ube2G2.
Following two rounds of panning, we identified a nanobody, VHH12G2(Fig.2A).
VHH12G2was obtained by bacterial periplasmic expression and purified to homogeneity (yield: ~ 6-10 mg/L).
Upon mixing of VHH12G2with Ube2G2, we confirmed their ability to interact in solution by size exclusion chromatography (SEC; Fig.2B) At a 2:1 molar ratio of VHH12G2:Ube2G2, the VHH12G2complex elutes at a larger Stokes radius than does free Ube2G2, with both proteins present in the complex in equal amounts, as verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2B).
We determined the binding affinity of VHH12G2for Ube2G2 by microscale thermophoresis and obtained a value of 1.3 ± 0.49 μM (Fig.2C).
VHH12G2fails to recognize Ube2G2 in immunoblot.
The epitope recognized by VHH12G2is thus conformationally sensitive.
VHH12G2does not cross-react with other E2s we tested, including E2s with acidic loops (Ube2G1, Ube2R1), a distantly related E2 (Ube2H), an E2 involved in ERAD (Ube2J1), or with an E2 that possess only the core UBC domain (Ube2D2), as examined by size exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig.1).
We conclude that VHH12G2is specific and binds to Ube2G2 in a conformationally sensitive manner.

The binding data, averaged from three independent experiments, are presented with the estimated binding constant indicated.
The raw relative fluorescence data for all MST runs is displayed on the right.
To identify the epitope on Ube2G2 recognized by VHH12G2, we used NMR and acquired transverse relaxation optimized (TROSY) version of15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of15N labeled Ube2G2, in the presence and absence of an excess of VHH12G2.
Peaks for each residue were assigned based on the published NMR structure (PDB: 2KLY33).
We estimated the lower limits of the combined chemical shift changes per residue (or their low bounds in case of ambiguous assignments) upon VHH binding and plotted these shifts for Ube2G2.
Based on the magnitude of the chemical shifts observed, interaction of VHH12G2with Ube2G2 likely involves residues G23 to G27, with significant effects seen throughout the protein, especially near the N- and C- termini (residues K14 to A56, S115 to A136, and K153 to L165) (Fig.3A).
Consistent with this interpretation, we observed varying degrees of reduced binding of VHH12G2to N- or C-terminally tagged Ube2G2 based on a minimal shift in SEC profiles of Ube2G2-bound VHH12G2and a corresponding reduction from the expected 1:1 elution ratio of VHH12G2:Ube2G2 as judged by SDS PAGE (Fig.3D, E).

To better identify Ube2G2 residues recognized by VHH12G2, we performed mutagenesis and changed the 6 residues with the most pronounced chemical shifts on Ube2G2 to Ala ( > 0.2 ppm from Fig.3A; G23,I24,V25,G27,F34,G52).
These mutants include Ube2G2F34A; a single residue mutant with the most pronounced chemical shift, Ube2G2I24A,V25A, Ube2G2Triple (I24A,V25A,F34A); where all non-Gly residues were mutated to Ala, and Ube2G2AllAla; where all 6 residues were mutated to Ala (Supplementary Fig.2).
The elution peaks of the Ube2G2:VHH12G2complex migrate with decreasing apparent molecular weight with increasing number of mutations introduced, reflecting different dynamics in the association between Ube2G2 mutants and VHH12G2(Supplementary Fig.2B)34.
The Ube2G2AllAlamutant runs at a higher apparent molecular weight on SDS PAGE compared to Ube2G2WT(close to VHH12G2, making it difficult to separate them even on a 20% SDS PAGE), and elutes at a larger Stokes’ radius as analyzed by SEC (Supplementary Fig.2A,E).
Only the Ube2G2AllAlamutant has very poor binding to VHH12G2as judged by SEC (Supplementary Fig.2A).
Ube2G2AllAlais the only mutant incapable of forming a thioester with ubiquitin (Supplementary Fig.2C,D).
This result is consistent with the proposed mode of binding of VHH12G2but could also be explained by a failure to properly fold or a conformational change of the mutant.
While screening the immune library against a different E2, we identified another nanobody, VHH02G2.
VHH02G2does not bind to Ube2G2 as shown by SEC (Supplementary Fig.3A), but it interacts weakly with Ube2G2 as seen by NMR spectroscopy (Fig.3B).
Residues near the acidic loop region appear to be involved (Fig.3B).
This weak interaction supports the flexible nature of the acidic loop region, consistent with previous reports33,35.
These weak interactions are not a generic feature of VHHs, since a nanobody that recognizes yeast SUMO, VHHSMT3, does not show interactions with Ube2G2 as inferred from the NMR spectrum, nor does it bind to Ube2G2 by SEC (Fig.3C, Supplementary Fig.5A).
We could therefore use these VHHs as controls.
We used alpha fold 3.0 prediction software36to see whether it would accurately predict the region on Ube2G2 to which VHH12G2binds.
The top-scoring model, with the best confidence metrics, showed an interaction of VHH12G2with Ube2G2’s backside (Supplementary Fig.4A).
However, VHH02G2(weak binding) and VHHSMT3(non-interacting) failed to yield satisfactory binding details, likely due to forced fit interactions (Supplementary Fig.4B, C).
While the individual predicted protein folds had good confidence scores, the ‘interface predicted template modeling’ (ipTM) scores were very low (best score is above 0.8; values for predicted VHH-E2 interactions were between 0.17 – 0.24), indicating a great degree of uncertainty.
Thus, such predictions which are helpful for visualization should be validated with biochemical experiments.
The ‘backside’ region to which VHH12G2binds is at a considerable distance from Ube2G2’s active site cysteine (Cys89).
We therefore did not expect to see a significant change in Ube2G2’s ability to form its thioester-linked Ub derivative.
Indeed, when we measured Ube2G2~Ub thioester formation in the presence of Uba1 (E1), Ub, and Ube2G2, we saw no significant differences in Ub loading in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess VHH12G2over Ube2G2 as analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig.4B).
When performing SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (with addition of DTT), only iso-peptide Lys-linked ubiquitinated Ube2G2 species persist.
Formation of Ub-modified Ube2G2 (Ube2G2Ub) was reduced only very slightly.
However, there is no loss of Ube2G2’s Ub-loading activity in the presence of VHH12G2.
ASchematic representation of the ubiquitination cascade.
The E1 enzyme activates ubiquitin (Ub) in the presence of ATP and transfers it to the active site cysteine (-SH) of an E2 enzyme (Ub loading).
Subsequently, an E3 enzyme with a RING/U-box domain facilitates the transfer of Ub directly from the E2 to the substrates.BThioester Ub loading assays of Ube2G2 in the presence and absence of VHH12G2, analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing (left, -DTT) and reducing (right, +DTT) conditions.
Reaction mixtures contained human E1 (Uba1), human Ube2G2, human Ub, and VHH12G2added at a 3-fold molar excess over Ube2G2.
Samples were collected at the indicated time points.

Immunoblots with anti-Ubiquitin (top), anti-HA (middle, to detect HA tagged VHH), and anti-Ube2G2 (bottom) are shown for (C–E), respectively.
Identifiable ubiquitinated species are indicated next to the blots where possible.
Ub/Ub2denotes unanchored ubiquitin.
E3 enzymes facilitate the ubiquitination of substrates and impose processivity on the formation of Ub chains4.
Ube2G2, which plays a key role in protein quality control via the ERAD pathway, interacts with several E3s to generate K48-linked poly-Ub chains37.
These E3s mainly belong to the RING family, which transfers Ub from E2~Ub to substrates38,39.
Because the relevant E3s are membrane-anchored through one or more transmembrane segments, we expressed their cytoplasmically oriented catalytic portions inE.coli.
To determine if VHH12G2interferes with the interaction of Ube2G2 with its partner E3s, we used recombinantly expressed GST-tagged cytoplasmic RING domains from ER-resident HRD1 (aa236-444) and TRC8 (aa513-664) in ubiquitination assays.
We also included the cytoplasmic ERAD-associated E3 CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein)40,41, a U-Box domain-containing E3.
All ubiquitination assays with E3s were analyzed under reducing conditions.
While we observe some ubiquitination of Ube2G2 upon inclusion of the E3 enzymes (Fig.4C-E), the predominant ubiquitinated species appear to be other proteins, likely contaminants from the E1 and E3 purification process (Supplementary Fig.6A).
For HRD1, the addition of excess VHH12G2over Ube2G2 reduced the overall amount of ubiquitinated species, suggesting the involvement of Ube2G2’s backside in its interaction with HRD1 (Fig.4C).
For TRC8, VHH12G2had a lesser impact, with only a mild reduction in the formation of higher molecular ubiquitinated species above 250 kDa (Fig.4D).
The presence of free Ub ( ~ 10 kDa) remaining even at the later time points also indicated reduced ubiquitination.
For CHIP, we likewise observed reduced higher molecular weight ubiquitinated species over time (Fig.4E).
Since VHH02G2weakly interacts with Ube2G2’s acidic loop near the active site Cys89, we investigated whether its presence allows VHH02G2’s ubiquitination by proximity.
However, the inclusion of VHH02G2did not result in its ubiquitination in the presence or absence of HRD1 (Supplementary Fig.3B,C).
Ube2G2 therefore does not promote ubiquitination of a weakly binding VHH despite its interaction near the active site and the presence of a catalytically active E3.
As a further specificity control, VHHSMT3showed no effect on any of the E3-mediated ubiquitination assays (Supplementary Fig.5B-J).
All purified proteins used in this study are shown in Supplementary Fig.6, and SDS PAGE gels corresponding to the ubiquitination reactions shown in main figures are presented in Supplementary Fig.7.
A unique region found in ER-resident AUP1 and in the E3 Gp78 is referred to as the G2BR.
G2BR binds to Ube2G2’s backside region, as shown by X-ray crystallography (PDB: 3H8K35and PDB:7LEW29) (Fig.5A), and NMR32.
AUP1 has multiple roles, including the regulation of lipid droplet formation and exerting protein quality control through the ERAD pathway30.
It recruits Ube2G2 from the cytoplasm to the ER via its G2BR segment to enable HRD1-mediated ubiquitination28,29.
The effect of G2BR binding on Ube2G2’s activity varies, depending on experimental conditions and whether the G2BR is part of an E3 with a RING domain, like Gp7829,32.
The backside region has been shown to be inhibitory for other E2s8,13,42, which has made it a target for the design of inhibitors9.
Since VHH12G2also shows an inhibitory effect on E2-E3 enzyme activity, we examined the effect of the soluble portion of AUP1, which participates in ERAD (the CUE-G2BR segment), as well as that of the isolated G2BR segments from AUP1 and Gp78.

We compared the NMR data for the G2BR peptide when bound to Ube2G2 from reference32, with our NMR data for the Ube2G2:VHH12G2complex (Supplementary Fig.8A,B).
While the overall binding profile is similar, there are subtle differences, clarifying the different mode of engagement of Ube2G2 by the G2BR peptide vs VHH12G2.
The G2BR segments bind to Ube2G2 with low nM affinity (4-10 nM29), while VHH12G2binds with ~1 μM affinity (Fig.2C).
The magnitude of chemical shifts in ppm values are much larger for G2BR binding, consistent with it being a strong binder.
Since G2BR binds with higher affinity on Ube2G2’s backside binding region than VHH12G2, we tested the stability of the VHH12G2complex in the presence of the AUP1 C-terminal region (aa292-410, hereafter referred to as CUE-G2BRAUP1), and the cytoplasmic Gp78 (N-terminal GST-tagged, 309-643, RING–CUE-G2BR, referred to as GST-gp78).
The affinity of GST-Gp78 for Ube2G2 is ~5 nM21.
We added a 2-fold molar excess of VHH12G2over Ube2G2, followed by a similar 2-fold molar excess of CUE-G2BRAUP1or GST-Gp78, and subjected the mixture to SEC.
Both CUE-G2BRAUP1and GST-Gp78 displaced VHH12G2from Ube2G2 (Fig.5B, C).
This displacement is most likely due to the lower affinity of VHH12G2for Ube2G2 but could also be due to differences in the conformational changes induced by binding of either VHH12G2or G2BR.
To test if the CUE-G2BRAUP1portion of AUP1 involved in ERAD also results in a similar reduction of activity with E3s, we added a 3-fold molar excess of CUE-G2BRAUP1over Ube2G2, or VHH12G2, or both (Fig.5D-F).
For HRD1, the presence of CUE-G2BRAUP1resulted in a greater reduction in ubiquitination compared to VHH12G2(Fig.5D).
For CHIP, VHH12G2showed a greater reduction than CUE-G2BRAUP1(Fig.5E).
The impact of CUE-G2BRAUP1on TRC8 was negligible (Fig.5F).
Since CUE-G2BRAUP1displaces VHH12G2, it overrides the effect of the VHH when added together.
Thus, the CUE-G2BR segment in AUP1 similarly reduces Ube2G2’s activity with HRD1 and CHIP, but not that of TRC8.
The CUE domain interacts with poly-Ub chains and aids in Ub chain assembly43,44.
Therefore, some of the reduction in activity observed for CUE-G2BRAUP1might be attributed to the CUE domain.
To test this, we purified the G2BR regions by appending them to C-terminus of a GFP construct with a Sortase A motif (LPETG) placed between GFP and a streptavidin binding protein (SBP) tag: GFP-(Lys-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly)-SBP-His6-G2BRAUP1/Gp78.
Since the G2BR region is a short peptide ( ~ 3 kDa), it is difficult to purify without attached tags.
We employed Sortase A 5 M enzyme to cleave and isolate the SBP-His6-G2BR constructs (Fig.6A), which bound to Ube2G2, as confirmed by SEC (Fig.6B).
Substituting CUE-G2BRAUP1in the previous assays to the SBP-His6-G2BR constructs of either AUP1 or Gp78 showed similar trends (Fig.6C).
The G2BR segment was therefore the major contributor to the reduction in activity seen in Fig.5D-F.
The SBP-His6 segment alone showed no binding to Ube2G2 (Fig.6D), nor did it impact the ubiquitination assay with E3s (Fig.6E).

Thus, we have shown that backside binding VHH12G2, CUE-G2BRAUP1, and the isolated G2BR regions from AUP1 and Gp78 (SBP-His6 tagged) all reduce Ube2G2’s activity with E3s to varying degrees.
Gp78 is a Ube2G2-specific E3 involved in ERAD and functions in maintaining protein quality control19.
As one of the best-studied E2-E3 interactions, how Gp78 interacts with Ube2G2 is well understood31,32,35.
At the ER, Gp78’s G2BR binds to Ube2G2, thus enhancing Ube2G2’s interaction with the RING domain through an allosteric change in the complex31.
This enhanced RING binding causes a secondary allosteric change in Ube2G2 that decreases its affinity for G2BR, ultimately leading to the dissociation of the E2-E3 complex31.
Although VHH12G2is displaced from Ube2G2 in the presence of GST-Gp78 (Fig.5C), we examined the impact of adding VHH12G2to the ubiquitination assay.
Surprisingly, we saw an increased presence of unanchored Ub3chains in the presence of an excess of VHH12G2over Ube2G2 (Fig.7A).
VHHSMT3or VHH02G2failed to do so (Fig.7B, Supplementary Fig.3D).
The release of unanchored Ub3chains was also seen when using isolated SBP-His6-G2BRAUP/Gp78segments (Fig.7C).
Ub3chains can be seen (but faintly) in the presence of only Gp78, but the significant increase seen upon inclusion of VHH12G2suggests that this is due to backside binding.

The Ub3species observed in reducing conditions (i.e. upon addition of DTT, Fig.7A-C) can only originate from thio-ester linked Ub chains on the active site of Ube2G2.
The consistent observation of prominent Ub3bands in the presence of backside binders to Ube2G2 (VHH12G2and SBP-His6-G2BRAUP1/Gp78), suggests that at some point, there should exist a fraction of Ube2G2-Ub3chains occupied by the backside binders (Fig.7D).En bloctransfer of pre-formed Ub chains from Ube2G2 to substrates with Gp78 have been shown in previous studies20,21,32,37.
In our case, without an E3, we only see formation of unanchored Ub2chains by Ube2G2 (Fig.4B), suggesting that the interactions with Gp78 are responsible for the formation of these Ube2G2-Ub3species.
The formation of larger Ub chains cannot be excluded and may escape detection under the assay conditions used.
All of this could point to an additional intermediary step in the existing model of Ube2G2-Gp78 interaction31, which involves the detachment of Gp78 from Ube2G2, allowing a backside binder to sequester Ube2G2-Ub3species as illustrated in Fig.7D.
The presence of G2BR in Gp78 increases its activity compared to its G2BR-lacking variant, suggesting that G2BR’s backside binding enhances its ubiquitination activity31.
This effect was attributed to the allosteric changes that result from the initial G2BR binding, as explained in the previous section31.
This G2BR confers specificity of Gp78 to Ube2G2, as Gp78 does not interact effectively with other E2s18,20,32.
We used Gp78ΔG2BRc (GST-Gp78 aa309-573, RING–CUE), and confirmed that deletion of G2BR abrogates binding of Gp78 to Ube2G2 (Fig.8A).
We also saw a similar reduced ubiquitination activity of Ube2G2 with Gp78ΔG2BRc compared to Gp78 (Fig.8B).
Gp78ΔG2BRc retains E3 functionality through its RING domain and shows activity comparable to Ube2G2 interacting with other E3s like TRC8 or CHIP (Fig.4D, E).
The ability of Gp78 to productively engage Ube2G2 is highlighted by the near-complete depletion of free Ub within 30 min, in contrast to the persistence of free Ub even after 2 hours with other E3s used in this study (HRD1, TRC8, CHIP).
Addition of an excess of VHH12G2over Ube2G2 in the Gp78ΔG2BRc ubiquitination assay resulted in further decreased ubiquitination, which was not seen with VHHSMT3(Fig.8B).
This suggests that the inhibitory effects of backside binding by VHH12G2persist after G2BR removal (Fig.8B).

SDS PAGE analysis of the ubiquitination assay SEC fraction (red) is displayed to the right, with the major eluted species indicated at the bottom.
The addition of a synthetic G2BR peptide in trans was previously shown to enhance E3 activity in vitro with Gp78ΔG2BR32.
In a similar type of assay, we added SBP-His6-G2BRAUP1/Gp78in excess over Ube2G2 with Gp78ΔG2BRc (Fig.8C).
While we did not see a significant increase in E3 activity, inclusion of SBP-His6-G2BRAUP1showed a slight decrease comparable to that seen with VHH12G2(Fig.8C).
However, this effect was not seen with SBP-His6-G2BRGp78(Fig.8C).
This may be an indication of the subtle differences in interaction between the two G2BRs of AUP1 and Gp78 on Gp78’s activity without its internal G2BR segment.
Both ER resident AUP1 and Gp78 contain CUE-G2BR domains.
Sequestration of Ube2G2 by AUP1 prevents its degradation and facilitates Ube2G2’s participation in HRD-mediated ERAD28,29.
The interaction between Gp78 and Ube2G2 is terminated upon execution of Gp78’s E3 ubiquitination activity31.
To identify if AUP1-bound Ube2G2 can function with Gp78, Ube2G2’s activity with excess CUE-G2BRAUP1was assessed in the presence of Gp78.
Figure8Dshows a significant reduction in Ube2G2’s activity with GST-Gp78 when CUE-G2BRAUP1is used, an effect not seen with isolated G2BRs.
As the CUE domain is the primary difference, we analyzed the reaction mixture at 30 min time point by SEC to analyze possible interactions.
CUE-G2BRAUP1not only co-elutes with Ube2G2 (Fig.8E) as seen also from Fig.5B, but also with free Ub.
Excess CUE-G2BRAUP1co-elutes with free Ub, suggesting that the observed inhibition may stem from sequestration of Ub by the CUE domain, thereby reducing its availability for Gp78’s activity.
This likely mirrors the CUE domain’s dual role in cells: sequestration of Ub and ensuring the proper orientation of poly Ub chains for enhanced processivity with E3s20,43,44.
We also investigated whether Ube2G2 remains bound to the isolated G2BRs present in excess with Gp78ΔG2BRc as shown in Fig.8D, given the hypothesis that Gp78’s RING domains might trigger an allosteric effect and detach the G2BRs from the E2.
We saw co-elution of Ube2G2 with G2BRs, indicating that they remain bound.
However, the fraction of Ube2G2 that is unbound and available for Gp78’s activity cannot be assessed unambiguously (Supplementary Fig.9).
We might therefore be observing the combined effect of bound and unbound G2BRs on activity.
Here we showed that engagement of the ‘backside’ of Ube2G2 by either VHH12G2, by CUE-G2BRAUP1or by isolated G2BR segments generally results in a reduction of Ube2G2’s activity when assayed with various E3s, in declining order: HRD1 > CHIP > > TRC8, with the exception of the G2BR-containing E3 Gp78 (Table1).
We confirmed the activating effect of G2BRin ciswithin E3 Gp7820.
However, deletion of the G2BR from Gp78 (rendering it more like a RING E3) still resulted in inhibition when the nanobody occupied Ube2G2’s backside.
These results underscore how the occupancy of an interaction site on an E2 can influence interactions with different E3s, suggesting that specific E2 conformations are optimized for interaction with particular E3s.
While reports indicate that G2BR peptide added in trans can show increased Ube2G2 activity in vitro with RING domains of HRD1, TRC8 and Gp78ΔG2BR29,32, we did not observe such stimulation in our assays.
This discrepancy could stem from differences in our ubiquitination assay setup, particularly our inclusion of a pre-incubation step with Ube2G2 and various backside binding proteins, which ensures that the results reflect the behavior of Ube2G2-bound species.
The assays reported in32were done with the GST-tagged RING domains of E3s immobilized on GST beads, and only bead-bound materials were analyzed.
Our findings fit reports that show G2BR enhances Gp78 activityin cis20.
Addition of G2BR segments in trans followed by an assessment of the totality of ubiquitinated species resulted in a reduction in total ubiquitinated species (Fig.8C).
VHH12G2and the G2BRs from AUP1 and Gp78 bind to the backside of Ube2G2 but interact differently.
The contact residues on Ube2G2 involved in the binding of both G2BRs include T17, P20,V25, A26,G27, M29, E31, E38, L40, I41, M42, E45, E50, F51,G52, V53, K156, V159, Q160, L163, G164, L16529, with partial overlap from VHH12G2at residues G23, I24,V25,G27, F34, andG52(chemical shifts >0.2 ppm; shared contact residues in bold italic).
While allosteric shifts after G2BR binding occur near the active site residues 96-108 in Ube2G2’s crystal structure32, our NMR data indicate minimal chemical shifts in these regions (Fig.3A).
This, together with comparisons of the NMR profiles (Supplementary Fig.8A,B), suggests that the conformational change imposed by binding of G2BR and VHH12G2must differ.
Our NMR data show significant shifts across the protein, excluding the active site, hinting at a specific Ube2G2 conformation that might hinder ubiquitination in concert with HRD1 or CHIP.
This is noteworthy, as TRC8 and Gp78 do not show significant inhibition in this configuration.
If backside binding is inhibitory, it may not matter for the ERAD pathways that involve TRC8 or Gp78.
Backside binding on E2s can either enhance or inhibit activity, depending on the E2 and its interacting partner(s).
In activating scenarios, the backside typically interacts weakly with Ub, enhancing the processivity of poly-Ub chain formation, as seen with Ube2D2 (UbcH5b)45,46, Ube2D3 (UbcH5c)10, Ube2B (Rad6b)47, the SUMO-conjugating E2 Ube2I11, as well as in the case of Ube2G2-Gp78, wherecisbinding increases processivity31,32,35.
For the Ube2D family, non-covalent weak interactions with Ub on the E2 backside (Kd ~200-300 μM) increases affinity and processivity with E3s by formation of self-assembled oligomers of Ube2D~Ub molecules45,46.
For Ube2B, interaction with Ub on Ube2B’s backside ( ~ 600 μM) is required for poly-ubiquitin chain formation in the absence of an E347.
The E3 Rad18 has a similar R6BD (Rad6 bindingdomain) region that binds to Ube2B’s backside (Kd ~62 μM), with an orientation perpendicular to that of G2BR’s binding to Ube2G2.
Rad18’s R6BD binding to Ube2B competes with the weak interaction with Ub on its backside, directing Ube2B to mono-ubiquitinate its substrate, PCNA47.
Conversely, examples of inhibition include the backside binding of Ube2R2 by a small molecule CC06518, inhibition of Ube2E3 by Ub’s K48 interaction on the backside42, and various E2s being inhibited by targeted Ub variants9.
Our findings generally indicate an inhibitory effect of backside binding, except for Gp78’s G2BRin cis.
We hypothesize that the observed inhibition results from an allosteric change on Ube2G2 upon engagement of the backside, disrupting Ube2G2’s weak interactions with Ub48, a phenomenon also reported for other E2s10,46,47.
Despite the addition of a molar excess of backside binders relative to Ube2G2, we can rule out molecular crowding as the cause of inhibition, because assays done under similar conditions with the non-interacting VHHSMT3(Supplementary Fig.5B-J) or SBP-His6 alone (Fig.6E, Supplementary Fig.6D) show no inhibition.
Binding of VHH12G2may sterically hinder E3 RING engagement.
We mapped the residues chemically shifted upon binding of VHH12G2to Ube2G2 onto the published X-ray structure of the G2BR-RING bound to Ube2G2 (PDB: 4LAD).
This shows that the residues most significantly shifted upon binding of VHH12G2do not fully coincide with the E3 binding region (Supplementary Fig.8C).
Our data show that ubiquitination in the presence of the RING domain of the TRC8 E3 is not significantly inhibited by the presence of VHH12G2.
Steric hindrance with E3 binding site therefore is unlikely to be the reason for the reduction in activity.
NMR data suggest that Ube2G2 does not bind to the U-box domain and does not show enhanced ubiquitination in the presence of CHIP49.
However, our assays showed a time-dependent increase in CHIP-dependent ubiquitination with Ube2G2, especially for higher molecular weight species (Fig.4E).
In vitro, CHIP can thus interact and function with Ube2G2, although at a lower rate compared to TRC8 or HRD1 (Fig.4C-E).
Since CHIP is also involved in ERAD, it may interact with Ube2G2 in cells and not just in vitro.
In the ERAD pathway, TRC8 in partnership with Ube2G2 plays a particularly important role in the degradation of Class I HLA molecules27,50.
Although Ube2G2 shows activity with TRC8 in vitro, backside binding shows only minimal inhibition of activity (Fig.4D).
The association between Ube2G2 and TRC8 may therefore not rely on backside binding, or an alternative mode of interaction may exist between these two proteins.
AUP1 and Gp78 are proteins integral to ERAD and target different types of misfolded proteins within the ER.
AUP1 collaborates with HRD1 to manage luminal misfolded proteins, forming a large complex that facilitates substrate recognition and translocation across the ER28–30.
Conversely, Gp78 primarily addresses misfolded membrane proteins on the cytoplasmic side of the ER19–21.
Distinctions between HRD1 and Gp78 within the ERAD context include their substrate specificity, molecular partnerships, and possibly their mode of action, though they may also function sequentially within the same pathway51.
Local Ub concentrations may influence certain E3-mediated ubiquitination reactions52.
Our observation that CUE-G2BRAUP1sequesters free Ub, resulting in a reduced pool of Ub for Gp78’s activity (Fig.8E) suggests that local Ub concentration could explain the independent or sequential ERAD pathways adopted by HRD1 and Gp7852.
The pan-ubiquitin blots in this study likely detect contaminating proteins rather than specific substrates.
While HERP is Ube2G2’s main substrate of Gp7837, G2BR’s displacement of VHH12G2prevents study of reduced ubiquitination.
Substrates for Ube2G2 with E3s HRD1, TRC8, or CHIP amenable to purification have not been reported.
The sparse representation of these ubiquitinated products poses a challenge for detection by mass spectroscopy.
The development of artificial substrates targeted to E3s by other means may resolve these limitations53.
Analysis of specific substrates in vitro or in cellular systems is beyond the scope of this study.
AUP1’s G2BR binds to Ube2G2, resulting in a notable inhibition of HRD1’s ubiquitination activity in vitro (Fig.5D).
In the cellular environment, AUP1 binds to Ube2G2 to prevent its degradation28,29.
This binding has also been implicated in the activation of Ube2G2 to serve ERAD in cells29.
The discrepancy between results obtained in vitro and in cells suggests that compartmentalization in a membrane environment, or alternatively, the presence of additional proteins within the HRD1-SEL1 complex, may relieve the inhibition seen in vitro.
Overexpression of GFP-tagged AUP1 lacking the G2BR in HeLa cells [19] showed increased ubiquitination in the fraction immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody, which implies that the G2BR negatively regulates ubiquitination.
Our findings corroborate this and show that G2BR binding to the ‘backside’ of Ube2G2 restricts its ubiquitination activity.
Thus, regulation of ubiquitination in vivo remains a challenging puzzle.

For all in vitro ubiquitination assays, backside binding proteins or control proteins (VHH12G2, VHH02G2, VHHSMT3, CUE-G2BRAUP1, SBP-His6-G2BRAUP1/Gp78, SBP-His6) were preincubated at a 3-fold molar excess over Ube2G2 in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) for 30 min at 25 °C on a rotator before the ubiquitination reaction.
For Ube2G2:VHH12G2:CUE-G2BRAUP1reactions, a 3:1 ratio of VHH12G2:Ube2G2 was incubated first for 30 min, followed by addition of 2-fold molar excess of CUE-G2BRAUP1over Ube2G2 and further incubation for 10 min.
After complex formation, purified recombinant E1 (Uba1-SBP-6xHis), Ubiquitin (R&D, U-100H-10M) and respective E3s were added, and the reaction was started by adding MgCl2(5 mM) and ATP (2 mM).
Reactions were performed at 37 °C with gentle agitation (300 rpm).
At various time points 50 μL aliquots were taken, and the reaction was quenched with 15 μL of 5x laemmli buffer (350 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% w/v SDS, 600 mM DTT, 0.01% w/v bromophenol blue) in reducing ( + DTT) or non-reducing (-DTT) conditions.
Samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min before loading on an SDS PAGE gel.
Final concentration of components used for the assay were: 0.1 μM E1, 4 μM Ube2G2, 12 μM of Ube2G2 backside binding proteins or control proteins, 10 μM ubiquitin, 8 μM or 12 μM CUE-G2BRAUP1(as indicated in figure legends), 4 μM GST-HRD1, 4 μM GST-TRC8, 4 μM 6xHis-CHIP, 1 μM GST-gp78, and 1μM Gp78ΔG2BRc.
After the final time point, 50 μL of the reaction was similarly quenched and 30 μL was loaded on a 13% SDS PAGE gel and stained by Coomassie (InstantBlue® Coomassie Protein Stain, Abcam, ab119211).
All E3 ubiquitination assays were analyzed under reducing conditions.
All ubiquitination experiments were repeated thrice, a representative blot of which is displayed in the figures.
The assays were performed on different days with different aliquots of purified proteins.
For ubiquitination assays, 10 μL of the quenched reaction was run on 13% SDS PAGE gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot turbo transfer system (Biorad, 1704150).
The membrane was blocked with 5%BSA (w/v) in TBST (TBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 25 °C with shaking, followed by addition of primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer; 1:1000 Direct-Blot™ HRP anti-Ubiquitin Antibody (Biolegend 646303, Clone P4D1), or 1:10,000 of HRP conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen 26183-HRP), or 1:1000 of anti-Ube2G2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell signaling technology, 63182), for 1 h at RT.
Membranes were washed in TBST thrice.
HRP conjugated antibodies were visualized using Pierce™ ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher, 32106) and imaged using ChemiDoc MP (Biorad, 12003154).
For anti-Ube2G2 blots, membranes were incubated with goat anti-Rabbit-HRP (Abclonal, AS014) at 1:10,000 dilution for 30 min, washed in TBST thrice, developed similarly and imaged.
Alpha fold 3.0 predictions were done by uploading the sequences of Ube2G2, and VHHs using the online version of the software.
Images of proteins from protein data bank (PDB) and AlphaFold output were rendered using ChimeraX 1.2.4 software.
