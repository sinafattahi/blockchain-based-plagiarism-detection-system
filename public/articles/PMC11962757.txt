This research was carried out to examine the fattening performance, slaughter, carcass, and some meat quality characteristics under intensive fattening conditions of Simmental, Charolaise, and Belgian Blue × Holstein F1(BB×H F1) bullocks imported from Europe to Türkiye.
The animal material of the study consisted of 13 Simmental, 14 Charolaise, and 15 Belgian Blue × Holstein F1(BB×H F1) bullocks, in a total of 42 heads.
The fattening period of the Simmental, Charolaise, and BB×H F1bullocks was started at 11 months of age with a live weight of 405–434 kg and finished at 19 months of age with a live weight of 648–742 kg.
While Charolais had better values than other genotypes in terms of daily live weight gain and FCR, Simmentals had the highest carcass‐meat ratio.
The meat quality traits of longissimus thoracic muscle ascertained at 24th hours after slaughter in the genotypes were obtained among 5.54–5.65 for pH and 13.72–16.45% for water holding capacity; 18.37–26.28% for cooking loss.
It was determined that the fattening performances of imported Simmental, Charolaise, and BB×H F1bullocks under intensive fattening conditions were acceptable, and the best in Charolaise bullocks compared with the other genotypes.
While the ratios of the valuable cuts in the whole carcass, and selected meat quality characteristics were the lowest in Charolaise, it was determined that the ratios of various bones in the whole carcass were higher in the Simmental bullock compared with the other genotypes.
Some countries sometimes import cattle to meet their meat demand.
In this study, fattening performance, carcass, and some meat quality characteristics of imported Simmental, Charolais, and Belgian Blue × Holstein F1bulls were evaluated.
According to TUIK2022data, red meat production in Turkey is 1.998 million tons, with cattle (71.8%) having the highest share in this production, followed by sheep (22.3%), goats (5.3%) and buffalo (0.6%; TUIK2022).
Inadequacy in red meat production in Türkiye is an issue that has been going on for many years.
The increase in population increases the demand for animal products.
Importing animals for slaughtering or fattening is one of the ways used to solve the inadequacy of red meat production.
There is a scarcity of beef cattle breeding in Türkiye, and the demand for the fattening material is basically met by dairy and purpose cattle breeds such as Holstein, Swiss Brown, and Simmental.
During the 2010–2019 years of period, 778,000 pure or crossbred bullocks from various genotypes were imported and the meat produced was offered for public consumption after intensive fattening.
Bullocks from various beef or dual‐purpose genotypes for fattening such as Charolaise, Angus, Simmental, Limousine, Hereford, Belgian Blue, and their crossbreds under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry were the most preferred among imported beef genotypes.
Bullocks imported from abroad were generally brought from the European Union, Australia, Uruguay, and Brazil (Anonymous2019).
The fattening performance, slaughter, carcass, and meat quality characteristics of the imported bullocks as fattening material under Türkiye conditions were poorly characterized.
Considering the number of imported bullocks for fattening in recent years, there is a need for more research on the performance of imported bullocks, from various genotypes, in diverse conditions in Türkiye.
It has been reported that the test results of various European countries on the fattening performance of Simmental bullocks up to the age of 1 year varied between 1103 and 1614 g of average daily weight gains while daily live weight gain of 1450 g was achieved in Charolais (Perisic et al.2009; Taussat et al.2019).
Gündüz and Çayıroğlu (2024) determined the daily live weight gain as 1243 g in Holstein Friesian × Belgian Blue crossbred bulls.
This research aimed to examine the fattening performance, slaughter, carcass, and some meat quality characteristics under intensive fattening conditions of Simmental, Charolaise, and Belgian Blue × Holstein F1bullocks imported from Europe.
The animal material of the study consisted of 13 Simmental, 14 Charolaise, and 15 Belgian Blue × Holstein F1(BB×H F1), a total of 42 heads of bullocks aged 6×7 months.
The bullocks were imported from the European Union Country (EU) in April 2017.
Before the start of fattening, the bullocks were vaccinated against foot and mouth disease and enterotoxemia and also treated against internal and external parasites.
Data collections were started after a 4‐month adaptation period.
Thus, the fattening performance data were determined between the ages of 11–19 months of the bullocks.
On the other hand, there was a decrease in the number of animals in the groups towards the end of the feeding period, as some of the bullocks reached slaughter weight and were killed.
The study of fattening performance was carried out in a closed barn with losing housing conditions and fully slatted floors belonging to a private enterprise located in the Livestock Cooperative Region, in Ankara province, in the Central Anatolian Region of Türkiye, where a steppe climate prevails.
The enterprise is located at 39° 51′36″ N and 32° 25′ 31″E with an altitude of 855 m above sea level.
The bullocks from each genotype were housed in the same pen, and three separate pens were used for the fattening.
Housing circumstances during the fattening duration were suitable for climate conditions, stocking density (4.0 m2per bullock), and feeder management (80 cm feeder per bullock).
All bullocks had free access to clean water and salt blocks.
The groups of the bullocks were fed ad libitum with total mixed rations (TMR) offered during the fattening period, presented in Table1.
Four TMRs were used during the sub‐fattening periods from initial to end of the whole fattening period (60, 65, 65, and 70 days, respectively).
The nutritional content of TMRs used is given in Table2.
The bullocks were weighed individually on a 2‐weekly basis using an electronic scale (100 g sensitivity), and daily feed consumption was recorded during the fattening period.
In order to determine the means for fattening performance, average daily weight gain (ADWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated.
In the calculation of FCR, the amount of kg dry matter consumed for 1 kg live weight gain was used.
Composition of total mixed ration (TMR) offered during fattening period according to age.
The composition of the concentrate feed was 6.7% corn, 32.5% corn DDGS (Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles), 30.0% wheat bran, 8.0% sunflower meal, 19.8% canola oil, and 3.0% palm oil.
Nutrient content (%) and metabolic energy levels (kcal/kg DM) of feeds and roughages.
The composition of the concentrate feed was 6.7% corn, 32.5% corn DDGS (distillers dried grains with solubles), 30.0% wheat bran, 8.0% sunflower meal, 19.8% canola oil, and 3.0% palm oil.
Five randomly selected bullocks from each genotype group were slaughtered and slaughter, carcass, and meat quality characteristics were examined.
Slaughtering was carried out in a private abattoir from a 45 km distance from the fattening facility.
Before slaughter, the live weights of the bullocks were weighed in the abattoir.
Hot carcass weight, head, and skin weights were determined after slaughter.
After the carcasses were kept at +4 C for 24 h, they were weighed again, and chilled dressing weights were determined.
Hot carcass, chilled dressing, head, and skin weights were ratioed to slaughter weight, and proportional values of slaughter traits were calculated.
The carcasses were separated into two halves using a chainsaw in the middle of the vertebrae.
The right half of the carcass was dissected into meat and bone.
Later, the meats were separated into valuable meats (tenderloin, full loin, rib roast, knuckle, top round, bottom round, rump, and eye of round) and less valuable meats (flank, shank, chuck, and plate+brisket).
The percentages of valuable and other meats were calculated both in relation to the total meat in the cold carcass and in themselves.
The weight of the bones in the right half of the carcass and their ratio to the carcass were also determined.
Back fat depth was determined by a digital calliper from the dorsal line on the section between the 12th and 13th costae.
The weights of carcass parts and dissection products were determined with an electronic scale with a 150 kg drawer, sensitive to 5 g.
Meat quality characteristics, pH, colour, water holding capacity, and cooking loss were examined from fresh meat.
pH and colour measurements were carried out 1 day after slaughter at the place where the chilled dress was cut.
Water holding capacity and cooking loss analyses were performed in the laboratory condition.
The pH of the meat was determined using a portable pH meter (Mettler Toledo SG2) with a glass electrode (Inlab 427) in the longissimus thoracic muscle (MLL; 12th–13th costae) and semimembranos muscle (MSM) muscles at 24 h after slaughter.
Before starting the pH measurement, the pH meter was calibrated with pH:4.01 and 7.01 buffers (Yakan et al.,2019).
The colour of the meat was measured directly on the meat surface 24 h after slaughter in MLL and MSM using the L*, a*, b* system with a colorimeter (Konica‐Minolta CR‐400).
The colorimeter was calibrated with a calibration plate before starting the measurements.
C* (chroma) and H* (Hue‐angle) values were calculated according to Wyszecki and Stiles (1982). Water holding capacity was determined at 24, 48, and 72 h in MLL after slaughter according to the method reported by Barton‐Gade et al. (1993). Cooking loss analysis was performed at 24 and 48 h in MLL after slaughter as reported by Honikel (1998).
One‐way analysis of variance was used for comparisons between genotypes in terms of body weight and ADWG at various ages, and for comparisons in terms of percentages of slaughter and carcass traits, valuable and less valuable meats and bones, and meat quality, and Tukey HSD test was used for pairwise comparisons if the difference between them was significant.
Levene's test was used to test the homogeneity of the groups.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 14.01 (license no: 9869264) package program (Anonymous2008).
At 11 months of age, fattening started with 405–434 kg live weight and at 19 months of age, it was 648.04 ± 17.54, 742.91 ± 17.50 and 680.51 ± 15.02 kg for Simmental, Charolais and BB×H F1, respectively.
While there was no difference between the genotypes until the 15th month of fattening, at the 17th and 19th months of fattening, Charolais had higher live weights than the others (p< 0.01;p< 0.001).
In the 11–19 months period, the highest ADWG value was in Charolais (p< 0.001) similar to the live weight and the lowest FCR value was in Charolais with 9.192 kg (p< 0.001; Table3).

There was no difference between the genotypes in terms of hot and cold carcasses which were the most important slaughter traits.
The highest carcass percentage was 61.37 ± 0.78% for hot carcass and 60.12 ± 0.77% for cold carcass in Charolais (Table4).
Simental and BB×H F1 genotypes (33.85 ± 0.57% and 33.34 ± 0.47%) had the highest value in terms of the sum of valuable meats, while Charolais (29.97 ± 0.69%) showed lower values (p< 0.001).
Knuckle had the highest ratio for valuable meats (between 6.22% and 6.91%), while the top round had the lowest ratio (between 1.79% and 2.07%).
On the other hand, the highest value in terms of total meat in the carcass was 79.20 ± 0.69% in Simmental (Table5).
There was no difference between genotypes in terms of post‐dissection bone ratios.
Simmental breed showed higher values only in femur and thoracic vertebrae than other genotypes (p< 0.05 andp< 0.001; Table6).

pH showed similar values in all genotypes in both muscles (MLL and MSM).
While L* value was higher in BB×H F1genotype in both MLL and MSM compared with other breeds (p< 0.05;p< 0.01), there was no difference between genotypes in terms of other colour characteristics.
While water holding capacity was similar between genotypes at 24, 48, and 72 h, there was a change in time‐dependent change in all genotypes (p< 0.05).
It was determined that water holding capacity value increased in all three genotypes depending on time.
Cooking loss was lower in BB×H F1compared with other genotypes at both 24 and 48 h (p< 0.01;p< 0.05).
Similarly, while the time‐dependent change (24 and 48 h) was insignificant in Simmental and Charolais, the time‐dependent change was also significant in BB×H F1(p< 0.05; Table7).

In the evaluation of the fattening performance of the genotypes, ADWG and FCR were taken into consideration.
Among the three genotypes, Charolais had the highest values in terms of ADWG during fattening.
Simmental bullocks showed the lowest ADWG among the three genotypes.
These findings were considered as an expected situation since the Simmental breed is a combined meat‐dairy breed and the Charolais breed is a meat breed.
On the other hand, the fact that the BB×H F1bullocks showed a similar performance to Charolais steers between 11–13th and 13–15th months and the differences between the two genotypes in terms of ADWG were insignificant can be explained by heterosis.
As a matter of fact, heterosis is very common in the crosses obtained by meat breed × dairy breed crosses and these crosses are reported to be one of the most used applications for meat production (Akçapınar and Özbeyaz2021).
There are different reports on the ADWG values of Simmental and Charolais bullocks fed under intensive conditions (Barton et al.2006; Duru and Sak2017; Şenyüz et al.2020).
While some of them were similar to this study for ADWG, some of them were found to be high.
The reason for this difference was thought to be that the animal material in this study was imported and could not adapt to different environmental conditions sufficiently and feeding regimens.
In some studies, evaluating the fattening performance of imported Simmental and Charolais bulls (Fidancı, Sarıözkan, and İşcan2022; Şenyüz et al.2020), ADWG values were similar to the values determined in this study, while they were lower than the European countries where they were imported (Perisic et al.2009).
This was explained by the different feeding regimes and adaptation of imported animals to the environment.
The bullocks used in this study were imported at the age of 6–7 months, and fattening was started at the age of 11 months.
For this reason, the different results of ADWG were tried to be explained by the change in feeding regime and environmental conditions.
Males of large dairy breeds can be utilized in terms of meat yield.
On the other hand, males and females obtained by crossbreeding of meat breed × dairy breed are also utilized for meat yield.
Holstein is a dairy breed with a large build and good growth ability, but meat yield and quality are not at a sufficient level (Akçapınar and Özbeyaz2021).
It is quite common to combine Holstein breeds with meat breeds.
In the present study, the ADWG of BB×H F1bullocks between 11 and 19 months of age (1.146 kg) is similar to the performances of Hereford × Holstein, Limousin × Holstein, and Charolais × Holstein males (1.170, 1.087 and 1.052 kg; Purvin et al.2016), which were fed between 300 × 600 kg, 300 × 570 kg, and 290 × 550 kg, respectively.
Like ADWG, the best FCR value was determined in Charolais (p< 0.001).
The fact that Charolais is a meat breed was effective in emphasizing this feature.
On the other hand, in all three genotypes, it was observed that the FCR value increased in the later periods of the feed compared with the previous month.
This can be explained by the decrease in growth rate due to the progression of the feed (Barton et al.2006; Özlütürk et al.2004).
In the study, hot and chilled dressing, head and skin ratios and back fat depth were considered as slaughter traits.
Although the differences between genotypes in terms of hot and chilled dressing were insignificant, the highest values were obtained in the Charolais breed.
The skin ratio was higher in Charolais than in the others (p< 0.05).
The reason for the higher skin ratio of Charolais is that they are a meat breed.
Because Simmental and BB×H F1are combined and crossbreed genotypes.
On the other hand, carcass fat thickness was slightly higher in Charolais than in the others.
The hot and chilled dressing determined in all genotypes in the study were similar to different studies (Barton et al.2006; Bures et al.2006; Chambaz et al.2003; Hollo et al.2008) at similar slaughter weights.
This shows that carcass percentages in breeds such as Simmental and Charolais are stable under similar conditions.
In the study, valuable, less valuable, and bones were considered as carcass characteristics.
Simmental and BB×H F1genotypes were similar to each other and showed higher values than Charolais in terms of the ratios of valuable meats to carcass and total meat in carcass (p< 0.001;p< 0.01).
In terms of the ratios of valuable meats in both carcass and total valuable meats, Simmental bullocks had the lowest tenderloin ratio (2.25%;p< 0.01) and the highest rib roast ratio (4.47%;p< 0.001).
While the values determined for Simmentals agreed with the values determined in similar studies (Barton et al.2006; Mandell et al.1997), the values determined for Charolais were lower than those reported by Kayar and İnal (2023). They were also lower than those of meat breeds such as Limousine, Angus, and Hereford.
This was thought to be due to the genetic potential of the imported Charolais.
The carcass bone ratios of all three genotypes used in the study were similar.
However, femur, cervical and thoracic vertebrae were higher in Simmentals compared with other genotypes (p< 0.05;p< 0.001;p< 0.01, respectively).
In this case, it was thought that the fact that Simmental is a dual‐purpose breed was effective (Akçapınar and Özbeyaz2021).
In the study, pH, colour (L*, a*, b*, C*, and H*), water retention capacity and cooking loss characteristics of meat quality were evaluated.
In all three genotypes, the pH values measured at 24 h after slaughter in MLL and MSM muscles were similar to each other and around 5.6, which is in accordance with the normal and acceptable level of 5.6–5.8 (Warris1990).
At the same time, the pH values measured in MLL at 24 h after slaughter in Simmental, Charolais and BM×H F1genotypes (5.54, 5.65, and 5.59), Brown (5.89, 5.97, 5.95, and 5.87) and Holstein (5.92, 5.97, 5.98, and 5.97; Uğurlu and Özbeyaz2010), Simmental and Holstein bullocks slaughtered around 560–580 kg (5.77 and 5.74; Çatıkkaş and Koç2017), Limousin bullocks fed with two different rations and slaughtered around 520–530 kg (5.63 and 5.63; Aviles et al.2015), in Angus, Simmental, Charolais, and Limousin (5.54, 5.57, 5.51, and 5.50; hot carcass weight of genotypes 275, 339, 395, and 405 kg, respectively) fed a castrated and roughage‐dominated diet (Chambaz et al.2003) were generally similar to the pH values obtained at 24 h after slaughter in castrated and noncastrated of eight beef cattle breeds (Aberdeen Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Hereford, Limousin, Parthenaise, Salers, and Simmental).
This indicates that pH values after slaughter were not changed except for the pre‐slaughter treatments, even though different rations or slaughter weights were used.
The colour of meat directly affects the purchasing behaviour of consumers during the marketing of meat.
The purple‐red or purple‐pink‐coloured meat after slaughter turns into bright cherry red due to the oxidation of myoglobin with oxygen.
In this study, L* values measured from MLL in Simmental, Charolais and BMXH F1genotypes (41.71, 37.73, and 43.
22), Brown Swiss (32.00, 33.55, 32.38, and 34.52) and Holstein (32.51, 35.15, 36.97, and 29.88; Uğurlu and Özbeyaz2010), Simmental and Holstein slaughtered around 560 and 580 kg (34.77 and 35.25; Çatıkkaş and Koç2017), Limousin slaughtered around 520–530 kg (39.90 and 38.50) fed with two different rations (Aviles et al.2015), Angus, Simmental, Charolais, and Limousines (40.0, 37.3, 39.5, and 38.1; Chambaz et al.2003), which were castrated and fed a roughage‐dominant ration, compared with the L* values obtained at 24 h after slaughter of eight beef cattle breeds (Cafferky et al.2019), it was found to be higher than the combined breeds Brown Swiss and Holstein, but similar to the beef breeds and crossbreeds.
The a* and b* values determined in MLL and MSM 24 h after slaughter were similar between genotypes.
It was also observed that there were similarities and differences with other studies (Aviles et al.2015; Chambaz et al.2003; Cafferky et al.2019; Uğurlu and Özbeyaz2010) conducted in different breeds.
This led to the idea that a* and b* values of meat can be easily affected by environmental factors.
The L*, a*, and b* values determined in this study for Charolais were generally consistent with those reported by Soulat et al. (2023).
In the present study, the water‐holding capacity of Simmental, Charolais and BMXH F1genotypes decreased as time progressed.
A decrease in water holding capacity due to denaturation in proteins with the decrease in pH after slaughter is an expected situation (Huff‐Lonergan and Lonergan2005).
On the other hand, the decrease in water‐holding capacity was higher in Charolais than in other genotypes.
Chambaz et al. (2003) reported that the difference in drip loss in Charolais (3.6%) was higher than in Simmental (3.0%) 48 h after slaughter.
The water holding capacity values calculated in Simmental, Charolais, and BMXH F1 genotypes were different from the values calculated in (Uğurlu and Özbeyaz2010) in 24 h (9.01, 7.17, 8.98, and 9.60%) in Brown Swiss bullocks fattened with four different rations and slaughtered between 430 and 470 kg and in 24 h (7.36, 9.39, 10.02, and 5.42%) in Holstein rams slaughtered between 445 and 515 kg.
This was thought to be due to differences in fattening practices and genotypes.
In Simmental, Charolais and BMXH F1 genotypes, cooking loss increased with time and was higher at 48th hour than 24th hour.
It is expected that the cooking loss increased due to a decrease in water holding capacity and decrease in pH.
Cooking loss was higher in Charolais than in other genotypes.
Cooking loss calculated at 24 h after slaughter in Simmental, Charolais, and BMXH F1genotypes (23.16, 26.28, and 18.37), in Brown Swiss (30.43, 27.35, 28.56, and 30.97%) and Holstein (28.46, 28.29, 28.19, and 23.84%) slaughtered between 445 and 515 kg (Uğurlu and Özbeyaz2010), Holstein slaughtered between 470 and 580 kg (30.6, 31.5, and 28.5%; Özdemir and Yanar2019), in Simmental and Holstein bullocks slaughtered around 560 and 580 kg (27.09 and 26.63%; Çatıkkaş and Koç2017), in Limousin bullocks fed with two different diets and slaughtered around 520–530 kg (25.20 and 23.17%; Aviles et al.2015), castrated Angus, Simmental, Charolais, and Limousin (20.6, 17.1, 15.8, and 14.1%; Chambaz et al.2003), Hereford slaughtered around 560 kg and Simmental slaughtered around 630 kg (20.0 and 19.9%; Mandell et al.1997), castrated and non‐castrated crossbreeds of eight beef cattle (30.15, 29.09, 29.09, 29.09, 29.66, 29.33, 30.59, 29.63, and 31.07%; Cafferky et al.2019) at 24 h after slaughter, it was observed that it was lower than the combined breed Brown Swiss and Holstein but similar to the meat breeds and their crossbreeds.
The fattening performances of the imported Simmental, Charolais, and BB×H F1bullocks at the ages of 11–19 months were at the expected level.
The highest fattening performance values were observed in Charolais as expected due to being a beef cattle.
Similar to the findings of fattening performance in carcass characteristics, higher values were obtained in Charolais.
While Simmental and BM×H F1were similar to each other and higher than Charolais in terms of the ratios of valuable meat to carcass and total meat in carcass, Simmental had the lowest tenderloin and the highest full loin and rib roast ratios in terms of both carcass and total valuable meat ratios.
In terms of bone ratios in the carcass, Simmental had the highest value.
In meat quality traits, the pH value was similar in all genotypes, while L* value was lower and cooking loss was higher in Charolais compared with other genotypes.
As a result, it was determined that fattening performances, carcass and meat quality characteristics of Simmental, Charolais, and BB×H F1genotypes imported in Türkiye were generally at expected levels.
The number of animals used to determine carcass and selected meat quality characteristics was considered as the limitation of this study.
