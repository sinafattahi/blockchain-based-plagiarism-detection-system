Attachment styles can influence how individuals perceive and cope with chronic pain.
This study examined the relationships between attachment security, pain coping and functioning in young adults with chronic pain, focusing on the mediating role of cognitive appraisals.
This cross‐sectional study included 206 young adults attending university aged 17–29 with chronic pain (Mage = 19.24,SD= 2.03) and 346 without pain (Mage = 19.11,SD= 1.79).
Participants completed measures assessing pain characteristics, attachment security, pain coping strategies, physical and social functioning and cognitive appraisals relating to bodily and social threat bias and pain catastrophising.
SPSS PROCESS macro was used to test mediational hypotheses.
Young adults with chronic pain had greater insecure attachment than controls (Mann–WhitneyU= 41639.50,p< 0.001).
Insecure attachment was significantly associated with poorer solution‐focused coping and social functioning (r= −0.330 and − 0.355 respectively), and increased emotion‐focused avoidance (r= 0.317).
Social threat bias partially mediated the effects of attachment security on emotion‐focused avoidance and social functioning.
Pain catastrophising partially mediated the effects of attachment security on solution‐focused coping and social functioning, and fully mediated its effects on emotion‐focused avoidance.
An indirect effect of attachment security on reframing and distraction was found via social threat and pain catastrophising.
Insecure attachment is heightened in young adults with chronic pain and may contribute to poorer pain coping and social functioning through cognitive appraisals, specifically social threat and pain catastrophising.
These may be useful targets for intervention.
Young adulthood, spanning ages 18–29, is marked by neurological, psychosocial and behavioural changes (Casey et al.2008), including increased independence and establishing romantic relationships and vocational goals (Ebner et al.2006).
However, these milestones can be disrupted for the 12% of young adults with chronic pain (Murray et al.2022), who commonly experience functional disability (Westendorp et al.2016) and psychological distress (Soyuer et al.2012), which can interfere with developmental milestones and long‐term well‐being (Gonzalez Aviles et al.2021; Pinquart2014; Xiao et al.2014).
The attachment‐diathesis model of chronic pain (ADMoCP) (Meredith et al.2008) theorises that attachment styles, formed during early interpersonal experiences (Bowlby1969), can influence the pain experience through activating attachment‐related cognitive and emotional processes.
Attachment styles, classified as secure or insecure, including anxious, avoidant and disorganised (Bartholomew and Horowitz1991), shape beliefs about self‐efficacy and trust in others, subsequently influencing how individuals perceive and cope with threats.
Insecure attachment is more commonly reported in individuals with chronic pain compared to those without (Davies et al.2009), and is linked with pain catastrophising (Ciechanowski et al.2003) and negatively interpreting ambiguous situations (Ein‐Dor et al.2011; Strahl et al.2000).
These appraisals are associated with passive coping strategies, such as avoidance and rumination (Meredith et al.2006; Strahl et al.2000), and greater social and physical impairment (Davies et al.2009).
Notably, negative pain appraisals have been found to mediate the relationship between insecure attachment and increased depression and stress (Meredith et al.2005), suggesting insecure attachment may exacerbate pain‐related interference through its influence on cognitive threat appraisals.
For young adults with chronic pain, limited research details the attachment and cognitive appraisal relationship.
In healthy young adults or those with acute pain, insecure attachment contributes to increased catastrophising (McWilliams and Holmberg2010) and pain‐related fear (Fasakhoudi et al.2022).
However, the relationship between attachment and pain‐related outcomes, as well as the mediating role of cognitive appraisals, remains underexplored in young adults, who may have a unique pain experience during this life stage.
For instance, social relationships and peer feedback are crucial for identity formation and self‐concept in young adults (Arnett2000).
For those with chronic pain, social functioning can be impaired due to disability, pain and distress (Stinson et al.2013; Tillman et al.2019; Twiddy et al.2017).
Insecure attachment may further exacerbate these social challenges by heightening sensitivity to perceived rejection or criticism (Dykas and Cassidy2011).
Guided by the ADMoCP (Meredith et al.2008), the present study aimed to investigate attachment security in young adults with and without chronic pain, the relationships between attachment security, pain coping strategies and the physical and social impact of pain, and the mediating role of cognitive appraisals.
We hypothesised that young adults with chronic pain would report greater insecure attachment, which would be associated with maladaptive coping strategies and poorer physical and social functioning.
Finally, we hypothesised that insecure attachment would predict increased biased cognitive appraisals, which would mediate relationships between attachment security and pain coping and functioning.
This study was part of a broader research project investigating pain and psychosocial functioning in young adults.
The current study used a two‐group, cross‐sectional survey design, conducted in accordance with the STROBE statement for cross‐sectional studies.
Ethics approval was obtained by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee prior to the study commencing (HREA 520221121337398).
We recruited participants from an Australian university from March 2022 to November 2023.
Participants received credit towards their course requirements for participation.
Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 17–29 years and proficient in English.
Participants with chronic pain reported experiencing chronic pain (i.e., recurrent or persistent pain for at least 3 months) that interfered with their physical or emotional functioning.
Participants without chronic pain (i.e., Controls) could report pain, but not to a recurrent or persistent degree.
Participants were recruited through two methods.
The first involved a screening questionnaire administered to first‐year psychology students.
Those who endorsed experiencing pain on ‘many days’ or ‘every day’ over the past 3 months were emailed to participate in the study.
Second, both chronic pain and control group participants were recruited through separate online advertisements on the university's system for student research participation.
The study was conducted online, via REDCap, a secure online survey platform (Harris et al.2009), with separate study links for the chronic pain and control groups.
Potential participants in both groups completed an eligibility screener on REDCap prior to enrolment.
The screener captured age, university enrolment status and the frequency of pain over the past 3 months (‘don't know’, ‘never’, ‘some days’, ‘many days’, ‘every day’).
For both groups, potential participants outside the 17–29 age range or those not currently studying were informed they were ineligible to participate.
For the chronic pain group, potential participants reporting pain for less than ‘many days’ or ‘every day’ over the past 3 months were notified that they were ineligible for the study.
For the control group, potential participants endorsing ‘many days’ or ‘every day’ (i.e., chronic pain) were notified that they were ineligible.
Eligible participants then provided informed consent to enrol prior to completing the questionnaires and a cognitive interpretation bias task.
Questionnaires and the interpretation bias task were presented in a counter‐balanced order.
A custom‐built questionnaire was used to capture participants' demographics, including age, sex at birth, education and employment status.
Participants with chronic pain were also asked about their pain characteristics including pain location, frequency, duration, intensity (0–10 numerical rating scale) and interference (rated from 0 ‘no interference’ to 10 ‘worst possible interference’).
The Experiences in Close Relationships–Relationship Structures (ECR‐RS) (Fraley et al.2011) measured attachment security.
The ERC‐RS assesses the level of attachment security as a continuous dimension across four relationship contexts: mother, father, romantic partners and friends.
Each relationship context comprises nine items, 6 relating to avoidant (e.g., ‘I prefer not to show this person how I feel deep down’) and 3 to anxious attachment (e.g., ‘I'm afraid that this person may abandon me’).
Items are rated on a scale ranging from 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 7 (‘strongly agree’).
Participants' responses were averaged to produce a total attachment security score, ranging from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating lower attachment security (i.e., greater insecure attachment).
The ECR‐RS has sound psychometric properties (Feddern Donbaek and Elklit2014; Fraley et al.2011), and internal consistency for the current sample was excellent (α.
= 92).
The Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ) (Reid et al.1998) measured pain coping strategies.
The PCQ comprises 39 items assessing coping across three subscales, two adaptive: solution‐focused (e.g., ‘Find out more information’) and reframing and distraction coping (e.g., ‘Do something to take my mind off it’), and one maladaptive: emotion‐focused avoidance (e.g., ‘Yell to let off steam’).
Items are rated on a scale, ranging from 1 (‘never’) to 5 (‘very often’).
Subscale scores are calculated by averaging the items within each subscale, with higher scores indicating greater use of the respective coping strategy.
The PCQ has been validated for use in both healthy and pain samples (Huguet et al.2009; Reid et al.1998).
Internal consistency for the present sample was good (α = 0.86).
The Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System‐29 (PROMIS‐29) (Cella et al.2010) measured participants' physical functioning/mobility and engagement in social roles and activities.
Each domain comprises four items, rated on a 5‐point scale ranging from 5 (‘without any difficulty’/‘never’) to 1 (‘unable to do’/‘always’) for physical functioning and social roles and activities respectively.
Total raw scores for each domain were converted to T‐scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10.
Higher T‐scores indicate a higher level of each domain (i.e., greater physical functioning and participation in social roles and activities).
The PROMIS‐29 has excellent psychometric properties (Hays et al.2018; Sands et al.2024; Stone et al.2016).
Internal consistency for the current was good for physical functioning (α = 0.87) and excellent for social roles and activities (α = 0.92).
The Ambiguous Interpretation Bias Task (AIBT) (Heathcote et al.2016) was used to measure interpretation bias.
AIBT contains 16 vignettes describing ambiguous situations: eight relating to bodily scenarios and eight relating to social scenarios.
Participants are first presented with an incomplete sentence followed by two possible word endings presented sequentially, one benign/neutral and the other threat‐related.
Participants rate the extent to which they believe each word is likely to explain the situation on a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from 1 (‘not likely’) to 5 (‘very likely’).
The vignettes and word endings are presented in a fixed random order.
Participants' responses to the benign and threatening word endings are averaged separately to produce two scores for bodily scenarios and two scores for social scenarios, with higher scores indicating greater biased appraisals.
For the purposes of the current study, only participants' responses to the threatening word endings were used.
The vignettes in the AIBT were previously piloted in adolescents, were validated for their association with bodily and social threat (Heathcote et al.2016), and have been used in chronic pain research (Heathcote et al.2017; Lau et al.2020).
Some of the vignettes were adapted to be more relevant for young adults, such as changingschooltouniversityandteachertotutor.
Vignettes are presented in Supporting Information, with adaptations highlighted.
The pain catastrophising scale (PCS) (Sullivan et al.1995) measured pain catastrophising.
The PCS comprises 13 items assessing catastrophising across three domains: Rumination, magnification and helplessness.
Items are rated on a 5‐point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘all the time’).
Items are summed, with higher scores indicating greater catastrophising.
The PCS has good psychometric properties (Osman et al.1997; Wheeler et al.2019), and internal consistency for the current sample was excellent (α = 0.95).
Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS v28.
Alpha was set at 0.05 for analyses comparing the level of attachment security between the chronic pain and control groups and for analyses investigating the relationships between attachment security, pain coping strategies and the physical and social impact of pain.
Data were checked for anomalies (e.g., duplicates, invalid responding) and removed where necessary.
Missing data was checked; a small percentage of data points were missing (0.004%) and were addressed using group (chronic pain/control) mean imputation.
Assumptions of normality (i.e., skewness and kurtosis) were examined.
Due to assumptions not being met for aim one, a Mann–Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in overall attachment security between the control and chronic pain groups.
Pearson correlations (r) were conducted to examine the relationship between all study variables.
The size of thereffects was interpreted as small (0.1), medium (0.3) and large (0.5) (Cohen1988).
The hypothesised mediation models were examined using the SPSS PROCESS macro (Preacher and Hayes2008).
Due to conducting multiple comparisons investigating the mediating role of cognitive appraisals, the alpha was set to a more conservative 0.1.
For each outcome, mediation analyses assessed the indirect effects of overall attachment security on the mediator variables (Path a), the mediating variable on the outcome variables (Path b) and attachment security on the outcome variables without the inclusion of the mediator (Path c).
The product of coefficients (paths a × b) was calculated using a bootstrapping procedure (n= 5000 bootstrap resamples), which produced a point estimate for the indirect (mediating) effect.
Mediators were significant if the bias‐corrected adjusted 95% confidence interval (BCa‐CI) around the point estimate did not include zero (Hayes2017).

The demographic characteristics of the sample are shown in Table1.
The overall sample,n= 552, had a mean age of 19.2 years (SD = 1.9; range 17–29 years), and was predominantly female (76%), studying full‐time (86%) and employed (83%).
There were no significant differences between the chronic pain (n= 206) and control (n= 346) groups on demographic characteristics, except for sex, where there were a greater number of females in the chronic pain group.
Participants in the chronic pain group had a mean pain duration of 35.6 months (SD = 31.4; range 3–144 months), and most reported pain in multiple locations (40%) on ‘most days’ over the past 3 months (82%).
Demographic and pain‐related characteristics of participants.
Average pain intensity over the past 7 days, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).
Pain interference over the past 7 days, ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).
The median attachment security score for the chronic pain and the control group was 3.08 and 2.89 respectively.
A Mann–Whitney U test revealed that participants with chronic pain had significantly poorer overall attachment security (Mean rank score= 305.63) relative to controls (Mean rank score= 259.15),U= 41639.50, SE = 1812.24,p< 0.001, effect size dCohen= 0.29.
As seen in Table2, Pearson correlation analyses revealed that a greater insecure attachment was significantly and moderately correlated with decreased solution‐focused coping and engagement in social roles and activities, and with increased emotion‐focused avoidance coping.
No significant correlations were found between attachment security and reframing and distraction coping or physical functioning.
Increased appraisals of bodily threat were correlated with increased emotion‐focused avoidance and poorer engagement in social roles and activities.
Greater appraisal of social threat was associated with worse solution‐focused coping, reframing and distraction coping and engagement in social roles and activities, and with increased emotion‐focused avoidance coping.
Finally, greater pain catastrophising was associated with worse solution‐focused coping and engagement in social roles and activities, and with heightened emotion‐focused avoidance.
Descriptive statistics and correlations for study variables.
In the direct model (Table3), increased insecure attachment significantly predicted poorer solution‐focused coping and increased emotion‐focused avoidance, but not reframing and distraction coping (c path).
In the mediation model, there was no significant relationship between attachment security and bodily threat bias (a path).
Increased interpretation bias towards bodily threat significantly predicted greater emotion‐focused avoidance only (b path), not solution‐focused coping or reframing and distraction coping.
With bodily threat in the model, insecure attachment continued to be a significant predictor of poorer solution‐focused coping (c’ path) and greater emotion‐focused avoidance and remained a nonsignificant predictor of reframing and distraction coping.
Bootstrapping results revealed no mediating effects of bodily threat for any of the outcomes: solution‐focused coping (β = 0.003, BCa‐CI = −0.007–0.019), reframing and distraction (β = 0.000, BCa‐CI = −0.014–0.013) or emotion‐focused avoidance (β = 0.016, BCa‐CI = −0.008–0.052).

The ADMoCP theorises how pain, as a threat, activates attachment‐related processes, in which the level of attachment security shapes cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses that influence pain coping and adjustment (Meredith et al.2008).
The current study compared the level of attachment security between young adults with and without chronic pain.
We then investigated the relationships between attachment security and young adults' strategies to cope with chronic pain, as well as their physical and social functioning, and examined the role of cognitive appraisals as mediators of these relationships.
Consistent with expectations and previous research among community‐recruited samples (Davies et al.2009), young adults with chronic pain reported significantly higher levels of insecure attachment than their healthy peers, with a small effect size, reinforcing its potential role as a distal psychological risk factor for chronic pain (Stamp et al.2024).
Among the chronic pain group, greater insecure attachment was moderately associated with poorer solution‐focused coping, increased emotion‐focused avoidance and lower engagement in social roles and activities, though no significant associations emerged with reframing and distraction or physical function.
Our findings suggest that young adults with greater insecure attachment may favour passive strategies, such as worry, over active approaches such as problem‐solving and information seeking.
Reduced self‐efficacy (Charbonneau‐Lefebvre et al.2019; Laird et al.2015) and poor emotional regulation (Nielsen et al.2017) commonly associated with insecure attachment, may contribute to feelings of incompetence in managing stressors, including pain (Meredith et al.2006).
Such beliefs could drive reliance on passive coping strategies (Laird et al.2015; Strahl et al.2000) and avoidance of potentially pain‐ or stress‐inducing situations (de Moraes Vieira et al.2014), thereby limiting social role engagement.
Our hypotheses regarding the mediating role of cognitive appraisals were partially supported.
Contrary to expectations, the level of insecure attachment did not predict negative appraisals of bodily scenarios, nor was their evidence of mediation through bodily threat bias.
A possible explanation is the nature of the ambiguous bodily scenarios used in the AIBT task, which primarily involved interpreting others' experiences (e.g., ‘You see someone breathing heavily… they are…').
These detached/external scenarios may not have elicited the same level of perceived threat as scenarios involving personal experience.
Previous research using the AIBT task among a clinical sample of adolescents with chronic pain found that increased interpretations of bodily threat were significantly associated with greater functional disability (Atkinson‐Jones et al.2021).
Our difference in findings may reflect the content specificity of threat appraisals (Ransom et al.2020).
The bodily threat scenarios may not have resonated with young adults' lived experiences or typical pain‐related challenges, potentially reducing their relevance and impact on participants' appraisals.
Meta‐analytic evidence has found type of appraisal assessment to moderate the threat appraisal–pain outcome relationships in adult chronic pain samples (Jackson et al.2014).
Previous research in this area has also typically employed self‐focused cognitive appraisal assessments of pain or threat (e.g., (Meredith et al.2005).
To understand whether the null findings on bodily threat appraisals were attributable to the scenarios presented, we conducted post hoc analyses to investigate pain catastrophising—a cognitive process involving exaggerated negative thoughts about pain and its impact (Martinez‐Calderon et al.2019).
Consistent with research in clinical and community samples (Borthwick et al.2024; Meredith et al.2005), analyses revealed that greater insecure attachment predicted increased pain catastrophising, which partially mediated the relationship between insecure attachment and solution‐focused coping, emotion‐focused coping and engagement in social roles and activities.
An indirect effect was also found between greater insecure attachment and decreased reframing and distraction through pain catastrophising.
Our results show that young adults with chronic pain and greater insecure attachment may perceive pain as more threatening, leading to increased emotion‐focused coping and reduced social engagement.
Catastrophising, which is linked to decreased adaptive cognitive strategies (e.g., distraction, positive self‐statements; (Sullivan et al.2004), may amplify distress to elicit support (Kolb1982; Stamp et al.2024; Sullivan et al.2004).
Catastrophising may also reflect hyperactivation coping efforts, such as soliciting support and seeking information (Hermann et al.2007; Stamp et al.2024; Sullivan et al.2001).
Consistent with this, our findings showed that catastrophising predicted increased solution‐focused coping (comprising seeking social support) and mediated the relationship between greater insecure attachment and reduced cognitive reframing and behavioural distraction.
Although bodily threat appraisals and pain catastrophising both relate to negative bodily perceptions, catastrophising appears to more strongly mediate the relationship between attachment security and pain coping and social functioning.
This may be due to differences in the extent to which the presented situation is personally relevant and threatening (Mikulincer and Florian2003; Monin et al.2010).
Insecure attachment may activate negative appraisals of personal experiences, such as pain, with less influence on biasing attributions of others' suffering.
Hence, pain catastrophising—a cognitive‐emotional response to one's own pain or bodily cues (Jones et al.2003)—likely plays a stronger mediating role than threatening attributions of other‐related bodily scenarios, such as those used in the AIBT task, supporting our hypothesised explanation for the null findings of bodily threat interpretations.
Regarding the interpretation of social threat, as expected, greater insecure attachment predicted increased negative appraisals of social scenarios, which partially mediated the relationship between greater insecure attachment and both increased emotion‐focused avoidance and reduced engagement in social roles and activities.
Such findings align with research linking heightened social threat interpretations to greater physical and social interference among a clinical sample of adolescents with chronic pain (Atkinson‐Jones et al.2021).
Additionally, while no direct effect was found, greater insecure attachment indirectly influenced reframing and distraction coping through social threat appraisals, suggesting that greater insecure attachment influences this coping strategy primarily via its effect on negative appraisals of social threat.
Our findings indicate that greater insecure attachment influences young adults' use of passive, emotion‐focused strategies and limits social engagement by shaping biased social appraisals.
This reflects the heightened sensitivity to social rejection commonly experienced by those with insecure attachments and underscores the importance of social relationships and feedback in young adulthood (Arnett2000), highlighting the saliency of social appraisals in how young adults live with chronic pain.
Our findings suggest that incorporating awareness of attachment styles into chronic pain management may benefit young adults.
Assessing attachment security, using tools including The Relationship Questionnaire (Bartholomew and Horowitz1991), could help identify individuals at greater risk of transitioning from acute to chronic pain or struggling with adaptive pain coping.
This brief self‐report measure categorises attachment styles across four dimensions (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, fearful), which can inform tailored interventions.
While solution‐focused strategies such as information seeking, distraction and positive self‐statements are related to better pain outcomes (Huguet et al.2009), emotion‐focused avoidance is associated with poorer physical, social and psychological well‐being (Merlijn et al.2006; Reid et al.1998).
Our results indicate that the influence of insecure attachment on maladaptive coping may be alleviated by modifying threatening cognitive appraisals of social situations and pain.
Interventions including cognitive behavioural or mindfulness‐based therapies, which effectively target and reduce maladaptive cognitions among chronic pain patients (Forden et al.2024; Simmons et al.2019; Williams et al.2012), should remain central to pain management for young adults with chronic pain.
Evidence linking reductions in pain‐related threat appraisals to reductions in maladaptive pain coping behaviours (Jensen et al.1999) suggests that directly targeting cognitions may enhance treatment outcomes more effectively than focusing solely on coping strategies.
This study's cross‐sectional design precludes testing causal hypotheses.
The use of a university‐based sample may limit generalisability.
Although the chronic pain sample was required to endorse pain‐related interference, they may not reflect the broader young adult chronic pain population, whose pain interferes with their ability to undertake tertiary education.
Their average physical functioning, which fell within one standard deviation of population norms, suggests less impairment than might be expected in a more representative chronic pain sample, possibly explaining the null findings on physical function/mobility.
However, our PROMIS‐29 and pain catastrophising scores fall within the range reported by clinical samples (Bartlett et al.2015; Feinstein et al.2017; Pope et al.2021), supporting relevance despite sampling limitations.
Third, the attachment measure used did not assess disorganised attachment, a distinct insecure attachment subtype (Bartholomew and Horowitz1991) that may uniquely affect coping and pain outcomes.
Future research should include this subtype to better understand attachment's role in pain management.
Finally, future research should examine whether imagining self‐experienced bodily symptoms/situations affects responses, clarifying whether the other‐related scenarios in the AIBT task influenced outcomes or if other factors may explain the lack of mediation.
This study highlights the role of attachment in young adults' chronic pain experience, showing that, compared to their peers, young adults with chronic pain experience greater insecure attachment, which may be a risk factor for poorer pain coping and social functioning.
Our findings elucidate cognitive mechanisms, such as threat appraisals in social scenarios and pain catastrophising, through which increased insecure attachment influences these outcomes.
Targeting these cognitive appraisals could improve pain coping strategies and enhance social role functioning in young adults with chronic pain.
