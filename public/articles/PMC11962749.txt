Echinococcus granulosussensu lato is one of the most important zoonotic parasites in many regions of the world.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a major economic and public health challenge in Iran.
This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genotypes ofEchinococcus granulosusisolates from slaughtered buffaloes in Guilan Province, northern Iran.
We examined 384 buffaloes at the Talesh county abattoir, isolating 42 hydatid cysts.
We sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) genes for genotype analysis.
Molecular phylogeny and haplotype network analysis was performed for the isolates.
Our results showed that 10.9% of the buffaloes were infected with hydatid cysts, with 90.5% of infections in the liver and 9.5% in the lungs.
Only one liver cyst was fertile; the rest were non‐fertile.
Amongst the infected animals, 21.4% (9/42) were male, and 78.6% (33/42) were female.
No significant gender‐related difference in infection rates was observed (p= 0.057); however, a significant relationship was found between age groups and infection (p= 0.030).
Sequence analysis identified all isolates as belonging to the G1 genotype ofE.
granulosus, with five haplotypes being identified.
The study highlights the high prevalence of hydatid cysts in buffaloes, though fertility was low, suggesting a minor role for buffaloes in CE epidemiology in this region.
Similar to other studies, our research shows that infection rates increase significantly with age.

The larval stage ofEchinococcus granulosusis the causative agent of cystic echinococcosis (CE), a significant zoonotic disease.
This chronic disease is distributed worldwide and imposes substantial, clinical and economic burdens on society (Deplazes et al.2017; Eckert and Deplazes2004; Fasihi Harandi et al.2012).
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included CE amongst neglected tropical and zoonotic diseases (WHO2010).
Iran is considered an endemic area for CE, with the annual cost of hydatid cysts estimated at $232.3 million (95% CI $103.1–$397.8 million) (Fasihi Harandi et al.2012).
The parasite's lifecycle involves canids as definitive hosts and herbivores as intermediate hosts, with humans acting as aberrant intermediate hosts infected by helminth eggs (Eckert and Deplazes2004; Pal et al.2022).
The diversity of intermediate host species, such as sheep, goats, cattle, and buffalo, contributes to CE's endemicity in various regions (Deplazes et al.2017; Borhani et al.2020).
Iran is an important region for CE, with different genotypes ofE.
granulosusreported amongst livestock and humans across various provinces (Rokni2009,2008; Harandi et al.2002).
Amongst intermediate hosts, buffaloes in Iran have shown the highest liver involvement compared to other hosts (Rahimi et al.2011; Dalimi et al.2002).
E. granulosuscomprises a complex of species and host‐adapted genotypes in different geographical regions (Thompson2008).
Different studies have identified four primary species:E. granulosussensu stricto (G1–G3),E. equinus(G4),E. ortleppi(G5) andE.
canadensis(G6–G10) (Nakao et al.2006; Thompson2008).
The G1 genotype is predominant amongst Iranian livestock (Arabloo et al.2025; Hajialilo et al.2012; Farhadi et al.2015; Sharbatkhori et al.2016).
Analysing the genetic variation ofEchinococcuspopulations is crucial for understanding the disease's epidemiology and control (Nakao et al.2006; Saarma et al.2009).
This study investigated the genotypes ofE.
granulosusin buffaloes from Guilan province using mitochondrial gene sequencing data.
We examined 384 buffalo carcasses from April 2023 to December 2023.
The buffaloes originated from a slaughterhouse in Talesh County, Guilan Province, northern Iran.
The liver and lungs of slaughtered animals were surveyed for hydatid cysts.
Fertility was determined by examining the cyst fluid for protoscoleces.
Information including age, gender and the infected organ was recorded.
Protoscoleces or germinal layers were aspirated from cysts and stored at −20°C until use.
DNA was extracted from protoscoleces and germinal layers using a commercial DNA extraction kit (Yekta Tajhiz Azma, Tehran, Iran) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) genes were used for amplification.
Mitochondrial genes were amplified with the following primers: JB3 (5′‐TTTTTTGGGCATCCTGAGGTTTAT‐3′) and JB4.5 (5′‐TAAAGAAAGAACATAATGAAAATG‐3′) for the CO1 gene (450 bp), and MS1 (5′‐CGT AGG TAT GTT GGT TTG TTTGGT ‐3′) and MS2 (5′‐CCA TAA TCA AAT GGC GTACGAT‐3′) for the ND1 gene (400 bp) (Hajialilo et al.2012; Nematdoost et al.2021).
PCR amplification was conducted in a 30 µL reaction volume with 3 µL of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, using 15 µL of PCR mix including 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase, 200 µM dNTPs and 1.5 mM MgCl2 (2 × Master Mix RED Ampliqon, Denmark).
The thermal cycling conditions were: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C for 35 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
PCR products of the ND1 and CO1 genes were sequenced by a domestic company (Takapouzist, Tehran, Iran).
Sequences were edited using Chromas software, version 2.6, and compared with reference sequences using BioEdit software, adjusted manually (Hall1999).
Multiple alignments were performed with the ClustalW method and compared with sequences in the GenBank database.
Phylogenetics and haplotype analysis were constructed with a concatenated obtained sequence of the CO1 and ND1 genes.
Phylogenetic analyses of the CO1 and ND1 sequences were conducted using the Tamura 3‐parameter model of the maximum likelihood (ML) method with MEGA 6.0 software.
Bootstrap values were calculated based on 1000 replications.
Haplotype network analysis was conducted with DnaSP software (version 6).
Genetic variability for CO1 and ND1 sequences was evaluated by the number of haplotypes (Hn), haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (π) and the number of variable sites (S).
Sequences were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbersOR473015‐OR473043for CO1 andOR451233‐OR451261for ND1.
Statistical analyses were performed using the chi‐square test with SPSS software version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Apvalue of < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Of the 384 buffalo carcasses examined, 42 (10.9%) were infected with hydatid cysts.
Of these, 38 (90.5%) were from the liver and 4 (9.5%) from the lungs, with a statistically significant difference observed (p< 0.001).
Only one liver cyst was fertile; the others were non‐fertile.
The incidence of hydatid cyst contamination based on gender and age groups is shown in Table1.
Hydatid cyst infection in buffaloes aged 3–5 years was 13.2%, higher than in buffaloes younger than 3 years (5.4%), with a statistically significant difference (p= 0.03) (Table1).
Thirty isolates were successfully sequenced for both CO1 and ND1 partial genes.
Sequencing analysis identified the G1 genotype in all isolates.
Genetic diversity indices of CE are shown in Table2.
Based on the CO1 and ND1 genes, isolates were categorised into five haplotypes.
Haplotype 1, with 14 isolates, was the most frequent amongst the haplotypes (Table3).
The distribution of CE isolates in each haplotype is presented in Table3.
A dendrogram based on phylogenetic analysis shows the five haplotypes in the present study are situated in the G1 genotype cluster along with the G1 reference genotype (Figure1).

The tree was designed by using the Maximum‐Likelihood test and the Tamura 3‐parameter model as implemented in the MEGA6 software.
The current study reveals a 10.9% prevalence of hydatid cyst infection amongst buffaloes in the region.
This finding aligns with previous epidemiological studies conducted in various Iranian provinces, such as West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Guilan, Mazandaran and Khuzestan, where infection rates ranged from 8% to 9.9% (Pour et al.2012; Rahimi et al.2011).
Similar infection rates have been reported in buffaloes from Pakistan (11.9%), Italy (10.5%) and Iraq (20.9%) (Mehmood et al.2020; Capuano et al.2006; Wajid2021).
Notably, our study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in infection rates between the liver (90.5%) and the lungs (9.5%).
This contrasts with other studies where buffalo lungs were more frequently infected than the liver (Pour et al.2012; Basti et al.2009; Mirzaei et al.2015).
The analysis did not find a significant difference in infection rates between male and female buffaloes.
However, the prevalence was higher in females (13.1%) compared to males (6.8%).
This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that female buffaloes in Iran are typically slaughtered at an older age due to their reproductive and milk production value, resulting in prolonged exposure to sources of contamination.
Furthermore, immune system weakening during pregnancy may contribute to the increased infection rates observed in females (Fallah et al.2010; Pour et al.2012).
Only one liver cyst was found to be fertile, resulting in a fertility rate of 2.4% (1/42) amongst the buffalo isolates.
Previous studies have reported fertility rates of 6.3%, 7.4%, 7.7%, 10.5% and 7.7% in West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Guilan and Khuzestan, respectively.
Variations in fertility rates may be due to differences in parasite strains (Pour et al.2012).
The study also noted a significantly higher infection rate in buffaloes aged 3–5 years (13.2%) compared to those younger than 3 years (5.4%), indicating that infection rates increase with age.
This trend has been observed in other studies as well (Pour et al.2012; Basti et al.2009; Mirzaei et al.2015; Khan et al.2013).E.
granulosusexhibits remarkable genetic variability, with genetic marker analysis providing insights into the parasite's pathogenesis, epidemiology, taxonomy, population biology and phylogenetic relationships.
Mitochondrial sequence analysis is particularly useful for understanding genetic variation across different hosts and geographical areas, aiding in the prevention and control of the disease (Hajialilo et al.2012; Saarma et al.2009).
All buffalo isolates in this study were identified as the G1 genotype, which is responsible for the majority of human and animal CE cases worldwide (Shahnazi et al.2021; Kinkar et al.2018; Shahabi et al.2021).
Studies in Iran have consistently found the G1 genotype to be predominant amongst buffaloes, with the G1 and G3 genotypes being reported (Amin Pour et al.2011; Sharbatkhori et al.2016; Babazadeh et al.2015).
Amin Pour et al. (2011), amongst 25 isolates of buffaloes, were reported four G1 haplotypes and one G3 haplotype.
Understanding the prevalence of the G1 genotype in buffalo hosts is crucial for comprehending disease dynamics and implementing effective control measures.
This study confirms the presence of the G1 genotype amongst buffaloes in the region and provides the first epidemiological data on CE in buffalo from this area.
Given the medical and veterinary importance of hydatid cyst in Iran, these findings have significant implications for public health, particularly in the prevention and control of the disease.
