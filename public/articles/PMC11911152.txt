Dyslexia is one of the most common language‐based learning disabilities.
Teaching a second language (L2) to dyslexic students is still a contested issue among educators.
Teachers' knowledge and beliefs about dyslexia play an important role in the successful inclusion of these students in L2 classrooms.
The current study investigated the knowledge and beliefs of Turkish second language teachers (SLTs) about dyslexia.
Data were collected from 150 participants using the Knowledge and Beliefs About Developmental Dyslexia Scale (KBDDS).
The findings revealed that Turkish SLTs possess a moderate level of knowledge about dyslexia, with notable strengths in understanding the need for individualised instruction and rejecting common myths, such as the belief that dyslexia is linked to laziness or low intelligence.
However, several misconceptions persist, including the belief that dyslexia primarily results from visual processing issues.
Female teachers and those with less than 11 years of teaching experience demonstrated significantly higher levels of knowledge.
The study highlights the need for targeted professional development that builds on teachers' existing strengths while addressing areas of misunderstanding.
Further research is recommended to explore the impact of teacher knowledge on dyslexic students' learning outcomes in L2 classrooms.
Dyslexia is one of the most common language‐based learning disabilities.
Although a precise figure cannot be confirmed, the prevalence of dyslexia was reported to range from 5% to 20% (Wagner et al.2020).
While there is no globally agreed‐upon definition, most experts concur that it is a specific language‐learning disability with neurobiological origins (Lyon et al.2003).
It manifests itself as a set of deficits in lower‐level reading processes, resulting in difficulties with automatic word recognition, reading comprehension and confined vocabulary growth (cf.
Adlof and Hogan2018; Moojen et al.2020; Snowling2012).
Dyslexia is typically identified when a child begins to develop literacy skills (Balcı2017), and it causes the child to develop reading abilities at a slower rate than his or her peers, leading to lifetime academic problems (Kormos2020).
Teaching a second language (L2) to students with dyslexia is still a contested issue among educators.
Some educators suggest that such students should be exempted from L2 learning as they struggle to read and write in their mother tongue (Csizér et al.2010).
In many educational settings, however, students with dyslexia are not given the option to opt out of L2 learning (Ivančević‐Otanjac2016), nor are their specific needs adequately considered in classroom practices.
Instead, they are obligated to adhere to the curriculum designed for all students.
In the Turkish context, while the exact prevalence of dyslexia is unknown, a report from the Tohum Autism Foundation (2011) estimates that approximately 12.29% of the population may have dyslexia.
In the Turkish educational system, children with mild to moderate learning impairments, including dyslexia, are integrated into mainstream public schools as part of the inclusive education policy (Erkan et al.2012).
With compulsory education spanning 12 years in Türkiye, all students must follow a standardised curriculum, which includes a foreign language as a compulsory subject.
Given that the Turkish school system serves 17,270,000 students, the total number of potential dyslexic students surpasses 2 million.
For the successful inclusion of dyslexic students, it is crucial to select appropriate teaching methods and techniques, and to provide timely support (Botwina2011).
As Mihić et al. (2022) note, dyslexia is a complex condition requiring tailored interventions that are customised to each student's age, language and other characteristics.
Kuyini and Desai (2007) also stress that teachers' instructional practices are shaped by their beliefs and knowledge of dyslexia.
Understanding second language teachers' (SLTs') knowledge of dyslexia is particularly important because dyslexic students encounter unique challenges in learning an L2, such as difficulties with phonological processing, spelling and reading comprehension.
These challenges, which stem from dyslexia, can impede their success in L2 learning unless properly addressed by informed teachers.
Furthermore, in Türkiye, where English is a compulsory subject, it is essential that SLTs are equipped with the knowledge and tools to support dyslexic students.
Despite this, research on SLTs' knowledge and beliefs about dyslexia, and how it can impact their teaching practices, remains scarce.
Most research has focused on general classroom teachers in Türkiye, leaving a gap in our understanding of SLTs' preparedness to teach dyslexic students effectively.
As Kormos (2020) points out, little research has been conducted on foreign language teachers' knowledge of and attitudes towards dyslexia.
To address this gap, the present study aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by exploring SLTs' knowledge of dyslexia.
It is now well‐established that teacher knowledge and beliefs guide their instructional choices (Fang1996; Baştürkmen2012; Borg2015) and play a significant role in student performance, particularly in the achievement of struggling readers (McCutchen and Berninger1999; Moats and Foorman2003; McCutchen et al.2009; Piasta et al.2009,2020).
According to Brody and Mills (1997), what matters most for children with learning difficulties and disabilities is their teachers' commitment and capabilities.
Teachers with accurate knowledge about reading disabilities may assist in identifying and supporting students with dyslexia.
Several studies on the knowledge and beliefs of pre‐service and in‐service teachers of different school subjects have shown that teachers have incomplete knowledge of basic language concepts related to reading instruction and hold misconceptions about dyslexia (e.g., Bos et al.2001; Binks‐Cantrell et al.2012; Gwernan‐Jones and Burden2010; Moats and Foorman2003; Piasta et al.2020; Regan and Woods2000; Serry and Hammond2015; Spear‐Swerling et al.2005; Soriano‐Ferrer et al.2016; Washburn et al.2014,2011).
Some misconceptions commonly reported in the literature are that dyslexia is more prevalent in males (Yin et al.2020), dyslexia is a reading disability resulting from a visual–perceptual deficit (e.g., Bell et al.2011; Serry and Hammond2015; Washburn et al.2017), or an intellectual capacity (Soriano‐Ferrer et al.2016), or a disability characterised by seeing letters and words backwards (Washburn et al.2014).
Reading development is a complex process both in the L1 and L2.
Learning to read starts with learning the correspondence between print and sound.
While grapheme–phoneme mappings are easier in languages with transparent orthographies, such as Turkish, the mappings in English are inconsistent, making the learning process difficult (Snowling et al.2020).
For this reason, as Spencer (2000) points out, readers in the former category experience little difficulty decoding words in their mother tongue.
Past research has provided evidence of this situation.
In an earlier study comparing normal first and third‐grade American and Turkish students, Öney and Goldman (1984) found that Turkish students read words faster and more accurately than their American counterparts.
Durgunoğlu and Öney (1999) conducted a similar study, comparing the phonological awareness abilities of Turkish and English‐speaking kindergarten and first‐grade students.
The study found that Turkish speakers were better than their American counterparts at handling syllables and deleting the final phonemes of words.
A similar pattern is seen in dyslexic children.
Landerl et al. (1997) compared decoding difficulties experienced by German and English dyslexic children.
They found that English dyslexic children had more severe reading impairments than German dyslexics.
This led the researchers to conclude that inconsistent orthography imposes a much heavier learning burden for dyslexic individuals.
Studies found in the literature suggest that children who have decoding problems in one language also demonstrate decoding problems in their L2.
For example, Da Fontoura and Siegel (1995) assessed the reading, language and memory skills of 37 bilingual Portuguese Canadian children to determine the relationship between reading problems in English (the language of instruction) and Portuguese (the language spoken at home).
They found that bilingual children with reading disabilities had similar scores to monolingual children with reading disabilities on word reading and working memory but lower scores on the syntactic awareness task.
While learning a L2, students with dyslexia experience various challenges.
For example, compared to non‐dyslexics, students with dyslexia perform poorly in all four language skills (Crombie1997), score lower on spelling, translation, reading, vocabulary and orthographic tasks (Helland and Kaasa2005; Ho and Fong2005; Ndlovu and Geva2008; Palladino et al.2016) and experience difficulties in oral language, word comprehension and reading comprehension (Abdullateef2023; Geva and Massey‐Garrison2013).
Such challenges might affect learners' motivation to learn a L2.
In an interview study with dyslexic Hungarian students, Csizér et al. (2010) reported that these students lack the motivation to learn English primarily due to the inadequate support they receive in their educational setting.
Similarly, Kormos and Csizér (2010) conducted a large‐scale study to explore the language‐learning motivation of Hungarian learners of English and German with and without dyslexia.
The results showed that dyslexic learners exhibit significantly less positive motivation than their non‐dyslexic peers, and that language‐learning experiences, as well as teachers' behaviour and instructional practices, indirectly affect students' enthusiasm for language learning.
Dyslexia is a phenomenon that has recently gained recognition in Türkiye.
According to Kayabaşı (2020), students with dyslexia may occasionally receive a false diagnosis, go unnoticed or face stigma from peers and teachers.
The situation may arise due to the morpheme–grapheme transparency of the Turkish language, which hinders teachers from recognising the difficulties experienced by dyslexic students in both their L1 and L2.
Turkish is a transparent language with a highly regular orthography (Göksel and Kerslake2005).
There is a consistent one‐to‐one match between letters and sounds.
For example, the letter ‘a’ consistently represents the/a/sound and ‘b’ consistently represents the/b/sound.
This predictable relationship between letters and their corresponding speech sounds enhances literacy skill development and contributes to successful language acquisition.
However, since dyslexia is characterised by difficulties with word‐level skills (Stevens et al.2022), a transparent L1 may pose additional challenges in acquiring an opaque L2.
Recently, there has been a significant increase in global attention towards dyslexia.
However, it is noteworthy that in the Turkish context, dyslexia has only recently started to garner substantial recognition.
This is supported by the findings of a study by Seçkin‐Yılmaz and Erim (2019), who surveyed 500 adults to assess their knowledge of dyslexia.
The findings revealed that the subjects' level of knowledge was extremely low.
Interestingly, females demonstrated greater awareness than males, and age and educational background did not exert a significant influence on the subjects' knowledge about dyslexia.
Several studies involving teachers as subjects have yielded comparable results.
Research suggests that many Turkish primary school teachers are not adequately prepared to teach children with dyslexia (Doğan2013; Balcı2019; Başar and Göncü2018; Kodan2020; Tosun et al.2021; Sümer‐Dodur and Altındağ‐Kumaş2021).
In an earlier study, Doğan (2013) investigated primary school teachers' knowledge about dyslexia and found that teachers had poor knowledge of dyslexia.
Recently, Sümer‐Dodur and Altındağ‐Kumaş (2021) investigated primary school teachers' knowledge and beliefs about dyslexia and found that teachers were not knowledgeable enough and did not feel ready to teach students with dyslexia.
In her study examining the opinions of the teachers about dyslexia, Balcı (2019) reported that teachers in Turkey do not receive adequate training during their initial teacher education, and for this reason, they feel incapable of identifying students with dyslexia or meeting the educational needs of such students.
The present study utilises a descriptive survey design to identify the knowledge and beliefs about dyslexia among Turkish SLTs.
This research design is appropriate for identifying the current level of understanding and misconceptions held by SLTs regarding dyslexia.
Descriptive research seeks to comprehensively characterise a population or phenomena at a specific point in time (Nardi2018).
This design is particularly useful in highlighting areas where teachers may need additional training or support, as it enables the identification of trends and patterns in dyslexia knowledge based on demographic variables such as gender, years of experience and school level.
The participants of the study were recruited through the snowball technique.
An initial call for participation was emailed to potential participants, and they were requested to share the link to an online survey with other SLTs.
A total of 150 SLTs participated in the study.
Of the 150 participants, 116 were female (77.3%) and 34 were male (22.7%).
Among the participants, 83 had between 1 and 10 years of teaching experience, while 67 had 11 years or more of teaching experience.
In terms of school level, 18 worked in elementary schools, 57 in secondary schools, 58 in high schools and 17 in colleges.
Table1below displays the characteristics of the study sample.
The initial survey was supplemented with additional questions aimed at gathering demographic information regarding the participants' gender, years of teaching experience and the educational level at which they teach.
Furthermore, questions were added related to the source of their knowledge about dyslexia, whether they have had experience teaching students with dyslexia, and if they have modified their instructional methods accordingly.
Demographic data was analysed descriptively.
Descriptive statistics and histograms were taken into consideration for the normality analysis and continuous variables (Gen; Sym; Trt).
The normality of the data was checked using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test.
Although the histogram of the continuous variables showed skewness, the data was accepted to be normally distributed because the mean, median and mode were close to each other and the skewness and kurtosis values for the factors were within the +1/−1 range.
In the present study, the internal consistency for the whole scale was 0.796.
One‐way ANOVA tests were performed to investigate the effects of independent variables (gender, years of teaching experience and the school level they teach) on the dependent variables.
Partial eta squared statistic (η2) was used to report the effect sizes.
Since the KBDDS was intended to measure knowledge about dyslexia, the Rasch model was used to identify the respondents' misconceptions about dyslexia.
The parameters of the model define the respondents' competency and the item difficulty on a continuous latent variable (Boone2016).
SPSS Version 29 was used for the Rasch measurement.
The first aim of the study is to identify the SLTs' knowledge and misconceptions about dyslexia.
The descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) are given in Table2.
The results indicated that overall, the Turkish L2 teachers had a medium level of knowledge about dyslexia (M= 16.43).
The mean scores of the subdomains also suggested a medium level of knowledge in terms of general information about the nature, causes, outcomes (M= 7.11), symptoms (M= 4.91) and treatment (M= 4.40) of dyslexia.
The medium level of knowledge indicates a basic understanding of the condition but also highlights the presence of some misconceptions.
Abbreviations: Gen, general information; Sym, symptom; Trt, treatment.
The descriptive statistics of the items indicate that Turkish SLTs possess accurate knowledge in several important areas related to dyslexia.
Nearly 97% of the respondents accurately rejected the misconception that dyslexic students are lazy or unintelligent, while 96% affirmed that dyslexia is not a fictitious problem.
In addition, 90% recognised that a child can be both dyslexic and gifted, showing an awareness of the complexity of dyslexia.
Another area of strength is the understanding that not all poor readers are dyslexic, with 91% correctly identifying this distinction.
Teachers also demonstrated accurate knowledge regarding effective interventions, with 74% recognising the value of phonics‐based programmes that support dyslexic students' phonological processing, and 69% acknowledging that repeated reading techniques can improve reading fluency.
Furthermore, a large proportion of teachers (87%) disagreed with the notion that accommodations such as extra time for exams are unfair to other students, reflecting a sound understanding of the need for reasonable adjustments to support dyslexic learners.
When respondents were asked about the sources from which they obtained their knowledge on dyslexia, the majority (39%) reported relying on social media and the internet as their primary sources of information.
This was closely followed by 36% who cited the special education courses they completed during their undergraduate studies.
Meanwhile, 10% mentioned acquiring information from their immediate surroundings, such as personal contacts and professional interactions.
A smaller portion (6%) reported receiving information through in‐service training programmes provided by their employers or professional associations.
Furthermore, 3% of participants identified conferences as their main source of knowledge.
Notably, 5% of teachers acknowledged having no information on the subject of dyslexia.
Specifically, this data demonstrated that more than half of the foreign language instructors in our sample learnt about dyslexia through informal sources.
To identify the misconceptions by SLTs in each domain, we calculated item difficulty using the Rasch model.
The most difficult items represent common misconceptions.
In the model, items are classified as difficult if participants respond them incorrectly.
As Furr (2021, 53–514) explains ‘an item that has a high level of difficulty will be less likely to be answered correctly than an item that has a low level of difficulty’.
Accordingly, the items that are most difficult to answer correctly serve to represents SLTs' misconceptions.
The analysis uncovered several prevalent misconceptions regarding the nature, causes and outcomes of dyslexia, including:Dyslexia is caused by visual perception deficits resulting in reversals of letters and words(Item 2),Dyslexia is more frequent in males than in females(Item 8),Problems in establishing laterality (body schema) are the cause of dyslexia(Item 27) andDyslexia refers to a relatively chronic condition that is usually cannot be completely overcome(Item 29).
Figure1below illustrates the item difficulties for the general information domain.
Item difficulties for the general information domain.
The most common misconception related to the symptoms of dyslexia was that reversingletters and words is the main characteristic of dyslexia(Item 13) andthat intelligence tests are useful in identifying dyslexia(Item 15).
The item difficulties of the symptom domain are shown in Figure2.
The analysis revealed that the SLTs held just one misconception about how to treat dyslexia:Children with dyslexia can be helped by using coloured lenses/coloured overlays(Item 17).
Figure3below displays the item difficulties for the treatment domain.
Regarding the second research question, a one‐way ANOVA between subjects was performed to investigate the effects of independent variables (gender, years of experience and school level) on the SLTs' knowledge about dyslexia.
As Table3displays, the analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the total mean score between female and male SLTs (F(1,148) = [12.639],p< 0.001,η2= 0.079), with a moderate effect size.
Female teachers with a mean of 17.23 (SD = 4.74) scored significantly higher on the total score than male teachers.
Also, females scored higher than males in all subdomains (F(1,148) = [14.889],p< 0.001,η2= 0.091 in Gen;F(1,148) = [6.241],p= 0.014,η2= 0.040 in Sym;F(1,148) = [4.286],p= 0.040,η2= 0.028 in Trt).
Means, standard deviations and one‐way analyses of variance in KBDDS and gender.
Abbreviations: Gen, general information; Sym, symptom; Trt, treatment.
As displayed in Table4, there was a statistically significant difference in the total mean scores between the group with 1–10 years of experience and those with 11+ years of experience (F(1,148) = [6.418],p= 0.012,η2= 0.042).
This finding indicated that SLTs with 11 years or more experience were less knowledgeable about dyslexia (M= 15.23).
While there was no statistically significant difference in the general information domain between the groups (F(1,148) = [1.667],p= 0.199), the mean scores of SLTs with 1–10 years of experience were significantly higher than those of SLTs with 11 years or more experience in both symptoms and treatment domains (F(1,148) = [4.761],p= 0.031,η2= 0.031 andF(1,148) = [7.931],p= 0.006,i2= 0.051, respectively).
Means, standard deviations and one‐way analyses of variance in KBDDS and years of experience.

In relation to the effect of school level on the knowledge about dyslexia, we found no statistically significant difference in the total mean scores between the groups (F(3,146) = [0.938],p= 0.424).
Also, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean subdomain scores (F(3,146) = [2.025],p= 0.113 in Gen;F(3,146) = [0.875],p= 0.456 in Sym;F(3,146) = [0.799],p= 0.496 in Trt) (see Table5).

Abbreviations: Gen, general information; Sym, symptom; Trt, treatment.
Regarding the fourth research question, we asked our SLTs if they received institutional guidance and the instructional strategies they employed to assist dyslexic students.
Out of the foreign language teachers who took part in our study, 91% reported that their school lacks a support unit for dyslexic students, while 9% stated that the counselling unit of the school provides support for them.
SLTs who received support from the counselling unit were teachers working in private schools.
The data suggest that public schools are currently inadequately equipped to meet the specific educational needs of students with dyslexia, highlighting an area in urgent need of attention and intervention.
Out of 150 participants, only 24 (15%) acknowledged having previously taught students diagnosed with dyslexia.
Those SLTs who responded positively to this question indicated they used various instructional strategies to accommodate the unique learning needs of these students.
The most commonly reported strategy involved altering the font, adjusting the font size, modifying the line spacing in reading materials and incorporating visuals into the text to enhance understanding—especially when introducing new vocabulary.
Seven SLTs mentioned using this strategy.
The second strategy, mentioned by five SLTs, included allocating additional time outside of scheduled class periods to address students' inquiries and clarify concepts they found unclear.
In addition, three teachers reported providing extra time during exams and writing tasks to help students demonstrate their comprehension and abilities without the added stress of time limitations.
These differentiated instructional practices underscore the SLTs' commitment to fostering an inclusive learning environment that accommodates the diverse needs of all students.
There was one teacher who stated that she monitors the dyslexic student during writing tasks and gives corrective feedback, while another stated that she uses different coloured pens to mark her dyslexic students' writing tasks.
One of the participants remarked that he took notes on the incorrectly pronounced sounds and prepared flashcards for practice.
Among the 24 teachers surveyed, only one expressed receiving training on dyslexia.
The response of this SLT revealed the concurrent implementation of a variety of strategies: ‘I send the audio recordings of the subject covered in the lesson to my dyslexic students and ask them to repeat the material.
I often assign songs, rhymes and videos related to the subject as homework.
Instead of assignments requiring writing responses, I assign multiple choice and matching questions’.
All these differentiated instructional practices mentioned underscore SLTs' commitment to fostering an inclusive learning environment that accommodates the diverse needs of all students.
The present study investigated the knowledge of Turkish teachers of English about dyslexia and whether it varied according to gender, years of experience and school level.
Overall, the findings revealed that Turkish SLTs had a moderate understanding of dyslexia.
This indicates that while teachers possess a basic understanding of the condition, there are areas for improvement.
For instance, they correctly identified the importance of individualised instruction for dyslexic students and understood that dyslexia is not solely a visual deficit.
These findings align with similar research conducted in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, USA, Greece and Poland.
For example, Bos et al. (2001) conducted a study in the United Kingdom that also found moderate levels of understanding of dyslexia among language teachers.
Similarly, studies by Nijakowska et al. (2018) in Poland and Pennington and Lefly (2001) in the USA reported comparable results, which were further confirmed by Washburn et al. (2014). This level of knowledge may be attributed to the fact that the source of knowledge for more than half of the L2 teachers was not formal educational channels but informal sources, such as social media and the internet.
This finding highlights substantial shortcomings in the distribution of knowledge related to dyslexia through reliable educational channels.
Also, it underscores the inadequacies in both undergraduate education curricula and in‐service training programmes, pointing to a need for improvement in these areas.
The study also uncovered several misconceptions among teachers.
One prevalent misconception was that dyslexia is primarily related to visual perception deficits, such as letter and word reversal.
This misunderstanding can lead to ineffective teaching strategies that fail to address the core difficulties students with dyslexia face, which are primarily related to phonological processing (Snowling2012).
Another common misconception was the belief that dyslexia is more common in males, potentially leading to biased identification and support practices, with female students being under‐identified or underserved (Yin et al.2020).
Regarding the misconceptions related to the symptoms of dyslexia, participating SLTs conceived reversing letters and words as symptoms of dyslexia.
The Turkish orthographic system may have contributed to this misunderstanding.
Because of the transparent orthography of Turkish, students with dyslexia are either misdiagnosed or go unnoticed (Sümer‐Dodur and Altındağ‐Kumaş2021), making the incidence rate appear lower than in other nations (Yavuz et al.2022).
The difficulties in diagnosis might have led teachers to develop false assumptions about students with dyslexia.
Similar misconceptions have been reported for languages with transparent orthography, such as Spanish (Soriano‐Ferrer et al.2016), Greek (Nijakowska et al.2018) and Finnish (Lyytinen et al.2019).
Another area of concern is teachers' misunderstanding of the role of intelligence tests in diagnosing dyslexia.
Many teachers were unaware that intelligence tests are not reliable for diagnosing dyslexia, which is more accurately identified through comprehensive assessments of reading and language skills (Soriano‐Ferrer et al.2016).
Moreover, some teachers believed that coloured overlays or lenses could help dyslexic students, reflecting the incorrect assumption that dyslexia is a visual deficit.
This misconception is widespread and detracts from the use of evidence‐based instructional strategies.
The belief that dyslexia is a lifelong, unchangeable condition was also prevalent, potentially discouraging teachers from using effective interventions.
However, research shows that with appropriate teaching strategies, students with dyslexia can significantly improve their reading and writing skills (Lyon et al.2003).
The persistence of these misconceptions points to a need for more targeted and effective professional development programmes.
The moderate level of knowledge observed in this study suggests that while teachers have a fundamental understanding of dyslexia, there is room for growth.
A more nuanced and comprehensive training that not only addresses these misconceptions but also builds on the accurate information teachers already hold is needed.
Effective professional development is not only about delivering new information but also about helping teachers connect their prior knowledge to new concepts and teaching strategies (Borko2004; Darling‐Hammond et al.2017).
Research suggests that professional development programmes are most effective when they build on teachers' existing knowledge and skills, rather than solely focusing on correcting misconceptions (Desimone2009; Guskey2002).
This approach helps to reinforce what teachers already know, fosters a positive learning environment and encourages deeper engagement with new content.
For example, professional development programmes can begin by reaffirming the accurate knowledge, which can help build confidence and create a more positive learning environment.
The second research question aimed to identify the factors influencing SLTs' knowledge and belief about dyslexia.
The results indicated that female SLTs had more accurate knowledge about dyslexia than their male counterparts.
Previous research examining the factors influencing teachers' knowledge about dyslexia also found that gender and experience levels played significant roles.
A study by Washburn et al. (2011) also found female teachers to have more accurate knowledge about dyslexia.
Regarding experience, one interesting finding of our study was that SLTs with less than 11 years of experience exhibited a higher level of knowledge about dyslexia compared to more experienced teachers.
Specifically, they knew more about the symptoms and treatment of dyslexia than more experienced SLTs.
In contrast to our findings, Mullikin et al. (2021) found that experienced teachers had greater knowledge of dyslexia than their less experienced counterparts.
This might be attributed to the curriculum renewal in initial teacher education programmes in Türkiye in 2013.
Special education courses, such as ‘Special Education and Inclusion’, ‘Learning Difficulties’ and ‘Inclusive Education’ were added to the revised teacher education curriculum.
This may have increased teachers' awareness of the challenges faced by students with various learning difficulties.
This finding underscores the importance of initial teacher education programmes in developing teachers' awareness of the requirements of students with special needs, such as dyslexia.
In addition, it highlights the need for in‐service training for experienced teachers in the Turkish context.
We also found that the knowledge of SLTs on dyslexia remained consistent regardless of the school level at which they teach.
Regarding the misconceptions held by SLTs, our research revealed that the most prevalent were mainly related to the nature, causes and outcomes of dyslexia.
Consistent with previous research, we found that SLTs perceived dyslexia to be mainly a visual deficit (Soriano‐Ferrer et al.2016; Washburn et al.2014,2017).
As Soriano‐Ferrer et al. noted, this could be due to the fact that dyslexia is occasionally referred to as ‘word blindness’ Another misconception among SLTs is that dyslexia is more common in males.
One possible explanation is that, globally, research on colour blindness has indicated that men are more likely to be affected by colour blindness than women (Jha et al.2018; Hashemi et al.2019).
Moreover, we found that Turkish SLTs did not know that dyslexia is a lifelong chronic condition.
This finding echoes previous studies conducted with pre‐service and in‐service Spanish teachers (Soriano‐Ferrer et al.2016), pre‐service primary teachers (Washburn et al.2014), primary school teachers (Tosun et al.2021) and mainstream teachers (Sümer‐Dodur and Altındağ‐Kumaş2021).
The findings of the third research question indicated that language teachers working in state schools do not receive any support.
This is primarily because public schools receive fewer resources from the state.
SLTs appear to receive assistance from counselling units in private schools when they require it, which has a beneficial impact on dyslexic students.
This finding indicated a significant inadequacy in public schools, necessitating urgent attention and intervention.
Furthermore, SLTs devoting their free time to assisting dyslexic students and preparing extra materials demonstrated the L2 teachers' commitment to fostering an inclusive learning environment for all students.
Studies conducted in different contexts have reported a similar finding.
For example, Leseyane et al. (2018) found that educators in South African public schools were impatient with dyslexic students and provided inadequate support.
The researchers concluded that this was because of the limited resources and support provided to teachers in the public schools.
Similarly, Elias (2014) reported that public schools in New Zealand provide inadequate support for dyslexic students.
Recognising and understanding the needs of learners with dyslexia is essential to providing the timely support and resources they require.
Given the importance of support for the success of such learners, SLTs are required to possess adequate knowledge about dyslexia.
The current study contributes to the growing body of research on SLTs' knowledge about developmental dyslexia.
The findings highlight the importance of recognising both the strengths and gaps in teachers' understanding of dyslexia.
While the moderate level of knowledge observed suggests a need for further training, it also indicates that teachers are not starting from scratch.
Many teachers demonstrate accurate knowledge of key aspects of dyslexia, and professional development programmes should build on these strengths by offering training that bridges the gap between what teachers know and what they need to understand more deeply.
Workshops that include real‐life case studies or simulations can be particularly helpful in providing teachers with practical, hands‐on experience in supporting dyslexic students in L2 classrooms.
In addition, ongoing support through mentorship or peer coaching could reinforce the application of new strategies in real classroom settings.
This study offers valuable insights into SLTs' understanding and beliefs about dyslexia, however, certain limitations warrant further investigation.
A significant limitation is the lack of data on student outcomes, which limits the ability to directly link teacher knowledge of dyslexia with actual improvements in student learning and performance in L2 classrooms.
While understanding teachers' knowledge and beliefs is crucial, it is equally important to explore whether this knowledge translates into effective teaching practices that benefit dyslexic students.
As previous research suggests (Darling‐Hammond 2016; Piasta et al.2009), teacher knowledge alone may not lead to improved outcomes unless paired with effective pedagogical strategies and classroom practices.
Future research should focus on observing classroom practices and measuring the impact of teacher knowledge on student outcomes, such as reading proficiency, language acquisition and overall academic success in L2 contexts.
This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of how teachers' knowledge affects dyslexic students' performance and help inform targeted interventions that can directly improve student outcomes.
Another limitation of the study is the reliance on self‐reported data regarding teachers' instructional practices.
While these reports offer valuable insights into teachers' perceptions and intentions, they may not accurately reflect their actual classroom behaviours.
Observational studies would be beneficial in verifying whether the practices reported by teachers are implemented effectively and how these practices influence student learning.
Including classroom observations in future research could provide a more comprehensive picture of the connection between teacher knowledge, pedagogical practices and student outcomes.
