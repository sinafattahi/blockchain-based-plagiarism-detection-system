The axillary vein approach has emerged as a promising alternative to subclavian venous access for pacemaker implantation, offering potential advantages including reduced infection risk and enhanced procedural success.
However, standardized protocols for fluoroscopy-guided axillary vein puncture remain undefined.
This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility of a simplified fluoroscopic technique for axillary vein puncture and (2) establish anatomical and clinical predictors of procedural success.
In this retrospective cohort study, 178 consecutive patients undergoing pacemaker implantation at Shanghai Tongji Hospital (January 2022–December 2023) were stratified by puncture technique: right anterior oblique (RAO) 30°, Caudal 35° (C-arm angled toward feet), and vein-guided fluoroscopy.
Demographics (age, sex), comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), spinal disorders), smoking status, and radiographic parameters (subclavian fat thickness, clavicle-first rib angle) were analyzed.
Axillary vein puncture was successful in 169/178 patients (94.9%) without venography.
First-attempt success rates were 75.8% (135/178) for RAO 30° and 79.1% (34/43) for Caudal 35°.
Key predictors of success included: Sex-specific anatomy, BMI threshold and Clavicular angx les.
There was a significant difference in smoking status, subclavian fat thickness 2 cm below the collarbone between males and females (P< 0.001).ROC analysis identified BMI ≥ 23.84 kg/m² as optimal for success (AUC = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.48–0.83).Frontal clavicle-first rib angle independently predicted RAO 30° success (P= 0.012, OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02–1.15), while RAO clavicle-first rib angle correlated with Caudal 35° success (P= 0.031, OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09).
In this study, the cumulative incidence of procedure-related complications was 1.69%.
Severe complications such as pneumothorax or lead dislodgement were not observed, highlighting the safety profile of the intervention.
Successful fluoroscopy-guided axillary vein puncture depends critically on patient-specific anatomical factors, including sex, BMI, clavicle-first rib spatial relationships, and smoking status.
Our standardized protocol achieved high success rates (94.9%) without ultrasound assistance, highlighting its utility in resource-limited settings.
Cardiac pacemakers, as vital medical devices for treating bradycardia and other cardiac rhythm disorders, have seen significant advancements in implantation techniques that greatly enhance the quality of life for patients [1].
With the evolution of technology, the annual implantation rates of cardiac pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT) have been on the rise, necessitating continuous optimization of implantation techniques to reduce complications and improve patient safety and satisfaction.
Traditionally, electrodes for implantable cardiac pacemakers are introduced via the subclavian venous approach, which may be associated with various complications, including electrode fracture, infection, venous occlusion, and “subclavian crush syndrome” [2].
ROLAND et al. also emphasized the clinical importance of impaired electrode function post-implantation [3].
To mitigate these complications, the medical community has been exploring safer venous access methods.
Hadjis et al. particularly highlighted the value of the cephalic vein anatomical approach in implanting CRT devices [4].
In recent years, the axillary vein approach has garnered considerable attention as an alternative method.
Compared to the subclavian venous approach, the axillary vein approach is believed to reduce the risk of infection and improve implant success rates [5].
Venous puncture techniques guided by ultrasound have provided a new perspective for the implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) [6].
Ahmed et al. explored predictive factors for successful implantation under ultrasound guidance [7].
However, this approach necessitates the use of an ultrasound machine and the expertise of a professional sonographer, which can lead to increased economic costs and the risk of infection.
As deep learning technology becomes increasingly integrated into medical image analysis, combining advanced imaging techniques with artificial intelligence algorithms can further enhance the success and safety of axillary vein puncture [8].The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical norms and procedures related to axillary vein puncture in RAO 30° position.
Patients eligible for permanent pacemaker implantation (including single-, dual-, and triple-chamber pacemakers, as well as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]) were enrolled in this study, in accordance with the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy.
Inclusion criteria required participants to be aged 18 years or older, non-pregnant, and with a life expectancy exceeding 1 year.
Exclusion criteria comprised individuals with a projected life expectancy of less than 12 months, including those with advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class IV) exhibiting refractory symptoms, metastatic cancer with documented progression despite therapy, or severe comorbidities such as end-stage renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) or advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] < 30% predicted).
Additional exclusions involved pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, those planning pregnancy during the study period, patients with active uncontrolled infections, and participants with psychiatric, behavioral, motor, or cognitive impairments that could compromise protocol adherence or follow-up.
Impaired coagulation status (international normalized ratio [INR] > 1.5 or platelet count < 50,000/µL) further warranted exclusion.Between 2022 and 2023, a total of 178 patients who underwent axillary vein puncture for permanent pacemaker implantation were included.
During the procedure, fluoroscopic positioning was prioritized based on anatomical considerations: RAO 30° position was selected as the primary puncture method due to its operational simplicity and reduced challenges in electrode manipulation.
In contrast, Caudal 35° position, though associated with closer proximity to the clavicular-rib intersection and subclavian vein (resulting in greater technical difficulty), served as a secondary approach.
If both methods failed, contrast medium guidance was utilized to facilitate successful axillary vein access.
All participants provided written informed consent after a comprehensive explanation of the study’s objectives, procedures, and risks.
The protocol adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the institutional ethics committee.
RAO 30° position was favored for its anatomical benefits, minimizing clavicular and rib interference to streamline electrode placement.
Caudal 35° position, while anatomically suboptimal, provided an alternative for challenging cases, with contrast-guided puncture reserved as a final safety measure.
This tiered approach aimed to optimize procedural success while mitigating risks of complications such as pneumothorax or vascular injury.
Record X-ray exposure time and number of puncture attempts for each technique.
Implement protocol modification criteria: Transition to alternative technique after five unsuccessful attempts.
Employ contrast-guided puncture if both techniques fail after five attempts each.
SR_RAO = (Successful RAO punctures)/(Total participants).
SR_Caudal = (Successful Caudal punctures)/(Total participants - Successful RAO cases).
All enrolled patients were followed for 6 months through scheduled clinical evaluations and imaging assessments to detect the occurrence of the aforementioned complications.
Utilize mathematical morphology image reconstruction algorithms based on grayscale images and employ U-NET for image segmentation of the frontal chest X-ray, RAO 30° X-ray of the left clavicular region, and Caudal 35° X-ray.
Extract imaging features and quantify image information, including the angle between left clavicle and first rib in the frontal chest X-ray, RAO 30° X-ray of the left clavicular region, and Caudal 35° X-ray.
A. Posteroanterior view: Left clavicle-first rib angle (Fig.1A).
B. RAO 30° view: Left clavicle-first rib angle (Fig.1B).
C. Caudal 35° view: Left clavicle-first rib angle (Fig.1C).
D. Subcutaneous fat layer thickness at 2 cm inferior to puncture site: Fat thickness was measured intraoperatively using a sterilised straightedge at the puncture site (mid-clavicular line).
Measurements were recorded perpendicular to the skin surface, from epidermis to fascial layer.
Two measurements are taken and averaged.
The study employed SPSS statistical software (Version 23.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) for data management and analysis.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to assess the normality of continuous variables.
If the continuous variables were normally distributed, they were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD) and compared using Student’s t-test.
If variables were not normally distributed, they were represented by the median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.
Categorical data were expressed as percentages and compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact probability method.
The Jonckheere-Terpstra test was used for the comparison and analysis of one-way ordinal data.
Values ofp< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
In univariate analysis, variables with significant differences (P< 0.05) were included in the multivariate linear regression analysis.
After adjusting for relevant confounding factors, a multivariate linear regression model was established to determine the predictive factors for successful puncture in different body positions.
The accuracy of the upper limit of normal values was tested by plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
A total of 178 participants were enrolled in this study.
Among them, 9 individuals (5.06%) required contrast-guided puncture, 135 (75.84%) were in RAO 30° group, and 34 (19.10%) were in Caudal 35° group (Fig.2).
The success rate for RAO 30° approach was 75.8% (135/178), while the success rate for Caudal 35° was 79.1% (34/43).
Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in the angle between left clavicle and first rib among the three groups when positioned in the RAO orientation (P< 0.05).
However, no significant differences were noted in various other parameters such as age, BMI, duration of X-ray exposure, thickness of the adipose tissue layer located 2 cm below clavicle, angles in the frontal position and Caudal 35°, gender, presence of pulmonary or spinal diseases, and smoking history (P> 0.05) (Table1).
The ROC curve analysis for axillary vein puncture success in RAO 30° and Caudal 35° positions yielded a score of 0.64 (0.48–0.83).
ROC analysis identified a BMI threshold predictive of successful axillary vein puncture was determined to be 23.84 kg/m², with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 56% (Fig.3).
Upon separate analysis of the two groups, a significant difference in the angle between left clavicle and first rib was noted in RAO position (P< 0.05).
However, no significant differences were observed in other factors such as age, BMI, X-ray exposure time, adipose tissue thickness 2 cm below clavicle, angles in the frontal and Caudal 35°, gender, pulmonary or spinal disease, or smoking history (P> 0.05) (Table1).
Regression analyses identified key factors for successful axillary vein puncture in both RAO 30° and Caudal 35° positions.
In RAO 30° position, independent predictors included the angle between left clavicle and first rib in frontal position (P= 0.012, OR = 1.08, 95%CI [1.02–1.15]) and the same angle in RAO position (P= 0.031, OR = 0.95, 95%CI [0.91–0.99]) (Table2).
For Caudal 35° position, frontal position angle (P= 0.012, OR = 0.93, 95%CI [0.87–0.98]) and RAO position angle (P= 0.031, OR = 1.05, 95%CI [1.01–1.09]) were also significant predictors of puncture success (Table3).
Among the 169 successful punctures, the normal distribution of angle between left clavicle and first rib in frontal position had a mean of 77.67° and a standard deviation of 11.26° (Fig.4A).
The RAO position showed similar metrics, with a mean angle of 89.35° and a standard deviation of 14.83° (Fig.4B).
The suitable reference range for these angles was determined to be approximately 75.97° to 79.37° for frontal position and 87.12° to 91.58° for RAO position.
The angle between left clavicle and first rib significantly impacts puncture success in both Caudal 35° and RAO 30° positions.
A smaller angle correlates with higher success rates in Caudal 35° punctures, while a larger angle is associated with higher success in RAO 30° punctures.
This variation could be due to the differing accessibility of anatomical structures based on their relative positions.
Certain angles may facilitate or hinder needle access to the target vessel.
Upon gender-based analysis of the 178 participants, significant differences were noted in smoking behavior and the thickness of adipose tissue layer 2 cm below clavicle (P< 0.001)(Table4).
A markedly higher proportion of males were found to smoke, indicating a potential gender disparity in smoking habits within the study population.
Additionally, the adipose tissue thickness varied significantly between genders, suggesting that gender influences fat distribution in this region.
In this cohort of 178 patients, the overall complication rate was 1.69% (3/178), with no statistically significant differences observed between males (n= 84) and females (n= 94) across all adverse events (P> 0.05).
Subclavian hematoma, venous thromboembolism, and subcutaneous emphysema each occurred in 1 patient (0.56% overall), all of whom were female (1/94, 1.06% for each complication).
However, the differences between genders were not statistically significant (P= 1 for all three complications) (Table5).
Notably, severe complications such as pneumothorax or device-related issues were entirely absent, underscoring the procedural safety profile.
The RAO 30° and Caudal 35° X-ray fluoroscopic methods are standard for axillary vein puncture in China, yet they pose radiation risks to both patients and operators.
Our study aimed to to analyse the clinical norms and procedures associated with axillary vein puncture in RAO 30° position.
Key findings include: (1) The BMI threshold for successful axillary vein puncture was 23.84 kg/m², with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 56%; (2) The angle between left clavicle and first rib is a consistent independent factor affecting puncture success in both fluoroscopic positions; (3)For a successful RAO 30° axillary vein puncture, the optimal angle between left clavicle and first rib is 75.97°-79.37°.
For a Caudal 35° puncture, this angle should be approximately 87.12°-91.58°.
Achieving venous access is pivotal for pacemaker electrode implantation, whether for initial device placement or electrode replacement.
Axillary vein emerges as a preferred site due to its lower risk of complications such as pneumothorax and arterial injury, and its suitability for multiple lead implantations, reducing the risk of “subclavian crush syndrome” [5,9].While cephalic vein offers fewer complications, its smaller diameter, greater anatomical variability, and requirement for venotomy make it less favorable for multiple electrode implants [4].
The subclavian vein, despite its larger diameter and straightforward accessibility, carries a higher risk of puncturing thoracic cavity, leading to serious complications like pneumothorax and mediastinal hematoma, especially in patients with specific anatomical challenges [3].
Moreover, repeated punctures or multiple lead implants through this route can result in lead fractures due to bone compression, posing significant risks for pacemaker-dependent or ICD patients [2].
In contrast, the axillary vein, as an extension of subclavian vein, lies outside the thoracic cage, which minimizes the risk of pleural injury and related complications.
Its high success rate and reduced likelihood of causing “subclavian crush syndrome” make it an ideal alternative to the subclavian vein for venous access during pacemaker procedures.
The axillary vein’s lack of distinct surface landmarks poses a challenge for puncture, which cannot be easily performed blindly as with subclavian vein.
Currently, no single technique for axillary vein puncture is universally accepted [10,11].
Clinical methods include blind puncture using surface anatomical landmarks, X-ray fluoroscopy, contrast guidance, ultrasound guidance, and guide wire guidance [12–14].The blind puncture method, while aligned with clinical practice, is complex and requires precise localization of landmarks such as coracoid process or sternal angle [15].
This approach often involves multiple attempts, has a low success rate, and carries a higher risk of complications like pneumothorax and arterial misplacement.
Researchers globally are refining blind puncture technique for axillary vein access, yet a consensus remains elusive [16–18].
When this method falters, fallbacks like X-ray fluoroscopy and venography are often necessary.
However, these procedures can compromise sterility during pacemaker surgery, risking site contamination.
Additionally, in obese patients, the subcutaneous fat can obscure landmarks, leading to inaccurate punctures.
The contrast guidance method offers a clear visualization of axillary vein, boasting high success rates and low complication rates.
Despite its benefits, the use of contrast guidance still subjects patients and electrophysiologists to X-ray radiation and carries risks like contrast agent allergies and nephropathy.
Consequently, it is primarily used as a backup when initial puncture attempts are unsuccessful [6,13].Ultrasound guidance is gaining traction as it provides real-time vascular imaging without radiation, resulting in high success rates and fewer complications [7,19].
This method is particularly advantageous in avoiding hazards associated with radiation and contrast agents, aligning with the growing preference for minimally invasive procedures.
Ultrasound-guided methods, although effective, require specialised equipment and expertise, which may increase costs and risk of infection during the procedure.
In addition, it may lead to prolonged surgery.Its limited adoption in China reflects these concerns.
Similarly, the guide wire localization puncture method, which demands X-ray fluoroscopy and adds to patient discomfort and expenses, is also infrequently utilized [14].
The X-ray fluoroscopy bone landmark method outperforms blind puncture in axillary vein access, with a higher success rate and reduced risk of complications like pneumothorax and hemothorax.
Despite the increased use of X-rays, this method is widely adopted internationally.
Various fluoroscopic positioning techniques exist, with RAO 30°and Caudal 35°views being particularly effective [14,20].
The RAO 30°view clearly delineates the “deltopectoral groove” facilitating safe puncture with a reported 97% success rate, especially prevalent in regions like Jiangsu and Zhejiang, China [21].
Caudal 35°view enhances visualization of subclavian gap and lung contour, with a success rate of up to 96% and a lower risk of pneumothorax [22].
This approach is endorsed by the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [23] for its safety and efficacy.
Studies, including one by Francesco De Sensi et al. [24], have identified factors such as high BMI, male gender, and antiplatelet drug use as correlates of failed axillary vein puncture under ultrasound guidance.
Notably, BMI was significantly associated with puncture failure, with an optimal threshold of 28 kg/m² indicated by ROC analysis, yielding an AUC of 0.75.
This prospective study evaluated axillary venous puncture success rates under dual fluoroscopic guidance using RAO 30°combined with Caudal 35°projections.ROC analysis demonstrated moderate predictive capacity of BMI for procedural success (AUC = 0.64, 95%CI 0.48–0.83), with an optimal threshold of 23.84 kg/m².
These findings underscore that puncture success constitutes a multifactorial outcome contingent upon anatomical variations, operator expertise, and imaging system performance, necessitating comprehensive clinical evaluation for procedural optimization.
Claviculocostal angulation emerged as a critical determinant of puncture efficacy through multivariable regression analysis.
For Caudal 35°projections, increased angulation in RAO 30°view significantly enhanced success probability (β = 0.05,P= 0.031; OR = 1.05 per degree, 95%CI: 1.01–1.09).
Conversely, RAO 30° projections demonstrated dependence on frontal plane angulation (β = 0.08,P= 0.012; OR = 1.08 per degree, 95%CI:1.02–1.15).
Optimal operational angles were quantified as 75.97°-79.37° for RAO 30°and 87.12°-91.58° for Caudal 35°projections, establishing quantitative benchmarks for fluoroscopic guidance.
Gender differences, particularly in fat layer thickness below clavicle, also impact puncture success, potentially due to hormonal, genetic, and body fat distribution variations.
While certain complications (VTE, subclavian hematoma) showed a numerical trend toward higher incidence in females, none reached statistical significance, likely due to limited sample size.
The absence of pneumothorax and lead dislodgement in both cohorts suggests procedural safety across genders.
This study provides valuable insights into the selection of axillary vein puncture methods and the reduction of X-ray exposure for patients and operators, suggesting a standardised procedure for axillary vein puncture.
The limitations of no ultrasound comparison, single-center design, and short follow-up period may impact the reliability and generalizability of study results.
These factors can lead to biased findings, incomplete assessment of long-term outcomes, and potentially inadequate treatment decisions.
Future studies should aim to address these limitations by incorporating ultrasound guidance, conducting multicenter trials, and extending the follow-up period to provide more comprehensive and accurate data.
